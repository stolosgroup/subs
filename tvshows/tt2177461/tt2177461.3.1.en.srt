1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,160
To be a husband
and a father again...

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,640
that's all I've ever wanted.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,080
There must be no question
that Diana is a de Clermont.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
And with this mark, you're
forever a member of our family.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,360
Madam de Clermont, such a
recent blood vow is deafening.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,440
A vampire
is murdering warmbloods.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,840
Whoever is doing this
is infected with blood rage.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,480
Our priority has to be the
missing pages from the Book of Life.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,240
It's possible that Diana
Bishop's aunts already have it.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,240
I have reason to believe
they're being sheltered.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,800
A witch
born to daemons.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,560
If you ever go near
my grandchild again,

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,200
I'll kill you
with my bare hands.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Sleep now.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,560
Diana will unite
all creatures.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,680
and she will avenge me!

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,074

18
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,160
Oh, she's gone.

19
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,080
I don't know what to do.

20
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,480
I can't believe
Em's gone.

21
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,120
I can't imagine the baby
not knowing her.

22
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,840
Two heartbeats.

23
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,600
Two babies?

24
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,920
Yes.

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,520
These children
are our future.

26
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,560
The Congregation will
never harm our family again.

27
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,080
I promise.

28
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,760
Welcome home,
old friend.

29
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
It's been far too long.

30
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Gallowglass,
welcome.

31
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,800
It looks like
we have another guest.

32
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,480
It's so good
to see you.

33
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,080
Hey, it's only been a
few days for you, Diana.

34
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,400
Some of us have been
waiting centuries.

35
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,760
This is
the darkest of days.

36
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,960
When Peter Knox
murdered Emily Mather,

37
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,760
he killed a woman that
was like a mother to my wife.

38
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,200
He killed a woman that
was truly beloved by Sarah.

39
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,760
He killed a woman
who was under the protection

40
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,760
of the de Clermont family.

41
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,440
And, therefore,

42
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,040
Peter Knox has brought
about, his own end.

43
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,760
Knox has powerful allies. Let's consider
the consequences before we take action.

44
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,520
None as powerful
as the de Clermonts.

45
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Killing him will be too easy.
It'll make him a martyr.

46
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,720
People need to know what
he did and not just to Em.

47
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,160
That's why Mum's
on her way to Venice.

48
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,040
She's told Baldwin to hold an
immediate meeting of the Congregation,

49
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
so she'll have a chance to tell the
truth about what really happened here

50
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,040
before Knox and Gerbert
can twist it.

51
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,880
And they will. They'll
portray us as the aggressors.

52
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm afraid they'll use what's been
happening in Oxford for the same ends.

53
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,040
What has been
happening in Oxford?

54
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
There's been
a series of killings.

55
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,520
They've rather captured
the imagination of the press.

56
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,960
They're calling them
"The Vampire Murders".

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,960
And for once,
the newspapers are right.

58
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,040
The victims were killed
by a vampire with blood rage.

59
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,880
A lot has been happening while
you were in the 16th century, Matthew.

60
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Gerbert will use this
against you.

61
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,520
I thought I should
introduce myself.

62
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,040
There hasn't really been
the right moment until now.

63
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm Phoebe Taylor.

64
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,720
Marcus and I... I know what you are
to each other, Miss Taylor.

65
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,800
Right, well, I only wish we were
meeting under better circumstances.

66
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,000
Indeed.

67
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,040
Now there is a
great deal to be done

68
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,440
and Marcus has many
important responsibilities, so...

69
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,840
I am well aware
of my responsibilities.

70
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
Really?

71
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,800
As Grand Master of the Knights
of Lazarus, your primary task

72
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,080
is to, at all costs, uphold
the sanctity of Sept-Tours.

73
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,880
And you think I failed?

74
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,080
Knox shouldn't have been allowed
to get within ten miles of this place.

75
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,520
You make it sound like he went
unchallenged! Marcus could have been killed.

76
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Emily was killed!

77
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,520
Matthew, enough!

78
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,800
You know, I always used to take
your disappointment personally.

79
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,920
But I'm finally beginning to understand
that nobody's beyond reproach.

80
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,800
Not even you.

81
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Blood rage?

82
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
It seems the rumors of its
defeat are somewhat exaggerated.

83
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,120
After all,

84
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,360
there are two blood-raged
vampires just in this room.

85
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,440
You're not
a blood-raged vampire.

86
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,680
You're not.

87
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,560
You... carry the disease.

88
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,600
So you thought it was okay
to lie to me for centuries?

89
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
There was no need
for you to know.

90
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
That wasn't
your decision to make.

91
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,480
Hey.

92
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,880
Why was Em
at the temple?

93
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,520
She'd been having dreams.

94
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
Nightmares about the page.

95
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,040
Em thought they were
some sort of premonition.

96
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,400
She needed someone
to help her with them.

97
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,480
She needed...

98
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,400
Rebecca.

99
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,000
Mum?

100
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,160
No.

101
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,520
No, Em was against
higher magic.

102
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,840
She told me that any witch who was fool
enough to think they could handle it...

103
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,800
...deserved to find out
they couldn't. The hard way.

104
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,960
You do realize she was
speaking from experience?

105
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,160
Yeah. She didn't
want you to know.

106
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
What was
she thinking?

107
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,600
I don't know.
I wish I could ask her.

108
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,440
We could.

109
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
We could ask her.

110
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,800
Sarah...

111
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,760
You know
we can't do that.

112
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,680
I can't use my power to
change things in the past.

113
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Not deliberately.

114
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,240
Why not?

115
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,720
Do you think it was Em's destiny
to be murdered by Knox? Her fate?

116
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,600
You think this was
all meant to happen?

117
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,320
No, of course not.

118
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,040
None of this is how
it was supposed to be.

119
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,560
She's meant to be here
with you.

120
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,360
So, I can tell you
both together.

121
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,120
I know these babies
won't fix our problems...

122
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,360
Babies?

123
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,000
Twins.

124
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,560
Twice blessed.

125
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,960
What are they?
Witch? Vampire?

126
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
I don't know.

127
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,760
Or something else?

128
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,440
I'll love them
no matter what.

129
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,160
But how will you
keep them safe?

130
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,360
This meeting is at the request
of Agatha Wilson of the daemons.

131
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,880
We relinquish the floor to her.

132
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,600
I'm sure whatever
she wants to discuss is fascinating.

133
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
I have the floor,
Gerbert.

134
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,880
However, there is an issue that
needs our immediate attention.

135
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,720
The murders in Oxford.

136
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,320
It's a human matter.
Not for discussion here.

137
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,160
Even when the murders
are the work of a blood-raged vampire?

138
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,160
There hasn't been a case of
blood rage since the 12th century.

139
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,400
I've been tracking the
killer's movements for the last few months.

140
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,720
He's killed six people
in that time.

141
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,280
Humans are quite capable
of violence.

142
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,920
Not like this,
Baldwin. The victims were torn apart.

143
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
No human I've ever known
has the strength

144
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,440
to inflict wounds of that
nature. Only vampires.

145
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,520
Do we know who this vampire
is supposed to be?

146
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,200
I tracked and confronted him
after his last kill.

147
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,040
Who is he?

148
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,880
I was fighting for my life.
I didn't see his face.

149
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,280
I didn't recognize his scent.
He's not a vampire I'd met before.

150
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,560
And he's still at large.

151
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,960
This puts all creatures at risk.

152
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,360
We only live safely amongst humans
by not drawing attention to ourselves.

153
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,400
The vampires
must deal with this.

154
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,480
And we will. I will.

155
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,240
Wasn't it your family who assured us
that blood rage had been consigned to history?

156
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,880
I can remember Philippe sitting in that
very chair declaring the scourge defeated!

157
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,800
I can only imagine his disappointment
at the current state of affairs.

158
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,080
Vampires, witches, daemons
mixing, marrying and even mating.

159
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,520
I understand there are
people here today

160
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,640
who are complicit in it.

161
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,400
Yes.

162
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,520
Agatha Wilson's family are breaking
the Covenant even as we speak.

163
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,600
They are at Sept-Tours along
with other daemons, witches,

164
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,720
vampires, and even humans.

165
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Is this true?

166
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,880
Perhaps, Baldwin,
you should see for yourself.

167
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,080
I'm sure you're looking forward
to reuniting with your brother...

168
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,000
and his wife.

169
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,920
Matthew and Diana
are at Sept-Tours?

170
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
Yes.

171
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,120
And they arrived home
to find that Diana's aunt,

172
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,760
the witch Emily Mather,

173
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,760
had been murdered
by Peter Knox!

174
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,120
That is not true.

175
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,360
Emily was practicing higher magic
and, sadly, it overwhelmed her.

176
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,800
And how did Marcus Whitmore
come by his injuries?

177
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,920
I was forced to defend
myself. He attacked me.

178
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,880
What were you doing there? How dare you
question my work?

179
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,440
We daemons know only
too well how you all see us.

180
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,000
How you question our
position on this council.

181
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,320
Let's see what we can do with the
little power that you so kindly afford us.

182
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,920
I move that Peter Knox

183
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,960
be removed from the
Congregation for his crimes!

184
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,800
You can demand
whatever you please,

185
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,240
but without a witch or a
vampire to second your motion...

186
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,920
It is an act of war for a witch to
enter Sept-Tours without invitation.

187
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,120
I second the motion.

188
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,560
You still
need a majority.

189
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm well aware
of that Knox.

190
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,280
I have served this council
unstintingly for years.

191
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,480
I have ensured the safety of not only
my fellow witches, but all creatures...

192
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,720
All those opposed to Peter
Knox's expulsion from this council?

193
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,360
And those in favor?

194
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,680
What do you think
you are doing?

195
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,400
Peter, you killed
a witch.

196
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,680
Justice must be served.

197
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,440
And with my vote,
the motion's passed.

198
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,040
No! BALDWIN:
Peter Knox,

199
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,520
you are no longer a
member of the Congregation.

200
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,880
You will no longer hold
a key to the chamber.

201
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,720
You will have no power,
no privilege,

202
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,920
and you must remove
yourself and your possessions

203
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,720
from this island
and never return here.

204
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,520
You think that this keeps
your family safe?

205
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Or those at Sept-Tours?

206
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,880
You are wrong.

207
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm proud of you.

208
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,920
Listen.

209
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,080
You, Sophie, and Margaret
should leave tonight.

210
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,880
You need to get
on a plane and go.

211
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,000
Knox is dangerous and
he's got nothing to lose now.

212
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,600
I don't want you to
call me or get in touch.

213
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,880
Not until all this
is over.

214
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,696
If I know where you are,
then Peter Knox

215
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,040
can use me to get to you
and our family.

216
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,440
I love you, Mum.

217
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,560
I love you, too.

218
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
I don't think I can.

219
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,600
Okay.

220
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,120
Emily,

221
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,800
we offer your spirit light
in every direction.

222
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,600
We offer you protection
along the way.

223
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,560
We release you
from your earthly ties.

224
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,400
And with the path lit
and free from danger...

225
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,520
...we...

226
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,800
We send you
on your next journey.

227
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,320
It didn't feel quite right to attend a
witch's ceremony, considering my history.

228
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,320
They'll be cold
when they get back.

229
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,840
Let's relight the fires and
say our own prayers for Emily.

230
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,040
What I said
about the babies...

231
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,360
I was lashing out.

232
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,840
Your children are
gonna be very special.

233
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,640
She would never let it
fall into Knox's hands.

234
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,920
I will make Knox pay
for all of it.

235
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,080
For everything
he took from us.

236
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,920
From our family.

237
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,080
Where the hell have
you been for the last few months?

238
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
London, mainly. Don't lie to me.

239
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I've had people looking
for you and the witch.

240
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,920
I'm not lying, Baldwin.
We were in London.

241
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,680
Just... a few
centuries away.

242
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,560
Is there no end
to the witch's talents?

243
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,920
Not so far, and that witch
is now my wife.

244
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,520
I can only imagine
what Philippe would say. Philippe?

245
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,040
He was there
at the wedding.

246
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,240
I don't believe you.

247
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,320
Well, his blood vow was
his wedding present to Diana.

248
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,920
Now no one can question
her position...

249
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,920
in the family.

250
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,640
The same cannot be said for
everyone you've assembled here.

251
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,616
If you think you're offering
them a place of safety,

252
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,200
you are sadly mistaken.

253
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,720
Peter Knox made sure
of that.

254
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,480
And what he did
demands justice, Baldwin.

255
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
I agree and I've already
dealt with him.

256
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,920
He's dead? No. He's been expelled
from the Congregation.

257
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,400
He's lost his job? He
killed someone here at Sept-Tours!

258
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,000
He killed a witch. A member of
my wife's family!

259
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,480
You can't have it
both ways!

260
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,480
If she is your mate and
Philippe's blood-sworn daughter,

261
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
then she answers
to this family and me!

262
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,920
And I am ordering you and every other
de Clermont to leave Peter Knox alone.

263
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,320
There are more pressing
matters that need to be dealt with.

264
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,200
The blood rage murders.
Fingers are already being pointed.

265
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,440
I want the infected
vampire found, killed,

266
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,520
and the outbreak contained.

267
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,520
And you're expecting me
to do it?

268
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,760
At a time of crisis, we should
all play to our strengths.

269
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,960
We can discuss how to undo
the rest of the damage over dinner.

270
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,520
Family only.

271
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,080
But do bring
the witch.

272
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,760
I'll be the judge of whether
she is a de Clermont.

273
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,640
I can't help but feel that we've got
the better end of the deal tonight.

274
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,360
I know where
I'd rather be.

275
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,640
I would like to think that
there will never be a time

276
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,360
that we cannot sit down
together as a family.

277
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,480
Even if it means our guests aren't
welcome to join us at the table?

278
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,280
I'll not apologize
for observing the Covenant.

279
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,560
It has been keeping us safe
for centuries.

280
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,160
Do you still believe that?

281
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,880
Of course I do.

282
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,336
Do you believe that
this is what your father imagined

283
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,520
when he established
the Congregation?

284
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,760
I believe that my
father always had the best intentions.

285
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,400
No one questions that,
but the world has changed.

286
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,680
Indeed. There is
a witch at the table,

287
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,680
who bears my father's
blood vow.

288
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
There was a time
when that was unthinkable.

289
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,520
Philippe's mark
is an honor,

290
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,920
but it is also
a privilege.

291
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,640
My concern is for the creatures
who are not afforded that.

292
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,040
For them, the Covenant
has outlived its usefulness.

293
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,840
Speaking
against the Covenant

294
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,920
in the house that Philippe de
Clermont built is inexcusable.

295
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,920
We should have been dining in
honor of a lost friend this evening.

296
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,520
We are.

297
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,480
To Emily.

298
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,320
To Emily.

299
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,120
Perhaps we should look
to brighter things.

300
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,040
To my brother's mate

301
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,400
and their unborn children.

302
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,000
Whatever they are.

303
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,120
I seem to remember
that this isn't the first time

304
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,680
a vampire had a child
with a witch.

305
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,160
Matthew may recall
better than I.

306
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,920
What happened
to the child?

307
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,080
It's not relevant.

308
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,640
The witches banished it
along with the mother.

309
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,520
I believe they died
in the desert.

310
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,080
Why would
they do that?

311
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,040
Superstition
and ignorance.

312
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,680
Wasn't that around the time
that you sired Benjamin?

313
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,800
Enough, Baldwin.

314
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,080
I hadn't thought
about him in a long time, but then,

315
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,560
with all the talk of blood rage
at The Congregation

316
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,840
and Gerbert reminding us of
the de Clermonts' involvement,

317
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,600
it did set me thinking about
our family's past exploits.

318
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,080
Well, thank you very much
for supper, Baldwin.

319
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,640
Excuse me, maman. I'm sure I'm
not the only one who has had their fill.

320
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,080
One more thing.

321
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,280
Anyone who is not a de Clermont
should leave this house by morning.

322
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,440
The Congregation is watching and as de
Clermonts, we will uphold Philippe's covenant.

323
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,320
Look, it's clear.
We can't stay here.

324
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,880
We'll leave for London
first thing. All of us.

325
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,440
Who is Benjamin?
Another de Clermont?

326
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,200
Not exactly.

327
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,360
At the end
of the first crusade,

328
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
I was in Jerusalem.

329
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,280
Philippe dreamt of establishing
a homeland for creatures,

330
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,480
but in order to do so, it was
necessary for us to reveal ourselves

331
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,240
to some humans that
we thought we could trust.

332
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,480
And, Benjamin
was one of them.

333
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,360
So when Benjamin threatened
to expose us all,

334
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
it crushed
Philippe's dream.

335
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,360
Well...

336
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,880
I lost control.

337
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,000
Matthew,
I think I met him.

338
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,520
No, no, that's not possible.

339
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,680
In Bohemia.

340
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,720
He said he could hear
Philippe's blood vow.

341
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,440
But he called himself Fuchs.
Not de Clermont.

342
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,680
He certainly didn't say
he was your son.

343
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,400
He's not my son.

344
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,720
Not in any true sense.

345
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,520
By God, I wanted
to punish him.

346
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,800
Death would be
too quick.

347
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,920
I made him a vampire,

348
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,360
so that he couldn't reveal our true
nature without revealing his own.

349
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,600
And then...

350
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,520
I abandoned him.

351
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,120
A new blood-raged vampire.

352
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,360
I thought it would kill him
eventually or get him killed.

353
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:55,680
It was the most
terrible miscalculation...

354
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,600
So, this place is as welcoming
as I always remember.

355
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,280
Especially with Baldwin
in residence.

356
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,920
Yeah. Just like his father. A
right bastard when he wants to be.

357
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,760
I know.

358
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,040
We're not meant to say a word
against the great man on this...

359
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,880
hallowed ground.

360
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,720
Philippe wasn't always the
easiest man to get along with.

361
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,880
Why do you think
my father and Fernando

362
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,360
struck out on their own
and formed a scion?

363
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,720
Maybe history needs
to repeat itself?

364
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,600
Any male with full-blooded
children can establish a scion,

365
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,640
which will be a branch of the
original family, but with autonomy.

366
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,760
And think of who
we can take with us.

367
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,360
Everyone you've sired,
Matthew. Everyone they've sired.

368
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,120
Our children.

369
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,760
Baldwin will never see the
problems that the Covenant cause us

370
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,480
or stand up
to the Congregation.

371
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,800
But if we establish a scion,
we can chart our own path.

372
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,160
Marcus, you are asking me
to disregard the history

373
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,320
and the family who
made me who I am.

374
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,200
You ask too much.

375
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,880
My answer is no.

376
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,320
We have enough problems
without splitting our family.

377
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,040
They're all leaving.
Matthew and Marcus as well.

378
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,440
It would appear so.

379
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm surprised you're
not going with them.

380
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,560
Another hollow victory.

381
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,920
If Matthew crosses the line,
I won't protect him.

382
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,480
Goodbye, Baldwin.

383
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,360
This will not end well.

384
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,680
Bem-vindo,
Matthew. Welcome home.

385
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,000
Fernando.

386
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I knew I could
rely on you.

387
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,680
You were there for me
when we lost Hugh.

388
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
Thank you.

389
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
Who's that?

390
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,760
He was mated
to Matthew's brother Hugh.

391
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,920
So you think the page
itself can give us some answers?

392
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,176
Miriam, the pages
are made from the skin of creatures.

393
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,680
I want to see if it's even
possible to extract the DNA.

394
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,520
It might tell us more about
the evolution of creatures.

395
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,160
Our possible extinction.

396
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,920
Maybe even the underlying
cause of blood rage.

397
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,920
If we can trace it back
to its origins then...

398
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,760
perhaps we can begin to
understand what activates it.

399
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,080
Why does it lie dormant in
some vampires and not others?

400
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,160
The Book of Life, species decline,
blood rage. Somehow this is all connected.

401
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,480
We need a lab.
Somewhere discreet.

402
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,840
I think I know someone
who could help with that.

403
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,120
Okay. He said
he'd meet us here.

404
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,320
Chris.

405
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,160
Oh!

406
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,480
Hello, stranger.

407
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,080
Where the hell
have you been?

408
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,800
It's a long story.

409
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,240
It better be a good one. You don't
call. You don't write. You don't email?

410
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,560
I know. Uh, things got
a little complicated.

411
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,160
Dr. Christopher Roberts.Dr.
Matthew Clairmont.

412
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Really? Your paper on cell
cycle regulation was interesting.

413
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,400
You finally got yourself out the library
and got yourself a boyfriend, huh?

414
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,600
Uh... Husband.

415
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,960
Married to a Brit?

416
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,640
French.

417
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,840
Any more surprises?

418
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,800
Uh, well, we're expecting
twins.

419
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,000
It really has been
a long time.

420
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,120
So where's this lab?

421
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,840
And you are?

422
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,200
Dr. Shepherd.

423
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,680
Perhaps we can do the
formal introductions on the way.

424
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,080
Shall we?

425
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,480
So, this is my place.

426
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,760
What do you think?

427
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,040
Is the equipment
well-maintained? It's state-of-the-art.

428
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,480
Hmm.

429
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,280
Miriam runs my research.

430
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,920
And what
is that exactly?

431
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,000
I mean, Diana was pretty vague
about your current interests.

432
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,560
I could do with a little more detail
before I, uh, take this project on.

433
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,320
What am I
looking at here?

434
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,520
Why don't you
tell me?

435
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,120
There's some damage
to the blood cells.

436
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,560
Viral?

437
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,000
No, genetic.

438
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,000
But it's not anything
I've seen before, is it?

439
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,080
No.

440
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,440
I thought
you might need a coffee.

441
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,000
No one talks about Em.

442
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,040
It's blood rage
and scions.

443
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,760
You vampires always
look after your own.

444
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,480
Do you know who
Hugh de Clermont was?

445
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
He was Philippe's
eldest son.

446
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,080
Hugh and I were mated.

447
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,080
For six centuries.

448
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,560
But Philippe refused
to recognize our union.

449
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,920
And when Hugh died,

450
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,000
neither my loss, nor my grief
were acknowledged.

451
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,640
When did he die?

452
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Seven hundred years ago.

453
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,120
I'm sorry
for your loss.

454
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,000
Grief never...
really goes away.

455
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,800
It gets
quieter, slower...

456
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,320
and sometimes it comes
rushing back like the sea.

457
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,520
The de Clermonts
accepted you and Emily.

458
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,800
More than that they...
embraced you.

459
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,920
And they recognize your loss.

460
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
They should recognize yours.

461
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,040
I live in hope.

462
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,480
You're asking me to believe
in witches and blood-raged vampires?

463
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,760
I mean,
you realize how this sounds?

464
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,200
I mean, sure,
as a scientist,

465
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,360
I'm trained to suspend disbelief
until something is disproven,

466
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,520
but without any evidence, you're
asking a hell of a lot from me.

467
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,640
I know.

468
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,600
Are you working on a
molecular level when you do that?

469
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
Okay, uh...

470
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,240
What do you need?

471
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,440
What these groups
have in common

472
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,640
is that they're all, in some
way, suffering decline.

473
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,080
Vampires can no longer sire.
Witches' powers are waning...

474
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,880
And daemons seem to be
slipping into actual mental illness.

475
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,680
And there
is a killer on the loose.

476
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,320
We need a cure
for blood rage.

477
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,600
Do you think you might
be able to help with that?

478
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
I can give it
my best shot.

479
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,120
What do you have to say that couldn't
be said in front of the Congregation?

480
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,280
This blood-raged vampire.

481
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,720
All the murders in Oxford were very
close to where Matthew and Diana had been.

482
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,440
Photos from the crime
scenes. All the victims.

483
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,800
Why would he be following
Matthew and Diana?

484
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,440
This is just another attempt
to smear the de Clermonts.

485
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,280
The killer stole
their portraits.

486
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,640
Miniatures painted in the 16th
century. Nothing else was taken.

487
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,440
You denounce me,
now you're helping me. Why?

488
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,680
No, I denounced the
blood-raged killer. Not you.

489
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Gerbert used it
to attack me.

490
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,040
Gerbert, not me.

491
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
I don't have to be
your enemy.

492
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,360
When did they get back?

493
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,560
I'm leaving now.

494
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,040
Auf Wiedersehen. Auf Wiedersehen,
mein Herr.

495
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,880
This is my DNA.

496
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,280
I'm a vampire.

497
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,480
Philippe
charged me to look after Diana.

498
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,320
I've spent her whole life
keeping her safe.

499
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,160
And Diana is
with Matthew now.

500
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,600
He is not here. I'm sure he'll turn up.

501
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,840
And when he does, you'll
let me know, won't you?

502
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,400
You can't control me
anymore. Your time is over.

503
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,600
Even the de Clermonts' secrets
come out eventually.

504
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,920
It's about time Matthew de
Clermont learns who he's dealing with.

505
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,440
Diana Bishop.

506
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Father Hubbard,
why are you here?

507
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,480
You left something
in my keeping.

507
00:46:12,305 --> 00:47:12,420
