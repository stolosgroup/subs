2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,160
- Jess, it's this way.
- Oh, sorry.

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,320
What time
are you thinking for lunch?

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,700
- Uh, one, maybe?
- Okay.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,200
Hey.

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,530
Yeah?

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,410
Yeah, I know,
it looks just great. Love it.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,410
Hey.
Here you go. Thanks.

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,660
Hi. Thanks.

10
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,160
You're welcome.

11
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,740
Quiet, please, everyone. Hey.

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,990
- Standby to roll, guys.
- Okay.

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,030
Okay. That's it.

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,660
Let's get slate in.

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,610
Here you go.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,610
And action!

17
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,610
Hey, I'm just gonna
check on her.

18
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,280
I've never
seen anything like it!

19
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,530
Heavens above, Gromit!

20
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,660
Hi. I'm...
I'm Mira. It's nice to meet you.

21
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,450
Nice to meet you too.
I'm Danielle.

22
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,660
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

23
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,610
Should we get started?

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,490
Yeah.

25
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,660
So, Mira.

26
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,240
I don't know if you remember me
from drop-off?

27
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,450
I babysit Iris and Sadie.

28
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,070
- Oh, um...
- Yeah.

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,410
- I'm not sure, I... right.
- Yeah. So, um...

30
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,070
Well, I believe
Jonathan told you

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,950
a bit about my study,
in general?

32
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,610
- Um...
- Well, it's for my PhD in Gender Studies and Psych

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,950
- at Tufts.
- Oh, okay.

34
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,530
I'm looking at how
evolving gender norms

35
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,700
- affect monogamous marriages.
- Okay.

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,660
Okay. Um...

37
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,860
So, to complete the formalities,
just confirming your pronouns?

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,160
He, him, his.

39
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,950
- She, um...
- She, her, hers.

40
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,740
Great.
Mine are she/her, too.

41
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,570
Um... okay.

42
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,950
So, yeah.

43
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,610
The first question
is pretty open,

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,450
it's for either one of you.

45
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,320
How would you define yourself?

46
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,610
- Define?
- I dunno...

47
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,450
Def... Like, describe?

48
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,950
- Well, define.
- Right.

49
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,910
I'm... I'm actually
interested in the...

50
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,360
- the elements...
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,030
...that constitute
your self-definition.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,610
The elements that constitute...

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,280
- Go first.
- ...your self-definition.

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,700
That's, um...

55
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,910
Well,
you could think of it like this.

56
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,780
What, um, attributes

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,610
couldn't you imagine
yourself without?

58
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,450
That's interesting.

59
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,160
Uh, okay. Let me think.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,610
Actually, if it's okay,

61
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,280
just say whatever comes to mind.

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,490
Okay. Uh, I'm a man.

63
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm Jewish.

64
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,320
That's weird, right?

65
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,910
- That's so weird.
- That's strange.

66
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,570
I went blank,
that's the first thing

67
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,610
- that came into my head.
- Great, yes.

68
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,780
- That's exactly the idea.
- Yes. Right. Okay.

69
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,030
- Um, I'm, uh, a father to Ava...
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,160
...who's four years old,
as you know.

71
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Um... I'm an academic.

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,030
Uh, I should've said that first,
actually.

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,780
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a big part of my

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,490
- self-definition.
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,410
- I teach in the philosophy department at Tufts.
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,160
Um...

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,030
What else?
I'm, uh, 41.

78
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,950
- I'm a Democrat.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm an asthmatic.

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,030
Whoa. You feel your asthma
defines you?

81
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,860
- Yeah.
- Really?

82
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,950
Yeah. Well, if you go through
your whole life

83
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,360
threatened with the possibility
of suffocating, then yeah,

84
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,990
you know, it becomes part
of your self-definition.

85
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,200
- Okay.
- What?

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
No. Nothing, babe.
It's... it's interesting.

87
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
- Really.
- Is it?

88
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,700
- Yes.
- Okay.

89
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,110
Cool.

90
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,950
And Mira,
how would you...

91
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,360
Right. I... Okay. Me.

92
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,160
I am a woman.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,030
- I'm married.
- Correct.

94
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,610
I am a mother.

95
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,530
- Mm-hmm.
- I am 40.

96
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,740
I... Not quite,
but that's definitely

97
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,700
my self-definition, 40.

98
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm, uh... in tech.

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,820
I'm, uh, VP of
product management at Horizon.

100
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,610
I know that doesn't mean much
to most people,

101
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,240
- but, you know...
- She's a big shot.

102
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,490
- Trust me.
- Yeah...

103
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,780
Um, okay, what else?

104
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm a mother, obviously.

105
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,530
You said that, don't worry.

106
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,530
Oh, good.

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,200
Is that enough?

108
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,990
Um...

109
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,320
unless there's anything else
you'd like to add?

110
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,950
- Oh, no. I'm good.
- Yeah.

111
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,070
I wonder, for instance,
if you'd like to add something

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,450
um, about how you divide

113
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,280
household and caregiving
responsibilities...

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,910
- Right. Yes. Um...
- ...in that context?

115
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,950
So, I forgot to mention
she's interested in couples

116
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,950
where the woman
is the primary provider.

117
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,110
- Yeah. Well, um...
- Oh.

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,360
- Right? Is that...
- Yeah, I wouldn't exactly...

119
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,780
- put it that way, but it's...
- Oh, yes. Sorry.

120
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,950
I'm not... I'm not... I'm not
trying to give away your thesis.

121
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,070
That's... that's fine.

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,910
Uh, anyway, yes.
So, for the most part,

123
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,660
I do take care of Ava
during the week.

124
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,200
- Um...
- Well, uh...

125
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,990
Well, being in academia,
as you know,

126
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,780
I have very flexible hours
and I can work from home.

127
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,780
Mira, she works long days and...

128
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,490
- has to travel for work.
- And I make it up to them on the weekends.

129
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,860
- Yeah, and you make it home for bedtime, when you can.
- Yeah.

130
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,450
Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,320
And has this always been your
arrangement, in terms of childcare?

132
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,950
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Well, yeah. I had...

133
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,280
Well, I had to take

134
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,490
- an extra-long maternity leave.
- Yes.

135
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,200
And, um, you know,
I'm still paying for it at work.

136
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Of course. Yeah.

137
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
And my company is going public
later this year,

138
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,740
- so that's why there's so much extra travel.
- Yeah, and it's also, like,

139
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,910
I'm not making a big, uh,
heroic sacrifice or anything.

140
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,820
No. - We
have our babysitter, Veronica,

141
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,240
and she does extra hours,
uh, on the, you know,

142
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,070
on the days
that I'm underwater at work.

143
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
- Sure.
- And look, it'd be great

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,360
if academia paid
as well as tech does,

145
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,990
- but it doesn't...
- It doesn't, no.

146
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,530
...so this arrangement
makes perfect sense.

147
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,200
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,070
It sounds like
we're apologizing for it. Maybe.

149
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,660
- No, not at all.
- Yeah. No, we're proud of it.

150
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,910
Babe. Don't.

151
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,530
Okay. So, at this point,
I'd like to...

152
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,320
hear a little bit
about your history.

153
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,200
I know that you've been married
for almost ten years.

154
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,160
Yes.

155
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,610
How long were you together
before that?

156
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,360
It's like two years and change,
maybe?

157
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,320
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Twelve years total.

158
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,450
- Mm-hmm.
- And how did you meet?

159
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,240
- You should be the one to tell the story.
- No.

160
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,990
It's way more entertaining.
Come on.

161
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,450
Is... Can you tell me
how this is part of the study?

162
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,530
Um, well, it's valuable

163
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,410
in the context
of the gender perceptions

164
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,990
you had at the beginning
of the relationship.

165
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,070
Okay. I just... I've...

166
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I was under the impression
that this is gonna be

167
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,320
more like multiple choice.

168
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,610
Sorry, no.

169
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,490
Okay.

170
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,530
I'll tell it. It's actually...
It's a good story.

171
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,910
- And, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,990
You can just interject
when I get melodramatic.

173
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,160
Sure.

174
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,240
So, we met at Columbia.

175
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
Um, we went there,
we were in a seminar together,

176
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,740
English lit.

177
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,320
So, um, we spent three hours
a week in a tiny little room,

178
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,280
uh, but at this point,
there was no way

179
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,070
- that we would have ever...
- No.

180
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,700
I should mention that I was
still Orthodox at the time.

181
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,530
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yes.

182
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,780
I, uh, I grew up
in a Modern Orthodox

183
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,160
- Jewish family.
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,450
So up until that point,
up until college, my education

185
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,780
had been mostly single-sex,
I'd never touched a woman.

186
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,110
So the whole thing
was pretty overwhelming,

187
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,950
um, me with my black yarmulke
and white button-down shirts,

188
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,610
and all these young women
in their little tank tops.

189
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,410
And Mira specifically
was like a campus celebrity.

190
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,610
She was dating a member
of a big rock band at the time,

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,280
that needless to say
I'd never heard of.

192
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,450
No, they were...
They weren't really rock,

193
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,660
and they weren't big.

194
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,820
You've probably heard of them,
Saraband? Lucas McRae?

195
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,280
- Oh, wow.
- Uh, yeah.

196
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,780
I just thought... I thought
of Mira as kind of a...

197
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,280
- A what?
- No, no, no.

198
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,450
- No. Tell me. I wanna...
- Yeah, it... it...

199
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,410
It's just that you were
as far away from my world

200
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,450
as it... as it got, you know.

201
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,490
And anyway, I was already
engaged to a girl

202
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,070
that I grew up with
near Long Island.

203
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,820
- Oh.
- Yeah.

204
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,320
- So how did it happen?
- Uh, well, she just...

205
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,700
just walked up to me one day
and, um...

206
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,740
This part you should tell.

207
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,820
Um, okay. So I was in a, um...

208
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,240
a theater group in school,

209
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,950
and we were doing this one play
by Bashevis Singer, and...

210
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,160
An adaptation of
Enemies, A Love Story.

211
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,490
- Hmm.
- Right.

212
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,070
And, um, so I was doing all
this research on Orthodox Jews.

213
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,490
I was very serious about acting
in college.

214
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,490
- Oh, yeah.
- And so I just went up to him

215
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,700
one day after class, and I asked
if I could talk to him,

216
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,740
- and he just... he seemed completely horrified...
- I was, yeah, paralyzed.

217
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,530
Yeah. But I was
very committed to this role.

218
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,570
Absolutely.

219
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,700
So committed
that she got completely naked

220
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,910
- halfway through the play.
- No! Not completely.

221
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,910
And I'd already started
the process

222
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,780
of, uh, leaving my religion.

223
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,950
But, uh, no, that... that...

224
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,740
That show was
definitely a milestone.

225
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,410
Mm. You mean
you actually started dating?

226
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,740
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not until years later.

227
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,570
Yeah. Yeah,
I was already here in Boston,

228
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,200
and I was, uh,

229
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,240
...creeping around
on her Myspace page,

230
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,660
and I saw
that she was moving here

231
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,200
and that she was looking
for an apartment share.

232
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,860
So we became roommates.

233
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,950
And from there, it progressed.

234
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,660
And who initiated that?

235
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,110
I think it was both of us?

236
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,990
- Yeah.
- Right?

237
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,780
Yeah.

238
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,780
Both.

239
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,110
I had just come out of a series
of relationships

240
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
which were...

241
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,410
borderline abusive.

242
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,990
And I guess
that I was addicted to that,

243
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,200
and I... and I was...

244
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,700
stuck.

245
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,160
Uh, I had a job that I could
care less about.

246
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,910
Mm.

247
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,740
And Jonathan
was the complete opposite.

248
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,910
Uh, he was everything
that I wanted to be.

249
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,320
He had values, and purpose.

250
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,200
- It's true.
- Yeah, well. Yeah, I...

251
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
It's ironic because this was

252
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,530
at the height of my
existential dread.

253
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,360
After I left my religion,

254
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,360
I just had these years
of loneliness and...

255
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,860
So... when did it happen?

256
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,570
Well, it happened...

257
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,450
thanks to the asthma, actually.

258
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,820
The asthma?

259
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,860
Yeah. There was this one time
we were coming back from the ER,

260
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,990
I'd had a very severe attack,
and the, um, the doctor...

261
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,450
...he mistook us
for a married couple,

262
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,410
and, uh... we liked it,

263
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,280
and we came home
and we kept playing at it.

264
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,530
And, um...

265
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,990
and then it happened.

266
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,030
That's great.
That's perfect.

267
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,160
So... All right.

268
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,320
- Now, I'd like to hear...
- It's almost over.

269
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,910
...a bit about, in your opinion,

270
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,570
what is the primary factor

271
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,610
contributing to the success
of your marriage?

272
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,610
Hmm.

273
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,860
- Hmm.
- I... I'll let you take this.

274
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,860
Interesting.
Interesting.

275
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,700
Could you actually tell us what
the definition of success is

276
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,110
that you're working with?

277
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,160
Yeah. Well, uh, first of all,

278
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,320
it means that
you're still together.

279
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,860
- Uh...
- That's a low bar.

280
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,530
Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,610
Well, does our ten years
make us statistical outliers?

282
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,570
Mm-hmm.

283
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,610
Well, if we ignore
all the socioeconomic

284
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,820
and race parameters, then yes.

285
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,610
The average marriage in the US
is 8.2 years.

286
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,200
Okay. Well then

287
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,740
shouldn't you ask first
if subjectively that...

288
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,950
If we perceive our marriage
to be a success at all?

289
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,030
Well, um, sure.
Yeah, if you can...

290
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,240
Yeah, I'm only saying
that because I feel like

291
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,700
that word, "success,"

292
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,570
is kind of emblematic
of a larger

293
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,660
cultural misconception
about marriage.

294
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,570
Hmm.

295
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,450
- Yeah.
- It's become this project, right?

296
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,200
This thing that you work on,
"We're working on our marriage."

297
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,410
- It's this...
- Mm.

298
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,570
...multibillion-dollar industry.

299
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,160
There's, you know,
self-help books,

300
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,740
- and couples therapy...
- Right.

301
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,740
-...and workshops, and podcasts,

302
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,280
and apps, and TV shows.

303
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,740
It's a huge business.

304
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,160
Mm-hmm.
And you see that as a problem?

305
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,700
Look, maybe it's because
of my background,

306
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,200
but I just think
it's so obvious that... that...

307
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,490
Western culture,
consumer culture,

308
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,410
has very purposefully created

309
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,450
these completely
irrational expectations

310
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,450
that marriage must,
at all times, be based

311
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,780
on passion, on sex,

312
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,570
on relentless
emotional intensity,

313
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,240
when it's so obvious that
these things stem from novelty,

314
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,530
so the whole concept's
a complete fallacy.

315
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,610
- Right. Okay.
- Mm.

316
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,990
So then,
well, what is...

317
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,240
What's your concept?

318
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:59,200
I think... I think we both see
marriage as a means.

319
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,660
It's not an end.

320
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,070
Right? I think we see it
as a platform...

321
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,860
- Mm-hmm.
- ...where we both can, uh...

322
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,200
that allows us to develop
as individuals.

323
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,160
We're both really passionate
about the work we do, and...

324
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,610
and our partnership gives us

325
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,070
the safe ground to do it,
and to...

326
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,070
raise a daughter
and have a family.

327
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,530
Yeah.

328
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,240
Mira, what about you?

329
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,490
Um, sorry, what was the...

330
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,700
The question was about
your perception...

331
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,990
Right. Our success.

332
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,660
Um, well, I agree with what
Jonathan said.

333
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,410
I mean, we... we come...

334
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,450
- Hi.
- Hey, honey.

335
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,450
- Hey, oh. What is it?
- Whoa!

336
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

337
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
- I'm Danielle. Remember me?
- Who's that?

338
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,780
- What's wrong, honey bunny?
- It's over.

339
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,990
Oh. Okay.

340
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,530
- Sorry, give us a second.
- Of course.

341
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,200
Come on. I'll put another one
on for you, okay?

342
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,410
- Take your time, no worries.
- Why can't I watch it

343
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,530
here with you on the iPad?

344
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,950
- We'll be right back.
- Because, silly goose,

345
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,030
we're having a little meeting,
but then... It's okay.

346
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,570
I'm just... I'm gonna stay
with her and watch.

347
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,110
I got it, I got it.
I got it, sweetie.

348
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
- No, I'm gonna...
- You're in the middle of your answer.

349
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,200
Yeah, but I'm dying to get this
over with. Come on. I'm...

350
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,160
I know, but it's just
gonna be a little longer.

351
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,990
- She said an hour at the most.
- Daddy.

352
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,410
Okay, sweetie,
I'm gonna put it on.

353
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,610
What's wrong?

354
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,570
Nothing.

355
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,740
Have fun.

356
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,660
Okay.
Just one second, patience.

357
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,820
- Sorry about that.
- No, no, it's fine.

358
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,240
- I know exactly how it is.
- Yeah.

359
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,450
I'm so grateful
to you both for doing this.

360
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,490
It's so hard finding subjects
for research,

361
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,110
especially straight men,
actually.

362
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,610
Well, lucky for you,
Jonathan loves

363
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,070
- talking about his theories.
- Hmm.

364
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,450
Well, what's yours?

365
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,990
Well, um...

366
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,030
I think about it in terms of...

367
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,030
an equilibrium.

368
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,320
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. I think that

369
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,700
in marriage, there is
this very delicate equilibrium

370
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,200
and that, um, you have to
maintain it together.

371
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,660
And what
do you mean by equilibrium?

372
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,490
Well, you know, at the beginning
of a relationship,

373
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,160
everything's thrilling
and it's new

374
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,280
and you feel as a couple
that nothing can hurt you.

375
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,530
Right.

376
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,950
And then you gradually
start to realize that actually,

377
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,160
anything can hurt you.

378
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,240
Mm-hmm.

379
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,700
Uh...

380
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,860
- I'm gonna go check on them.
- Okay.

381
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,820
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

382
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,110
- Hey.
- Good? Yeah.

383
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,740
Sorry, the Wi-Fi was,
uh, messed up.

384
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,160
It wasn't loading.

385
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,070
Hi.

386
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,780
We have another half an hour
while she watches this one.

387
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,780
- Perfect.
- Okay. All right.

388
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,030
Okay. Great.

389
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,740
Thank you.

390
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,700
So...

391
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,490
Yes, I'd like to hear about
your attitudes towards monogamy.

392
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,660
Um, to what extent do you see
yourselves committed

393
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,160
to each other exclusively?

394
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,860
Well, what do you mean?

395
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,070
I mean sexually.

396
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,240
I would say
it was very unexpected.

397
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,110
Well? What did I miss?

398
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,410
- Oh, God.
- Basically, she asked

399
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,990
if they're fucking other people.

400
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,110
- That's a little intrusive, no?
- Yeah.

401
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,820
- Why?
- Well, maybe not for you,

402
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,570
but how did you agree
to do this?

403
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,110
I didn't. Jonathan agreed,
and he dragged me into it.

404
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
I didn't drag you into it.

405
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,530
- You did. Yes.
- No, I didn't.

406
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,030
You did. He met her
at Ava's preschool.

407
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,360
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

408
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,160
For the twins, she takes care
of the twins that go there.

409
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,950
So she told him all about it,

410
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,910
and he couldn't help advancing
his theories

411
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,490
on how capitalism
ruins marriages.

412
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,700
It's true.

413
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,360
- Jonathan.
- Word needs to get out.

414
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,610
Getting friendly with
the younger women at pickup?

415
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,160
- Come on.
- Uh-huh.

416
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,110
- That is true.
- He's taking advantage of his sexy dad factor.

417
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,820
She's a student.
She's a student. Please.

418
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,110
But, wait,
what is the research about?

419
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,700
I'm kidding.
I'm totally kidding.

420
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,320
I think that... I think

421
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,820
her thesis is basically that

422
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,030
when the woman
is the primary provider

423
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,820
and the man
is the primary caregiver,

424
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,660
the marriage has
a greater chance of "success."

425
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,030
- Mm.
- Really?

426
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,280
Yeah.

427
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,410
Apparently, there's research
that says that the woman's

428
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,070
level of satisfaction
is the crucial element

429
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,660
in determining the long-term
stability of a marriage.

430
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,410
Huh. You hear that, Kate?

431
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,320
Loud and clear.

432
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,450
Anyway,
why is she choosing

433
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,070
to follow long-term
monogamous couples?

434
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,410
I would expect more out of
a millennial psych student.

435
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,530
Yeah, apparently, uh,

436
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,320
divorce has been researched
to death, so...

437
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,570
Yeah, but there's so many
other relationship models.

438
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,820
I mean, it's a new era.

439
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,910
Take us, for example.

440
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,660
- She should have met with us.
- Yeah. Well, you know, I'm happy to give her your number, Peter,

441
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,820
if you're interested, as she's
desperate for research subjects.

442
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,950
By all means. I think she could
benefit a lot from us.

443
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,240
Wait. But she's interested in
successful marriages.

444
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,070
I think that rules us out, baby.

445
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,450
That's...

446
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,070
I don't think that's true.

447
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,160
Okay. Hey. I'm sorry.

448
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,450
Wait. So how was,
uh, how was Boulder?

449
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,780
- Oh, yeah.
- It was good.

450
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,240
We... we won the pitch.

451
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,530
- Hey, that's great.
- No!

452
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,570
- Cheers. Congrats. Fantastic.
- Thank you, guys.

453
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,410
Yeah, actually, we killed it.

454
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,780
You know, I don't think
they were, uh,

455
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,780
looking for a boutique company,

456
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,160
but they fell in love
with Kate's demos.

457
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,570
Of course they did.
She's a genius.

458
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,740
There's no better web designer
on the entire East Coast.

459
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,950
- No.
- I've said that

460
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,360
- multiple times.
- No argument here.

461
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,280
And, you know, I didn't fuck up
the presentation too badly, so.

462
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
- Well, good. Good on you.
- You sure? You sure?

463
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
We were
a well-oiled machine.

464
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,240
That's great, guys.
I'm jealous of you.

465
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,610
I am. I get jealous of them.
I just think that, like,

466
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,660
a couple that can
work together is...

467
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,030
Don't be too jealous.

468
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,570
No, I'm sure it's not
always easy, but when it works,

469
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,660
- that's like the paradigm.
- Easy? I mean, the fact that

470
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,360
we got through Boulder without
killing each other is a miracle.

471
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,280
Let's not do this now, Kate.

472
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,820
- Why not? What's the problem?
- This is not the time for it.

473
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,660
Okay. So, when we're alone,
it's not the time either.

474
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,990
Maybe you can give some thought
to when the right time might be.

475
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,910
- Just stop, okay?
- Okay. Fine.

476
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,530
Okay. Let's go home.

477
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,240
- No! What are you talking about?
- We're playing make-believe.

478
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,070
- Kate. Let's not ruin it.
- Don't leave.

479
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,490
- What's going on, Peter?
- It's nothing important,

480
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,490
it's just the usual
drama about...

481
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,030
Don't say it's not
important. No. Fuck you.

482
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,950
Okay.

483
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,910
What's going on...

484
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,360
is Nathan broke up with me,

485
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,320
and I'm extremely depressed
about it.

486
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,110
Peter can't deal with it.
He won't talk about it.

487
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,700
So that's what's going on. And...

488
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,530
- Kate. Cut it out.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

489
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,780
Cut it out?
You cut it out. All of these...

490
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,860
I'm so sick of this
social fascism.

491
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,780
- Social fascism.
- All these bullshit empty conversations.

492
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,410
I'm allowed
to talk about everything

493
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,240
but the most important thing
going on in my life.

494
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,780
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

495
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,410
Maybe they don't really
feel like hearing about it,

496
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,160
- have you considered that?
- No, no.

497
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,610
You're the only one that doesn't
wanna hear about it.

498
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,740
Because you'd rather wallow in your
passive-aggressive bullshit resentment,

499
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,820
you can't
admit that you're hurting,

500
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,280
that it hurts,

501
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,570
- and just talk to me about it.
- Yeah, I'm hurt, okay?

502
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm very hurt. I admit it. Okay.

503
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,780
- Can we end this now?
- Okay. No, we can't end this.

504
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,200
And I won't live like this.
Okay?

505
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,280
When we started this, we said

506
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,910
that we would talk about
everything, and I was there

507
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,200
through all your shit
with Alana, Grace.

508
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,570
I accepted that.
I dealt with that.

509
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,780
And now suddenly when I'm the
one that's going through something,

510
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,910
it's like
my feelings aren't legitimate.

511
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,610
I never fell in love
with anyone else.

512
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,860
That's the difference.

513
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,660
Okay.

514
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,160
So what if I... fell in love?

515
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,530
That was supposed to be a part
of the risk we both accepted.

516
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm not leaving, I'm here,
I'm dealing with it.

517
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,280
- Sorry.
- It's okay. No, no, no.

518
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,910
- Oh, God.
- It's all right.

519
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,320
So you care more about
what they think about you

520
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,160
than what I'm going through
right now.

521
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,200
- You're so pathetic.
- I think it's a real competition

522
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,490
as to who's most pathetic
right now.

523
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,910
Let's take a break.
I'm gonna go upstairs.

524
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,700
Why don't you come upstairs
with me?

525
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,740
I'm gonna call a car.
You do whatever you want.

526
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,160
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

527
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,570
- No, no.
- I couldn't hold it together anymore.

528
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,450
- I get it.
- That whole dinner, he was just...

529
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,030
I know.

530
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,160
It's been like this all week
since I talked to you.

531
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,200
I'm sorry
I haven't been here.

532
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,700
- When did your flight get in?
- Last night.

533
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Do you have an Advil?
My head's killing me.

534
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,110
In my bathroom. I'm just gonna
check on Ava for a second.

535
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,360
I'll be right there.

536
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,700
Revisionist history, you know?

537
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,610
She was a mess,
I was holding things together.

538
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,780
- Did you find it?
- Yeah.

539
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,030
So, it ended with Nathan,
completely?

540
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,410
Yeah. For good.

541
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,030
I'm sorry.

542
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,070
Oh, girl. Yeah.
He said he's exhausted

543
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,360
from living a double life.

544
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,360
The irony is a double life's
the only life

545
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,780
I know how to live.

546
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,530
Right.

547
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,860
Mira, this past week,
I can barely get out of bed.

548
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,030
Literally.
It's not getting any better.

549
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,360
And Peter just sulks all day
like a child. And...

550
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,860
When he's not doing
this phony chipper thing

551
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,660
that makes me
wanna strangle him.

552
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,160
And then I have these outbursts
of hatred for him

553
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,570
where I'm just...

554
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,280
I find myself in bed...

555
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,320
thinking of the craziest ways
to torture him

556
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,990
and then fucking kill him.

557
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,950
- I don't know.
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:08,240
Perhaps it's time to reconsider
this arrangement.

559
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,450
This arrangement?

560
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,490
I'm...

561
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,410
You gotta remember
this whole thing started

562
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,450
so Peter could justify
his cheating.

563
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,740
This is just... It doesn't matter
how it started.

564
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,070
This is the way that we found
to, you know, get through it,

565
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,780
and I don't regret it.

566
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,450
Mm.

567
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
I don't.

568
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,950
- I don't... Kate.
- It's been good for us.

569
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,320
I don't remember ever wanting
to fuck Peter

570
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,820
as much as
when I was with Nathan.

571
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,950
I'm serious. I wore him out.

572
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,820
- Okay.
- Do you know how good it felt

573
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,320
to actually want my husband?

574
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,110
You know, this is real.

575
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,700
This is my life, Mira.
It's not some whim.

576
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,530
I mean, what I had with Nathan,

577
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,240
I don't remember
ever feeling so alive.

578
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,280
And so, okay, it also means
feeling this terrible pain.

579
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,700
It's part of the deal.

580
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,860
You're really
suffering though, honey.

581
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,860
Hmm.

582
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,030
What would be better?

583
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,490
There were at least three years

584
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,570
when I didn't have sex
with Peter.

585
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,070
- I know.
- Yeah.

586
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Does that seem
reasonable to you?

587
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,820
Life without any passion,
right? Kind of like...

588
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,700
Well, passion, okay,
it's awesome,

589
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,990
uh, but, you know,
it's not sustainable.

590
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,450
We're not 16 anymore.
You can't...

591
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,820
What does 16
have to do with anything?

592
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,450
Did you renounce passion
at the age of 16?

593
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,280
No, I'm not saying
that I renounced it.

594
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,950
Don't start quoting
Jonathan's theories

595
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,570
- about marriage.
- I'm not quoting him.

596
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,410
No, I... I'm saying that, okay,
this open relationship

597
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,990
- comes at a price for everybody.
- Of course it does.

598
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,280
And... it can't be easy
for your kids, right?

599
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,200
Well, it's not easy
for any kid, Mira.

600
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,490
I mean...

601
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,490
Honestly, in the long run,
I think that it's actually...

602
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,990
very empowering for them

603
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,070
to see me always searching
for freedom and happiness.

604
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,610
I don't know,
self-actualization?

605
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,490
It's absolutely something
that I want to model for them.

606
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,780
Especially Anna.

607
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,160
Okay.

608
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm not judging you, honey.
I'm not.

609
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Yeah.

610
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,700
And I'm on your side
always. You know that, right?

611
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,160
I know. I do.

612
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,410
I'm sorry. Here.

613
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,110
- Mm.
- No, no, no.

614
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,610
Hmm.

615
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,820
Oh, this day. It's just, like,
it's so much. It's...

616
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,660
Wait, is something wrong?

617
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,990
No, it's just, uh...

618
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,280
It's just a lot of pressure, so.

619
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,700
What kind of pressure?

620
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,030
No, it's nothing. Forget it.

621
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,700
What?

622
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,660
Nothing, I just...
I'm sorry I lost it.

623
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,740
I think it's okay.
That was crazy.

624
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
Girl.

625
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,700
- You're such a good friend. Hey.
- Aw.

626
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,740
And you're stunning.

627
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,240
I don't...

628
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,660
Not sure where what came from.

629
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,410
I think I'm pretty drunk.

630
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,410
Um...

631
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,610
- Okay. You good?
- Yeah.

632
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,070
- Do you wanna go downstairs?
- Okay.

633
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,030
Mm. Yeah.

634
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,660
Hang on.

635
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,070
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.

636
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,820
Oh, no, no, no,
you got it backwards.

637
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,070
It was... it was... it was she
who made the sale.

638
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,320
I get that, but you
did your fair share of the work.

639
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,780
She is a ball buster.

640
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,530
- She can be really fucking scary.
- Oh my God.

641
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,740
And she's a...
She's a true artist, right?

642
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,530
- I'll call a car.
- She's a certifiable genius. She's gorgeous.

643
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,110
I'm just gonna clean up a bit.

644
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,490
I don't know why she even
ever let me between her legs,

645
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,320
this paragon of perfection.

646
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,360
Hi. I need a car

647
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,160
at 206 Abbottsford Road
in Brookline.

648
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,030
When I sleep with
other women, it's because, uh,

649
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,490
it's only because
it makes me feel...

650
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,200
You know, it's...
It has nothing to do

651
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,360
with falling in love.
It's the only way...

652
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,070
It's the only way
that I can, uh...

653
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,320
No, it does...

654
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,910
You know, I know...
I know I'm the one who...

655
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,240
Peter, I called us a car.
Neither one of us can drive.

656
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,200
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Do you want coffee or anything?

657
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,240
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

658
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,030
Yeah, I was just, uh...

659
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,740
I was just trying
to explain to him

660
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,110
how you and I decided to, uh...

661
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,610
And I, you know, I was saying
that just ignoring the fact

662
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,360
that you have options
doesn't make them go away.

663
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,530
- Right? Right?
- Yeah.

664
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,610
You know, or another way
of saying it is,

665
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,240
you know, if the only reason
that you're faithful

666
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,070
is because it's like
a rational decision,

667
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,280
- well, that's not sustainable.
- Why not?

668
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,490
Well, because it's just a matter
of the right woman, right time

669
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,490
- when it finally happens, right?
- Oh, okay.

670
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,410
So I don't have a choice
in the matter?

671
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,740
No, you don't.

672
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Because, I mean, this force...

673
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,240
- I'm tired.
- ...call it Eros or whatever,

674
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,700
you know, it's far more powerful
than your own will.

675
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,110
The car is on the way.

676
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,410
You better start
getting ready, okay?

677
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,110
Just a second.
You understand what I'm saying?

678
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,450
It depends on who you are.

679
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,160
- No, it doesn't! It doesn't!
- Shh. Peter.

680
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,490
- Quiet.
- I'm sorry.

681
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,280
I think it's just...
It's a longer conversation.

682
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,860
No, tell me, I wanna hear.

683
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,950
I think maybe it's just because
of the way that I was raised.

684
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,610
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, in...

685
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,950
the first 20 years of your life,

686
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,110
you're taught to conquer
your desires,

687
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,240
- not surrender to them.
- Dude.

688
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,660
- What?
- That's grotesque.

689
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,780
Maybe.

690
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,530
I mean,
that level of repression,

691
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,700
it's like from the Middle Ages.

692
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
I'm not defending it.

693
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,280
I'm just saying
that it's ingrained in me.

694
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,530
Hey, babe, where is your jacket?

695
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,110
- Just a second.
- We need to get ready.

696
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,610
You really need
to start shaking that off.

697
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,780
- Or it's gonna take a major toll on you.
- Peter.

698
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,070
Not just mentally,
I mean,

699
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,240
physically
and spiritually, and...

700
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,160
- The car is almost here.
- Yeah, I heard you!

701
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,070
- He can wait a minute!
- Shh.

702
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,860
Shit.

703
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,530
- Here.
- I'm sorry.

704
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,410
- I'm really sorry.
- I call you tomorrow.

705
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,530
- Mira, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

706
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,410
I'm sorry.
I apologize.

707
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,700
- Bye. Night.
- No worries. It's all right.

708
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,320
- Is she mad at me?
- Peter, let's go.

709
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,280
It's fine. It's fine.
It's just a long day.

710
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,910
All right, guys.
Thanks for coming.

711
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,450
- Okay.
- Don't worry about it.

712
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,030
So we'll come back
for our car tomorrow?

713
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,570
- Uh, is it that one?
- No, it's across the street.

714
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,700
You're welcome. Bye.

715
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,570
I'll be right there.

716
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,030
Sorry I left you down there.

717
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,320
It's okay, sweetie.

718
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,110
I couldn't take it anymore.

719
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,160
Yeah,
he was really drunk.

720
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,410
It was tragic.

721
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,820
Tragic, why?

722
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,910
Why?

723
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,160
Yeah. It's not like we
haven't seen that before.

724
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,240
She's really suffering.
I'm telling you.

725
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,990
Yeah,
I could see that, but...

726
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,030
The sad thing is they're
basically a good couple

727
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,910
if he hadn't roped her in
all his adolescent bullshit.

728
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,160
Yeah?

729
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,110
You sure it's him
that roped her?

730
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,280
Oh, come on.
It's not who she is,

731
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,030
this whole polyamory thing.

732
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,860
I think they both get to...

733
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,700
feed off of the drama, you know?

734
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,820
Mm. Well, you get a kick
out of it, don't you?

735
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,490
You must admit, darling,
it is diverting.

736
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,030
Whatever.

737
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,610
What is it?

738
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,740
Oh, don't look so scared.

739
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,910
I'm not.

740
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,280
What's going on?

741
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,070
I'm pregnant.

742
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,950
- What?
- Yeah.

743
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,660
Wow.

744
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,030
Mira.

745
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,280
How?

746
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,860
Uh, well, that weekend.
The Cape.

747
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,320
Yeah, I forgot my pills,
so I missed a couple days.

748
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,160
Why didn't you tell me
you forgot your pills?

749
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,700
Well, I didn't think
that it mattered if we...

750
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,070
Well, it shouldn't be so easy
to get knocked up at my age.

751
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,660
I took a...

752
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,240
Well, I was late for my period,

753
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,950
so I took a test this afternoon,
and there was a faint blue line.

754
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,700
Okay, so it's a faint line,
so maybe...

755
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,280
No, I took a picture
of the stick

756
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,740
and sent it to my doctors.

757
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,990
I'm pregnant.

758
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,780
- Wow.
- Yeah.

759
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,110
- Wow.
- Yeah. I've got an appointment

760
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
with her next week. Dr. Varona.

761
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,860
Okay.

762
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,410
- Are you happy? Yeah?
- Yes, of course. I'm happy. Yes.

763
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,450
I'm just a little... I'm stunned.

764
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,950
God, me too.

765
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,200
I mean,
I have no idea what to do.

766
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,660
What do you mean?

767
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,570
Nothing. Nothing.
I just... I don't know. It's...

768
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,950
If we do this,
so much is gonna fall on you.

769
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,530
Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,570
So, what do you feel?

771
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,570
Well, I don't know.
I wanted to know how you felt.

772
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,780
No, no, forget about me
for a second.

773
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,110
What do you feel?

774
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,030
I don't know.

775
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,070
Okay.

776
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,320
Well, try to think about
how you felt

777
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,070
the second that you realized.

778
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,410
- Try to remember.
- Fine.

779
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,240
I felt shocked.

780
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,570
And, um, then I had to...

781
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,240
come downstairs
for that interview,

782
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,360
so I buried it. And now...

783
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,610
I guess I...

784
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
I don't know.

785
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,530
Come on.
You can be honest with me.

786
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,950
Anything that you feel is
legitimate.

787
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,070
I don't know how I feel.

788
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,200
How am I supposed
to be honest about that?

789
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,820
Sorry.

790
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,610
Just trying to figure out
how this could have happened.

791
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,740
Yeah.

792
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,450
Maybe the sex
had something to do with it.

793
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,160
Yeah.

794
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,990
Hey, what if... what if we
think about this in,

795
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,530
I don't know,
like a slightly more...

796
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,780
...deterministic way?

797
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,780
You know, like,
it's the Lord's doing, right?

798
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,360
- What?
- Not in a religious sense.

799
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,860
- Not in a religious sense.
- Okay.

800
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,740
I just mean, like, I mean,
you know, okay,

801
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,450
you forgot your pills.

802
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,910
Uh-huh.

803
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,450
And you still...?

804
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,570
Yeah.

805
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,280
And you
immediately got pregnant.

806
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,740
So is it possible that
there's a part of you that...

807
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,110
Wanted this or thought
that we should have this?

808
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,740
Where is this coming from?

809
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,410
- It's so...
- I know, I know.

810
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,240
I mean, if you're...
If you're trying to say

811
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,490
that you want
to keep it, just say that.

812
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,820
Well...

813
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,450
I...

814
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,320
I... It's what we talked
about originally.

815
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,910
Yeah. But originally,
it was completely abstract.

816
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,490
I mean, it was...

817
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,240
before we knew anything
about anything,

818
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
it was before Ava,

819
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,610
before we knew
what it was actually like.

820
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,570
What?

821
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,660
You...

822
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,110
- You wanna keep it, right?
- I think so. Yeah, I think so.

823
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,240
I think we can handle it,
but only if it's something

824
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,740
that you really, really want
and would be happy about.

825
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,070
I think so.

826
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,660
I think I might.

827
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,860
Ava will be thrilled.

828
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,740
Yeah.

829
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
And your parents.

830
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,570
Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.

831
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,990
So, are we going for this?
Oh, my God.

832
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,820
Um... yeah?

833
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,160
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Come here.

834
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,070
- Okay.
- Come here.

835
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,490
You okay?

836
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,410
Here.

837
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,360
Don't...

838
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,360
Don't look at me like that.

839
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,910
This is...
This doesn't mean anything.

840
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,280
Right.

841
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,820
- It only means you're panicking.
- It doesn't mean I'm panicking.

842
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,410
- I had a lot to drink.
- Yeah, hmm.

843
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,820
But you know what, even if
I was panicking, so what?

844
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,200
This is a really big deal, okay?

845
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
This is irreversible,
what we're talking about here.

846
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,610
Mm-hmm.

847
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
What?

848
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,160
You know, it just sucks
that neither one of us

849
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,280
could be completely happy
and confident about this...

850
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,860
Yeah, but... that's because I see
how ambivalent you are about it.

851
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,360
- Well, yeah. Of course I'm ambivalent.
- Yeah.

852
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,360
I mean, you remember
those first two years with Ava?

853
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,990
- Yeah.
- Thinking about jumping back

854
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,160
into that nightmare.

855
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,860
Yeah. I was there too.
I remember.

856
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,660
I know you were. I know
you've been an amazing partner,

857
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,200
but you don't...
You couldn't, like...

858
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,410
I couldn't... I couldn't be

859
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,610
- where you were.
- No, you could not.

860
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,320
I couldn't be
in your place. I know.

861
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,490
You tried and...

862
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,660
But you couldn't.

863
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,030
I took that out on you.
I took it...

864
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,740
I was just awful to you.
I was awful.

865
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,820
We... we talked about it,

866
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,570
and I understood
where that came from.

867
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,950
- You know?
- I know you understood,

868
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,110
but you were also hurt.

869
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,490
That's why you become distant,
and I hated you

870
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,160
for being distant, and I hated
myself even more for...

871
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,530
being so shitty to you.

872
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,490
- I felt like a terrible mom.
- Oh, sweetie, I...

873
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,660
That was a nightmare for you.

874
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,410
It was a nightmare
for both of us.

875
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,530
Yeah.

876
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,860
And it took so long to, like...

877
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,030
feel like myself again,
you know?

878
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,860
And now we're good, and...

879
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,570
And Ava's so good, and...

880
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,450
Especially
when she's with you, she's...

881
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,070
- Aw, come on.
- Kidding.

882
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,660
It's just like I finally...

883
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,320
returned to my life.

884
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,860
I feel so guilty
about what I'm saying.

885
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,610
Sweetie, you shouldn't
feel guilty.

886
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,360
It makes perfect sense,
you know?

887
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,030
Yeah.

888
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,110
It's like, um...

889
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,410
all of a sudden,
everything is unreal.

890
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,860
Everything that we had,

891
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,280
you, you're not real.

892
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,990
Ava isn't. It's just...
It's this thing.

893
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,450
It's this pregnancy.
It's the only thing that's real.

894
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,240
- It's...
- Hey, Mira.

895
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,200
Yeah.

896
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,030
- Babe.
- What?

897
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,990
Mm.

898
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,320
It's painful wanting something
and not wanting it

899
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,320
at the same time.
You know?

900
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,910
Yeah, yeah.

901
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,360
But think about it.

902
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,030
- Yeah.
- When Ava was a baby, we had no perspective at all.

903
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,860
We thought it was
gonna be like that forever.

904
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,160
- Right.
- And now we see that it passes, right?

905
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,030
It gets better. Right?

906
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,950
- That's true.
- Yeah.

907
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,700
You know, Ava's totally obsessed
with having a little sister.

908
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,410
- Yeah.
- If it's...

909
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,780
a boy, that'll be rough.

910
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,240
Well, it'll have to
be a girl then.

911
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
We'll raise it a girl,
regardless.

912
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,070
Either way, they're gonna want
their own rooms eventually.

913
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,240
Mm-hmm.

914
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,990
But it should be a pretty easy
renovation, you know,

915
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,820
to divide Ava's room in half.

916
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,240
We'll have to steal a little
square footage from the hallway,

917
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,030
put up a little drywall, right?

918
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,160
Sure.

919
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,070
I love you.
You know that, right?

920
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,320
Yes, I do.

921
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,490
- Yup, come in.
- Hi? Sorry. Am I late? I'm late.

922
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,240
It's fine. We just, uh...
We're just starting out.

923
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,030
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Yeah, no problem.

924
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,610
- Nice... nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

925
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,450
So, I was just
starting to explain

926
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,410
- the procedure to Mira.
- Great.

927
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,410
As I said, you'll
take the mifepristone here today,

928
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,860
and that blocks
your progesterone,

929
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,610
effectively ending
the pregnancy.

930
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,450
And then I'll send you home
with four pills of misoprostol,

931
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,240
and that'll bring on
contractions.

932
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,700
- Mm-hmm.
- So that can be not so fun.

933
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,320
You'll have cramping
and heavy bleeding.

934
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,450
You'll pass some large clots,

935
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,450
and you might have nausea,

936
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,450
vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness,
and in rare cases, fever.

937
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,740
It's like a stomach virus.

938
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,820
Great.

939
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,240
So that's all normal.

940
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,240
But if you have any side effects
that worry you, just call.

941
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,030
Does it still seem
like what you wanna do?

942
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:27,990
Yeah.

943
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,320
While you're here,

944
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,360
do you wanna talk
about contraception,

945
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,660
since the pill
wasn't your friend this time?

946
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,490
Yeah, I was just
saying to Jonathan

947
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,360
that I was amazed that, um,

948
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,490
could still have an accident
at my age.

949
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,860
You'll be...

950
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:44,030
- 40 in November, right?
- Mm-hmm.

951
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,450
Yeah.
That's gonna keep

952
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,280
- getting less likely.
- Yeah, totally.

953
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,610
But in the meantime...

954
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,360
So there are a bunch
of long-term options.

955
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,320
There's Implanon,
which is an arm insert.

956
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,990
- I could place that here today.
- Mm-hmm.

957
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,160
And there are IUDs,
the ParaGard,

958
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,910
which is plain copper,

959
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,110
or the Mirena,

960
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,410
which is very popular,
it's a hormone-releasing IUD.

961
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,530
Maybe the copper one.

962
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,200
It would be nice to give
my body a break

963
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,780
- from all those hormones.
- Mm-hmm.

964
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,860
Yeah. Well, I can place that
at your follow-up.

965
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,410
- And, uh, you can think about it a little more.
- Okay.

966
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,320
For now, just throw
out your current package of pills

967
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,200
and start a new one tomorrow.

968
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,660
- Okay?
- Yeah.

969
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,320
Any questions?

970
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:22,450
Nope.

971
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,660
Okay.
I'm gonna go get the medicine.

972
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,780
Okay.

973
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,860
She has to warn us
about the symptoms,

974
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,200
but it's, uh,
it's the simplest procedure.

975
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,110
Yeah. Yeah. No, I know. I know.

976
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,610
I'm gonna get us
something to drink.

977
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,660
Diet Coke, is that good?

978
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,240
No, I don't need...
I don't need anything.

979
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,950
No, I'll get us one.
There's a vending machine

980
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,240
right outside the door.

981
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,160
Um, yeah.
I'll be right back, okay?

982
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,030
Uh, fine.

983
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,820
Hey? I'll be right there.

984
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,910
Okay.

985
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,450
Hey. So, they only had Pepsi.

986
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,530
- Is that okay?
- That's fine.

987
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,860
- It's all right?
- Mm-hmm.

988
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,280
I'm sure
there's, like, a cup

989
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,910
around here somewhere.

990
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,320
No, it's fine. I'll just
drink it straight from the can.

991
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,200
I'm sure there's something.
Maybe here.

992
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
Jonathan.

993
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,820
Oh, I think
there's something here.

994
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,160
Come here for a second.

995
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,780
Oh, fuck,
it's a urine sample cup.

996
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,240
Okay. Come over here.
Sit down for a second.

997
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,450
Look at me.

998
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,450
Are you okay?

999
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,990
- Yeah.
- Are you mad?

1000
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,570
Am I mad? No.
Why would I be mad?

1001
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,950
Are you having
second thoughts?

1002
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,160
No.

1003
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,990
- No?
- No, no, no, no. I...

1004
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,280
- I don't...
- I'm just...

1005
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,030
I don't why
I'm feeling like this.

1006
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,780
I didn't expect
to feel like that.

1007
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,860
No, it's okay, honey.

1008
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,110
- It's fine.
- Yeah.

1009
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,700
You know, I'm... it's not easy
for me either.

1010
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,200
No, no, no, no, no.
Of course. Of course. Uh...

1011
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,950
Sorry, I'm not, um, trying
to make... No, yeah.

1012
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,200
I know you... you're the one that
has to... has to go through it.

1013
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,490
We're making
the right decision here.

1014
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,820
We talked about it.

1015
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,740
I don't think there's a single
angle that we haven't covered

1016
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,990
over the last ten days.

1017
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,990
Yeah, I don't...
I don't think there is.

1018
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,160
Yeah.

1019
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,700
You know, I was thinking

1020
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,360
we could still go ahead
with the renovation.

1021
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,820
- You know? Like...
- No.

1022
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,660
Yeah. Like, we can move
Ava's play area into her room

1023
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,610
and, you know, make your study
back the way that it was before.

1024
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,610
That's never gonna work.

1025
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,950
She's gonna reclaim it
within hours.

1026
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,950
Well, then we use the attic.
I mean, we always said that

1027
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,490
we were gonna get to that
eventually.

1028
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,240
I'm okay.
I'm good where my office is.

1029
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,610
- I don't need...
- Well, I have a vision.

1030
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,780
- Just, you know, leave it to me.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

1031
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,360
- You're gonna thank me.
- Okay. Okay.

1032
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,070
Oh.

1033
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,200
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

1034
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,030
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1035
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,410
Okay.
And here's the misoprostol

1036
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,240
that you will take at home
tomorrow.

1037
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,530
Mm-hmm.

1038
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,660
Take some ibuprofen
about an hour before you put

1039
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,740
the tablets in your cheek, okay?

1040
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,490
All right. Here you go.

1041
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,320
- Mm-hmm.
- See you in a couple weeks.

1042
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:45,860
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1043
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,490
Oh.

1044
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,280
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1045
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,990
I feel a little nauseous.

1046
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,610
I'm fine. It's fine.

1047
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,860
I'm sure, um, it's just
the power of suggestion.

1048
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,030
Just rest
until it passes, okay?

1049
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:07,410
If you do vomit, you'll have to
take the medicine again.

1050
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:11,660
I'll ask the nurse to check in
on you in a bit.

1051
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,320
- Okay. Feel better.
- Hmm.

1052
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,450
- You okay?
- Mm-mm.

1053
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:24,950
Okay.

1054
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,110
I feel awful.

1055
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,570
I'm sure you'll feel better
tomorrow.

1056
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,910
Why don't you go home to Ava?

1057
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,410
- I'll take a car home.
- No, no. No way.

1058
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,820
I'm staying here.

1059
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,320
- Veronica's with Ava. She's...
- Jonathan, I...

1060
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,740
What?

1061
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,280
I'd like to be alone
for a little bit. Is that okay?

1062
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,860
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1063
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,070
Of course. Of course.

1064
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,200
Here, I'll leave this
right here, okay?

1065
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,360
Yup. You're not...

1066
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,910
- You're sure it's fine?
- Yes, of course, sweetie.

1067
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,610
It's fine. It's fine.
I'm totally fine, yeah.

1068
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,280
- I'll go do a little work in the waiting...
- Mm-hmm.

1069
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,030
...room over there, okay?
And you just come out

1070
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,450
- whenever you're ready.
- Yeah, just...

1071
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,160
- It won't be long.
- Yeah. Take your time.

1072
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,990
- I've got my phone, so...
- Okay.

1072
00:53:24,305 --> 00:54:24,284
