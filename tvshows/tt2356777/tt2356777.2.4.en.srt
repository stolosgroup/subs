38
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,017
I paid for fucking
avocado trees

39
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:57,486
and now you tell me can't grow?

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,271
Man can come, test the dirt.

41
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:01,656
I thought one of you'd
be able to taste it

42
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:03,575
off your finger
and tell me what's wrong.

43
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,944
Frank, that's enough.

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,333
Like it fucking matters.

45
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:12,834
Can't deal with this shit now.

46
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,786
We should talk

47
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:18,623
if we want to reschedule
that doctor's appointment.

48
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:21,460
We'll get back on the kid
when I get my feet under me.

49
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:28,049
Maybe we've been
going about it wrong.

50
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,853
How's that, specifically?

51
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:33,722
Right now there's
so many things for me

52
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:36,441
to go about the wrong way,
I'm losing my fucking vision.

53
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,654
The baby.

54
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,241
Maybe we should talk
alternatives.

55
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,460
Like what, another dog?

56
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:58,163
Adoption.

57
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:01,883
No, you don't do
somebody else's time.

58
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:05,921
My own kid, I see.
Yeah, it's my responsibility.

59
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:09,891
But you don't take on
somebody else's grief.

60
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:12,727
A child's not grief.

61
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,813
I mean they all
come in with their own.

62
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:18,600
Don't you and I and every other
hapless monkey on the planet?

63
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:20,986
At least with your kid,
it's your sins.

64
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,238
What if I can't have a child?

65
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:26,274
Why wouldn't you? You got
pregnant before, you said.

66
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,276
Maybe that's--

67
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,030
the operation, it...

68
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,836
might have made things hard.

69
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:40,505
I don't know.

70
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:44,593
You can have a kid.
Look at you.

71
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:47,512
But if.
I'm saying if.

72
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,384
You should get more tests.

73
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:54,452
Whatever they got.

74
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:58,824
I gotta go to work.

75
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,027
If I don't come up
with a new play,

76
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:05,146
the dead trees,
the present from the stork

77
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,365
are gonna be what they
call moot points.

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,818
All right, Frank.

79
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:11,453
Go to work.

80
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:50,575
<i>Hello, motherfucker.</i>

81
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,161
<i>We put out some fires</i>
<i>last night or what?</i>

82
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:59,167
I, uh--

83
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,585
I drove here?

84
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,004
You don't remember
meeting me at Lux?

85
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,956
No.

86
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,131
I'm glad you did, man.

87
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,133
DVR'd the game.

88
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,352
Here, sit down.
Have some waffles.

89
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,521
I got work.

90
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,858
<i>You let yourself go, man.</i>

91
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,860
Be what you want.
It ain't bad.

92
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:29,965
Need a ride to your bike?

93
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,816
No.

94
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:03,398
No.

95
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,485
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck.

96
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,821
Come on.
No.

97
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:12,073
Fuck.

98
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:16,911
Fuck.

99
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:19,581
Fuck.

100
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,249
Fuck.

101
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:22,751
Fuck!

102
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:30,175
Officer Woodrugh!

103
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,043
What's your comment on the
war crimes allegation?

104
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:34,446
Were you involved with the securing
of a village outside Habbaniyah?

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,015
Would you say your behavior with
Lacey Lindel follows a pattern

106
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,433
given the accusations against
Black Mountain operatives?

107
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,385
Do you have a history
of abuse with women?

108
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,055
Say, about 5'10", maybe 160?

109
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,726
- What do you think?
- I think we fucked up.

110
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:50,061
So it wasn't the transpo guy.

111
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:53,148
No, it was somebody who wanted
us to think it might be

112
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,283
dumping the car near his place.

113
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:59,454
Listen, that thing
at the mayor's house...

114
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:02,123
I respect the sack,
but it's--

115
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:03,792
it's looking
to come back on you.

116
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:08,213
Ooh, the mayor of the Shitberg
Landfill is gonna get me?

117
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:10,548
His family's controlled
this landfill for 100 years.

118
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,134
And he lives in the biggest
house on his street in Bel-Air.

119
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,122
You think men like that exist without
a long history of high-up friends?

120
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:19,174
I don't think he's gonna
have too many friends,

121
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:21,259
the state investigation
shakes out.

122
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,644
Unless it's his cellmate.

123
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,679
That's what I'm telling
you, Bezzerides.

124
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,233
State investigation, you don't think
they've seen that before down here?

125
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,485
Any member of that family
ever gone to jail?

126
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,488
Look...

127
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:38,860
Detective, the state
investigation's a shakedown.

128
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,578
Do you understand?

129
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:42,997
It's the attorney general
with his fucking hand out.

130
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:44,699
Hand out for what?

131
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,951
What's a hand usually out for?

132
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:49,204
Caspere was in a lot
of development money.

133
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:52,957
These land deals floating
around, those new corporations?

134
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,509
You think this is
about stopping Vinci

135
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:57,178
doing the same thing it's
been doing for a century?

136
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:59,013
Nobody wants to stop it.

137
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,382
Nobody gives a shit.

138
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:04,886
I'm here to solve a murder.

139
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,639
And when our betters make nice
and the money's traded hands

140
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,692
and they need something to show
for this big investigation,

141
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,978
who do you think's gonna be
first in the firing line?

142
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,147
I'm gonna take a wild guess
that you and Woodrugh

143
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:18,750
ain't the most popular
folks at your squads.

144
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,702
Expendable, one might say.

145
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:23,988
Well, you're not dirty, they
shouldn't be able to hurt you.

146
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,875
Well, I don't know about Ventura, but
you can't be that naive down here.

147
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,376
If there's a buyout
with the state attorney,

148
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,462
Chessani could make
your ass part of the deal.

149
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:34,549
Where's Woodrugh?

150
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,634
He was working
prosts last night.

151
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:39,754
I hope he didn't fall in.

152
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,263
Velcoro.

153
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,366
<i>That a barroom sunburn?</i>

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,903
Maybe I've just been out in the sun
working bullshit pawn details.

155
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:59,691
You know what?
I could give a shit.

156
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:02,861
I don't think there's any
confusion about that, Detective.

157
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:09,300
<i>Frank, what you ask,
you would need to be family</i>

158
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,469
just to avoid insult.

159
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:13,254
Family is blood.

160
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,290
Blood spilled is blood.

161
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:19,177
'99. '03.

162
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:21,429
January 2010.

163
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:24,599
I've done you favors.

164
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,385
What you mention--
history.

165
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,304
We paid for that.

166
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:31,389
You paid Osip back

167
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,725
when he was around to be paid.

168
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:35,393
Me?

169
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,563
I just call it a favor.

170
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:42,150
And you think what, an old favor
gets you free merchandise?

171
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:43,902
I don't want a handout.

172
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,486
I wouldn't take it.

173
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:47,071
I'm talking consignment.

174
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:48,806
I've got the Lux back.

175
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:50,909
I need product
to move through it.

176
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,378
Notice I'm not talking
to the Mexicans

177
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:54,996
or Russians.

178
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:57,248
I'm talking to you.

179
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,801
I'm offering 5%
above your going rate.

180
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,420
I need coke, crystal,

181
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,840
and whatever the fuck
they call MDMA now.

182
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:09,260
We move it through the club,
you get paid plus five.

183
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:10,979
It's a risk, Frank.

184
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:13,481
For me, not for you.

185
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,266
Our men handle sales.

186
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:19,103
No, I run the club.

187
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:21,189
I control who moves
what and when

188
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,941
and they answer to me.

189
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:25,159
Your only concern
is your money.

190
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,579
Santos had his own arrangement.

191
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:28,913
Mexicans.

192
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:30,582
I'll deal with it.

193
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:33,418
<i>And how have you dealt with
things since you've been away, huh?</i>

194
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,453
<i>Why you back to this, Frank?</i>

195
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:39,290
<i>I think it's because your other
plan, it somehow failed.</i>

196
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:42,210
Why now would we trust you
not to fail in this, huh?

197
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:44,679
It's respectable,
what I'm offering.

198
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:48,917
I'll upscale your clientele,
increase your market.

199
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:50,852
And together we'll prosper.

200
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,355
We don't do consignment, Frank.

201
00:10:56,859 --> 00:11:01,479
5% is not
a one-time number.

202
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:03,364
It's monthly.

203
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,284
Month in, month out.

204
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:08,453
It is a long-term
investment

205
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:10,872
in a mutually beneficial
relationship.

206
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,002
Then we're settled at five.

207
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:28,056
All that sugar, Frank,

208
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,408
I wonder you haven't
lost your teeth.

209
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:35,179
Dental work's expensive.

210
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:38,516
It's the only way I can
keep your coffee down.

211
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:48,609
I never lost a tooth.

212
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:51,446
Never even had
a fucking cavity.

213
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:27,031
Glove box.

214
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,100
Take a cure.

215
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,796
Where's your bike?

216
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,665
Stolen.

217
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:46,918
I checked city impound already.

218
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:51,005
That hotel have a shower?

219
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:54,225
I couldn't get back in.

220
00:12:55,144 --> 00:12:58,229
Reporters mobbed me.

221
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:00,098
Cameras and shit.

222
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:07,688
My picture's gonna be everywhere, man.

223
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,741
Fuck 'em.

224
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:12,110
They lie without blinking.

225
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:14,612
You know what one of those
dog fuckers said to me once?

226
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:17,615
I'd rather be wrong and first
than right and second.

227
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,952
That tells you
all you need to know.

228
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,456
<i>I read about that actress.</i>

229
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,125
The Black Mountain stuff.

230
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:30,128
Fallujah, Tikrit.
You've seen shit.

231
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,463
After that, anything else
should be a cakewalk.

232
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:36,217
It's actually
just the opposite.

233
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:38,719
Well, you're a war hero
is my outlook.

234
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:41,722
You had a bad night and they
don't need to hear about it.

235
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:52,950
I did everything
they said, man.

236
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:56,237
Army, PD.

237
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:00,825
But it doesn't matter.

238
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:04,829
You do what they say,
it doesn't matter.

239
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:08,249
Ahem.

240
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:15,673
Oh, fuck.

241
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:19,894
Been listening to them
for so fucking long that...

242
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,846
I don't even know
who the fuck I am.

243
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,565
You're a survivor.

244
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,350
Everything else
just dust in your eyes.

245
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,319
Blink it away, man.

246
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:32,190
I don't know.

247
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:34,025
<i>I'll get your stuff.</i>

248
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:37,662
Take it to another hotel,
all right?

249
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:43,201
I just don't know how to be...

250
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:44,869
out in the world, man.

251
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:47,955
Hey, look out that window.

252
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:50,007
Look at me.

253
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,509
Nobody does.

254
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:53,261
<i>Hit that again.</i>

255
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:55,930
<i>We'll get you some Pedialyte.</i>

256
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:02,770
All right,
enough of this monkey fuck.

257
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,419
<i>Place runs strong, huh?</i>

258
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,804
<i>How many beaners you got here?</i>

259
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:40,291
<i>It's like, I think, 200 or so.</i>

260
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:43,194
You need some help
managing this place, Luke.

261
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,029
My view.

262
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:47,848
You need security, collections.

263
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,601
Collections.

264
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:54,872
Frank, you sold the place,
you got the cash.

265
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:57,074
Oh, sure.

266
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:00,027
You own it, no question.

267
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,495
No question.

268
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,233
I'm thinking partnership.

269
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:06,918
30%.

270
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,707
I'm thinking
the next three months,

271
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:16,594
we start pulling in
what this place should.

272
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:17,962
You'll do better.

273
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:20,047
This ain't right, Frank.

274
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:21,799
I'm already paying Chessani.

275
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,634
Place has expenses.

276
00:16:25,304 --> 00:16:27,221
Nobody wants to feel
taken advantage of.

277
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:29,357
I ain't, man.
You set the price.

278
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,108
So long as it's cash, you said.

279
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,984
40%.

280
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:43,321
We're gonna handle
the collections from now on.

281
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:45,740
We'll be knocking
first of the month.

282
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:50,077
And mow the fucking lawn.

283
00:16:50,128 --> 00:16:52,663
I don't want any of these
kids getting snakebit.

284
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,977
<i>You want to give him new
reasons to step on you, huh?</i>

285
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,354
<i>That's the daughter.</i>

286
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,836
Did you know Ben
Caspere, the city manager?

287
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,091
I knew him a little.

288
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,793
<i>He was nice to me.</i>

289
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:40,795
He know your brother very well?

290
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:42,847
<i>I don't think so.</i>

291
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:46,667
Tony wouldn't have much
in common with Mr. Caspere.

292
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,940
Mr. Caspere was talking to someone
on your second phone line a lot.

293
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,893
Think that was
your dad or Tony?

294
00:17:58,163 --> 00:17:59,830
I don't know.

295
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:01,766
How would I know?

296
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,236
There's no rules, you see?

297
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:07,238
It's how it's always been.

298
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,833
Your father's wife,
she's not your mom.

299
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:25,756
My mom died in a
hospital in Nevada.

300
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:32,980
When I was 11, she started
manifesting schizophrenia.

301
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:35,566
She became dangerous.

302
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,569
<i>Daddy had her committed.</i>

303
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:42,073
And that doctor...

304
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:45,743
She hung herself in there.

305
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:54,085
I really don't want
to talk about these things.

306
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:58,005
<i>I don't want to talk</i>
<i>about any of these things.</i>

307
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,625
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:06,380
My mom, she died when I was 12.

309
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:13,304
And your mom,
who was her doctor?

310
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,608
His name's Pitlor.

311
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:23,814
My father,
he is a very bad person.

312
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,158
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be talking to you.

313
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,710
I just--
I have to go.

314
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:24,041
I have this memory of her

315
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,544
in the sand.

316
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:30,931
Her big dresses.

317
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,351
Yeah.

318
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:36,220
Polishing that driftwood

319
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:39,723
till it shined
like steel or something.

320
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:47,364
I lost her in the light.

321
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,834
The light off the water.

322
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:54,738
Why do these memories
stay so vivid

323
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:58,242
when I can't even remember
stuff from last week?

324
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,712
Those moments,
they stare back at you.

325
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:04,582
You don't remember them,

326
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:06,884
they remember you.

327
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,137
Turn around, there they are.

328
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,091
<i>Staring.</i>

329
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:22,316
Maybe I could get one back.

330
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,688
You took her knife.

331
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:29,990
You said you didn't
want anything else.

332
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:37,915
Thena, this Web shit,

333
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:41,001
those outfits, you fall
in with some bad people.

334
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,504
<i>I'm clean. I don't
even drink anymore.</i>

335
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:46,290
I'm saving up to go to CalArts.

336
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,591
I'm not a whore.

337
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,994
<i>It's not like I would</i>
<i>do one of those parties.</i>

338
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:51,345
What parties?

339
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,931
Like the real hooking.
No fucking way.

340
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:56,133
Where are these parties?

341
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,468
I mean, all over.

342
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,604
<i>Up north. But I don't
mess with that.</i>

343
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:03,691
Like I'm saying, two more
months and I'm walking.

344
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:09,980
I should have been
there for you.

345
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:15,653
Babe, you couldn't even
be there for yourself.

346
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:40,477
Look, I know
how we left it, but...

347
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:43,931
Look, I don't
fucking blame you.

348
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:48,569
I ain't easy, I know.

349
00:22:51,523 --> 00:22:53,691
And what you said, I mean...

350
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:58,195
I think you were right.

351
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:00,247
I'm pregnant.

352
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,917
Uh...

353
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,346
Weren't you on the pill?

354
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,681
It's not 100%.

355
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:23,420
Look, you didn't want this.

356
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:27,057
But I don't believe
in abortion.

357
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:34,732
I'm--
I'm keeping it, Paul.

358
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:41,472
I want you to.

359
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:48,912
And I think
we should get married.

360
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,838
I don't want you to do this
because you think

361
00:23:57,889 --> 00:23:58,806
it's the right thing
or something.

362
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,257
I'm not.

363
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,259
I don't.

364
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:06,697
I love you, Em.

365
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:10,267
And I didn't know
and I wasn't sure

366
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:13,103
until just this minute
right here

367
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:15,322
hearing this.

368
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:17,508
I love you.

369
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:25,949
I guess I love you, too.

370
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,871
I...

371
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:43,467
This is the best thing
that could happen.

372
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,571
<i>♪ and I ain't done</i>
<i>nothing wrong, no ♪</i>

373
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:09,660
<i>♪ but I can't find</i>
<i>my way home... ♪</i>

374
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:12,496
Working a case down in LA.

375
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:13,831
Met a man said he knew you.

376
00:25:13,882 --> 00:25:15,632
Said he knew me
when I was little.

377
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:19,636
This psychiatrist,
Irving Pitlor.

378
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:22,840
- Does that ring a bell?
- Pitlor?

379
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:26,310
Ooh, yes.

380
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:28,779
He was around
for a time, early '80s.

381
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:31,482
Researching dynamics
of communal living.

382
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:34,651
Part of Chessani's lodge,
I think.

383
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:37,237
Chessani's lodge?

384
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:38,739
What the fuck?

385
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,190
You knew Chessani, too?

386
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:44,745
I'm sorry, your case,
it involves these men?

387
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:48,365
Theo Chessani, he would have to
be somewhere in his 90s by now.

388
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,868
- His son.
- We have a dead body.

389
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,704
Benjamin Caspere.

390
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:57,040
I recognize him.

391
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:58,542
Never spoke.

392
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:01,044
He attended some seminars
here, I believe.

393
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:02,796
You remember
anything about them?

394
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:05,849
Those times, Chessani, Pitlor?

395
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:11,438
That's Pitlor.

396
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:14,391
Hard to tell, but I think that's
the Vinci mayor as a kid.

397
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:17,060
<i>Jesus, that's some</i>
<i>fucking coincidence.</i>

398
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:21,031
Well, a lot of spiritual movements
cross-pollinated in these parts.

399
00:26:21,065 --> 00:26:24,902
Being that I kept exclusively to
such company, it's not so unusual.

400
00:26:24,904 --> 00:26:27,404
More unusual
is that my daughter

401
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,706
became a sheriff's detective.

402
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:37,714
Oh. Your mother
took this, you know.

403
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:41,585
An old soul

404
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:43,720
right from the start.

405
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:47,758
Excuse me.

406
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,645
You have one of the largest
auras I've ever seen.

407
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,964
<i>Green and black.</i>

408
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:55,732
It's been taking up
this whole room.

409
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:59,403
I just--
I had to say something.

410
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:04,858
You must have had
hundreds of lives.

411
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,245
I don't think I can
handle another one.

412
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:16,119
What do you think
green and black means?

413
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:17,704
I don't know.

414
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:19,673
You're a mood ring?

415
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,134
We're driving to Fresno.

416
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:34,855
It's not that I don't enjoy
our time together, but...

417
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:37,658
When I was in Chessani's house,

418
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:39,893
there were all these
soil readings for Fresno land.

419
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:42,562
GPS shows Caspere
in the same areas.

420
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:57,044
_

421
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:59,496
Now I get why
nobody lives out here.

422
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:03,333
Chessani's map went all the
way to the Lost Coast.

423
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,947
So what is all this?

424
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:20,684
Maybe this is where
the bodies are buried.

425
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,905
<i>It's our biggest
issue in the county.</i>

426
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:27,658
- <i> Mine tailings, runoff.</i>
- Hi there.

427
00:28:27,692 --> 00:28:29,359
<i>We're constantly
finding new contamination.</i>

428
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,996
Like in this area here. A lot of these
mines have been closed for decades.

429
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:35,666
Companies are bankrupt. There's
really no one to do the cleanup.

430
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,585
<i>State doesn't have</i>
<i>the resources.</i>

431
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:42,005
Can you think of any reason why our victim
would visit so many of these sites?

432
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,874
I don't know.

433
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:45,542
Um...

434
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:49,596
Unsafe levels of lead,

435
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,382
cadmium, arsenic,
and/or mercury.

436
00:28:52,384 --> 00:28:54,685
It's contaminated the water
table to such a degree,

437
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,553
the farmland here is useless.

438
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,305
Family farms have been
selling out for years.

439
00:28:58,356 --> 00:29:01,191
Whole county's turning over.
People have just given up.

440
00:29:13,905 --> 00:29:16,073
<i>It's about trust, right?</i>

441
00:29:16,124 --> 00:29:18,041
<i>The people in my industry,</i>

442
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:21,228
<i>they can't even tell when
they're lying half the time.</i>

443
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:23,497
Entitled.

444
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:28,001
Hey, doll.
Look at you.

445
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,471
This place does all right, huh?

446
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:33,256
Six-figure weekends.

447
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:36,226
On paper, you come in
as part owner.

448
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,762
The club's equity guarantees
the land investment.

449
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:40,097
How's the capital multiplied?

450
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,599
In dry farmland
in the middle of the state?

451
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:45,819
The rail puts the land in line for
commercial zoning and development.

452
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:48,739
Fed money means cost overages.

453
00:29:48,773 --> 00:29:51,992
This is the last pork barrel
outside of defense.

454
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:56,830
Ah, man, we were
young once, huh?

455
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,199
I was so focused on my career.

456
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,418
I think things worked
out well for us both.

457
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:06,456
Let me talk to my business
manager, see how liquid I can go.

458
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:08,508
And I wasn't looking for
any land, you understand,

459
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:12,129
but I'll definitely give
it serious consideration.

460
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,269
I wanted to drag my heels,

461
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:21,605
I'd go to a credit union.

462
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,025
You aren't interested,

463
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,943
why'd you take the meeting?

464
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:29,229
Well, this lady asked.

465
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,698
And I am interested.

466
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:34,067
We'll kick the tires, Frank.

467
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:36,787
Trust takes time.

468
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:40,740
Beautiful, you call me.

469
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,426
Lunch.

470
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:48,498
I told you he was a dipshit.

471
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,333
But not too much of one

472
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:53,670
to avoid this colorful
shared history.

473
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,939
I was a kid

474
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:58,925
and he never pulled
anybody's teeth out.

475
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:00,644
This gonna get fucking worse,

476
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:02,729
what I gotta do.

477
00:31:02,763 --> 00:31:04,347
You get that, right?

478
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,316
But just like that,
you're back here.

479
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,352
Have I somehow given you the
impression I've got a choice?

480
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:12,439
Caspere, my fucking
life's savings, Stan.

481
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,826
Congratulations,
we're club owners again.

482
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,777
I'm saying it seems fast.

483
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:21,531
Maybe we should take some time for
ourselves, talk this through.

484
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:23,033
Things move fast now, babe.

485
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:24,584
Someone hit
the fucking warp drive

486
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,086
and I'm trying to navigate
through the blur.

487
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,538
It's moment to
moment and you just wasted my time

488
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,340
on your fairy
producer boyfriend.

489
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:32,425
Your time, is it?

490
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,794
- Your time.
- Mm-hmm.

491
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,346
My boyfriend.

492
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,931
Here's an idea.

493
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:40,684
Let's be one of those
couples that fights a lot.

494
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:42,853
That's a fucking great idea.

495
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:15,919
Yeah.

496
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:18,088
Yeah, this is them.

497
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:20,640
Guy that pawned these,
you got video?

498
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:23,894
It was a girl.
Still got the tape.

499
00:32:32,436 --> 00:32:35,272
Car gets processed,
we might get something.

500
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:37,107
But that was him.

501
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:40,277
And I'd like state to know Velcoro
put himself in harm's way for me.

502
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:43,113
Where's Davis?
I want to talk to her.

503
00:32:43,115 --> 00:32:45,365
Anything you want to tell me?

504
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,751
About you and Velcoro?

505
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:50,003
No. Why?

506
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,472
Detective...

507
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:56,543
Look, honey, there's been
a formal complaint lodged.

508
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:58,762
Sexual misconduct.

509
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:00,013
Against who?

510
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:01,464
You, for Christ's sake.

511
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,600
Wait, what?

512
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:07,938
Deputy Steven Mercer.

513
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:10,807
<i>Conducting a relationship</i>
<i>with a subordinate.</i>

514
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:12,609
<i>That's called coercion.</i>

515
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:14,344
<i>You attended the seminar.</i>

516
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:16,279
Is this for real?

517
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:26,022
You do realize they're all giving
Mercer high fives out there, right?

518
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,709
What I do outside work--

519
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:33,580
This isn't outside work.
This is an IA complaint.

520
00:33:33,631 --> 00:33:35,298
And I was subsequently
made aware

521
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,334
of your relationship
with Detective Ilinca.

522
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:40,170
Oh, for fuck--

523
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:42,172
once.

524
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:44,391
Once.

525
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:46,760
Partners?
I mean...

526
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:49,346
What, you're telling me that's
some kind of first for this place?

527
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,815
Unofficially, admin
doesn't stick its nose in

528
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:54,401
until a situation's created
that disturbs the department.

529
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:57,687
Okay, so if I had married
Mercer, this'd be okay?

530
00:33:57,689 --> 00:34:01,992
Imagine that. You adopting a
position of righteous indignation.

531
00:34:02,026 --> 00:34:03,943
<i>He was your subordinate.</i>

532
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:05,912
<i>That means you had</i>
<i>power over him.</i>

533
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:07,364
<i>County has to investigate.</i>

534
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:09,032
This would not
be happening to a man.

535
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:11,751
If a complain were lodged,
you bet it would.

536
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:13,620
They just wouldn't be able
to use that line.

537
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:15,872
I don't have anything
to apologize for.

538
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:18,174
<i>I'd consider altering that tune</i>

539
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:20,243
<i>before professional</i>
<i>standards talks to you.</i>

540
00:34:20,277 --> 00:34:22,629
And until their
investigation is concluded,

541
00:34:22,713 --> 00:34:24,547
you cannot enter this building.

542
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:28,218
Wait a--

543
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,271
I'm suspended?

544
00:34:31,305 --> 00:34:33,139
<i>Since you got</i>
<i>this state detail,</i>

545
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,808
<i>you'll keep working on that</i>
<i>as a special investigator,</i>

546
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,762
but right now you're on departmental
leave pending investigation.

547
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:46,236
Listen, there's some word

548
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:47,954
you got gambling debts.

549
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:51,491
<i>That comes up, they'll want
to look at your bank records.</i>

550
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,626
I'd straighten
them out if you can.

551
00:34:56,414 --> 00:34:59,165
Does this have anything
to do with that mayor?

552
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:00,917
Vinci? Chessani?

553
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:06,756
Look, I don't care
who you sleep with

554
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:10,143
so long as you find them
outside this department.

555
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,145
Ani, come on.

556
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:13,646
You know as well as I do

557
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:17,183
<i>no grown woman in her right
mind would date a cop.</i>

558
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:24,691
Hey.

559
00:35:24,742 --> 00:35:26,042
You're gonna leave
just like that?

560
00:35:26,077 --> 00:35:27,994
Not allowed in the building.

561
00:35:28,028 --> 00:35:31,081
And it never hit you this might
come back some way you don't like?

562
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:32,365
You talked to them?

563
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:36,453
They asked questions.
And Mercer, really?

564
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:38,872
This has to do with you
and me, doesn't it?

565
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:40,757
Hey, I didn't slap
no complaint on you.

566
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,459
Forget my fucking
busted marriage.

567
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,211
Oh, your marriage
was busted years ago.

568
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:47,931
Or you never would have
been in that hotel.

569
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:50,100
You didn't even
give it a chance.

570
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:54,270
There was no chance.

571
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,306
Fuck!

572
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:58,475
Fuck this, partner.

573
00:35:58,526 --> 00:35:59,893
Fuck off.

574
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:02,562
Fuck off? I've been
a friend to you.

575
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:05,482
With friends like these...

576
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:18,795
Call came in from
an El Monte pawnshop.

577
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:20,630
<i>Irina Rulfo.</i>

578
00:36:20,664 --> 00:36:23,166
<i>Priors-- solicitation,</i>
<i>possession.</i>

579
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:26,085
- Who's your fucking Sherlock now?
- Right.

580
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:28,972
<i>She pawned the stuff
taken from Caspere's house.</i>

581
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:32,008
No history of B&E
or assault, but...

582
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:36,930
Ledo Amarilla.
Priors for assault, B&E,

583
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:38,481
pandering, possession
of a deadly weapon.

584
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,350
We had prints run ASAP.

585
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:43,069
Jewelry came back
with Caspere's,

586
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:46,022
Rulfo's and Amarilla's prints.

587
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,857
This is real?

588
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:51,194
<i>APBs out in Los
Angeles and Ventura County.</i>

589
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:53,279
Our job now is to locate

590
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,998
and arrest
on the charges of murder.

591
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:58,201
Idea, of course, is that chica
was turning tricks with Caspere.

592
00:36:58,203 --> 00:37:00,587
<i>Got a look at how he lived.</i>

593
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:04,174
Ledo and possible accomplices
tortured him for his valuables.

594
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,593
We've got known KAs
for Ledo and Irina listed.

595
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:07,877
Let's check them out.

596
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:10,547
Hit up working girls for anything
about Irina and Caspere.

597
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:22,358
Dixon, follow up with canvass.

598
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:24,611
Split those KAs up
with the other dicks.

599
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:26,396
Woodrugh, work prosts
looking for Irina.

600
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:28,898
Anything come from hookerland?

601
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,367
Tascha was a hooker.
Hasn't been around.

602
00:37:31,402 --> 00:37:34,454
Rumors of elite parties
Caspere might have attended.

603
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:37,407
High-end girls.
That's about it.

604
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:40,076
All right, well, we got
this to focus on anyway.

605
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:52,805
<i>♪ my bed is now ♪</i>

609
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:06,686
His name is Ledo Amarilla.

610
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:09,606
- Mexican.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,108
Guy's a pimp.

612
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,578
Pawnshop has one of his girls
selling Caspere's stuff.

613
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:18,848
So he's pawning shit.

614
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:21,618
May be safe to say
this guy ain't got my money.

615
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,954
Not unless Caspere had it in
a suitcase at his fuck pad.

616
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:30,593
What the fuck would this spic
have to do with Stan?

617
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:32,962
What happened to Stan?

618
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:39,102

00:38:59,157 --> 00:39:02,825
So I'm getting back
into some things.

626
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:05,044
Got my club again.

627
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,996
Some other stuff.

628
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,883
Thought that was behind you.

629
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:13,336
I thought being poor
was behind me, too.

630
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:16,773
That shit never leaves you.

631
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:19,309
Doesn't matter how much
money you make.

632
00:39:22,012 --> 00:39:24,547
I'm enjoying this soberish you

633
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:27,183
where your head doesn't dip
and fall when I talk.

634
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:33,523
Things I got coming, I could
use you in a fuller capacity.

635
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:36,159
Maybe it's time to put
this cop shit to bed.

636
00:39:36,193 --> 00:39:38,094
Come with me.

637
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,831
I'm not muscle, Frank.

638
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:43,700
You're smart.

639
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:46,536
Keep your head out the bottle.

640
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,438
It's just...

641
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:54,043
all your talent's
going to waste.

642
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,296
In the things I'm planning...

643
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,386
black rage goes a long way.

644
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:07,056
A long way to where?

645
00:40:07,107 --> 00:40:10,393
Sometimes your worst self

646
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:12,328
is your best self.

647
00:40:12,363 --> 00:40:14,063
You know what I'm saying?

648
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,211
I wanted to give you this.

649
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:30,797
It's your grandfather's.

650
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,965
I thought you should have it.

651
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,918
You know, remember me with.

652
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,305
Are you going away?

653
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:43,893
Oh...

654
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:51,567
And don't let Mom
or Richard see that.

655
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:54,437
All right?
You hide it.

656
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:57,106
You can look at it when
you want to remember me.

657
00:40:57,108 --> 00:40:58,825
It's Grandpa's.

658
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,860
Yeah, my father,

659
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,162
me, you.

660
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:05,748
Come here.
Come here.

661
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:13,039
Where you come from,

662
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,259
that'll mean something
to you one day.

663
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,128
Okay.

664
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,296
All right.

665
00:41:20,298 --> 00:41:23,049
<i>Chad?</i>

666
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,302
Chad, what are you doing out there?
Come back inside.

667
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,104
Just a minute.

668
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:37,897
<i>Looks like maybe
we got an answer here.</i>

669
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:40,116
Ledo Amarilla.

670
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,567
A pimp.

671
00:41:41,618 --> 00:41:43,536
<i>Some Santa Muerte association.</i>

672
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,322
And this was Mexico?

673
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:47,990
Find this fuck.

674
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:50,076
He owes me a long conversation.

675
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:51,961
Come back with hard targets.

676
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:55,715
You stay.

677
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:05,675
I'm looking
for an outside read,

678
00:42:05,677 --> 00:42:07,760
events, and you go
out of pocket?

679
00:42:07,811 --> 00:42:11,230
You know how I can
get with a girl.

680
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:14,117
Pull myself together and Ivar's
banging on my door about Stan.

681
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:18,437
You and Osip talked a while
when he was at the Soho.

682
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:21,607
When he showed up,
he was pleased to see you.

683
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:23,993
I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.

684
00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:27,163
You tell me entertain
him, I entertain.

685
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:33,870
You got this
Roger Moore thing, huh?

686
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:37,540
Johnny Unflappable.

687
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:41,961
Must be my predilection
for virtue.

688
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:48,384
You know the word louche?

689
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:54,857
Somebody's pulling me
out on the streets

690
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:56,475
and you're louche.

691
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,814
Stay up here.

692
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,234
You're pit boss tonight.

693
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:07,236
What?

694
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:09,539
Frank, come on.

695
00:43:09,573 --> 00:43:11,908
I haven't bossed
in, like, three years.

696
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,626
Maybe get used to it.

697
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,294
Till you show me something.

698
00:43:28,593 --> 00:43:30,092
There's something there.

699
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:31,894
This new generation,

700
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,146
everybody wants to go
straight to the top.

701
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:39,802
Last week Chessani said
somebody wants the poker room.

702
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:42,104
- Who?
- He was vague.

703
00:43:42,106 --> 00:43:45,942
He implied he was choosing sides
now that I'm broke and all.

704
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:53,416
People take chances.

705
00:43:57,754 --> 00:43:59,956
Is this worth sticking out?

706
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,958
We walk away now...

707
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:06,229
what do we walk with?

708
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:50,506
<i>One of Dixon's old CIs
tipped us to Amarilla.</i>

709
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,259
Cousin rents a warehouse off 6th.
That's where they crash.

710
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,429
Dixon's called in surveillance.
Our man just got home.

711
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,899
Now, state can't get us a tactical squad
till later, but we don't want to lose him.

712
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:02,318
You feel all this
manpower is warranted?

713
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:04,854
Better safe
than something else.

714
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:09,492
- All right.
- Let's be careful out there.

715
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,186
<i>Save our transit!</i>

716
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,189
<i>Citizens who
rely on public transit</i>

717
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,693
<i>are protesting a shortage</i>
<i>of bus routes and maintenance</i>

718
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:45,561
<i>in order to subsidize</i>
<i>a rail system</i>

719
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,947
<i>that does not service</i>
<i>their communities.</i>

720
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:51,150
<i>One such area of controversy</i>
<i>is the city of Vinci</i>

721
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:54,987
where opponents argue that the
subway serves no purpose.

722
00:45:55,038 --> 00:45:57,406
All right, you two at the
door with Velcoro and me.

723
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:58,657
Woodrugh and Dixon
will back us.

724
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:00,242
Everybody else
form up a perimeter.

725
00:46:00,244 --> 00:46:02,962
He's still in there. We
might wait for him to exit.

726
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,047
No, bosses said take him.

727
00:46:05,082 --> 00:46:07,216
Let's go.

728
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:27,403
- Cut through. Cover the back.
- Okay.

729
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:39,331
Shit!
Go, go, go!

730
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:40,950
Go, go, move!
Cover!

731
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:43,586
<i>Go, go!</i>

732
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:46,188
Shit!

733
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:51,677
Contact, second floor!

734
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:54,046
<i>We have shots fired...</i>

735
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:03,439
Watch the door.

736
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:29,248
Get it.

737
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:35,221
Go inside now.

738
00:47:38,176 --> 00:47:39,725
Was this a cookhouse?

739
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:49,068
Moving.

740
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:53,272
What the fuck--

741
00:47:53,323 --> 00:47:54,773
Oh, fuck.

742
00:48:04,701 --> 00:48:06,168
Fuck.

743
00:48:06,203 --> 00:48:08,204
Cover?

744
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:24,970
Rog, take the alley.
Cutting through.

745
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:33,395
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Out of the way!

746
00:48:33,397 --> 00:48:35,281
Move, move!
Get down! Get down!

747
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:37,500
<i>Stop! Police!</i>

748
00:48:42,572 --> 00:48:43,906
Locked.

749
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:51,647
Dark SUV southbound
through the alley.

750
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:53,549
Go.

751
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:57,503
Fuck! Fuck!

752
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:08,397
Come on!

753
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:12,935
Fuck!

754
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,833
Oh, fuck!

755
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:30,369
Watch out!

756
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:32,955
Move, move!
Get out of the way!

757
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:47,086
Everybody, get back!

758
00:49:50,707 --> 00:49:52,575
- Get down! Get down!
- Get down on the ground!

759
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:54,443
- Down, now!
- Go! Go!

760
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,896
Oh, shit!

761
00:49:57,948 --> 00:49:59,481
<i>Behind!</i>

Fuck. Fuck.

Damn it.

00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:14,917
<i>Get back!</i>

<i>Stop right there, you pig.</i>

775
