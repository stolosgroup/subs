487
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,716
DISTANT WOMAN:
Cop car, y'all.

488
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:34,386
Just trying to get
some freebies.

489
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,305
DISTANT WOMAN:
I don't do no cops...

490
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:52,143
HART: Hello, ma'am.

491
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:56,049
Martin Hart,
Rustin Cohle-- State CID.

492
00:29:57,451 --> 00:29:59,417
This your place?

493
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:02,086
It's my lease.

494
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,624
What is this, some kind
of hillbilly bunny ranch?

495
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:06,424
WOMAN: Excuse me?

496
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,264
You might want to talk
to Sheriff Bilson

497
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:10,464
'fore you start tossin'
accusations around.

498
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,527
No, I ain't got nothing
against hillbillies.

499
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:15,567
HART: Relax. That's not
why we're here. We, uh,

500
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,537
well, something
happened to a girl,

501
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,208
and we need to know if
any of you knew her.

502
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,686
Yeah. That's Dori.

503
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,254
Somethin' happened?

504
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:35,496
You know about that woman
found outside of Erath?

505
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,599
Oh, no.

506
00:30:39,632 --> 00:30:42,270
WOMAN: Did something
happen to Dori?

507
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,709
HART: Were you pretty good
friends with her?

508
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:51,710
She was nice to me when
I first came around.

509
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:54,680
Gave me tips and stuff.

510
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:58,381
Tips? About what?

511
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,021
Nothin'.

512
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:06,958
You know, just how to be.

513
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,208
You got any idea where she might have
been staying the last few weeks?

514
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,745
I don't.

515
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:21,709
Her ex is in prison.

516
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:25,213
I guess maybe
she got a new place.

517
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:28,182
She'd been going to church.

518
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:32,890
I was hoping maybe she
just turned things around.

519
00:31:34,764 --> 00:31:38,130
We're gonna need to question any
girls might have known her.

520
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:39,595
[Scoffs]

521
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:42,572
That's a tougher ask
than you think.

522
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:45,173
Folks'll be stayin' away,
they hear y'all are out here.

523
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:48,480
Well, ma'am, it's the best
way to get us to leave.

524
00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:50,114
[Sighs]

525
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:54,084
You said she left a bag.

526
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,060
Yeah.

527
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:57,892
Can I see it?

528
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,864
Sure.

529
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:12,306
[Door closes]

530
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,636
That girl's not 18.

531
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:20,941
The sheriff know you got
underage working here?

532
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:24,010
What do you know about
where that girl's been,

533
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,143
where she come from?

534
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,572
You want to know
Beth's situation,

535
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:30,939
'fore she ran out on her uncle?

536
00:32:32,307 --> 00:32:34,274
There are other places
she could go.

537
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:35,841
[Scoffs]

538
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:39,280
Such holy bullshit from you.

539
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:41,785
It's a woman's body, ain't it?

540
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:43,752
A woman's choice.

541
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:46,581
Well, she don't look
like a woman to me.

542
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:49,087
At that age,
she is not equipped

543
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,560
to make those kind of choices.

544
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,556
But I guess you don't give
a shit what kind of damage

545
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:57,596
she's doing to herself, as long
as you're making your money.

546
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:00,134
Girls walk this Earth
all the time

547
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,437
screwin' for free.

548
00:33:02,469 --> 00:33:04,771
Now, why is it you add
business to the mix,

549
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:07,139
and boys like you can't
stand the thought?

550
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:09,109
I'll tell you.

551
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:11,613
It's 'cause suddenly
you don't own it

552
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:14,080
the way you thought you did.

553
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:17,458
[Door opens]

554
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:19,586
COHLE: Ahem.

555
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,796
COHLE: Ma'am, you've both
been very helpful.

556
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:26,468
We'll be in touch.

557
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:29,468
Yes, thank you...

558
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,203
for your help.

559
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:43,979
Do something else.

560
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:58,559
That a down payment?

561
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,893
Is shitting on
any moment of decency

562
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,563
part of your job description?

563
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,064
COHLE: "I closed my eyes
and saw the king

564
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:14,939
in yellow moving
through the forest."

565
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:17,936
This is her diary, Marty.

566
00:34:17,976 --> 00:34:19,943
Believe this shit.

567
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,374
A girl that young.

568
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:25,943
You know the sheriff has got
a stake in this place, too.

569
00:34:25,984 --> 00:34:27,909
Fucking Christ.

570
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,411
"The king's children
were marked.

571
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:34,185
They became his angels."
[Engine turns over]

572
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:42,597
COHLE: The yellow king, Carcosa.

573
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,092
Nut job.

574
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,069
Fried her brain on
whatever she was on.

575
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:51,102
Sounds like she didn't
have much to begin with.

576
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:53,912
Well, it reads like a fantasy.

577
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:58,050
What if he was
dosing her regular,

578
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,556
and over a period of time,
upping the dose

579
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:03,053
little by little
without her knowing it?

580
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:05,928
We should stay out here
today, check around

581
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:07,431
for johns

582
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,599
maybe knew her.

583
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,737
Look at this.

584
00:35:14,674 --> 00:35:16,072
Oh, yeah.

585
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:18,576
Man, a lot of these
type places.

586
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:22,281
Expect the flock
to canvass for 'em.

587
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:24,282
You know, we should go there.

588
00:35:24,315 --> 00:35:26,250
Could be the church
everyone mentioned.

589
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:28,787
Well, let's check around for
johns while we're out here

590
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,487
and pick up the church
on Monday.

591

GILBOUGH VOICE-OVER:
Most of your stuff's still redacted.

592
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:39,558
Now, what's Northshore?

593
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:44,427
Northshore
Psychiatric Hospital,

594
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,899
Lubbock, Texas.

595
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:49,371
I spent 4 months there in '93.

596
00:35:49,404 --> 00:35:52,105
- You feel like talking about that?
- Well, sure.

597
00:35:52,138 --> 00:35:54,671
Who gives a shit?

598
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,880
Sofia... my daughter.

599
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,878
She was on her tricycle

600
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:08,517
in our driveway. Um...

601
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:18,021
We lived down a--
where a little bend in the road, and...

602
00:36:19,957 --> 00:36:22,527
They said that...

603
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,872
Anyway, afterwards, uh,

604
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:32,407
Claire and I turned
on each other, you know?

605
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:36,080
We... we resented each other

606
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:39,216
being alive, you know?

607
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:47,057
I transferred
from robbery to narco.

608
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,067
Started hitting it,
you know, 24/7.

609
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,068
Street rips, knocking down
doors, and within 3 months

610
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,570
I was ripping off couriers
or ending up in a Ramada Inn

611
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:01,108
with a couple
of fuckin' eight-balls.

612
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,246
Oh, yeah.

613
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,180
Somewhere in there,
Claire left,

614
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:11,087
and somewhere in there,

615
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,590
I emptied a 9 into a crankhead

616
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:17,263
for injecting his infant
daughter with crystal.

617
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:21,264
Said he was trying
to purify her.

618
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,472
State attorney gave me one
chance to stay out of jail.

619
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:31,010
He said, "You can keep your profile, but
we want to make you our wild man junkie."

620
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:34,818
So they did. They made me
a floater, like a trick.

621
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:38,877
You know, any agency or department
needed a deep undercover narco,

622
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:40,852
they got me,

623
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:44,787
and there was no fuckin'
expiration date, baby.

624
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,291
And they kept you
out there for 4 years?

625
00:37:47,324 --> 00:37:49,058
[Exhales]
Mm-hmm.

626
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:51,459
And then, February of '93,

627
00:37:51,493 --> 00:37:55,396
I killed 3 cartel men
in Port Houston.

628
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:58,964
I took three 25s
in the side and ended up

629
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:02,974
at Northshore Psychiatric
Hospital in Lubbock, Texas,

630
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:05,975
which is kind of funny
in its own rite--

631
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:08,849
psych ward being
in Lubbock, Texas. Heh!

632
00:38:08,882 --> 00:38:12,923
You ever been there? They
offered me a psych pension.

633
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,923
Jackpot, right?

634
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:16,827
And I said no.

635
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,499
I said, "Put me
on homicide somewhere."

636
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:23,499
By then, I was owed
quite a few favors,

637
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:27,738
and, uh, Louisiana was
what they had.

638
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:36,640
COHLE VOICE-OVER: Yeah, for a long
time after, I-- I didn't really sleep.

639
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:39,608
Nightmares, PTSD,

640
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:42,249
exhausted nerves, whatever.

641
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,947
Yeah.

642
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:19,949
Why homicide?

643
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,088
Oh, something
I saw at Northshore.

644
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:28,223
Quote from Corinthians.

645
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:35,959
"The body is not

00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,938
of being a father.

807
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:50,441
HART: Hey, Cathleen,

808
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:51,873
you little vixen.

809
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:54,852
- [Cathleen giggles]
- Any chance of some coffee?

810
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:56,883
- Of course.
- Okay.

811
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:58,884
Who are these guys?

812
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:02,358
Some assholes Quesada brought in.
Coffee on its way.

813
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:04,230
COHLE: - Hey, morning, Marty.
- Hey.

814
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:07,229
Major's introducing me.
New flying squad.

815
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:10,305
QUESADA: You know Mark
Daughtry, Ted Bertrand.

816
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:11,801
Daughtry.

817
00:49:11,842 --> 00:49:13,305
Ted.

818
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:15,306
- Jimmy Dufrene.
- Jimmy Dufrene.

819
00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:17,241
What's up?

820
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:20,781
BERTRAND: We've been tasked with investigating
crimes with possible occult links.

821
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:23,220
There's been a rash
of animal mutilations,

822
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,683
cemeteries defiled.

823
00:49:24,724 --> 00:49:27,723
- And they want to see what we have
on the Lange case. - Uh-huh.

824
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,755
QUESADA: Well, this task force
is important to the Commander

825
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:31,765
and to the Governor's Office.

826
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:34,765
You know, a lot of people
are concerned about it.

827
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:36,763
You know, me, I don't
see the connection

828
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:39,772
between two dead cats
and a murdered woman.

829
00:49:39,805 --> 00:49:41,973
But then, I'm from Texas.

830
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:43,708
Heh!

831
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:46,011
We're not stepping
on your toes, Marty.

832
00:49:46,044 --> 00:49:48,577
We just got the mandate. We got to
compare notes with what you got.

833
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,711
HART: Yeah.

834
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:51,136
CATHLEEN: - Here you are, Detective.
- No. Oh.

835
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:52,904
- Thanks, Cathleen.
- You got it.

836
00:49:52,944 --> 00:49:55,807
Xerox all you want.

837
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,679
Make you feel like good cops.

838
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:08,688
You two, my office.

839
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,402
QUESADA: Cohle, we got a new rule
around here, especially for you.

840
00:50:14,435 --> 00:50:16,937
You got an opinion
about anything,

841
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,066
you hold on to it.

842
00:50:19,106 --> 00:50:22,075
You hold on to it
or you tell it to Marty.

843
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:25,039
Otherwise, button
your big, fat mouth.

844
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:28,177
However smart you are, you're
not as smart as you think.

845
00:50:28,211 --> 00:50:30,179
Be serious, boss.

846
00:50:30,218 --> 00:50:33,112
This God-bothering shit.

847
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:35,689
It's a political circle-jerk.
You know this.

848
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:37,655
Is this a place you live?

849
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,149
Where are you, huh?

850
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,524
You had anything in the last weeks?
You got a suspect?

851
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:44,691
Give us some more guys

852
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:46,889
to follow up KAs,
track records.

853
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:50,558
No, our bosses don't want you
at all, you understand?

854
00:50:50,592 --> 00:50:52,422
I don't want you.

855
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:56,093
You are upright only by the
grace of this man's reputation.

856
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:57,662
Goddamn, Cohle.

857
00:50:57,695 --> 00:51:01,398
How many ways are there for me
to say, "Shut the fuck up"?

858
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:06,637
I mean, we work
under command, right?

859
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:11,213
Now, our betters want a public,
high-profile show of response.

860
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:13,140
Shit, I got a state senator,

861
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:16,317
he's trying to label Satanic
graffiti as a hate crime.

862
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:19,884
That has nothing to do with our
DB, and that's the fact of it.

863
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:21,387
Okay, okay. Fine.

864
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,554
Let's say that's true,
all right?

865
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:26,554
Let's say that you guys get
the case all to yourselves.

866
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:30,362
You ever solve a murder, been in
the red more than a week?

867
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:33,864
You ever clear one where two rounds of
questions didn't hand you the fucking answer?

868
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:36,960
HART: - Oh, come on--
- No, no, you got leads, you got a timeline.

869
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:39,002
You know what I got?
I got a whodunit

870
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,938
where my two detectives
are stalling,

871
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:44,642
and I got a brand-new task force
wants to take it off our hands.

872
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:45,810
We have a lead--

873
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:48,074
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Fuck off, Cohle.

874
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,619
[Quesada sighs]

875
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:53,619
Christ.

876
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,820
It's your call.

877
00:51:57,188 --> 00:51:59,289
You want to dump this one off?

878
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:01,752
You know, I'd think about it,
given the spotlight.

879
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:05,455
You know, Teddy Bertrand's a good detective.
You know him.

880
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,633
Well, you're a smart-ass
with your mouth shut.

881
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:13,601
I was just gonna say

882
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:15,600
we've got a lead on a church.

883
00:52:15,641 --> 00:52:18,104
Our vic was spending
a lot of time there.

884
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:20,944
That's where we were headed.
It could be the break we need.

885
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:23,948
Inside, whatever they're
putting over you,

886
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:26,516
how much more time
could you get us?

887
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:28,955
Right now, it's up
for discussion, but,

888
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:30,955
you know, Tuttle's lighting
a fire under this.

889
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:33,996
Without a suspect,
they're just gonna

890
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:36,996
stop asking questions, Marty,
and they're gonna give orders.

891
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,499
That's that.

892
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:40,996
Give us the rest of the month

893
00:52:41,037 --> 00:52:43,003
before they lump it
into whatever

894
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:46,034
the play is with
the task force, yeah?

895
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,445
I'll try.

896
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:53,475
Two weeks, and then you two
start catching again.

897
00:52:53,516 --> 00:52:54,948
Yeah.

How Cohle worked it,
especially.

904
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:18,140
Which indicates you think
I'm too thick to realize

00:53:18,173 --> 00:53:21,244
that y'all are trying
to jam somebody up.

You're on to something new.
