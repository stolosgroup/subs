1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,980
- I know what he did.
- Who?

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,910
The man on TV acting like my father!

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,450
Something you wanna
tell us, Mr. Purcell?

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,640
- Did you give her to somebody, Tom?
- What?

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,180
Was she trying to get away from you?

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,500
After everything you know,

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,120
you think I could do
something like that?

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,820
You ain't the only ones
looking for Julie.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,040
There are people trying to make sure

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,900
that none of your questions
can ever be answered.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,400
Harris James. He was one of the officers

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,940
who processed the Woodard scene.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,370
He disappeared during
the 1990 investigation.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,550
Chief security officer.

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,240
- You took the job May '81?
- That's right.

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,160
We're backtracking the Purcell case.

17
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:41,249
Got it down you were the
one who spotted the bag.

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,720
What about your book?

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,760
You got some idea where she's at.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,500
You just makin' your money
and milkin' they pain.

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,380
- Where's my daughter?
- I don't know!

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,410
That's all I was gonna
give the cops. A name.

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,900
Julie?

24
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,530

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,880
Here we are.

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,410
First day of school all over again.

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,440
I don't want you to go.

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,910
I don't wanna go.

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,820
But I'm doin' it anyway.

30
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,833
What I'm gonna do without you?

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,420
You're a tough guy. You'll be fine.

32
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,750
You don't know that.

33
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,875
Dad, come on. Let's get me moved in.

34
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,660
You'll feel better once you're
liftin' something heavy.

35
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Boy, you got my number.

36
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,280
Since I was two.

37
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,320
_

38
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,990
Why didn't you call?

39
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,625
I left you messages.

40
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,420
Wayne, there was a man at my reading,

41
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,680
- and he...
- Where are the kids?

42
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,290
In their rooms. Henry's on Nintendo.

43
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,900
But there was this man at my reading.

44
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,410
He was a black man with one eye.

45
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,120
You saw a man with one eye?

46
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,999
He was aggressive
and... and rude, and...

47
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:33,333
and he was asking if I
knew where Julie was now.

48
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,416
Wayne, I think he was the
guy from back in '80.

49
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,780
The one y'all were looking for.
The one who bought the dolls.

50
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,291
You didn't get a name? Any
other way to find him?

51
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,880
No...

52
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,291
but he's out there, and
he's looking for her.

53
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,120
I think he's the reason
that she ran away.

54
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,792
Tom Purcell killed himself.

55
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,416
What?

56
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,333
How?

57
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,792
Blew his brains out.

58
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,625
After Roland and I went at him.

59
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,625
Why'd you do that?

60
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,920
Did you ever think it was possible

61
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,700
Tom didn't commit suicide?

62
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,875
That was the M.E.'s call.

63
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,200
Man had plenty of reasons for
doing somethin' like that.

64
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,039
The ME's report noted
a swollen contusion

65
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,219
at the base of his skull,

66
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,420
as if he'd been struck there.

67
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,440
His skull was blown apart.

68
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,520
The whole thing was one big contusion.

69
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,300
We had an independent
M.E. evaluate the report.

70
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,480
She said the gunshot wouldn't account

71
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,450
for a particular bruise and blood clot.

72
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,667
You're suggestin' that
somebody brought him up there,

73
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,940
unconscious... then did him in that way?

74
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,160
In any case, it effectively
ended the second investigation.

75
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:01,541
It's like 1980, isn't it?

76
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,416
A sudden act of violence,

77
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,500
a dead man, and the case is closed.

78
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,041
Guess I never thought of it that way.

79
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,120
It's like 1980 again. They gonna
hang it on a dead suspect.

80
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,700
Suspect?

81
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,041
That was us, man.

82
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,083
We did that.

83
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,333
Drove him to it.

84
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,790
We didn't make that phone call.

85
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:37,667
We did our job.

86
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,580
If we hadn't, someone else would've.

87
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,208
And you said it.

88
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,500
They woulda eaten him alive.

89
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,990
We need to keep goin'.

90
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,480
The missin' prints,
the man with one eye.

91
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
- What Dan was sayin'.
- Take a fuckin' minute.

92
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,083
A good man's dead 'cause we pushed him.

93
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,700
Knowin' we didn't like him for it,

94
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
seein' how he was takin' it.

95
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,830
You sure that's what happened?

96
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,280
You figure Tom for a typist,

97
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,750
write a little three-line
note like that?

98
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,166
You ain't worked a case in 10 years.

99
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,124
Fuck's sake, Purple.

100
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,166
What do you think this is about?

101
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,120
Why do you think I pulled you in here?

102
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,800
To find a girl and solve what happened.

103
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,080
You don't think there's
better detectives around?

104
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,180
Hey,

105
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,291
we find the girl, great.

106
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,291
We clear it, great.

107
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,000
But how often's that happen,

108
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,580
10-year-old case?

109
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:36,166
This was me helpin' you
get your career back.

110
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,699
Ya understand? It was a favor I did.

111
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,720
'Cause I'm such a hard-luck case.

112
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,580
Keep talkin'.

113
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,500
Keep talkin'.

114
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,333
Gonna put you back on
public information...

115
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,958
or highway cleanup for
the next 10 years.

116
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,750
How'd that be? Huh?

117
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,041
Roland... we need to keep goin'.

118
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,080
If it wasn't Tom,

119
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,020
- don't let 'em...
- What do we got?

120
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,179
You wanna go back lookin' for any

121
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,900
one-eyed black man in Arkansas?

122
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,625
For what? 'Cause your wife saw one?

123
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,720
It's somethin'.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,990
- And we got other evidence...
- Stop.

125
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,440
Let go. This is our job.

126
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,917
It ain't here to make you right.

127
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,124
It's not the place you
work out your shit.

128
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,500
You been drinkin' this mornin'?

129
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,330
Fuck you, Wayne.

130
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,060
Tom. What's doin'?

131
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,833
I'm gettin' the fuck outta this place.

132
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,833
Lucy's gone, and Julie's...

133
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,999
Yeah, Julie's...

134
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,166
Ya know, I thought if...

135
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,833
if there was a chance, but...

136
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,541
y'all say she's dead.

137
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,249
So I'm gettin' lost.

138
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,708
What do you aim to do?

139
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,041
Whatever it takes to stop feelin'.

140
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,958
I mean, there's no point.

141
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,620
Ain't nobody left to feel anything for.

142
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,040
I don't think those children'd
want you hurtin' yourself, Tom.

143
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,880
No. No, they don't want
anything at all now.

144
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,208
How could I get hurt worse?

145
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,750
Ain't nothing could happen to
me that wouldn't be a relief.

146
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,910
Where ya goin'?

147
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,160
Nowhere.

148
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,041
I'm gonna need you to move your car.

149
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,950
I don't feel quite right about that.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,160
Well, I ain't your orphan, Detective.

151
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,200
Let me go out.

152
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,660
I'm gonna give you my
personal number here too.

153
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,120
You get into trouble out there...

154
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,541
you get jammed up...

155
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,416
you use it.

156
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,540
Hey.

157
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,249
You don't need my help.

158
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,580
But the day may come...

159
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,416
and if it does, you got it.

160
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,166
I make these for Decoration Day.

161
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:44,833
This one's for Tom.

162
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,166
I don't understand why
he would do that now.

163
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,792
He got through so much.

164
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,700
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?

165
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,370
Really?

166
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,541
Well, you being her best friend...

167
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,708
did you ever know Lucy
to have an acquaintance,

168
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,000
a black man with one eye?

169
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,240
No.

170
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,416
I mean...

171
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,917
there were other men,

172
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,291
but I never knew her to...

173
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,583
well, you know, not... a black man.

174
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,780
What are you drivin' at?

175
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,708
It seems... it looks like...

176
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:39,333
this man with one eye gave Julie a doll

177
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,249
at Halloween in 1980.

178
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,480
And there's some thought that he
might've been the one to take her.

179
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,040
I-I don't know anythin' about that.

180
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,520
You say Halloween?

181
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,140
Hold on.

182
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,369
All right.

183
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,625
See now, these were developed

184
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,416
after what happened.

185
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,780
Look, I took their picture
when they came by.

186
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,375
Do you know who these people are?

187
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,208
The two ghosts?

188
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,500
No, I don't think so, nuh-uh.

189
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:37,480
The farmer back then... he said he saw

190
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,270
a mixed-race couple a few times

191
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,480
near his house, on the
other side of Devil's Den.

192
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,999
Could I borrow this picture?

193
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
No, I... I'd rather that
you didn't. That's mine.

194
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,208
Just to make a copy. I could
bring it right back to you.

195
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,740
I would rather that... that you didn't.

196
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,500
Hey.

197
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,540
If I let you borrow this
picture, you'll come back?

198
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,020
Tomorrow?

199
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,200
Yes, I will. Tomorrow.

200
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,060
Do you ever think about moving to town?

201
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,420
Why would I?

202
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,625
Somebody's got to stay.

203
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,833
Somebody's got to remember.

204
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,740
There was talk initially

205
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,060
that your wife was writing a
sequel to her first book.

206
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,625
She eventually decided not to do that.

207
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,249
She had other stories to write.

208
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,079
Were you sharing information with her

209
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,420
during the second investigation?

210
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,540
Just the way a husband and wife talk...

211
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,375
tell each other what's...

212
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,720
- Hey, Henry.
- How you doin', Mr. West?

213
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,950
... what's goin' on in their lives.

214
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,625
Did any of her research
suggest a larger conspiracy?

215
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,360
Like a cover-up?

216
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,208
I don't think so.

217
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,041
Do you have evidence of
somethin' like that?

218
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,291
- What do you got?
- Car's in the lot.

219
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,416
A '78 Mercury Capri.

220
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,875
Missouri, Echo-Echo-Oscar 6-7-9.

221
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,833
- You talk to the clerk?
- Mm-mm.

222
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:02,500
Paid up through the week.

223
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,800
Anybody come around
askin' about this guy?

224
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,410
Just you two.

225
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:16,708
Stay here.

226
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,249
Dan?

227
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,875
You hear anything? See somethin'?

228
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,208
No. Nothin'.

229
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,833
You work last night?

230
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,640
Who else mans the desk?

231
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,880
I worked the last two
nights. Wife covers.

232
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,059
Can talk to her if you want.

233
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,040
I think she would've mentioned it.

234
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Shows up... says Lucy was murdered.

235
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,958
Seemed to clear Tom.

236
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,900
Actin' real paranoid.

237
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,416
"There's people out there don't
want you to know what I know."

238
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,560
So he's right to be paranoid.

239
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,792
Unless he just took off.

240
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,166
I can't see him leavin' the
car, stagin' that scene.

241
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,708
We fuckin' lost him. We're burned.

242
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,660
After being confronted with new
evidence alleging his guilt,

243
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,875
and his children's
disappearance and death,

244
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,550
Tom Purcell committed suicide

245
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,240
at the scene of the original crime.

246
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,760
He left a note which could be
interpreted as a confession.

247
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,240
We are at this time

248
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,870
willing to overturn the
absentia conviction

249
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,291
of Brett Woodard.

250
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,333
Sir...

251
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,041
I saw that live.

252
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:55,520
You weren't satisfied

253
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,750
with the AG's conclusions, were you?

254
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,500
No.

255
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,100
But I've never been satisfied
with any part of the case.

256
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,249
Good morning.

257
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,041
You trying to impress me?

258
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,458
I'm only doin' my half.

259
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,750
I ain't bein' funny.

260
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,291
You gotta do your own.

261
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,458
Yeah, no complaints.

262
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,249
I'm just happy you're not
looking for a mother.

263
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,200
Workin' on somethin'?

264
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,792
Eh, just playing around.

265
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,375
'Bout the case?

266
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,416
What kind of thing you writin'?

267
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,360
An article... maybe.

268
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,370
I'm not sure.

269
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,500
For the paper?

270
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,958
Maybe a magazine.

271
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,750
I don't know.

272
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,500
You ever read "In Cold Blood"?

273
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,917
Is that Batman or the Silver Surfer?

274
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,208
I have my seniors read it.

275
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,541
I'm thinking about
writing about the crime,

276
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,083
but more about the community.

277
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,999
Writing's a pain.

278
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,833
You scratched out half
of what you wrote.

279
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,020
Why you bother?

280
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,083
I feel I have a voice.

281
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:36,583
You think I went to
college for four years

282
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,249
to be like my mother?

283
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,080
You should write about it.

284
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,950
Really?

285
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,260
Well, you're a hunk of surprises.

286
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,541
It's not like the 6:00
news is gonna do it.

287
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,780
Somebody oughta point out what
they're sayin' doesn't fuckin' hold.

288
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:03,500
You think it's a conflict of interest?

289
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:08,500
Us doing this, and me
writing about that?

290
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,541
People oughta know they closed it
'cause they wanted it closed...

291
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,333
it's not solved.

292
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,541
Wouldn't that hurt you? Your job?

293
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,120
I don't want you getting in trouble.

294
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,570
Fuck 'em. They don't wanna do it right,

295
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,999
it's not a job worth havin'.

296
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,208
Could tell you all kinda shit.

297
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,708
Thought you were just
gonna do your half.

298
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,541
Me and my goddamn work ethic.

299
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,800
Did you know that even after Tom died,

300
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,870
there was a man going
around looking for Julie,

301
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,500
asking about her?

302
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,100
A black man?

303
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,260
No.

304
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,279
This man was missing an eye.

305
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,980
One witness said he identified
himself as "Watts."

306
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,375
Watts.

307
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,958
Our thought was this man was a procurer.

308
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,875
Possibly the person Julie ran away from.

309
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,166
Procurer?

310
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,260
For what?

311
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,291
They came to me, you know.

312
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,083
I said fuck off.

313
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,060
I told your daddy he
shouldn't be doin' this.

314
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,208
Could be dangerous.

315
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,792
Dangerous how?

316
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,333
Look, I ain't tryin' to rat
on the man or nothin'.

317
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,960
You know what he does at night?

318
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,870
I know last week he ended up on
Shoepick Lane, 3:00 in the mornin'...

319
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,740
couldn't say what he was doin' there.

320
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,740
He sits in your mama's old office

321
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,999
goin' through her book, her old files.

322
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,140
Yeah, I got that impression.

323
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,917
Well, he's doin' it with a
loaded gun on his desk.

324
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,320
Keeps it near at hand.

325
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,960
Dolls are used as signifiers

326
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,040
in the human trafficking underground.

327
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,500
Like this blue spiral...
it's code for pedophiles.

328
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,450
In 2012, two former Louisiana state
police stopped a serial killer

329
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,600
associated with some
kind of pedophile ring.

330
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,830
Despite evidence of accomplices,
the case never went wider.

331
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,667
Think I read about that.

332
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,920
So what are you sayin'?

333
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,750
Hmm?

334
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,708
I think at this point... I
deserve an explanation, Miss.

335
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,240
What do you say happened?

336
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,960
Never a moment of doubt in that man,

337
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,208
right?

338
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:53,124
Watchin' him like this, I...

339
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,166
I can't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

340
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,440
He needs somebody stayin' with him,

341
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,660
watchin' out for him.

342
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,060
I think what happened
to the Purcell children

343
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,200
was connected to a similar group.

344
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,360
I think one or both of their
parents sold them off...

345
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,330
probably with the cousin's help.

346
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,500
That's why they're all gone.

347
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,917
Vanished, killed, kept silent.

348
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,500
Hmm.

349
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,792
These groups, they take runaways.

350
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,140
Kids in orphanages. Outright kidnapping.

351
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,410
And wider investigations are
consistently curtailed.

352
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,420
In both the Louisiana
and Nebraska cases,

353
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,960
high-level politicians and
businessmen were implicated.

354
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,840
People with the power to
make these things go away.

355
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,360
You were transferred off Major
Crimes after the '80 investigation.

356
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,708
In 1990, you left the force.

357
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,460
You saw nothing that suggested
obfuscation from higher quarters?

358
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,917
No evidence ignored?

359
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,375
No forced conclusions?

360
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:06,166
Bein' police... there's no certainty.

361
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:09,041
Lot of the time, there's
no clarity at all.

362
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:13,917
You just do your best, and...

363
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:16,458
learn to live with ambiguity.

364
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,416
I have to say I'm disappointed.

365
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,000
I most wanted to talk to you
because your record indicated

366
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,900
you never went along with
the official version.

367
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,830
I've been hoping you'd
provide a missing piece.

368
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,440
Young lady...

369
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,240
my whole brain's a
buncha missin' pieces.

370
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,875
I'm sorry...

371
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,833
this is what you've been
leadin' to the whole time.

372
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:02,333
I don't got answers for you, Miss.

373
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,875
I wish I did, but I don't.

374
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:06,999
Mr. Hays, please...

375
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:10,124
can we consider this, what I've said?

376
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,980
No, ma'am.

377
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,958
You'll excuse me.

378
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,792
I'm tired of walkin'
through the graveyard.

379
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,667
The story's over for me.

380
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,990
Hey.

381
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,583
"Watts," she said.

382
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,750
The one-eyed man.

383
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,416
You heard that?

384
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,999
Write it down 'fore I forget. Watts.

385
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,750
I'm sorry, man,

386
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,440
but you think your wife
would want this for you?

387
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,160
What's happenin' with you?

388
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,541
She wants me to finish it.

389
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,667
How's that?

390
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,333
Watts.

391
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,583
Don't forget, 'cause I will.

392
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,880
Detective Hays, Nevada Bell faxed

393
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,700
the phone records that you requested.

394
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,660
Three weeks in '88.

395
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,917
Thank you, Officer.

396
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,780
OK, kids, let's get in the car.

397
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,180
What?

398
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,940
Your dad was supposed to watch you.

399
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,700
- It's a school night.
- Come on, shoes on!

400
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,520
Need y'all to take a ride with me.

401
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah, hi.

402
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:02,124
Lieutenant Roland West.

403
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,920
Arkansas State Police, badge 4-5-7.

404
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,180
I need flight records,

405
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,420
private airfields, passenger records.

406
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,833
Every flight into
McCarran International,

407
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,140
these dates, uh...

408
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,875
Yeah, I'll hold.

409
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,833
I was wondering, when Lucy worked here,

410
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:34,792
she get a lot of visitors? Men?

411
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,140
Yeah, you could say that.

412
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,580
Most guys came here
tried to chat her up.

413
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,320
Good for business.

414
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,400
I was curious,

415
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,999
you ever see a couple
in here talking to her?

416
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,999
Black man, white woman.

417
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,958
I don't think so, not that I recall.

418
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,458
How about just a black man?

419
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,160
He'd' have been missing an eye.

420
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,740
White, no pupil.

421
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,940
Now, that...

422
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,900
It just occurred to me.

423
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,416
I never seen her with him,

424
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,583
but I remember her
brother or cousin, um...

425
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,900
- Dan O'Brien.
- Dan, yeah.

426
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,958
Him I seen once talkin'
to a fella like that.

427
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Black fella missing an eye.

428
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,750
Ohh.

429
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,639
Oh, great. 'Cause we don't
see each other enough.

430
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,950
- You need to look at this.
- Why?

431
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,875
I got the whole thing.

432
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,830
That phone number.

433
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,220
Called eight times in one night.

434
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:59,999
Less than two days before Lucy OD'ed.

435
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,640
Her room... unpaid on her bill.

436
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,540
- OK.
- Belongs to this address.

437
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,760
Place is owned by the Ozark Trust.

438
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,040
Dug through a bunch of private records.

439
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,208
It's the Hoyt Corporation.

440
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,958
Security.

441
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,420
Harris James' personal line.

442
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,124
Huh.

443
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,792
This is the passenger manifest
on the FAC out of Tulsa.

444
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,416
First-class passenger to Vegas.

445
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,820
This is it.

446
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,180
Harris James flew to Vegas
the day before Lucy died.

447
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,160
Came back the day after.

448
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:44,840
So you wanna bring this to Blevins?

449
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,830
No, goddamnit.

450
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:49,875
What would they do, 'cept
shove it in a file

451
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,060
and stuff me in another basement?

452
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,620
They planted the evidence
at Woodard's, man.

453
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,659
Probably took the
fingerprints from the toys

454
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,480
in the woods before he left the force.

455
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,640
Roland.

456
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,160
So what do you think we
can do with this, Wayne?

457
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,870
We can go and ask him what the
fuck he was doin' in Vegas.

458
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,960
And we ask hard, man, like we used to.

459
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:15,249
Have to do with Hoyt, don't you think?

460
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,620
Harris gettin' that job?

461
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,760
If it had to do with his boss,
we can get him to roll.

462
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,875
No. We can't.

463
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,460
We can bring it in. That's all there is.

464
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,400
We can't do somethin' like that.

465
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,540
He doesn't talk, we'd be fucked forever.

466
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:52,333
And I get what you did here. It's good.

467
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:55,541
But all we can do is make our case.

468
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,260
I'm thinkin' about Tom.

469
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,160
Thinkin' about that note.

470
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,440
You see him wantin' to
be with Lucy again?

471
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,540
You see him typin' it?

472
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:20,917
We gotta do this for Tom.

473
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,583
And what if James won't talk?

474
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,083
We get enough on him, he'll break.

475
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,540
Get him out to that barn...

476
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,960
he'll break.

477
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,580
If we...

478
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:43,833
If you feel like you let Tom down,

479
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,760
this is how you make it right, Roland.

480
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:48,166
Don't let it slide.

481
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,917
Don't let them put this on him.

482
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,840
This is how we do right by Tom.

483
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,500
You can stop sayin' that now.

484
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,790
I'm not simple.

485
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,166
1955 to 1985.

486
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,833
I was kitchen maid, then housekeeper.

487
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,540
Long time with the Hoyts.

488
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,460
Why y'all still police at your age?

489
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,500
Just didn't want to retire.

490
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,160
Couldn't imagine what
I'd do with myself.

491
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,917
And we ain't good for much else.

492
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:32,541
Hmm.

493
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,750
So, how can I help you?

494
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,220
What was it, about the Hoyts?

495
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,330
We're lookin' at some old stuff.

496
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:42,958
You ever know a man named Harris James,

497
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,458
worked for the Hoyts?

498
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,208
Seen him more than known him.

499
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,416
He came on in my last years there.

500
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,999
He ran security for Mr. Hoyt.

501
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,375
Lotta tragedy in that family.

502
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:58,583
Wondered what you could
tell us about 'em.

503
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,833
That family had no luck.

504
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,999
'Cept in business.

505
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,820
I helped raise Miss Isabel.

506
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,583
Isabel, the daughter.

507
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:11,041
She had her own family, right?

508
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,740
Like I said, no luck.

509
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:19,083
Her husband and little girl passed on.

510
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,333
Bad wreck, '77.

511
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,180
She was...

512
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,160
troubled.

513
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,667
Never left the estate.

514
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,200
Then one night,

515
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,080
she took a car out,

516
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:38,124
put it through a guardrail.

517
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:41,124
Caused a big accident.

518
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:45,500
After that, Mr. June watched over her.

519
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,520
He'd drive her... whatever she needed.

520
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,200
Mr. June? Who was that?

521
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,830
He was pretty close with
Mr. Hoyt. Black gentleman.

522
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:57,958
Stayed in the main house.

523
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,583
Basement level.

524
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,792
Whole part of the house for Miss Isabel,

525
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:06,541
with Mr. June the only
one could go down here.

526
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:10,667
You know his first name, Mr. June?

527
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,917
I'm not sure was "June," his last name.

528
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,124
We just called him Mr. June.

529
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,440
There wasn't much talk

530
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,369
'tween him and us others.

531
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,119
You know if he's still around?

532
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,600
Mm-mm.

533
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,750
How 'bout a description?
Anything you noticed about him?

534
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,792
Just his eye.

535
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:35,124
His left eye was white. Dead, you know.

536
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,240
How about a man named Watts?

537
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,520
Can I go swimming down
by the river with Lisa?

538
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:48,875
Becca.

539
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,833
You're all packed?

540
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,375
No, man. Shh.

541
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,958
Hey, just look at me.

542
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,940
I'm drivin' her to school.

543
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,958
Later, yeah. Sure.

544
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,600
Why'd you leave?

545
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,540
'Round '81,

546
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,700
they started restricting
where we could go.

547
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:14,124
Had to stay in the kitchen
or foyer, in the main house.

548
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,560
Miss Isabel,

549
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,040
I don't know what was happenin',

550
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,291
but I think she was gettin' worse.

551
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,166
Where you at?

552
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,583
Are you all right?

553
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,667
I shouldn'ta said that.

554
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,958
About Tom. I'm sorry.

555
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,917
What about Tom?

556
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:43,875
Gettin' you to go after Harris,

557
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,166
tryin' to make you do what I wanted.

558
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,040
I shouldn'ta done that.

559
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,600
I just...

560
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,041
What happened, I...

561
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,880
I didn't realize how different we were.

562
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,667
Hope we can move past it.

563
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,541
We're past it, bro.

564
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,060
Come on.

565
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,120
That's him.

566
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,420
Lieutenant West.

567
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,917
You doin' traffic stops now?

568
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:11,667
Step out of the car, sir.

569
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,958
Everything all right?

570
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,100
You got a dark look, Lieutenant.

571
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,458
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

572
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,740
Yes... Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

573
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,416
Uh... What seems to be the problem? I...

574
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,083
Refusin' to comply?

575
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,559
You're refusin' to comply.

576
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,300
Wait, just... just what
are we doin' here?

577
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,120
You... need to talk or somethin',

578
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,820
we can always do that at the office.

579
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,440
Yours or mine.

580
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:40,249
You seem real upset, sir.

581
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,580
Oh. You reachin' for this?

582
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,350
No, sir, I was not.

583
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,667
Step out of the car!

584
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,470
I'd like to know what's goin' on.

585
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,540
- You both seem real angry.
- Get out, motherfucker!

586
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,041
Come on! Son of a bitch!

587
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,875
Get out, motherfucker!

588
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,290
What, then?

589
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,820
Get on with it.

590
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,083
You don't want to be givin' orders.

591
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,458
Lucy called the Hoyt Corporation...

592
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:31,375
eight times, the day before she OD'ed.

593
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,770
We got you comin' into Vegas

594
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,958
for two days when she died.

595
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,859
You put that fuckin' backpack

596
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,220
and dress in Woodard's
way back, didn't ya?

597
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,570
And you were goin' around
re-interviewin' witnesses,

598
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,340
see if anybody saw anything?

599
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:51,833
You gave Lucy a hot-shot.

600
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,670
Well, that's some wild storytellin'.

601
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,083
I do not know what you're talkin' about.

602
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,160
Ohh! Oh, God!

603
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:02,750
What happened to the kids in '80?

604
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,124
You tell me. You're the detectives.

605
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,330
Goddamnit!

606
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,620
Stop hittin' me!

607
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,080
Fuck!

608
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,500
Lucy wanted what... money?

609
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,260
What'd she say, you flew
out there and killed her?

610
00:42:19,124 --> 00:42:22,875
Dan O'Brien said somethin' about, uh...

611
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,792
people who don't renegotiate.

612
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,600
You's who he was worried about, huh?

613
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,440
- You found him.
- Let me tell you both somethin'.

614
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,160
Them two, the mother and her cousin...

615
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:39,083
they ain't people you should worry on.

616
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,420
I mean, what's this for?

617
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,375
Y'all can't give a
shit about that trash.

618
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,000
My friend's dead.

619
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,819
The kids.

620
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,420
I got kids.

621
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,040
I wouldn't ever... I would...

622
00:42:51,124 --> 00:42:54,625
I would never hurt a child. Oh, God.

623
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:59,249
Somethin's wrong inside.
You... busted me up, man.

624
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,291
Tell us what happened.

625
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,625
The whole story.

626
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,667
The kids were meetin' somebody
in the woods, regular.

627
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,416
That's who took 'em.

628
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,416
Maybe the mother's
involved, maybe O'Brien.

629
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,416
But you planted the evidence in '80.

630
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,800
And you took the
fingerprints outta evidence.

631
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,958
All for Hoyt, we figure.

632
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,708
He got somethin' for kids?

633
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,083
Maybe there was a group of 'em.

634
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,416
Friends of his.

635
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,040
People into kids.

636
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,480
You two are really up shit creek, huh?

637
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,740
Uhh! Uhh!

638
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,833
Oh, God.

639
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,100
I'm hurt.

640
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,450
I...

641
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,999
I can only tell you what I know.

642
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,124
But...

643
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:58,749
I gotta know I'm walkin' outta here.

644
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,800
You'll be alive, any rate.

645
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,720
Take these...

646
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,240
I can't feel my fuckin' hands, man.

647
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:13,166
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

648
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,875
You kicked my ribs to pieces, man.

649
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,000
I feel it stabbin' my lung.

650
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,990
Oh, God. Jesus.

651
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,249
How hard you kick him?

652
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,100
- Listen...
- Fuck you.

653
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,708
Fuck you for this.

654
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,880
He didn't give us a choice.

655
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,160
And I was right. You seen it. He knew.

656
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,917
Nah, you were talkin' shit about Tom.

657
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,800
Gettin' me to go along with
this. Gettin' your way.

658
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,600
Hold up. You're a grown-ass man.

659
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,820
I didn't force you to do anything.

660
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,550
I just killed a man, you dumb asshole!

661
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:04,416
Now it's all gone! Done!
Whatever he knew, gone!

662
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,166
- You fucked my life!
- We did it, Roland!

663
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:09,458
You manipulative, egotistical,

664
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,166
uppity fuckin'...

665
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,080
What?

666
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,708
Huh?

667
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:17,980
What you gonna say?

668
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,960
Guess what word's runnin'
through my mind right now.

669
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,458
Say it, then.

670
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,060
Say it, motherfucker.

671
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,580
No.

672
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,440
I just want you to know I'm thinkin' it.

673
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,560
Harris was Highway Patrol,

674
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:51,160
Zone 4, back in '77.

675
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,740
That puts him in the
area where the maid said

676
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,833
that Hoyt's daughter had her accident.

677
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,541
That coulda been the start...

678
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,458
him helpin' them, workin' for 'em.

679
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:07,249
The black man. "Mr. June."

680
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,460
Amelia said O'Brien met with him,

681
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,500
that bar Lucy worked.

682
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,820
They had some kind of arrangement.

683
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:19,199
You know, I always figured
you woulda kept after this

684
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,950
in some way.

685
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,500
No. I told you,

686
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:26,083
let it go.

687
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,980
Amelia and me made a deal.

688
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:35,124
Yeah.

689
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,750
She was a good investigator, huh?

690
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:46,416
She told me somethin' the other day.

691
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,041
She was talkin' to me.

692
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,410
She said, uh...

693
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,416
she said that I hadn't known myself,

694
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,208
and that...

695
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,300
that it made me harden my heart.

696
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,840
Amelia told you this?

697
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,291
She was sittin' right there.

698
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,790
She always knew how to cut
into me, she wanted to.

699
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,400
Son of a bitch is back.

700
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,960
Humor a crazy old man, Detective West.

701
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,667
Hey.

702
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,280
You lookin' for me?

703
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,792
Come out there.

704
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,249
Hey...

705
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,958
- You get it?
- Yeah.

706
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,940
Could just be somebody's
ex-boyfriend watchin' the house.

707
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,300
Wayne?

708
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,500
Wayne.

709
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,660
What are you doing?

710
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:52,541
What is this?

711
00:51:56,917 --> 00:51:58,999
Where have you been?

712
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,041
I can't talk about this.

713
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,360
In the morning... we have to talk.

714
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,833
Will you talk to me in the morning?

715
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,083
We haven't been honest.

716
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,917
What's going on, what we're doing.

717
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,280
No. I know.

718
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,460
Maybe we could turn it around.

719
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,958
If I tell you...

720
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:28,416
Things you're better off not knowin'.

721
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,249
Not about you, there's not.

722
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,680
With you, I need to know everything.

723
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,380
I'd be a son of a bitch
if I did that to you.

724
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,458
I'm sorry, could be Roland or somethin'.

725
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:51,583
Could be big.

726
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,400
Please. Hold on.

727
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:02,375
- Hello?
- Detective Hays?

728
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:05,041
- Wayne Hays?
- Yes.

729
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:07,625
Do you know who this is?

730
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,458
No.

731
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,458
Edward Hoyt.

732
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,792
I think we may have
some things to discuss.

733
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,208
How's that?

734
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,583
Harris James.

735
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:26,667
I'd like to discuss the
events of last night...

736
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,792
as I understand them.

737
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,680
I could come inside, if you like.

738
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,940
I'd be pleased to meet your family.

739
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,333
Your wife, the writer?

740
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,208
Little Henry and Rebecca.

741
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,833
It's lucky, havin' a family.

742
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,541
No.

743
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:05,583
Then maybe you'd like to
come out and talk to me.

744
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,880
My preference, you understand,
is to keep this between us.

745
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,208
For the moment.

746
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,166
How 'bout a little later?

747
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,930
You may not realize this,

748
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,560
but I've been pretty damn
patient with you already.

749
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,300
Perhaps I should take my information
to the prosecutor's office.

750
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,290
Or like I say...

751
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,416
happy to talk inside.

752
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,541
No.

753
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,416
I'll be out in five.

754
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,750
What?

755
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,840
Just, uh...

756
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,640
I'm sorry. It's one last time.

757
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,166
Trust me, all right?

758
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,380
One more time. That's it.

759
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,320
Then we talk, then I
tell you everything.

760
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,460
Right now, uh,

761
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,166
listen.

762
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,820
You gotta just trust me.

763
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,040
One last time.

764
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,500
This is it.

Time is the school in which we learn.

767

Time is the fire in which we burn.

768
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,041
The case. It's only ever the case.

769
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:35,940
That's over now.

770
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,360
All this time...

771
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,291
What the hell were you doing?

772
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,000
My God...

773
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,580
Just tell me what happened.
