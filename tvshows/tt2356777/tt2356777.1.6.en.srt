2
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,473
I'm gonna go make my rounds
on the other end.

3
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,079
I'll check back with you
in about 20 minutes.

4
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,559
I didn't know Audrey's dad's a cop.

5
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,956
I didn't mean no disrespect.

6
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,394
Yes, sir.
We didn't mean any disrespect.

7
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,561
Audrey's 16.

8
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,168
We got you on statch rape.
You know that, right?

9
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,603
You know what happens
to pretty boys like you

10
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,905
who go up to The Farm on statch charges?

11
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,778
Look at that.

12
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,421
Door come open.

13
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,360
Y'all want to step out a bit?

14
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,754
Take some air'?

15
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,262
No, sir.

16
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,532
I think that you're a
little angry right now.

17
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,371
You telling me how I feel?

18
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,444
That's patronizing.

19
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,883
Two choices.

20
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,349
We do this here with an understanding

21
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:02,154
that not you or any of your river rat boys
comes within 100 yards of my daughter.

22
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,995
Or we file those charges.

23
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,564
I got a lot of brothers in Angola
who love to owe me a favor.

24
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,671
Come on out here.

25
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,749
Come on.

26
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,825
Come out here.

27
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,825
A man's game charges a man's price.

28
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,330
You take that away from
this, if nothing else.

29
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,567
Oh!

30
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,208
Aah!

31
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,083
Please!

32
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm sorry. Please!

33
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,466
<i>Disciplinary reports say
he was acting unstable even before.</i>

34
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,557
What happened, you and him?

35
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,797
Two formal reprimands. Suspension.

36
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,839
Your major back then, Salter,
wrote "manic state."

37
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,935
Right here.

38
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,144
No, he, uh, started pulling lost time more.

39
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,683
But okay.

40
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,081
And, for whatever reason,

41
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,185
<i>he started working something
that t didn't know about.</i>

42
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,157
<i>Old missing persons.</i>

43
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,087
What you want, man?

44
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,625
Nothing here for you.

45
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,796
I'm with the State
Police department.

46
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,498
If you're Terry Guidry,
I'd like to talk to you about your boy.

47
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,197
Sheriff call for a search party?

48
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,111
They had a marine unit out there.

49
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,942
Spotlight, everything.

50
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,476
Nothing.

51
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,847
Four weeks later,
wildlife fishers found his pirogue.

52
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,286
All broke up.

53
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,956
They said it could have been a gator.

54
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,560
Where did Sonny go to school?

55
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,165
Queen of Angels.

56
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,998
One of them Tuttle schools.

57
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,676
We didn't sleep
them first four weeks Sonny was missing.

58
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,809
Drove his mama crazy.

59
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:19,187
She thought she heard him, under the water.

60
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,485
Calling for her.

61
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:32,227
Hey, man, look,
why don't you just get out of here?

62
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,395
Please.

63
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,337
I don't want to get arrested. Just get.

64
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,172
Before I do something to you.

65
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,347
If it's wrong, I want it right.
That's all I got.

66
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,352
We're not going to talk to you...

67
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,414
Personal matters like this...
Without you...

68
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,426
You don't want to talk about something,
it's okay. No problem.

69
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,456
You sure we can't get you any coffee, or...

70
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,965
No, thank you.

71
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,590
You worried about your ex?

72
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
It's okay. We're not looking at him.

73
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,266
And nobody wants to.

74
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,477
What are you looking for from me?

75
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,275
Well, perspective, I guess.

76
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,943
Something went down, 2002.

77
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,245
Your (ax-husband's partner, Rustin Cohle.

78
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,746
In a former life,

79
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,318
I used to exhaust myself navigating
crude men who thought they were clever.

80
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,454
So ask your questions or I'm leaving.

81
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,158
That's a cop's wife, all right.

82
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,330
Not anymore.

83
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,768
We're not trying
to work you, ma'am.

84
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,964
Word of honor.

85
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,738
We need to know about Rustin Cohle in 2002.

86
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,605
Why he took off. What he's done since.

87
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,474
Have you had any contact
with Cohle, Mrs. Sawyer, since 2002?

88
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,641
No, I haven't.

89
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,150
But you knew him well enough.

90
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,311
I mean, he was your husband's partner.

91
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,150
Rust, yeah, I knew him.

92
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,483
Not as well as other people.

93
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,958
Why exactly are you asking about him?

94
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,818
Something bad happened.

95
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,189
Maybe Cohle's involved.

96
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,761
More we look at him, it don't look good.

97
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,871
Something went real wrong with him
a long time ago.

98
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,777
I knew Rust to be a good man.
So I can't imagine what I can offer.

99
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,150
<i>Rust knew exactly who he was</i>

100
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,194
<i>and there was no talking him out of it.</i>

101
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:47,233
Marty's single big problem
was he never really knew himself.

102
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,667
So he never really knew what to want.

103
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,640
But I'm big enough
to not stay angry at someone for that.

104
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,547
Not after all this time.

105
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,406
Thank you so much.

106
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,169
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

107
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,575
Can I help you with anything, sir'?

108
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,678
Oh, yeah. Uh, please.
I was thinking about this one.

109
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,478
Fuck!

110
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,798
Excuse me. Can I get a
dirty martini, please?

111
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,836
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

112
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,179
Big weekend planned?

113
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,615
Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah.

114
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,815
Has all the makings of a good time.

115
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,853
You're a cop, aren't you?

116
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,255
How'd you know'?

117
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,293
L, uh...

118
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,162
I think I saw you before, years back.

119
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,494
- You get in some trouble?
-  No. Uh...

120
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,664
You came around this place I was staying
asking about a girl.

121
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,138
Oh.

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,270
Marty.

123
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,706
Beth.

124
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,392
We're closed.

125
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,135
You always hit the bottle
this early in the day, Reverend?

126
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,842
Who are you?

127
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,144
You don't remember me?

128
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,247
Hmm?

129
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,020
I came to see you at your revival tent,
January '95.

130
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,855
Looks like you gave that up.

131
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,825
Mid-'80s, you were still
with the Tuttle ministry then.

132
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:07,031
What do you know about a Tuttle organization
that was set up to finance rural schools?

133
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,008
It was called Wellsprings.

134
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,678
It was an evangelical initiative
to provide religious education

135
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,344
as an alternative to public schooling
in rural communities.

136
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,221
Pan of the reason there were
so many dropouts in the state,

137
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,690
a lot of kids had to bus an hour or more.

138
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,788
You know about that school
on Pelican Island?

139
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,922
I don't know it specific.

140
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,765
But there was one in 1988.

141
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:46,301
Accusations of children
being interfered with.

142
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,548
I never found anything on that.

143
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,480
It was kept internal, I think.

144
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,749
Maybe it was nothing.
Maybe people was paid.

145
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:03,157
It's got nothing to do with me, mind you.
I was going to school in Baton Rouge.

146
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,925
Gossip around the seminary,
but we didn't give credence to rumors.

147
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,892
Why'd you leave?

148
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,004
Bureaucracy.

149
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,336
Politics.

150
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,846
Don't lie to me.

151
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,679
Why'd you leave?

152
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,754
Part of our lay duties was custodial.

153
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:48,700
One night,
cleaning the senior minister's library,

154
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,604
I knocked over a very old volume.

155
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,170
<i>The Letters of Telios DeLorca.</i>

156
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,113
Twelfth-century Franciscan mystic.
Very obscure.

157
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,550
When I picked up the book,
this little folder falls out.

158
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,018
A little folder of pictures.

159
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,559
Pictures of children.

160
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:21,965
Naked.

161
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,901
Looked like they were sleeping.

162
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,711
And what did you do?

163
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:34,547
I took it over to the Morals Officer,
Deacon Farrar.

164
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,985
He was close with Tuttle,
vice-president of the college.

165
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,525
- He didn't do nothing?
- No.

166
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,653
He seemed angry that I brought it to him.

167
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,697
He even intimated that maybe
I was confessing to something.

168
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,937
I had to prove to him that I wasn't.

169
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,000
He promised to look into it.

170
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,702
I left by the time Wellsprings shut down.

171
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,950
Why'd you quit the revival, hmm?

172
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,353
Our last two tents were vandalized.

173
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,526
I lost heart.

174
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,354
A little too much of this.

175
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,595
All my life I wanted to be near 10 God.

176
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,535
The only nearness,

177
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,941
silence.

178
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,717
Oh, it wasn't <i>as</i> bad as it seemed.

179
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,120
Better than most. Jan was a decent lady.

180
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,589
I heard she sold the ranch a while back.

181
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,288
I can't believe that was you.

182
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,729
Saved up money for a place,
got a straight job.

183
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,762
I'd run off from a bad situation
when we first met.

184
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:03,296
Well, it's just so great
how you turned everything around.

185
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,000
Look at you.

186
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,408
Well, you're a big hero in the papers.

187
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,284
Aw, they made a bigger deal
of that than it was.

188
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,922
I haven't been too heroic of late.

189
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,186
Just...

190
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,853
You're a good man.

191
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,965
Anybody can see that.

192
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,662
I saw it the first time I met you.

193
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,838
God gave us these flaws.

194
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,103
And something I learned?

195
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,004
He doesn't see them as flaws.

196
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,447
There is nothing wrong
with the way he made us.

197
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,285
The universe forgives all.

198
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,819
You want some bourbon?

199
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,461
Mmm.

200
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,048
Oh, yeah.

201
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,155
Oh, yeah.

202
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,917
What happened in 2002?

203
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,183
You pulled our last case?

204
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,345
Charmaine Boudreaux?

205
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,860
It was in all the papers. Marshland Medea.

206
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,260
- You know who Medea was?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:09,731
We had a lot of static
after that, me and him.

208
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,894
That was a bad one.

209
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:17,538
I always thought it contributed,
Rust's state of mind when he walked.

210
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,471
SIDS.

211
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,041
What is that?

212
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,443
It's a four-letter word.
S-I-D-S. But, I mean,

213
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,078
what is it?

214
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,388
It's an old word, like a curse.

215
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,491
Not a language anyone speaks.

216
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,998
But that's what happened to Jessica,
your first.

217
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,099
They said.

218
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:54,002
Your second, Jody. Twenty-three days old.

219
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:00,240
Autopsy showed no signs of trauma, so...

220
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,416
SIDS.

221
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,486
I lost one myself, Charmaine.

222
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,596
I lost a marriage, too.

223
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,169
Now your third.

224
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,607
You had him last year.

225
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,209
Jesus, lady'
you ever hear of a fucking condom?

226
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,977
Birth control's a sin.

227
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,718
A child is a wonderful thing.

228
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,565
A child is wonderful.

229
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,746
You see, sometimes, people

230
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,979
mistake a child as an answer for something.

231
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,578
You know, like a way to change their story.

232
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,554
Charmaine, have you ever heard
of something called

233
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,862
Munchausen by proxy?

234
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,032
No.

235
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,367
At exactly 4:49 a.m.,

236
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,381
the sleep apnea monitor that was
hooked up to your child was unplugged

237
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,080
for 36 minutes.

238
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,917
Then it was plugged back in, and by that
time, the child's vitals had flatlined.

239
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,693
Charmaine, I need you
to talk to me about some things.

240
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,534
- Okay?
{VOICE TREMBLES)

241
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,111
How's it going?

242
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,711
He's getting it.

243
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,254
You should sign that.

244
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:29,427
The newspapers
are going to be tough on you.

245
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:37,567
And prison is very, very hard
on people who hurl kids.

246
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,905
If you get the opportunity,
you should kill yourself.

247
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,445
What?

248
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,789
What? Please.

249
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,286
What? Wait.

250
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,103
Jesus!

251
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,612
This evil bitch.

252
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,349
I called Pennsylvania, tried to get
homicides on the first two kids,

253
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,544
but looks like we may only have the one.

254
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,985
- Well, it's still life.
- Yeah.

255
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,216
Good job.

256
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,384
Listen, Marty, type that
up for me, will you?

257
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,392
Excuse me?

258
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:36,625
You got somewhere to be?
This confession is, like, 40 pages.

259
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,032
What, you got somewhere to be?

260
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,127
Come on, man. You want me to
tie your shoes for you, too'?

261
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,801
Hey!

262
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,337
Hey!

263
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,215
What the fuck's with the attitude, huh?

264
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,912
Like my time is less than yours?

265
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,047
Oh, you got things to do, Marty?

266
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,891
Need to go home to the family,
play with the kids?

267
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,561
Don't get up my ass
just 'cause you ain't getting any.

268
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,062
- Oh.
- You should have held onto your woman.

269
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,997
Getting laid was good for you.

270
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,730
God damn. You moron.

271
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,365
God damn.

272
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,836
You, these people, this place,
ifs like you eat your fucking young

273
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,541
and that's all just fine as long as
you got something to salute, huh?

274
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,210
What's going on with you, man?

275
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,347
I mean, Salter asked about it.

276
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,382
Iberia called.

277
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,790
You've been going around bothering people,
trying to open up old cases.

278
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,391
I am working. I have things to do.

279
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,691
So type the report, man.

280
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,102
That's how we do.
I get people to talk, you write the stats.

281
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,229
It's worked out well for you so far.

282
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:55,607
I'm the only one, ever, took up for you.

283
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,376
Ever.

284
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,915
You know what it's like being your partner?
Huh?

285
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,149
Fuck you.

286
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,052
No, buddy, without me,

287
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,722
there is no you.

288
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:13,060
So type the fucking report, man.

289
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,468
We've had behaviorists in with her.
It's regressive catatonia.

290
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,972
Seven years now.

291
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,013
If she shows any distress,
responds in any way negatively,

292
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,172
we're gonna have to ask you to leave.

293
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,271
Of course.

294
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:37,015
I was actually one of the men who found
Kelly at that place seven years back.

295
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,782
She's right here.

296
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,442
Kelly.

297
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,814
Now you may not remember,
but you and I met a long time ago.

298
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:14,457
I want to ask you a question about
those men that hurt you way back then.

299
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,058
Do you remember
if there were more than two?

300
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,155
Was there anyone else?

301
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,496
The man with the scars
was the worst.

302
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,161
My Lord.

303
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,666
What scars?

304
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,405
The giant.

305
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:15,076
He made me watch what he did to Billy.

306
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,453
The scars on the giant,
were they on his face?

307
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,885
His face.

308
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,789
His face.

309
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,357
His face.

310
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,100
Rose, I need Haldol.

311
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,436
Stat, please.

312
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,032
We have to hold her. Sir, you better leave.

313
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,555
<i>What you doing, Cohle?</i>

314
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,657
Riling up people, opening old cases.

315
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,129
Iberia sheriff's talking
jurisdictional complaints.

316
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,962
Somethings going on, Major.

317
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,897
Along the coast.

318
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,405
Women, children disappearing.

319
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,738
Nobody hears about it.
Nobody puts them together.

320
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,070
- First I'm hearing about it, boss.
- Puts what together, Cohle?

321
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,843
Someone, maybe more than one,
is killing people, Major.

322
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,244
They've been doing it for a long time.

323
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,748
You got any bodies?

324
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,590
You got something that actually applies
to your job as a homicide detective?

325
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,359
Know what he did? Know what he did?
Goes and visits Kelly Reider.

326
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,699
Sent her into a screaming fit.

327
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,266
Look, either we don't find them or they
don't get connected, I don't know which.

328
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:46,833
I can't decide if ifs a cover-up
or the garden variety incompetence here.

329
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:51,676
I mean, it has to do with those boys
we got in '95, the Dora Lange killing.

330
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,782
We didn't get them all.

331
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,312
You're building up something in your head.

332
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,854
Women and children.

333
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,522
How did they get no press?

334
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,354
The way things in the bayou get no press.

335
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:07,629
And it's happening in the same area
where that Voudon shit goes down.

336
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,963
And it's happening in the same area
where those schools were set up.

337
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,525
What the fuck schools you talking about?

338
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,535
Tuition reimbursement programs

339
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,164
for rural and Christian schools
founded by Billy Lee Tuttle.

340
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,503
Yeah, think about it.

341
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,877
Back in '95, why was he so fired up
to get his ass down here?

342
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,540
Comes barging in with his task force.

343
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,706
Fuck.

344
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,481
Before we even got started on the case,
he took it over. Why?

345
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,821
'Cause he recognized something in it.

346
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,156
We're in a muddy swamp here, man.

347
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:41,562
The alligators are swimming around us and
we don't even know whether they're there.

348
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,927
You know why?

349
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,559
'Cause we don't see them.

350
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:51,573
I caught zero logic in all that.
And that last bit, pure gibberish.

351
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:56,612
How about we track all the missing persons
within 10 miles of every Walmart, huh?

352
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,239
Right along the I-10.
Why don't we go after Sam Walmart?

353
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,182
I'm fixing to pull you
for mental exhaustion, man.

354
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,622
You want to stay on, do not ever, ever
say that to anyone in the state again.

355
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,354
Sure.

356
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,387
That's some fucking nerve you got, buddy.

357
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,094
You need to take a few steps back, Rust.

358
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,765
- Right now.
- Hey.

359
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,527
No more visiting victims' families.

360
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,267
You will stop trying to turn
missing persons into homicides

361
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,865
as you do not have any bodies.

362
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,377
That's a direct fucking order, you hear me?

363
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,279
You do anything else, I'll have you on
insubordination and I will suspend you.

364
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,611
Please, take some time.

365
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,548
Go on one of them
fishing tours or something.

366
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,951
All right? Get yourself together.

367
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,099
And a little less than two years ago,
Turtle overdosed.

368
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,140
Accidentally supposedly.

369
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,638
You mentioned that already.

370
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,305
Couple weeks before he died, Turtles
house in Shreveport was broken into.

371
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,178
Found out his Baton Rouge one was, too.

372
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,576
Wasn't reported.

373
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,584
So?

374
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,522
So your man
gets a hard-on for Turtle.

375
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:15,955
Man's house gets broken into right after
Cohle turns back up in the state.

376
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:20,657
What's he been doing since here?
Drinking? Bartending'?

377
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,359
Dude with a mind like that,
do you think that's all he get up to?

378
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,936
Marty, he never went anywhere.

379
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,468
He never left.

380
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,600
He's been right here
doing bad things a long time.

381
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,316
Hey, hey, hey, hold up now.

382
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,376
I've been in this room a
long time, gentlemen.

383
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:49,221
Whatever Rusty is or was or became,

384
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,889
don't call me again.

385
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,629
I won't help you.

386
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,457
We're trying to help him' Marty.

387
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,888
- Hey, did you have a good day?
- Mmm.

388
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,222
Well, why don't you
get that bathroom cleaned finally? Huh?

389
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,492
Get all the toothpaste out.

390
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,760
Thanks.

391
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,537
Many, I didn't know you were home.

392
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,803
Oh, yeah. Just cleaning up.
Be out in a sec.

393
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,745
I'll heat up something.

394
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,548
Hey, those ﬂowers came in nice!

395
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,883
You were right.
They really brighten up the yard.

396
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,318
Hey!

397
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,420
I was thinking, we're due for a date night.

398
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,400
Don't you think? You and me?

399
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:44,431
I'm gonna dress up,
we'll go for a nice dinner, a movie.

400
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,573
Yeah? That sound good?

401
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,408
Honey!

402
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,841
Sure.

403
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,420
Ah.

404
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,765
Oh, thanks, hon.

405
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,464
Nice.

406
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,105
So, is my eldest
still offended by my presence?

407
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,343
Huh?

408
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,023
Yeah, I don't mind.

409
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,390
I'm happy just to sit here
with three beautiful women watching...

410
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,359
What is this?

411
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,797
<i>Dumb Blonds in Cracker Country?</i>

412
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,741
Hey, hon.

413
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,475
Do me a favor? Find the game.

414
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,812
Here you go. I have to study.

415
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,554
Good girl.

416
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:28,936
What?

417
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,175
Nothing.

418
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,274
Now, this pasta is great.

419
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,286
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

420
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,691
I love you.

421
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,061
Thank you.

422
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,893
Can you turn it down some, please?

423
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,064
Sure.

424
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,363
Ahem.

425
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,306
How's that?

426
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:10,043
We were talking once
about growing up, parents,

427
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,448
I said something about forgiveness,

428
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:16,720
and he said
that there is no such thing as forgiveness.

429
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,659
That people just have short memories.

430
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,460
Do you think Cohle was wrong about that?

431
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:24,932
Forgiveness?

432
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,631
Less and less.

433
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,240
Can I get you a drink, miss?

434
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,626
Thank you. Uh, sure.
A vodka martini, extra dirty.

435
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,266
Margaret.

436
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,707
- Bruce. Hi.
- Hi.

437
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,010
So, you, uh, waiting for someone?

438
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,275
No.

439
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:23,659
<i>You and, uh,
Marty split prior, right?</i>

440
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,150
In '95?

441
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,667
- Are either of you married?
- Got an ex.

442
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:32,827
<i>Mmm.</i>

443
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,304
- Still on the first.
- It's difficult to admit defeat.

444
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,704
Marty quit drinking.

445
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,571
Found religion for a while.

446
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,838
I didn't love that.

447
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,815
To be honest, I preferred him before.
He had a sense of humor then.

448
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,879
But we stayed together seven more years,
some of it pretty good.

449
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,252
2002?

450
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,990
Cohle's bad year, too.

451
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,420
Rust was an intense man,
but he had integrity.

452
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,397
He was responsible.

453
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,503
<i>Not a lot of responsible
people in the world.</i>

454
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,573
<i>Reverend, thanks for taking the time
to see me on such short notice.</i>

455
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,844
Of course, Detective. Please.

456
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,087
It's a very interesting building.

457
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:31,183
This was the first. Built it in 1980.
The rest of the campus grew around it.

458
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,622
Now, I remembered you, of course.

459
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,960
- People of this state owe you a great deal.
- Not as much as they owe you.

460
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,603
Charitable organizations.
Education initiatives.

461
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:47,404
Thank you.
We're very proud of our ministries.

462
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,537
I don't do as much preaching as I used to,

463
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,982
but the Legacy programs
are more my focus now.

464
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,076
The things like the State
Policeman's Charity.

465
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,082
What did you want to talk about, son?

466
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,323
The Wellspring program.

467
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,756
Mid-'80s through the early '90s,
you remember that?

468
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,156
Well, of course I remember.

469
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:13,426
I'm trying to locate old
personnel, faculty,

470
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,097
but I'm having a little bit of trouble
acquiring names.

471
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:19,734
Well, the program was shut down ofﬂcially,
you know, maybe 10 years ago.

472
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,800
I never had much ground contact with it,

473
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,848
but it involved a number of private
schools, enterprises, you understand,

474
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,440
that would adopt our
standard of curriculum,

475
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:32,818
and in return receive tuition reimbursement
for underprivileged students.

476
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:37,758
You got any files? Any list of faculty?

477
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,963
Well, that's what I'm getting at
is that these were private institutions,

478
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:44,193
so you'd have to track down
their administrators, I believe.

479
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,427
That's the thing.

480
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,863
See, all the schools
dissolved with the program.

481
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,640
And I'm trying to find some tax info,
but there were religious exemptions.

482
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,338
Well, there's our archives, of course.

483
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,936
Now, we did lose a lot of files.

484
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,108
We had some flooding
on one of the sub-ﬂoors.

485
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,354
But, you know, I think I should put you
together with one of our clerical workers

486
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,548
and see if they can't
help you find something.

487
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,825
Thank you. Just before you do that,

488
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:15,458
former deacon of yours, Austin Farrar...

489
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,294
That was very, very unfortunate.

490
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,136
Yet he was dismissed.

491
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,399
Evidence had accrued.

492
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:31,510
It became apparent that Austin
had implemented certain funds.

493
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,906
Well, "embezzling" is the word.

494
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:39,477
We elected to handle it internally
rather than pursuing formal charges.

495
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,916
And then he had his accident.

496
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,487
I'd heard he had taken it hard, drinking.

497
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,268
I've seen more souls lost down a bottle
than any pit.

498
00:39:55,693 --> 00:40:01,575
At the same time, it's hard to trust a man
who can't trust himself with a beer.

499
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,906
Don't you think?

500
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,373
Hmm.

501
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,674
But what's this all about? Um...

502
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,420
Wellspring program, Austin Farrar?

503
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,353
Dead women and children.

504
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,456
Terrible.

505
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,754
That's terrible.

506
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,066
How's that? What you're working on?

507
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:29,437
Oh, I can't say anything about
it at this point, Reverend.

508
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,766
I'd like to set you up with a clerk.

509
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,811
You can look at, uh,

510
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:45,443
whatever information
we still have from Wellspring.

511
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:54,297
Why did the Wellspring program shutdown,
Reverend?

512
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,592
It couldn't sustain its costs.

513
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,563
The whole idea was to
provide an alternative

514
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:04,664
to the kind of secular, globalized education
that our public schools were promoting.

515
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:10,302
When we get the school voucher program
instituted, we'll reintroduce the idea.

516
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,944
People should have a choice in education,
like anything else.

517
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,577
Hmm.

518
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,912
Steve, would you show the detective
to our old archives for outside ministries?

519
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,284
- Yes, sir.
- I'll call ahead.

520
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:27,353
I'm gonna come back for that.
Reverend, thank you for your time today.

521
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,994
Godspeed, Detective.

522
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,995
You'll be in my thoughts.

523
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:43,875
<i>Just the one more time.
I just need it one more time.</i>

524
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:47,883
Beth, if you knew the day I just had...

525
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,619
<i>Oh, then tell me about ii.
I want to hear about it.</i>

526
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,487
Oh...

527
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,889
No, you do not.

528
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,624
I really wanted to see you.

529
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,568
- I've been thinking about something all week.
- Don't.

530
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,537
- Ever since last time...
- Don't, okay? <i>I</i> just...

531
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:15,137
Haven't been able to think of
anything else, tell you the truth.

532
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,839
Ohh...

533
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,978
Like what?

534
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,180
<i>I've been thinking...</i>

535
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,214
I think I want you to fuck me in my ass.

536
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,088
<i>- Uh, Beth.
- I've never done that before,</i>

537
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,226
but I think I want you to do it to me.

538
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:40,530
<i>I want you so bad.</i>

539
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,498
You're out of your goddamn mind.
Hmm?

540
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,938
What did I tell you?

541
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,441
You're fucking unbelievable, boy.
You know about this?

542
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,912
Uh, I'm not sure
what we're talking about here.

543
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:56,417
Your partner here, he
braced Billy Lee Tuttle.

544
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,750
Oh, "braced." Are you fucking kidding me'?
It was a friendly conversation.

545
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:00,948
Hey, dipshit.

546
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,388
You don't get to decide
what kind of conversation it was.

547
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,425
Why did you talk m Billy Lee Tuttle?

548
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,587
And, you, look at you.

549
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,598
You look like you haven't seen
your own bed in a couple days, huh?

550
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,395
Yeah? What the fuck is wrong with you two?

551
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:15,135
Ahem.
Well, I can't speak for Rust,

552
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,137
but I've got the flu.

553
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,969
I didn't know that was going around.

554
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,043
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

555
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,375
If he was pissed off
after the conversation we had,

556
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,745
- then I am onto fucking something...
- Shut the fuck up. I told you.

557
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,717
I fucking told you!
And human tampon here heard me.

558
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:33,586
Badge and gun, Cohle. You're suspended.
One month without pay.

559
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,319
Repeated rank insubordination,
misallocation of departmental resources.

560
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:39,952
- Come on.
- Leroy. Come on. That's over the top.

561
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,793
Don't you fucking Leroy me!
I told you both.

562
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:46,266
Cut the shit! It's done.
Badge and gun, Cohle.

563
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,308
Oh, and, uh,
before your official reinstatement,

564
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,071
you have 30 hours
mandated departmental counseling.

565
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,442
You fucking serious?

566
00:43:57,502 --> 00:44:00,108
This guy, right?
I got to kick you in the fucking head.

567
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:04,747
I'm the person least in need of counseling
in this entire fucking state.

568
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,686
You ain't acting
right, you don't sound right,

569
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,155
you're up my ass, and you were warned.

570
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,521
What?

571
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,828
He's doing it again.

572
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:54,865
He's been doing it.

573
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,305
I can't live with it.

574
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,412
I can't live with it.

575
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,819
I can! deal with it.

576
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,488
Not again.

577
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,327
Did you know?

578
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,164
Did you know?

579
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,191
No.

580
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,416
What are you doing in here?

581
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,793
What happened?

582
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,054
I'm off the job.

583
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:02,099
That's not what I mean.

584
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,737
You can't live like this.

585
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,087
You know, people give me advice,
I reckon they're talking to themselves.

586
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:21,054
What are you doing?

587
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,093
Some people, no matter where they look,
they see themselves.

588
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:41,810
Be honest with me now.

589
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:12,065
What the fuck are you doing here? Huh?

590
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,701
I'm sorry.

591
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:20,198
It wasn't you.

592
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,242
Really, I...

593
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:29,276
I wasn't even sure I could do it.
Seventeen years is a long time.

594
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:36,215
I almost went with a stranger in a bar.

595
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,054
I'm sorry, Rust.

596
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:41,929
He'll have to go, you see,

597
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,761
because this, he won't live with.

598
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,702
- Get the fuck out of here.
- This...

599
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:50,893
- Get the fuck...
-  This will hurt him.

600
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,930
Get the fuck out of here right now.

601
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,270
I'm sorry, but thank you.

602
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,868
You need to get the fuck out of here.

603
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,271
Get the fuck out of here!

604
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,452
<i>Do you know what was going on
with Cohle around that time?</i>

605
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,255
No.

606
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,061
I knew that he got suspended,

607
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:24,472
and that he quit after
he and Many had his...

608
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,670
They had their thing.

609
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,270
That's it.

610
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,836
So, your split with Marty,

611
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,447
that had nothing to do with Cohle?

612
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,408
No.

613
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,772
Hey, hon.

614
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:13,619
- Hi, Marty.
- How are you doing?

615
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,319
Sit down.

616
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,453
Okay.

617
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,664
I have to tell you something.

618
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,572
I saw the pictures on your phone.

619
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,068
B?

620
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,869
- Now, honey...
- Nice ass, Marty.

621
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,004
No. I cannot...

622
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,950
I was maybe always a
little too skinny for you.

623
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,976
No. I cannot help it if some crazy bitch...

624
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,851
I slept with someone.

625
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,088
And you know him.

626
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,656
You're close.

627
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,528
Who?

628
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:06,440
It was Rust.

629
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,169
I fucked your partner Rust.

630
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:15,843
Oh.

631
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,610
What are you saying? What are you...

632
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,751
What the fuck are you saying to me?

633
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,381
I already told you.

634
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,897
- You fucking whore.
- You don't know the half of it.

635
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:36,234
To tell you the truth, I haven't been
tucked like that since before the girls.

636
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,539
Do it! Do it!

637
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,916
Al least you'll have something
to explain to your daughters.

638
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,383
Get your fucking hands off me.

639
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,586
Coward!

640
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,480
Cohle's outside.

641
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:29,256
Does he know he's suspended?

642
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,448
I was coming for my files, Marty.

643
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,056
Whoa!

644
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,689
Come on, swing, Marty!

645
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:13,064
You're getting your ass kicked!

646
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,896
Oh, my God. Get Salter. Get Salter!

647
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,306
Hurry up! Stop them!

648
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,202
Stop!

649
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,709
on!

650
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,135
- Stay down, Marty.
- Come on now.

651
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,872
Don't do it! Stop them!

652
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,040
Get up, get up!

653
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,708
- Calm down, Many.
- That's enough now!

654
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,222
Hey! All right, back off, guys!

655
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,312
- Come on!
- Come on!

656
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:36,881
- Get him out of here!
- Come on.

657
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,425
Get him the fuck out of here.

658
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,392
- Fuck you!
- Calm down, Marty.

659
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,930
- Cohle!
- You better calm your shit right now!

660
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,098
Get inside!

661
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,666
You're standing around watching this shit?
Get the fuck inside!

662
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,330
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

663
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,533
- Get him inside. Get him inside.
- We ain't done here!

664
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,437
- Get him inside.
- We ain't done here!

665
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,544
I'm gonna need some fucking detail here,
you two.

666
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,210
It's a personal matter
between us, boss.

667
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,185
Is there anybody pressing charges?

668
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,850
Not me.

669
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,224
You want to say anything, Cohle?

670
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:15,892
No.

671
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:20,095
This man right here is the only pal
you have. You understand that?

672
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,363
Fuck him. I ain't his pal.

673
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,201
I quit.

674
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,800
You serious?

675
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:32,938
I'll send you a letter.
Yeah, fuck this. Fuck this world, man.

676
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,878
Nice hook, Marty.

677
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,058
You're not gonna go into this, huh? Really?

678
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:50,460
You two fucked each other up pretty good.

679
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:51,927
No shit.

680
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,436
<i>What about when he quit?
Any idea why?</i>

681
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,111
<i>Maybe it was
old stuff between them.</i>

682
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,811
Way they always rubbed wrong.

683
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,754
I never learned what it was about.

684
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:08,803
Marty.

685
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,837
Rust.

686
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,370
Long time.

687
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,415
Long time.

688
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,579
Changed your hair.

689
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,488
Thought maybe we should talk.

690
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,651
Yeah?

691
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:26,992
Buy you a beer'?

692
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,826
Sure. I'll follow you.

693
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,073
Actually, why don't you buy me a beer?

694
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,954
