1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,981
Last orders, please!

3
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,981
Who's there?

4
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:56,021
You've reached Kate,
Alex and Ella.

5
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,501
We're not home right now,

6
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,821
but if you leave a message,
we'll get back to you.

7
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,901
You have no new messages.

8
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:24,981
Boss?

9
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,061
Darren.

10
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:28,981
First lead on a murder case.

11
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:31,861
Bit early.

12
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:35,141
Jesse Halpin. Sheep farmer.
Right.

13
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:36,781
This is his place.

14
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,381
Someone shot him last night.
He was walking home from the pub.

15
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:40,901
It's a bit out of the way,
these woods.

16
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,701
There's a footpath from the village.
Leads straight across his land.

17
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,741
Up through those trees
to the farmhouse.

18
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:48,101
Who called it in?
Farm worker.

19
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,061
Lorna Spalden.
She's given us a statement.

20
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,500
I still need to speak to her, yeah.

21
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,581
I'm gonna check in
with Dr Newstone first.

22
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,741
Dr Newstone.

23
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,861
Shotgun wounds to the upper torso.

24
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:19,981
No soot staining
or secondary projectile damage.

25
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,500
Any sign of a firearm?

26
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,501
Nothing yet.

27
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,501
What about these shoe treads?

28
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,261
We've ruled them out
as the victim's.

29
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:28,381
It's a public footpath.

30
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,981
Any number of people
will have traipsed all over it.

31
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:32,861
We'll get them photographed.

32
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:36,061
But we did find
some expended shell cases.

33
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:38,861
If we're lucky,
we might lift some latent prints.

34
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,301
So, whoever shot him
was standing here.

35
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,021
So he either chanced upon
his killer,

36
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:47,301
or someone was lying in wait.

37
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:49,621
That's a reasonably accurate
assessment.

38
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:57,741
This is hardly the time,
but well done with that promotion.

39
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,661
Thanks.

40
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,301
Ambitious new DI
with a point to prove.

41
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,061
Pretty much sums it up.

42
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:12,901
Ridley never let himself get carried
away with theories and guess work.

43
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,621
Well, Ridley isn't running
this case.

44
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,461
I'm not saying he was always right.

45
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,701
Play to your strengths.

46
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,101
You'll get there.

47
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:46,661
Oh, Jesus...

48
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,341
So, this is where
you've been hiding?

49
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,381
Jean.

50
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,421
What are you doing out here?
Oh, I've come to see you.

51
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,421
Can I come in?

52
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:04,741
Place is a bit of a mess.

53
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,981
I'll get my boots on,
we'll go for a walk.

54
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:19,541
Lorna, isn't it? DI Carol Farman.
Copelton Police.

55
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,541
I understand
that you found the body?

56
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,941
Yeah, he was lying by the footpath.

57
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,101
Must've been there all night.

58
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:31,981
Do you always walk to work
along the footpath?

59
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:35,021
I've a place
down by Wensbeck Bridge.

60
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,941
Live-in tenant.

61
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:39,261
Edge of the woods?
That's right.

62
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,221
So, erm, how long have you
worked for the Halpins?

63
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:48,181
Must be 20-odd years now.

64
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,781
You'd have known Jesse Halpin
pretty well, then?

65
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:53,501
Well enough.

66
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:59,421
Is there anyone you can think of
that might have fallen out with him?

67
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,101
Well, people round here....

68
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:04,141
..they never had
a good word to say about Jesse.

69
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:07,221
Any of those people
I should be talking to?

70
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,421
Halpins keep themselves
to themselves.

71
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,661
It's just the way it's always been.
Hmm.

72
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,101
I'll let you get on.

73
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,661
How's your retirement shaping up?

74
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:30,501
Well, you know,
takes a bit of getting used to,

75
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,261
all this time on your hands.

76
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:34,421
Well, you cut adrift in your prime.

77
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,741
You've still got so much to offer.

78
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,981
"Access to pension
on medical grounds"

79
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,981
was the phrase
they used to dress it up.

80
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:45,421
Well, I used to run
a Major Crimes team.

81
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:49,861
And these days, the school run
is about as exciting as it gets. Ha!

82
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,101
The grandkids.

83
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,701
You gotta enjoy that.

84
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:01,741
Do you know, if I'm honest,
they make me feel old.

85
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,861
You miss it then. The job?

86
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:09,021
So much more than I thought I would.

87
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:15,981
Your presence was noted
at the funeral.

88
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,381
I should have come earlier, but...

89
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:27,101
To be honest,
I didn't know what to say to you.

90
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:28,461
Nothing anybody can say.

91
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,261
Won't bring them back.

92
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:37,301
He went to the pub after tea.

93
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:39,821
And that's The Mason's Arms
in Wensbeck?

94
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:43,181
20-minute walk
if you cut across the fields.

95
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,701
And when he didn't come home,
you rang the police?

96
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:48,061
He wasn't answering his mobile.

97
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,261
What time was this?

98
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,941
Must have been well after midnight.

99
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:55,701
And you were both here all evening?

100
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,941
We don't get out much.
The farm keeps us busy.

101
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,621
Mm.

102
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:02,781
You own most of the land
around the village.

103
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:07,141
Just shy of 300 acres.
Sheep farming, mainly.

104
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:10,541
I'm sorry to have to ask you this,
Mrs Halpin,

105
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,421
but, erm, is there anybody

106
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,941
who might have had a grievance
with your husband?

107
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,501
No-one I can think of.

108
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:22,421
The chances are
this wasn't a random shooting.

109
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:27,781
Well, we keep our own company.
Always have done.

110
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,861
Your tenant, Lorna Spalden,
hinted that there was tensions.

111
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:34,181
Neighbours in the village.

112
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,301
Best pay no heed to what Lorna says.

113
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:42,541
How long will they be out there
in the woods?

114
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,021
We've locked off the area
as a murder scene.

115
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,701
Crime Scene Investigators
are searching for evidence.

116
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:54,221
She's been up all night.
She's exhausted.

117
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,781
I understand.

118
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:59,021
We'll still need you
to identify your husband's body.

119
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,421
There's no rush.

120
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:06,621
I can speak
to a family liaison officer?

121
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:08,501
No, no. No need for any of that.

122
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,541
I'll see she's looked after.

123
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,581
Thank you.

124
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,701
You heard from
Carol Farman lately?

125
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:31,301
Carol. Yeah.

126
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:34,581
No, I suspect she's busy. You know,
with the promotion and that.

127
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:37,781
So you won't have heard about
last night's homicide?

128
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:41,461
Sheep farmer right in Wensbeck.
Jesse Halpin.

129
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,621
I thought it would be better
if you heard it from me.

130
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,461
Have they any idea who killed him?

131
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:09,901
Well, that's a question for the SIO.

132
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,861
So this wasn't a social call, Jean.

133
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,101
You came all the way out here what,
to warn me off, is that it?

134
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,901
It's just some friendly advice,
that's all.

135
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:22,901
From one ex-copper to another.

136
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:25,901
You can't solve them all, Ridley.

137
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:28,221
It doesn't pay to dwell on the past.

138
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,261
See you later.

139
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,781
Adless Woods homicide.
Victim's name was Jesse Halpin.

140
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:48,621
He's a sheep farmer from Wensbeck.

141
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:51,141
Last seen drinking
in The Mason's Arms in the village.

142
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:54,301
It appears
he was killed on the walk back home.

143
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,021
Fatal shotgun wound to the chest.

144
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:59,021
Body was discovered by Lorna Spalden
- one of his tenants.

145
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,301
Any names in the mix?
No-one so far.

146
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,341
It does seem that
the Halpins have a bit of a rep.

147
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:06,781
Chances are this was personal.
Someone with a grudge.

148
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:08,501
Someone local who knew the area.

149
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,701
So let's get some legs
over to Wensbeck.

150
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:12,421
I want house-to-house inquiries.

151
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:14,981
Cameras. Phone records. ANPR.

152
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:18,021
Who did Jesse Halpin talk to
last night?

153
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,861
Have a seat.

154
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,981
This stays strictly between us.

155
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,781
But it won't hurt
to give you the heads up.

156
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:34,101
Jesse Halpin was questioned
by DI Ridley

157
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,181
in connection with
the Zoe Lindsey case.

158
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:38,741
The three-year-old abducted
near Dunmore Sands.

159
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,421
Yeah, I know. Must've been...
14 years ago.

160
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:43,221
West Riding were running
that case.

161
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,621
My old stomping ground.
Lowly DS back then.

162
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:48,141
Why was Ridley anywhere near it?
He was asked to rule out Halpin

163
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,141
after his plates flagged up
near the crime scene.

164
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,101
And was he ruled out?

165
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:55,221
Ridley was convinced
he was somehow connected.

166
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,421
You clearly weren't in agreement.

167
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:00,301
A suspect had already been arrested,
Daniel Preston.

168
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:03,301
A lot of evidence pointed to him,
but the charge never stuck.

169
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:06,781
So Ridley might actually
have been on to something?

170
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:10,301
If Ridley gets wind of this, he's
bound to start stirring things up.

171
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,741
Wouldn't hurt to bring him in.
See what he can add to the mix.

172
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:16,101
He's just lost his wife and
daughter, Carol. Full on breakdown.

173
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,581
I hear he can barely get out of bed.

174
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,661
This might give him
something to focus on?

175
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,301
I don't want him anywhere near it!

176
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:25,741
Last thing we need is Zoe Lindsey
coming back to haunt us.

177
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:38,221
'If anyone out there
knows where she is,

178
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:42,101
'please, please come forward.

179
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,821
'She'll be tired and frightened.

180
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:47,941
'She'll be wanting her mum.'

181
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,621
'Control from Bravo Delta,

182
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,501
'potential witness
on 25 Wishbone Street.'

183
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:28,141
Jesse Halpin always drank
on his own.

184
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:31,461
Regular, was he?
He'd show his face most evenings.

185
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:32,981
Barely a civil word out of him.

186
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:35,861
I get the impression
that he wasn't well liked?

187
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:38,101
Halpins have always been oddballs.

188
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:41,221
You'll see Moll in the village,
and she'll look right through you.

189
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,541
So she doesn't get out much?

190
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,501
Jesse liked his women
to stay at home.

191
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,661
Even had his daughter
home-schooled.

192
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:55,061
Any trouble last night
we should know about? It was quiet.

193
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:59,261
Usual faces. Well, I'll need you
to put some names to those faces.

194
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:02,341
Yeah?

195
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:08,701
Hiya.

196
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,021
What's all this?

197
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,421
DI Farman. Copelton Police.

198
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:17,821
Steve, my lad.
They're here about Jesse Halpin.

199
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,141
Aye, erm...

200
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:21,541
I heard someone shot him.

201
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,061
You work in the pub, then,
with your mum?

202
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:26,861
Not much else on offer round here.
Were you working last night?

203
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:29,501
Busy collecting glasses
till closing.

204
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:32,581
Truth be told,
we had a bit of a lock-in.

205
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,301
Oh, right.

206
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,981
I'd keep that one between us, eh?

207
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:41,541
Boss?
Yeah.

208
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,861
Nothing we can work with
from house-to-house.

209
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,061
No-one seems to have seen him
walking home.

210
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,941
Well, clearly he ran into someone.

211
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,741
But I need you to retrace
Halpin's steps last night.

212
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:54,861
Walk along the lane
until you get to the footpath.

213
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,421
See if it throws up anything.
Boss.

214
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:59,861
Darren.
Yeah?

215
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:00,941
Run a check on Steve Parry

216
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:02,741
soon as you get back at the station,
yeah?

217
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:05,821
Summat I should know about?
Just covering all our bases.

218
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:19,101
Detective Inspector Farman.

219
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:20,741
Nice ring to it, don't you think?

220
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,781
It's been a while.

221
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,501
Too long. I know.

222
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:31,741
Listen, er, wondered if you had
any plans later this evening?

223
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,421
Thought I could buy you dinner.

224
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:39,341
Makes a change from takeout, eh?
Pulling an all-nighter.

225
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,741
Pizza sauce
all over the custody suite.

226
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,461
How's it going anyway?

227
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,701
Let's just say
I'm still on probation.

228
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:50,621
What? You deserve it, the promotion.

229
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,341
Five years on the job with you

230
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,581
and that is the first compliment
you've ever paid me.

231
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,381
That's got to be a lie.

232
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,781
I've been meaning
to call you for ages.

233
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,981
Things have been pretty full-on.

234
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:09,101
That murder up in Wensbeck.
must be keeping you busy.

235
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,581
Jean Dixon came to see me
this morning.

236
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:15,141
Jesse Halpin.
Someone shot him last night.

237
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,981
So, what, you thought I might be
able to shed a bit of light on it?

238
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:21,981
Goodwin warned me
not to talk to you.

239
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:25,221
But he said that you had concerns
about Halpin.

240
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:29,101
Yeah, I was always convinced
he'd taken her.

241
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:30,741
What made you so sure?

242
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:33,501
Well, apart from inconsistencies
in his statement,

243
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,781
he could never explain
what he was doing in the area.

244
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:38,101
I asked them to keep on,
but they never did.

245
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:41,941
But they arrested a suspect.
A convicted sex offender.

246
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:44,701
Yeah. Daniel Preston.

247
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:46,821
He's serving time
for an unrelated offence.

248
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:49,541
Indecently assaulting a minor.

249
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,181
CPS ruled there was insufficient
evidence to charge him

250
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:53,941
with Zoe Lindsey's abduction.

251
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,381
And you think he was innocent?

252
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:59,701
The investigation was flawed,
I know that much.

253
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:04,381
Perhaps they were in it together?
Halpin and Preston.

254
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:35,781
# You remember young
Danny McClaren, of course

255
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:39,181
# Well, he's over here

256
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:43,181
# With the rest of the force

257
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:48,661
# I've seen him myself
As he stood on the Strand

258
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:54,741
# Stopped all the traffic
With a wave of his hand

259
00:19:54,741 --> 00:20:00,461
# And as we were talking
Of days that are gone

260
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:07,101
# The whole population of London
Looked on

261
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:14,821
# But for all his great powers
He's wishful like me

262
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:23,341
# To be back where the dark Mourne
Sweeped down to the sea. #

263
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,381
I've missed that voice.
Oh, Annie.

264
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,821
Yeah, I'm a bit rusty.

265
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:35,141
Sounded good to me.

266
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,261
Didn't expect to see you tonight.

267
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:41,781
No, I was just round the corner.
I thought I'd drop in.

268
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:43,981
I didn't expect to see you either.

269
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,261
How are we doing?

270
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:47,661
Well, by the time
we've paid the talent,

271
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:49,421
we're barely breaking even.

272
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:51,221
I keep telling you,
you know, you see,

273
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:53,221
you're giving away
too many free drinks.

274
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:56,581
You want a return
on your investment?

275
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:58,421
You could always play a set
this weekend.

276
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,461
Oh, I don't know, Annie.

277
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,181
These days,
I'm more of a silent partner.

278
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:09,741
You know, I could do with
a bit of support, Alex.

279
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:12,621
It's been tough on me, too,
coming to terms with what happened.

280
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:15,701
And trying to keep this place
ticking over. I know.

281
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:19,901
I know.

282
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:27,421
You think this is what
Kate and Ella would've wanted?

283
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,781
To see you like this?

284
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:34,701
You can't hide away forever.
Can't I?

285
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:42,221
Make sure you lock up
before you leave.

286
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:47,821
Night.
Night.

287
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:54,021
Sorry I couldn't make it
to parent's evening, Jack.

288
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,461
So, what did I miss?

289
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:59,381
Mr Atkins has got a new hairpiece.
It's a much better fit.

290
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,261
You can only see the joins up close.

291
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,901
And Sharon Dawkins said
could she ring you?

292
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,221
Wants to talk about policing
the school-run parking.

293
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,701
Her daughter's a right nutter.

294
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,301
She comes to school
with no knickers on.

295
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:11,821
What?

296
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:14,221
I'm not even gonna ask
how you know that.

297
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:15,821
Oh!

298
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,021
Can I go round Tom's for tea?

299
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:21,461
I don't see why not.

300
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:24,461
And what about that project
you still need to finish?

301
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:27,501
Well, one late night won't hurt him,
will it?!

302
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:29,061
He'll probably be outside
right now.

303
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:32,021
Er, fruit, please.
You'll get scurvy!

304
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:33,901
I can give you both a lift
if you want?

305
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,221
I'm headed that way.

306
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:38,821
I'll take that as a no, then.

307
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:41,821
He's falling behind as it is.

308
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:45,981
And all you ever do is remind him.
Yeah. It's a big year for him.

309
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:47,261
Which is why he should be able

310
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,061
to let off some steam
every now and then.

311
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:55,341
Sorry.

312
00:22:58,661 --> 00:22:59,741
Mm!

313
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:02,141
Yes, Darren?

314
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:04,421
I ran that check on Steve Parry
you asked for.

315
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:06,301
Six-month custodial
for stealing a tractor.

316
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,261
And this couldn't wait
until I get to the station?

317
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:11,701
His plates also flagged up
on Wensbeck Lane

318
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:13,421
the night of Jesse Halpin's murder.

319
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:16,261
Get a team over to Wensbeck.

320
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,341
Arrest him and put him
in an interview room. I'm on my way.

321
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:33,821
You've got a visitor waiting.
Catherine Halpin.

322
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:36,301
She said she'd only speak to you.
Right.

323
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:40,901
Catherine?
I want to see Steve.

324
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,741
Right, well,
I'm just about to question him

325
00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:44,301
in relation to a very serious crime.

326
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,661
We had nothing to do with it.

327
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:48,101
Ah, you and Steve?

328
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,741
We've been together
for a couple of months now.

329
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:53,261
Boss.
Right.

330
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:55,021
Duty solicitor's arrived.
OK.

331
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:57,061
We'll finish this
after I've interviewed him.

332
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,581
Hi, Michael.

333
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,221
That pick-up truck you own,
we can place it on Wensbeck Lane.

334
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:43,741
9.46pm on the night
of Jesse Halpin's murder.

335
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:47,661
And again, nearly two hours later,
heading back towards the village.

336
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:49,061
I went for a drive.

337
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:51,141
You told us
you were in the pub all night.

338
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,301
I knew if you found out
me and Jesse had previous...

339
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:54,621
Well, what previous is this?

340
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,141
My dog were injured
in one of his snare traps.

341
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:01,461
He sets them in the woods.

342
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,301
To keep scrotes like you
off his property?

343
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,901
I took it to your lot.
Official complaint.

344
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:08,061
And they said I couldn't prove owt.

345
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:10,141
Your relationship
with Catherine Halpin.

346
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,181
You didn't think
that was worth mentioning?

347
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,741
Let's just say
it wasn't common knowledge.

348
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:16,061
I'm guessing he warned you off?

349
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,101
Said his daughter
were too good for us.

350
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,821
Oh, that must've been
a blow to the ego.

351
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,661
You know,
they worked her like a skivvy.

352
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,061
Kept her locked up on that farm.

353
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:25,701
OK, so he's warned you off
his daughter. Nobbled your dog.

354
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,981
Chances are
you were looking to even the score.

355
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:31,381
I didn't even see him that night!
So what were you doing in the woods?

356
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:45,061
Me and a mate, we went lamping.

357
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:50,061
That's hunting after dark.
Yeah, I know what it is.

358
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:51,781
There's always plenty of bait there.

359
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:54,261
So we just placed
a few bets on the dogs.

360
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,741
What about a firearm,
were you carrying?

361
00:25:56,741 --> 00:25:59,301
OK, we had a gun.

362
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,901
Well, it's licensed. You can check.

363
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:03,501
Oh, we will.
Look, we heard a shot.

364
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,541
So we ran because we thought
he was coming for us.

365
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,661
Called in the dogs
and drove back to the village.

366
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:09,461
What, and then
got your mum to cover for ya?

367
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:11,301
Look, Jesse Halpin was
a piece of work,

368
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:13,261
and I'm not sorry he's dead.

369
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:17,661
But I didn't kill him.

370
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:21,901
This mate of yours...

371
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:23,661
we're gonna need his name.

372
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:29,181
'I brought you some books.'

373
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:33,181
Some of those racing sagas
that you like to read.

374
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:34,861
Good of you to remember.

375
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:38,501
How are you bearing up?

376
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:41,101
Every visit,
same sanctimonious concern.

377
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,381
Be rude not to ask.

378
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:46,141
My request for a transfer
was refused.

379
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:47,741
I wasn't aware you'd made one.

380
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:49,621
Maybe you could put in
a word for me?

381
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:53,421
Man of your standing.
Ex-copper to boot.

382
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:54,461
Ex-copper.

383
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,621
I don't think my word
would count for much.

384
00:26:57,621 --> 00:26:59,821
You think I'm going to be safe
in the seg wing?

385
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:02,301
Banged up with the fruit loops
and the nonces?

386
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:06,541
You know what they'll do to a grass.
You'll just have to watch your back.

387
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,861
In case you're forgetting,
you owe me.

388
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:12,621
We're serving this sentence
together.

389
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:15,421
It were your fault
what I did that night.

390
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:23,061
Listen,
you don't have to answer this,

391
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:26,981
but how did your dad seem
in the days before he was killed?

392
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,061
Hadn't really seen too much of him.

393
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:36,581
They were arguing, night he died.

394
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,621
I heard them downstairs.

395
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:42,061
What were they arguing about?

396
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:44,701
It was usually money.

397
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:48,701
They even talked about
selling the land.

398
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,501
Buying somewhere smaller
in the village.

399
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:53,541
There was always
something stopping 'em.

400
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,661
Come on.

401
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:12,461
Get yourself inside.

402
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:19,381
You had no cause to speak to her.
Not without me there.

403
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:23,141
We were questioning Steve Parry in
relation to your husband's murder.

404
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:26,541
Parrys are bad news.

405
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:30,501
You must have known that Catherine
and Steve were seeing each other?

406
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,301
This is what happens
when you let people in.

407
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,381
Nothing good ever comes of it.

408
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,821
Ever come across Daniel Preston
on the seg wing?

409
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:47,701
A man like that,
you learn to keep your distance.

410
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,461
Did he ever talk about his crimes?

411
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,021
In case you'd forgotten,
I don't sing for you these days.

412
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,981
You must have heard something,
rumours.

413
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:55,781
He has a certain notoriety.

414
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:57,621
The numbers only talk to each other.

415
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:01,501
Always competing
for bragging rights.

416
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:03,141
Did he ever mention Zoe Lindsey?

417
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:06,141
Not to my knowledge. Why do you ask?

418
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:10,581
Two days ago,
a man was murdered on my old patch.

419
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:11,901
Jesse Halpin.

420
00:29:13,341 --> 00:29:16,581
I interviewed him at the time, in
connection with Zoe's disappearance.

421
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:20,301
And you think Preston took her?

422
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,981
He's always maintained
his innocence.

423
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:26,741
The powers that be
sent all kinds in to visit him,

424
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:29,621
pushing him to tell them
what he'd done with her.

425
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:33,701
Maybe he finally gave 'em something?

426
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:35,861
What makes you say that?

427
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:38,741
They released him on parole
a few days ago.

428
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:50,261
Lowlifes like Preston,
best not to indulge 'em, huh?

429
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:52,861
He'll be back inside soon enough.

430
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,581
Thanks for the books.

431
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:07,981
Got you a coffee.

432
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,501
OK.

433
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:11,421
Daniel Preston was released
two weeks ago.

434
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:14,261
Ten days before Jesse Halpin
was murdered.

435
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:16,541
Let's go.

436
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:29,341
That's him.
Thanks.

437
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:35,541
Daniel Preston?

438
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:38,141
Detective Inspector Farman,
Copelton Police.

439
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:39,701
What's this about?

440
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,661
Well, we'd like to ask you
a few questions

441
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:44,061
in connection with the abduction
of Zoe Lindsey.

442
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:51,061
Yeah. I mean, we can do it here
or we can go somewhere more private.

443
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:03,861
In case you'd forgotten,
they threw out the charges.

444
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,541
Police tried to stitch me up.

445
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:09,021
We need to talk to you in light
of some recent developments.

446
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:12,381
Jesse Halpin. Does that name
mean anything to you?

447
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:14,621
No. Can't say it does.

448
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:19,861
You may have come across him
about 14 years ago.

449
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:23,501
Yeah. Yeah, the face... Yeah, maybe.

450
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,941
I think he, erm,
he worked at the park that summer.

451
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:32,821
Dunmore Sands?
Yeah.

452
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:34,701
Could only have been
a couple of weeks.

453
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,661
The manager took him on.

454
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,701
And what work
was he doing there exactly?

455
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:43,181
Odds and sods.
Wherever he was needed.

456
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:45,181
I didn't have anything
to do with him.

457
00:31:45,181 --> 00:31:47,981
You know that Jessie Halpin was
questioned as a person of interest

458
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:50,141
during the time
of Zoe Lindsey's abduction.

459
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,381
What's that got to do with me?

460
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:53,741
He was murdered three nights ago.

461
00:31:54,861 --> 00:31:56,981
A few days after
you got out of prison.

462
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:01,381
What, and you think I did it?

463
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:07,421
Well, if you knew who'd taken her,
you might want to even the score

464
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:10,101
for all the years everyone pointed
the finger at you.

465
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:17,221
7pm curfew.

466
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:21,421
I guess that puts me in the clear.

467
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:26,141
I've been reading
a list of your previous convictions.

468
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:30,781
Possession of child pornography.
Five counts of indecent assault.

469
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,781
Statuary rape of a minor.
Was that a stitch-up, too?

470
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,861
Do you think you're the first person
to try and get me to confess?

471
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:44,621
I've been threatened, bribed,
all sorts of promises.

472
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:47,421
Well, maybe this is a chance
to clear your name?

473
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:51,941
Nah.

474
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:54,701
I'd rather take my chances.

475
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,581
We pulled out
Jessie Halpin's phone records.

476
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:01,381
Three unanswered calls from his wife
the night he died.

477
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,381
I ran a background check on
the daughter with social services.

478
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:07,941
The home-schooling flags up some
concerns. They queried neglect.

479
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:09,421
She also missed her MMR jabs,

480
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,581
several childhood
medical appointments

481
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:12,901
and developmental checks.

482
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:15,341
There don't seem to have been
any major issues.

483
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:16,941
I'm glad you think so, Darren.

484
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,781
I just meant...
How old is that lad of yours?

485
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:20,141
Well, he'll be four in a few weeks.

486
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:21,901
Well, why don't you run
this list by his mum.

487
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:25,541
And then you get back to me, yeah.
Carol! A word.

488
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:35,301
I just got a call from
Daniel Preston's probation officer

489
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:36,941
accusing us of police harassment.

490
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,981
I was all set to update you...
Well, I'm all ears.

491
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:42,981
Halpin worked at Dunmore Sands

492
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,861
the summer that Zoe Lindsey
went missing.

493
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:46,461
If Halpin and Preston
were acquainted,

494
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:49,141
his death could be connected to
Zoe's disappearance.

495
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:51,021
So, now Preston's in the frame
for his murder?

496
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:53,101
I just think that Ridley
might be on to something.

497
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:54,461
Well, this just gets better!

498
00:33:54,461 --> 00:33:56,701
I might've known
he'd be pulling your strings!

499
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,301
We're obligated to investigate it.

500
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:02,741
That was my call to make -
not yours.

501
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:14,941
You worked the original case.
A case that was never solved.

502
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:16,341
If we could reopen it,

503
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,540
I really think
these cases could be connected.

504
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:23,741
I'd need to take it to the Super.
I still want Ridley in on this.

505
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,101
You really think
this is going to fix him?

506
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,381
He's going to go after Halpin anyway
and make some noise.

507
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:31,141
Surely, it's better
to have him onside?

508
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:33,621
I think he has something to offer.

509
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:51,181
Are you sure you wanna do this?

510
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:55,621
It's too late to turn back now.

511
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,781
You've got nothing to prove
any more.

512
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:01,901
I don't know.

513
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:13,461
Mr Ridley,
we'll need to sign you in.

514
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:18,421
Oh, I wasn't expecting
a welcoming committee.

515
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:23,221
Thought I'd take the opportunity
to lay down some ground rules.

516
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,661
You will answer to Mr Ridley

517
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:26,421
as you're no longer
a working detective.

518
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:28,461
I've answered to worse.

519
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,341
No access to the PNC.
No powers of arrest.

520
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:34,701
You can question suspects out in
the field, but never under caution.

521
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:39,101
Hands off. Arm's length.
Hardly worth my while coming back.

522
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:43,421
Let's get one thing straight,
shall we?

523
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,061
I only cleared this
with human resources

524
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:48,701
after I guaranteed personally
that you're fit and able to work.

525
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:53,221
I put my neck on the line for you.
Don't let me down, Ridley.

526
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:57,341
Adless Woods homicide.

527
00:35:57,341 --> 00:36:00,061
We are pursuing
a new line of inquiry.

528
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:02,821
A connection
to a well-known cold case.

529
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:05,741
We think it's possible
that Jesse Halpin

530
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:10,341
may have been involved in
the abduction of Zoe Lindsey and...

531
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:14,501
The three-year-old was abducted

532
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:17,581
from Dunmore Sands Caravan Park
where she lived.

533
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,381
Missing, presumed dead.

534
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:23,941
A 34-year-old male was arrested
on suspicion of her abduction.

535
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:27,261
Daniel Preston, a convicted sex
offender who worked at the park,

536
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,501
was never charged,
but remains under suspicion.

537
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,181
The evidence was circumstantial.

538
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,981
So what's Halpin's connection
to the cold case?

539
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:37,181
I interviewed him
at the time as a person of interest,

540
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:40,181
and his plates were flagged up
in the area where Zoe went missing.

541
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:42,781
He could never really explain
what he was doing there.

542
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:46,581
There were also inconsistencies in
his statement that raised concerns.

543
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:49,501
Concerns that were
taken on board at the time.

544
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:52,141
And subsequently disregarded.

545
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:55,701
He was clean. No previous.
Nothing that tied him to any crime.

546
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:02,021
Er, Preston claims that Halpin

547
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:04,181
worked at the caravan site
that summer.

548
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,901
A fact that was missing
in the initial investigation.

549
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,981
If the two of them
were acting together...

550
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:10,461
That's pure supposition.

551
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,701
Gives Preston a motive
for Halpin's murder.

552
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:17,261
We could be looking at extortion.
Reprisals.

553
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:18,981
A catch-up between
two guilty parties.

554
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:21,261
We can rule Preston out
as our murder suspect.

555
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:23,821
We've established that he was under
a Home Detention Curfew.

556
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:26,341
But he can place Halpin
in the caravan park.

557
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:29,381
So that puts Halpin
back in the frame for the abduction.

558
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,781
All right, everyone.

559
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:33,541
I don't want the press
getting wind of this.

560
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:34,661
Could blow up in our faces.

561
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:37,661
Over 100 people say
that they saw Zoe Lindsey

562
00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:39,461
the day that she went missing.

563
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:42,061
Case files, statements, evidence.

564
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:45,021
Anything that might tie Jesse Halpin
to the Zoe Lindsey case.

565
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:49,461
Just to be clear, well,
is DI Ridley back on the team?

566
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:53,821
Mr Ridley is here in the role
of Investigative Support.

567
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:56,581
Temporary consultancy basis.

568
00:37:56,581 --> 00:38:00,461
In case anyone's forgotten,
we've still got a murder to solve.

569
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,781
We were wiped out by foot and mouth.

570
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:13,981
They told us
we had to cull the whole flock.

571
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:16,701
That summer, we were flat broke.

572
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:19,741
And how did Jesse hear
about the job at the caravan park?

573
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,941
Saw it advertised in a local paper,
I think.

574
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:26,981
It was only a summer job.

575
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:30,141
He also visited Dunmore Sands
on a later occasion.

576
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:35,421
Same day, a three-year-old child
was abducted.

577
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:38,581
You're the copper
what questioned him.

578
00:38:38,581 --> 00:38:40,141
The missing child.

579
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:43,581
Her name was Zoe Lindsey.
Jesse had nothing to do with that.

580
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:47,061
He also lied to the police about
his movements that day, Mrs Halpin.

581
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:53,101
He's not even gone to his grave.

582
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:57,141
And you come to my house
and drag it all back up again.

583
00:38:57,141 --> 00:39:00,661
Did Jesse ever mention
a man named Daniel Preston?

584
00:39:00,661 --> 00:39:03,301
What has this got to do
with the murder of my husband?

585
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:05,301
Just answer the question,
Mrs Halpin.

586
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:08,541
Not that I remember.

587
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,981
Now, if we're done here,
I've got work to do.

588
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:20,501
Her husband was murdered.

589
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:22,861
What happened
to compassionate policing?

590
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,821
Oh, come on, she's covering for him,
she must know something.

591
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,581
Is this really about
closing a cold case,

592
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:29,661
or is it actually about getting
one over on Goodwin?

593
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:37,061
This is about a parent
who lost a child 14 years ago.

594
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:38,941
But we've got nothing on Halpin.

595
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,261
Except that he worked there
that summer.

596
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:43,541
Well, maybe it's time we went back
to the crime scene.

597
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:22,741
Penny Lindsey?

598
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:32,341
This was the picture
they used on the posters.

599
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:36,021
She took that doll with her
everywhere.

600
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:38,901
She never let it out of her sight.

601
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,261
She had it with her the...

602
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:48,181
Look, we know it's gonna be
very difficult for you

603
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:49,741
to tell us what happened, but...

604
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:53,221
It helps... somehow.

605
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:56,781
Keeps her alive.

606
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:01,981
Can you tell us what you remember?

607
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:06,421
Er, she'd gone out to play
with her friends.

608
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:11,021
Kids on the park ran wild
in the summer.

609
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:14,941
It was a safe place.
A friendly place.

610
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:16,821
When she didn't come back home
for her tea,

611
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:19,421
I wasn't especially worried.

612
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:22,701
Then it went dark. Still no sign.

613
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:25,741
That's when they started the search.
Sorry, can I...?

614
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:34,421
They said it was neglect.

615
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,021
That I'd been drinking.

616
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:41,341
Even suggested
I might have hurt her. I...

617
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,661
Do you ever remember
seeing this man?

618
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,901
His name's Jesse Halpin.

619
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:56,581
We think he was working here
the summer that Zoe went missing.

620
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,861
Has someone come forward?
Is that why you're here?

621
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:04,101
We're just following up
some routine inquiries.

622
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:07,621
Yeah. He was questioned at the time
by detectives.

623
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:09,141
He was a person of interest.

624
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:13,221
But we all know who took her.

625
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:16,101
It was Daniel Preston.
Can you be so sure about that?

626
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:18,421
Something about him,
it just wasn't right.

627
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:25,501
Then the police found all that stuff
on his laptop.

628
00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:30,501
You know, if I'd known what he was,

629
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:32,381
I'd have never let him
anywhere near her.

630
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:35,861
It wasn't your fault, you know,
what happened.

631
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:40,461
Well, she was my little girl.

632
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:42,341
Hm.

633
00:42:42,341 --> 00:42:43,781
I couldn't protect her.

634
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:54,341
Right, Jesse Halpin.

635
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:58,461
Yeah, took him on for six weeks,
June 2007.

636
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:00,541
You're lucky
I've still got the book.

637
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:06,541
This about Zoe?
Only, I saw you talking to Penny.

638
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:10,741
We had a few questions we needed
to ask her, Mrs Moreland, yeah.

639
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:15,381
She used to leave her with me
in this office. Three years old.

640
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:17,061
Disappear to the pub.

641
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,541
Some days,
she'd even forget to feed her.

642
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,421
Daniel Preston,

643
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:24,701
that caretaker's job,
did you give him that?

644
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:25,981
References checked out.

645
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:29,981
None of us had any idea.

646
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:33,061
And I had a lad of my own
to look out for.

647
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:40,741
Yeah, Adam Moreland.
I remember his name on the file.

648
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:42,781
Well, he was with her
the day she was taken.

649
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,301
Followed him everywhere, she did.

650
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:49,141
And how old was Adam then?

651
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:52,141
Maybe six. Seven.

652
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:54,461
And did the police
take a statement from him?

653
00:43:54,461 --> 00:43:56,581
Well, I know they asked him
some questions.

654
00:43:56,581 --> 00:43:58,821
But they ruled him out
as a credible witness.

655
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:01,421
Oh, might be useful for us
to speak to him again.

656
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:04,141
You know, in light of
some recent developments.

657
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,341
Adam's only just about
getting his life together.

658
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:09,301
It'll do him no good
to go back there.

659
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:15,221
Well, we wouldn't ask, you know,
if it wasn't important.

660
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:25,621
We, er, got that statement
from Steve Parry's mate, sir.

661
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,181
Backed up his alibi.

662
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:29,821
Course he did.

663
00:44:29,821 --> 00:44:32,621
We've got no evidence that ties him
to Halpin's murder.

664
00:44:32,621 --> 00:44:34,301
What about the firearm?

665
00:44:34,301 --> 00:44:36,781
Ballistic report shows it
wasn't the gun that killed Halpin.

666
00:44:37,781 --> 00:44:40,621
Either we find something
solid to charge him with... Fine.

667
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:44,581
Get him signed out.
Sir.

668
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:13,901
I told the police what happened.
Over and over.

669
00:45:15,701 --> 00:45:19,341
Not that it made much difference.
We're listening now.

670
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,341
And what makes you think
I want to talk about it?

671
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:29,501
Well, if it could help us
to find out what happened to Zoe.

672
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:32,621
One more time couldn't hurt, Adam.
Yeah?

673
00:45:39,621 --> 00:45:40,781
It was baking that day.

674
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:43,941
Summer holidays.

675
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:47,781
Zoe said she wanted an ice cream.

676
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:52,621
I'd managed to cadge some money
off someone. I can't remember who.

677
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:55,581
I was stood in the queue
at the prom.

678
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:00,301
When I turned back to look for her,
she was talking to somebody.

679
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,581
He'd pulled up
in a white van by the slipway.

680
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:04,301
Did you recognise the driver?

681
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:05,501
I didn't see his face.

682
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:08,021
But the police said
it must have been Preston.

683
00:46:08,021 --> 00:46:10,141
Oh, yeah.

684
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:11,901
But you couldn't say for sure?
No.

685
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:14,061
But he used his van
when he needed to move stuff.

686
00:46:14,061 --> 00:46:16,021
Did you see what happened to Zoe?

687
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:18,221
By the time I'd bought
the ice cream, I looked back,

688
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:20,381
the van had gone.
She was nowhere to be seen.

689
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:23,741
But you think she got into
that vehicle? I don't know!

690
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,461
It's fine. It's OK.

691
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:28,581
Look...

692
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:32,301
need you to look at this photograph.
Do you recognise him?

693
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:37,981
Should I?
Name's Jesse Halpin.

694
00:46:39,501 --> 00:46:41,461
She'd never have gone off
with a stranger.

695
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,101
We spoke to Daniel Preston.
He's out on parole.

696
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,581
He claims that Halpin
worked at the caravan site

697
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:49,381
the summer Zoe went missing.

698
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:52,021
Preston's out of prison?

699
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:54,621
Just need you to look
at the photograph, Adam.

700
00:46:57,221 --> 00:47:01,661
I've spent 14 years
trying to forget what's happened.

701
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:07,621
Last thing I need is people
like you stirring it all back up.

702
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:10,621
I should get back to work.

703
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:24,701
The investigating team
just assumed the van was Preston's.

704
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:27,701
The van was taken apart.
Not a shred of forensic evidence.

705
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:30,261
Yeah, well, maybe they were looking
in the wrong place.

706
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:33,101
We've still got nothing
that ties this abduction to Halpin.

707
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,341
Haven't we?

708
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:37,541
Those plates that flagged
Halpin up as a possible suspect,

709
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:40,821
they were registered
to a white minivan.

710
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:55,181
We've got a statement
from Gill Moreland,

711
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:57,621
the manager of the caravan park,

712
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:01,661
confirming that Jessie Halpin worked
there for six weeks that summer.

713
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,741
He was probably
just casing the place.

714
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:06,101
Went back a few weeks later
and abducted Zoe.

715
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:11,341
I know this much, while
you've been off chasing shadows,

716
00:48:11,341 --> 00:48:13,941
we're still no closer
to finding out who killed him.

717
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:17,181
You may not remember Gill's son,
Adam?

718
00:48:17,181 --> 00:48:20,461
He was the little boy
who was with Zoe all that day.

719
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:23,021
He remembers her talking to someone
who pulled up in a white van.

720
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:25,501
Daniel Preston's van.
No! He did NOT say that

721
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,301
because he did not see his face.

722
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:32,621
That's the kind of evidence that
would have pushed us towards Halpin.

723
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:35,341
No decent copper
would have missed those connections!

724
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:42,741
You think I haven't questioned
my own mistakes?

725
00:48:42,741 --> 00:48:46,101
The lack of a conviction,
our failure to find her,

726
00:48:46,101 --> 00:48:48,701
every hour she was missing,
every dubious decision.

727
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:51,021
You think it hasn't stopped me
sleeping at night?

728
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:54,981
Well, if mistakes were made...

729
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:58,941
..maybe this is our chance
to put them right.

730
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:05,461
I'll apply for a warrant
to search the farm.

731
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:37,221
Boss!

732
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:59,981
The van was never used.
The clutch was buggered.

733
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:01,861
Should have been scrapped years ago.

734
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:04,701
So why did Jesse keep it locked up,
hidden, out of sight?

735
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,141
Because he was a hoarder.

736
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:09,741
All that junk in the farm yard,
could never throw anything away.

737
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:12,661
We will need to get it
checked over by forensics.

738
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:16,541
You had Steve Parry locked up.
It's him you should be talking to!

739
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:20,181
Oh, yeah, that complaint that
Steve Parry made against Jesse.

740
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:22,661
It was something and nothing.
Something and nothing?

741
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,821
His dog was injured by a snare trap.

742
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:28,461
He shouldn't have been in
them woods. Jesse warned him.

743
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:48,541
Any time now, if we're sharing?

744
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:52,261
You said the crime scene
didn't give us anything.

745
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,381
But it's the one thing
that connects the two cases.

746
00:50:54,381 --> 00:50:58,621
Why was Halpin so desperate
to keep people out of these woods?

747
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:14,821
You check in here.

748
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,341
I'll go down to the shed.
OK.

749
00:51:36,781 --> 00:51:38,101
Lorna?

750
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:42,141
It's DI Farman.

751
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:52,901
It's OK.

752
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:58,781
We just want to talk to you,
that's all.

753
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,461
Put the gun down, Lorna.

754
00:52:09,101 --> 00:52:11,621
Put the gun down,
we don't want anybody else killed.

755
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:16,301
Just put the gun down.

756
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:21,341
That's it. I'll take that.

757
00:52:23,581 --> 00:52:24,821
It's all right.

758
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:32,501
Our ballistics team have confirmed

759
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:35,101
that the shotgun
found in your possession

760
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:38,541
was indeed the firearm used
to shoot Jesse Halpin.

761
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:41,221
Unless you can explain how that
came to be in your possession,

762
00:52:41,221 --> 00:52:43,981
then I have reasonable grounds
to charge you with murder.

763
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:47,861
Well, I took it from the shed.

764
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:48,941
When did you take it?

765
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:53,181
Can't remember.

766
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:56,741
Also recovered were a pair of
Wellington boots from your property.

767
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,701
Sole treads matched those found
at the crime scene.

768
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,901
Well, I found him that morning.
I told you.

769
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:10,541
Well, I think that you killed him
the evening before...

770
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:14,101
..when he was coming back
from the pub.

771
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:16,701
And you left him for dead
on the path.

772
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:19,221
And then you went back the next
morning to cover up your tracks.

773
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:27,261
He said I'd have to leave the farm.

774
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:30,501
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

775
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:32,621
Was this the night he was murdered?

776
00:53:32,621 --> 00:53:34,581
No!

777
00:53:34,581 --> 00:53:37,581
No, it were years ago!
The day she...

778
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:41,941
Lorna, you're not making any sense.

779
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:53,221
He swore it were an accident.

780
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:56,941
Said he never would have hurt her.

781
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:58,141
The little girl.

782
00:54:00,221 --> 00:54:01,901
Zoe Lindsey.

783
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:04,781
Look at the photograph, Lorna.

784
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:13,941
"I were part of it," he said.

785
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:18,301
Made me swear not to speak of it.

786
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:22,541
What did you do with the body,
Lorna?

787
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,301
Hm?

788
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:28,861
I know you want to tell us.

789
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:36,701
We put her in a box.

790
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:41,741
And we buried her.

791
00:55:03,861 --> 00:55:05,021
That tree.

792
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:10,021
Yeah, it was here.

793
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:13,861
We'll need to lock this space down.

794
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:17,221
I've got to check in with Goodwin.
Come with me.

795
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:36,621
You know, my dad used to tell me
these woods were haunted.

796
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,981
Scared me half to death
when I were little.

797
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,221
Maybe he had his reasons.

798
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:51,821
I found a bird
with a broken wing once.

799
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:54,941
It had fallen
out of one of these trees.

800
00:55:56,461 --> 00:56:00,301
I rescued it
and nursed it back to health.

801
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:05,861
And for a while, it was fine,
but then it died.

802
00:56:08,621 --> 00:56:12,461
He told me that the bird
didn't need its body any more.

803
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:19,781
Its soul had flown away
and found someone else.

804
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,621
I don't think you should be here,
you know.

805
00:56:26,701 --> 00:56:28,661
They're looking for a body,
aren't they?

806
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:31,141
Look, I'll take you back
to the house.

807
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,701
What, you think I can stand
to be near her after this?

808
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:51,781
Ridley?

809
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:55,021
Ridley?

810
00:56:56,221 --> 00:56:58,581
We're scanning the site
with a hyperspectral camera.

811
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,021
Could be hours before we find
anything. I'll call you when we do.

812
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:03,141
Thank you.

813
00:57:14,941 --> 00:57:17,061
All right.
Hiya.

814
00:57:18,261 --> 00:57:21,101
Are you all on your own?
Mum went out.

815
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:22,341
Work drinks, or summat.

816
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,061
You doing your homework?
Yeah.

817
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:32,381
How you getting on?
Gonna be a while yet.

818
00:57:33,301 --> 00:57:35,021
Mum!
What?

819
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:36,941
You used to love it
when I mussed up your hair.

820
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,821
Yeah, when I was, like, five.

821
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:45,821
Why don't we order a pizza tonight?

822
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:49,701
Can't really be bothered to cook.
You never cook, Mum.

823
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:56,901
I'm sorry I haven't really
been around much lately.

824
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:01,621
I told Oscar and Jase
you'd been promoted.

825
00:58:01,621 --> 00:58:04,781
Oh, yeah. Detective Inspector.
They said it was kind of sick.

826
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,461
Yeah.

827
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:09,261
I suppose it is kind of sick
when you think about it.

828
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:22,581
You gonna drink that
or just stare at it all night?

829
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:29,461
I saw Michael Flannery.

830
00:58:35,701 --> 00:58:37,621
What is this,
you just prolonging the agony?

831
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:40,101
Punishing yourself.

832
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:42,061
I don't pretend to understand it
myself, Annie,

833
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,501
to tell you the truth.

834
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:48,101
He killed your wife.
Your daughter. My best friend.

835
00:58:50,061 --> 00:58:51,781
He doesn't deserve your forgiveness.

836
00:58:56,581 --> 00:58:59,621
I've been thinking about that young
lad that Ella was going out with.

837
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:00,661
What was his name?
Owen.

838
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:02,821
Owen. Owen. Owen.

839
00:59:02,821 --> 00:59:04,581
I've been thinking about them,
you know?

840
00:59:04,581 --> 00:59:05,901
Would they have got together?

841
00:59:05,901 --> 00:59:07,741
Would they have got married,
had kids?

842
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:10,541
They'd fallen out,
the night of the fire,

843
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:11,901
they'd fallen out.

844
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:16,501
I was down the station.
If only I'd stayed at home.

845
00:59:16,501 --> 00:59:18,021
If only I'd stayed at home.

846
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:22,621
I picked up the phone
to call Kate last week.

847
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:25,701
Something trivial
I wanted to share with her.

848
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:29,821
And then I remembered
that she wasn't around any more.

849
00:59:31,141 --> 00:59:32,461
Still hits me like a punch.

850
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:36,141
Same way it did when
you first told me they were dead.

851
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:40,741
It was me he was coming for, Annie.

852
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:45,541
When Flannery set the fire,
it was unfinished business.

853
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:51,461
It was me who should have burned
that night.

854
01:00:24,581 --> 01:00:26,741
We've recovered
the remains of a body.

855
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:29,021
We've reason to suspect
that it's Zoe Lindsey.

856
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:32,301
"Reasons to suspect."

857
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:33,501
You've got nothing.

858
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:36,821
We've also interviewed
Lorna Spalden,

859
01:00:36,821 --> 01:00:39,341
who told us that
she helped Jesse bury the body.

860
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:45,821
Lorna'd say anything
if you asked her to,

861
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:47,661
if someone put her up to it.

862
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:50,941
Lorna was found in possession
of your husband's shotgun.

863
01:00:50,941 --> 01:00:53,141
The weapon we now know
was used to kill him.

864
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:58,421
Jesse always kept it locked away.
Did Lorna have access to the keys?

865
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:02,221
They were kept on a hook
in the annexe.

866
01:01:02,221 --> 01:01:04,901
She'll be making an appearance
in court later today.

867
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:07,701
We're looking for a warrant
for further detention.

868
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:13,461
Is Catherine home?

869
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,621
You shouldn't be alone
at a time like this.

870
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,301
Catherine's gone.

871
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:24,221
She took off last night.

872
01:01:26,701 --> 01:01:29,021
Why couldn't you have
just left us alone to grieve?

873
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:07,661
Still leaving
a spare key under the mat?

874
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:13,981
The skeletal remains
of an infant child.

875
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,421
Shape of the pelvis would suggest
she was female.

876
01:02:16,421 --> 01:02:19,141
Right, and how long do you think
she'd been down there?

877
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:22,941
I'd say somewhere between
10-15 years.

878
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:25,061
Is this a fracture?

879
01:02:25,061 --> 01:02:26,941
I'm pretty certain
that's what killed her.

880
01:02:28,101 --> 01:02:29,941
Any chance of a positive ID?

881
01:02:31,101 --> 01:02:33,701
I might be able to extract
some mitochondrial DNA

882
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:35,461
from the marrow in the leg bones.

883
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,981
IF Penny Lindsey agrees
to provide us with a swab,

884
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,421
we can run it for a familial match.

885
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:42,861
It would tell us for certain
if they're related.

886
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:47,061
What do you think you're playing at
coming back here?

887
01:02:47,061 --> 01:02:50,741
The police have been round
asking questions.

888
01:02:50,741 --> 01:02:52,981
Jesse Halpin.
Hm.

889
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:54,701
They're saying
it was him that took her.

890
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:59,181
Well, we'll never know now, will we?
He's dead.

891
01:02:59,181 --> 01:03:02,341
The last chance
of clearing your name.

892
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:04,701
I never laid a finger on Zoe.

893
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,461
You know that
better than anyone else.

894
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,341
I need you to tell 'em the truth.

895
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:13,701
What,
that you were with me that night?

896
01:03:15,101 --> 01:03:16,861
Never gonna happen!

897
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:20,421
You know what they'd do
to a paedophile's girlfriend.

898
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,741
Thought I might get a place
round here

899
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:24,461
soon as my parole's up.

900
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:29,101
Get one of them caravans
down near the dunes.

901
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:31,941
Nothing too fancy.

902
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:36,701
We could pick up where we left off.

903
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:41,141
You disgust me.

904
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:45,461
Maybe I'll pass.

905
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:48,701
Place looks on its arse to me.

906
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:10,861
Preston!

907
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:14,501
Adam! No!

908
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:39,461
I was angry.

909
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:41,381
I lashed out.

910
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,981
What was Daniel Preston
even doing in the caravan park?

911
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,501
He'd been to see my mum.

912
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:50,101
Trying to wheedle his way back
into her good books.

913
01:04:50,101 --> 01:04:51,981
Not to mention her bed.

914
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:54,621
Your mum and Daniel Preston?

915
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:59,861
Oh, I knew what they got up to.
Even as a kid.

916
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:05,141
It's the only reason
he got that caretaker job.

917
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:07,381
Did the police know about this
at the time?

918
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:13,501
That she was sleeping with the man
that took Zoe Lindsey?

919
01:05:18,141 --> 01:05:19,701
Is he gonna be OK?

920
01:05:19,701 --> 01:05:22,941
He's got a bleed on the brain.

921
01:05:22,941 --> 01:05:24,901
You'd better hope
that he pulls through.

922
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:44,421
We found the body of a child...

923
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:46,901
buried up on Jesse Halpin's land.

924
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,221
No!

925
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:51,341
You think it might be Zoe?

926
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:54,621
Well, we can run a DNA test

927
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:57,821
to confirm
if there's a familial match. No.

928
01:05:59,181 --> 01:06:01,301
Look...

929
01:06:01,301 --> 01:06:03,141
I know it's gonna be hard, but...

930
01:06:03,141 --> 01:06:04,541
You have no idea!

931
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:11,941
Wouldn't it be easier in the end,
Penny...

932
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:14,821
..to get to the truth
of what happened?

933
01:06:14,821 --> 01:06:17,461
Then she's never coming back.

934
01:06:20,901 --> 01:06:23,341
No.

935
01:06:23,341 --> 01:06:25,261
No, I'm not sure
I'm ready for that.

936
01:06:37,621 --> 01:06:40,101
I lost my wife and daughter.

937
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:47,261
They died in a terrible house fire.

938
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,141
I would do anything...

939
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:53,061
..anything...

940
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:55,821
..to get some answers to...

941
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:02,621
To get some closure, you know?
To move on.

942
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:09,621
How old was she, your daughter?

943
01:07:09,621 --> 01:07:11,861
Ella, she was 19.

944
01:07:15,501 --> 01:07:17,781
You had her for longer
than I had Zoe.

945
01:07:17,781 --> 01:07:19,741
I did, yeah.

946
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:27,061
Anything'd be better than this,
Penny, wouldn't it?

947
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:31,181
Living in some kind of purgatory.

948
01:07:34,781 --> 01:07:36,621
All I want is a swab.

949
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:42,261
Yeah?

950
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:46,501
14 years of hating Preston.

951
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:49,021
But now you're telling me
he might not have taken her,

952
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:51,221
that someone else...

953
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:58,141
The evidence that the police found
on Preston's computer.

954
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:00,901
How did you find out about that?

955
01:08:00,901 --> 01:08:03,101
One of the detectives
must've told me.

956
01:08:05,261 --> 01:08:08,381
It was the woman in charge.

957
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:11,181
DI Dixon?
Yeah.

958
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:28,461
I was very pleasantly surprised
when I got your message.

959
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:30,541
It's been a while
since I've been invited to lunch.

960
01:08:33,181 --> 01:08:35,301
Forensics have discovered a body,
Jean.

961
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,581
It was buried up in Adless Woods.

962
01:08:43,181 --> 01:08:45,941
Lured me here under false pretences.

963
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:48,861
We've also recovered a white van
hidden on Halpin's farm.

964
01:08:50,261 --> 01:08:53,181
The same farm that I pushed you
to search 14 years ago.

965
01:08:53,181 --> 01:08:55,861
We had no solid evidence.

966
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:57,301
You had a first-hand account

967
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,620
of Zoe Lindsey's abduction
from Adam Moreland.

968
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,981
A contradictory testimony
from a seven-year-old child.

969
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:05,780
That you manipulated
to suit your version of the truth.

970
01:09:07,381 --> 01:09:11,981
Daniel Preston took Zoe.
That was always the consensus.

971
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,421
For Christ's sake, Jean.
"The consensus." You were the SIO!

972
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:16,700
And I needed an arrest!

973
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,061
So you found a suitable suspect
and you set about fitting him up.

974
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:24,581
You also shared confidential
information about a murder inquiry

975
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:26,221
with Penny Lindsey,

976
01:09:26,221 --> 01:09:28,181
a mother
who wanted somebody to blame.

977
01:09:28,181 --> 01:09:30,061
I did what I had to do.

978
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:33,061
If you'd gone after Halpin,
Zoe Lindsey might still be alive.

979
01:09:33,061 --> 01:09:36,301
She'd been missing for days, Ridley.

980
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,821
We both know she was already dead!

981
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:52,581
It was a... a moment.

982
01:09:52,581 --> 01:09:54,101
A misstep.

983
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:58,981
You're stonewalled.
You're damaged goods.

984
01:10:00,461 --> 01:10:03,421
I don't need to tell you
how that feels.

985
01:10:04,821 --> 01:10:06,181
Oh, I know.

986
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:09,741
All those years
of distinguished service.

987
01:10:10,901 --> 01:10:12,261
They don't count for much.

988
01:10:16,901 --> 01:10:21,541
Let this go, Ridley.
For old time's sake.

989
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:25,301
Sorry, Jean, I can't.

990
01:10:26,821 --> 01:10:30,861
After all that's happened,
there'll be an inquiry.

991
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:43,061
You were never a team player.

992
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:46,221
That was always your trouble.

993
01:10:54,301 --> 01:10:56,341
We ran tests on the clothing.

994
01:10:56,341 --> 01:10:58,421
Green cotton top.
Polyester trousers.

995
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,541
Both of which were 80% decomposed.

996
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:03,741
No traces of any fibres.
No skin cells. No bodily fluids.

997
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:06,661
Any touch DNA we do lift
is likely to be seriously degraded.

998
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:09,941
So, nothing to implicate Halpin,
then?

999
01:11:09,941 --> 01:11:11,741
Dental X-rays.

1000
01:11:11,741 --> 01:11:13,981
The deciduous teeth
were all still in place.

1001
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:17,101
I can say with near certainty that
this child was under five years old.

1002
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:19,381
Zoe was three when she disappeared.

1003
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:21,501
Now, hang on a minute. Hang on.

1004
01:11:21,501 --> 01:11:23,661
Zoe was missing a tooth
at this point, wasn't she?

1005
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,861
Which immediately rang
alarm bells.

1006
01:11:26,861 --> 01:11:29,861
So, what are you saying,
that there might be some doubt?

1007
01:11:29,861 --> 01:11:33,021
I ran the bone marrow DNA
against the sample

1008
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:34,981
we took from Penny Lindsey.

1009
01:11:34,981 --> 01:11:36,261
They didn't match.

1010
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:39,541
What?!
The body we found isn't Zoe.

1011
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:48,981
The child that you buried
in Adless Woods...

1012
01:11:50,141 --> 01:11:51,861
..wasn't Zoe Lindsey.

1013
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:03,501
You helped Jesse Halpin
bury that child, Lorna.

1014
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:05,341
Why won't you give us her name?

1015
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:11,341
I can't.

1016
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:15,061
We know she died
from a blow to the head.

1017
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:18,741
Were you with Jesse
when he killed her?

1018
01:12:18,741 --> 01:12:21,141
Jesse... Jesse never killed anyone!

1019
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:24,501
She were already dead
when he found her!

1020
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:27,901
But you said it was an accident
the last time we spoke to you.

1021
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:34,501
He told me she'd fallen.

1022
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,781
Climbed up on the tractor
when no-one was looking.

1023
01:12:41,141 --> 01:12:42,501
Wanted to sit with her dad.

1024
01:12:45,901 --> 01:12:49,981
We... We carried her
into the farmhouse.

1025
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:57,461
Laid her out on the table.

1026
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:04,741
Still as stone, she was.

1027
01:13:06,021 --> 01:13:07,981
Moll...

1028
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:10,301
Moll said a prayer to Our Lady.

1029
01:13:12,141 --> 01:13:14,701
The same words over and over.

1030
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,861
"Blessed Mary, pray for us."

1031
01:13:21,181 --> 01:13:23,541
She couldn't live
with what had happened.

1032
01:13:27,581 --> 01:13:29,781
Sent her half mad with grief.

1033
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,621
Let's get into the barn.

1034
01:13:47,621 --> 01:13:49,981
Can you go to the barn as well,
please?

1035
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:51,261
Can you just lock it off here?

1036
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:22,741
Ridley?

1037
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:27,781
There's no sign of her outside.
The team are searching the farm.

1038
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:30,861
How old is Catherine Halpin?

1039
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:34,301
Social services report said
she's 17.

1040
01:15:38,181 --> 01:15:40,101
Zoe Lindsey isn't dead, Carol.

1041
01:15:42,981 --> 01:15:46,621
She's been hiding in plain sight
for 14 years.

1042
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:11,401
I wanted to take her to hospital,

1043
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:12,321
but Jesse said
there'd be too many questions.

1044
01:16:14,281 --> 01:16:16,201
He never trusted outsiders.

1045
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:19,001
He said if we nursed her,
she'd get better.

1046
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,681
But she didn't get better, did she?

1047
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:29,441
But we were blessed
when God brought her back to us.

1048
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:37,481
And the accident that
led to your daughter's death,

1049
01:16:37,481 --> 01:16:39,561
can you remember the date
that it happened?

1050
01:16:40,561 --> 01:16:42,241
June 3rd.

1051
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:45,921
We were cutting the first grass
for haylage.

1052
01:16:45,921 --> 01:16:48,361
And she would have been
how old then?

1053
01:16:48,361 --> 01:16:50,801
She'd just turned three.

1054
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:54,921
But you must have known
she'd be missed.

1055
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:59,401
That people would start
asking questions.

1056
01:16:59,401 --> 01:17:02,081
Only a matter of time, Jesse said.

1057
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:05,161
Yet, he went off
looking for work in Dunmore Sands?

1058
01:17:05,161 --> 01:17:07,001
Where he found our little girl.

1059
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:12,441
Our little lost soul
made flesh and blood.

1060
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:14,561
So you knew he planned to take her?

1061
01:17:18,121 --> 01:17:19,481
He did it for me.

1062
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:24,881
To save me, he said.
She was someone else's child.

1063
01:17:24,881 --> 01:17:29,401
That woman never cared for her,
not the way we did.

1064
01:17:29,401 --> 01:17:33,001
We gave her a good home.
A better life.

1065
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:34,681
Everything she needed.

1066
01:17:34,681 --> 01:17:36,601
Daniel Preston, was he involved?

1067
01:17:40,361 --> 01:17:43,521
Well... we'd heard
he'd been arrested.

1068
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:44,961
We saw it on the news.

1069
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,961
But...

1070
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:48,681
Jesse barely remembered him.

1071
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:51,161
That was handy, wasn't it?
A convicted sex offender.

1072
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,841
The man everyone assumed
had taken Zoe.

1073
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:56,561
Her name's Catherine!

1074
01:17:56,561 --> 01:18:01,081
I take it "Catherine" is none
the wiser about who she really is?

1075
01:18:02,281 --> 01:18:04,841
And Jesse wanted to tell her.

1076
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:06,561
Cos he couldn't live
with what he'd done.

1077
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:09,641
She's all grown up, Moll.
She's got her own life to live.

1078
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:10,921
Will you keep your voice down?

1079
01:18:10,921 --> 01:18:13,161
We keep her locked up here,
she'll start resenting us.

1080
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:15,881
And how do you think she'll feel
if she found out the truth?

1081
01:18:15,881 --> 01:18:17,801
Maybe she deserves to know.

1082
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:19,761
Maybe it's time she was told.

1083
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:21,601
Je... Jesse..

1084
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:25,321
I tried to make him see sense,
to see reason.

1085
01:18:25,321 --> 01:18:29,161
But, no, he wouldn't listen.
He stormed off to the pub.

1086
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:33,361
Like he always did.

1087
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:40,761
So Lorna didn't kill him.

1088
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:42,761
She just took the gun afterwards.

1089
01:18:44,201 --> 01:18:46,081
She was just looking out for us.

1090
01:18:47,761 --> 01:18:49,521
The way she's always done.

1091
01:18:56,561 --> 01:18:57,921
Who's there?

1092
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:10,681
Moll?

1093
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:38,921
I...

1094
01:19:40,321 --> 01:19:43,121
I couldn't lose another child.

1095
01:19:44,121 --> 01:19:48,281
Don't you see? I couldn't.

1096
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:56,681
Moll Halpin, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder

1097
01:19:56,681 --> 01:19:59,281
and also
on suspicion of kidnapping.

1098
01:19:59,281 --> 01:20:02,081
You have a right to remain silent.
You don't have to say anything,

1099
01:20:02,081 --> 01:20:04,241
but anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1100
01:20:23,961 --> 01:20:27,961
She needs to hear this from me,
from her mam.

1101
01:20:38,841 --> 01:20:40,161
You'd do anything...

1102
01:20:42,321 --> 01:20:44,561
..anything to get a child back.

1103
01:20:46,961 --> 01:20:48,961
To fill the void.

1104
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:52,201
It could never justify
what Halpin did.

1105
01:20:52,201 --> 01:20:53,921
No.

1106
01:20:56,121 --> 01:20:57,521
He lost his daughter.

1107
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,441
He thought he was losing his wife.

1108
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:05,521
He must have thought
his whole world was ending.

1109
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:12,841
No, please.

1110
01:21:12,841 --> 01:21:14,841
Catherine!

1111
01:21:14,841 --> 01:21:16,721
I'm so sorry.

1112
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:34,561
I always knew
there was something.

1113
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:38,121
A distance.

1114
01:21:38,121 --> 01:21:40,081
Like they never really knew me.

1115
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:43,361
None of it was real.

1116
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:47,961
They loved you, though.

1117
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:51,481
Despite what they did.

1118
01:21:51,481 --> 01:21:53,081
I mean that was real, wasn't it?

1119
01:21:58,441 --> 01:22:00,121
I don't know who I am any more.

1120
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:06,321
You're Penny Lindsey's daughter,
Zoe.

1121
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:12,841
The child she lost
all those years ago.

1122
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:24,281
That little girl
in all the pictures...

1123
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:26,921
..they stole her away.

1124
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:30,161
She's gone.

1125
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:09,201
Hey. I hope you're not leaving
without saying goodbye.

1126
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:12,281
Oh, I just didn't want to outstay
my welcome, that's all.

1127
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:13,801
OK.

1128
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:16,361
You know,
if you hadn't contacted me,

1129
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:19,401
I would definitely
have come looking for you.

1130
01:23:19,401 --> 01:23:23,161
Still got one more call to make if
you want to come along for the ride?

1131
01:23:23,161 --> 01:23:25,961
No. I think you've got it covered.

1132
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:31,641
I'll catch you later, then, yeah?
Yeah.

1133
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:36,081
Friday night. Italian.
It's a date!

1134
01:24:04,161 --> 01:24:07,321
Hey.
You were missed!

1135
01:24:07,321 --> 01:24:08,801
Great house.

1136
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:14,121
It wouldn't hurt
to do a couple of songs.

1137
01:24:14,121 --> 01:24:15,481
About bloody time.

1138
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,201
One, two...

1139
01:24:47,721 --> 01:24:53,841
# Hold back the night from us

1140
01:24:53,841 --> 01:25:00,121
# Cherish the light for us

1141
01:25:00,121 --> 01:25:06,081
# Don't let the shadows
Hold back the dawn

1142
01:25:09,561 --> 01:25:14,361
# Cold city lights glowing

1143
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:20,561
# The traffic of life is flowing

1144
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:28,921
# Out over the rivers
And on into dark... #

1145
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:48,561
Hi.

1146
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:55,841
# Cold city lights glowing

1147
01:25:56,961 --> 01:26:01,481
# The traffic of life is flowing

1148
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:09,961
# Out over the rivers
And on into dark

1149
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:18,361
# Hold back the night from us

1150
01:26:18,361 --> 01:26:24,881
# Cherish the light for us

1151
01:26:25,841 --> 01:26:31,841
# Don't let the shadows
Hold back the dawn

1152
01:26:36,161 --> 01:26:42,761
# I'm going downtown
Where there's music

1153
01:26:42,761 --> 01:26:48,961
# I'm going where voices
Fill the air

1154
01:26:48,961 --> 01:26:54,561
# Maybe there's someone
Waiting for me

1155
01:26:54,561 --> 01:27:01,281
# With a smile
And a flower in her hair

1156
01:27:01,281 --> 01:27:07,001
# I'm going downtown
Where there's people

1157
01:27:07,001 --> 01:27:13,921
# The loneliness
Hangs in the air

1158
01:27:13,921 --> 01:27:19,481
# With no-one there real
Waiting for me

1159
01:27:20,641 --> 01:27:24,801
# No smile
No flower nowhere... #

1160
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:27,081
'You've reached Kate, Alex and Ella.

1161
01:27:27,081 --> 01:27:28,681
'We're not home right now.

1162
01:27:28,681 --> 01:27:31,401
'But if you leave a message,
we'll get back to you.'

1163
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:41,681
'You've reached Kate, Alex and Ella.

1164

'We're not home right now.
