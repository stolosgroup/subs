00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:04,535
<i>Previously on Smallville:</i>

2
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:17,448
Sweetheart, we can't keep him.

3
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,457
What'll we say?
We found him out in a field?

4
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:23,255
We didn't find him.

5
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,726
He found us.

6
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:28,356
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm from another planet?

7
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:31,332
He can't get within five feet
of Lana Lang...

8
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:33,734
...without turning into
a freak show.

9
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:40,042
- Who's the maniac driving the car?
- That would be me.

10
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:41,339
Lex Luthor.

11
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:45,041
I didn't dive in after Lex's car.
It hit me a 60 mph.

12
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:49,154
Does that sound normal to you?
I'd give anything to be normal.

13
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:51,813
I call it the Wall of Weird.

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,724
It's every strange event that's
happened due to the meteors.

15
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:59,797
That's when it all began.
The town went schizo.

16
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:00,955
What's with you and Lana?

17
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:04,331
Congratulations, Clark.
You're this year's scarecrow.

18
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:06,096
Ah, jeez.

19
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:09,241
Who did this to you?

20
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,877
Doesn't matter.

21
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:28,721
Thanks for the dance, Lana.

22
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:44,060
Is this what you
do with your time?

23
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:50,896
- Where did you get those?
- In that hole you call a room.

24
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,439
- You had no right to go in there.
- You've got a lot of nerve.

25
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:57,769
I'm in a club with Lana's aunt.

26
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:03,143
How will I face Nell, knowing
my son is videotaping her niece?

27
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:07,218
- Is that where you were tonight?
- No.

28
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:13,189
- I was out collecting.
- Two disgusting habits.

29
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,692
Insects aren't disgusting, Mom.

30
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:23,063
Look what has become of you, Greg.
This isn't you.

31
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:27,164
- People change.
- Really?

32
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,572
Monday morning, I'm phoning
Claremont Military Academy.

33
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:33,177
Yeah, right, Mom.

34
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:38,579
I've had it with your behavior.
This time I'm making the call.

35
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:42,118
Hey, who's gonna
take care of my bugs?!

36
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:28,158
Don't worry, guys.

37
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:31,599
I'm gonna take you somewhere safe.

38
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:07,272
No!

39
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,704
No, don't do that!

40
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:14,268
Stop!

41
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,954
No, no!

42
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,435
Greg?

43
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:43,063
Greg! Where have you been?

44
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:45,867
Greg!

45
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:57,432
It's all your fault, Clark.

46
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:00,536
Clark!

47
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:07,814
We're leaving in 15 minutes, and you
haven't done your chores yet.

48
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:25,826
That looks good, I like that.

49
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:32,605
All hail the homecoming
king and queen!

50
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:39,277
Clark! I didn't see you
at the dance last night.

51
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,919
I was...

52
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,717
I was a little tied up.

53
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,381
Hey, congratulations!

54
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,189
I haven't seen an offense
that good since I played.

55
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:52,660
Thank you.

56
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:56,290
I'll get the rest of the boxes
out of the truck.

57
00:09:58,003 --> 00:10:00,096
I'll help.

58
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:01,872
- Lana?
- Thank you.

59
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,536
Kent.

60
00:10:05,444 --> 00:10:09,210
You realize last night
was just a joke, right?

61
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:15,051
- I need that necklace back.
- I don't have it.

62
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:17,480
Look, it's Lana's favorite-

63
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:21,353
Then you'd better go to that
cornfield and find it.

64
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:35,070
Beautiful, isn't it?

65
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:40,367
Greg! I didn't recognize
you without your glasses.

66
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:43,640
You know they only
live for eight hours?

67
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:45,545
Live fast, die young.

68
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:49,245
They're the rock stars
of the insect world.

69
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,855
Could you help me with my Lit paper?

70
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:54,854
Nathanael West assignment giving you
brain freeze?

71
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:57,655
Yeah, it's kicking my ass.

72
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,127
Sure, okay.

73
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:02,665
Great. How about my house,
after school?

74
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:05,531
Library might be easier.

75
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:07,797
It's a date.

76
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:11,540
Lana, your aunt's looking for you.

77
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,084
Hey, bug boy, do me a favor
and quit tailing my girlfriend.

78
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:23,449
You afraid of a little competition,
Whitney?

79
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:27,556
We're not in competition, Greg.

80
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:31,822
If I find out you've been
leaving butterflies in her room...

81
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:34,022
...you'll know about it.

82
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:41,203
Yeah, well, just remember...

83
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:46,140
...sometimes you're the windshield,
sometimes you're the bug.

84
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:04,957
Can't knock your taste in women.

85
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,760
- What happened last night?
- It was just a stupid prank.

86
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,199
You were tied to a stake
in the middle of a field.

87
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,568
Even the Romans saved that
for special occasions. You could've died.

88
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:17,072
I appreciate your help.

89
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:21,042
- I just want to forget it ever happened.
- Hey, Clark, what's the holdup, son?

90
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,410
Mr. Kent, it's good to see you.

91
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,018
Lex.

92
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:30,485
- We've gotta finish up.
- Okay, Dad.

93
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:33,819
At least I got a handshake this time.

94
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,055
Oh, my God! Jonathan!

95
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,761
Clark!

96
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,606
- Clark!
- Clark!

97
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:04,646
- Clark!
- Clark!

98
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:08,643
- Clark.
- Clark.

99
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:37,940
Whitney will be all right. He's got a couple
of cuts and bruises, but nothing serious.

100
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:40,881
- Does he remember anything?
- No.

101
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:46,150
Just that something smashed his truck
and he woke up in the ambulance.

102
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,993
You need to talk to Mom.
I think I really freaked her out this time.

103
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:55,258
You also made her really proud, Clark.

104
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:04,169
Something else happened
to me this morning.

105
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:09,608
When I woke up,
I was kind of floating.

106
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,409
Floating?

107
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,492
As soon as I woke up, I crashed.
What's happening to me?

108
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,594
I honestly don't know.

109
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:29,132
Soon as you start breaking the law
of gravity, we're in uncharted territory.

110
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,792
I just wish it would stop.

111
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,737
Look, Clark, I'm your father.
I'm supposed to have all the answers.

112
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:39,673
It kills me that I don't.

113
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:45,044
But you've gotta have faith.
We'll figure this thing out together.

114
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:50,185
I do, but this is happening to me
and I'm scared.

115
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:55,443
Your form's good, but his gait's off.
You might wanna check his shoes.

116
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:01,921
- Lex Luthor, a friend of your aunt.
- Sneaking up like that...

117
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:04,426
...you're lucky you didn't get kicked.

118
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:09,694
You must be Lana.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

119
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,699
We've already met.

120
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,668
I seriously doubt
I'd forget meeting you.

121
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,332
You were a little preoccupied
at the time.

122
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,774
Not a great first impression?

123
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:25,576
When I was 10, I went to Metropolis
for a riding competition.

124
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,015
Your father invited us to stay over.

125
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:31,883
My aunt said you had an indoor pool.
I went to check it out...

126
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:35,390
...and I found you and a girl
skinny-dipping.

127
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,399
I think you were teaching her
the breaststroke.

128
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:43,534
That was you?

129
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:45,169
Wow.

130
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:48,739
You're all grown up now.

131
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,305
Very impressive.

132
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,041
It's tacky,
but it makes my aunt happy.

133
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,350
- That's an unusual necklace.
- Thanks. It's very special to me.

134
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,925
How come you're not wearing it?

135
00:18:09,094 --> 00:18:11,324
I lent it to my boyfriend.

136
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:15,956
- Lucky guy. What's his name?
- Whitney Fordman.

137
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:20,503
- The kid that Kent saved today?
- Just came back from seeing him.

138
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:23,539
He's lucky Clark was there.

139
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,075
I know the feeling.

140
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,944
Makes you wonder
if you're with the right guy.

141
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:33,448
One chucks footballs,
the other helps save lives.

142
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:37,884
For someone who just moved here,
you've got a lot of opinions.

143
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:44,061
You just seem
more interesting than that.

144
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,330
While you're nursing your boyfriend
back to health...

145
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:50,832
...ask him what he was doing
before the big game.

146
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:58,069
- He was with me.
- Are you sure?

147
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,678
Tell your aunt I stopped by.

148
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:23,659
Greg, what's going on here?

149
00:19:23,835 --> 00:19:25,359
Greg!

150
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,941
I have-!

151
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,419
What's gotten into you?

152
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:44,714
Two million years
of intelligence and instinct.

153
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:50,290
- You stop this right now.
- I can't. See, it's too late.

154
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:53,693
Nature's already taken its course.

155
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:58,928
First I'll eat, then I'll molt.

156
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:03,268
- Then I'll mate.
- You need help.

157
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:11,515
Mom, did I ever tell you
about the farrow spider?

158
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:15,247
It's a fascinating creature.

159
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,878
See, after it hatches...

160
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:23,594
...it kills its mother.

161
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:35,364
Save any lives on your way over?

162
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,100
You keep it up, and you could make
a career out of it.

163
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:42,713
Just dropping off your produce.
Sorry my parents gave you a hard time.

164
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:46,442
If push came to shove,
I would have arm-wrestled them for it.

165
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:48,415
Planning an invasion?

166
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:52,648
- My father gave it to me when I was 9.
- Cool gift.

167
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:56,282
It wasn't a gift,
it was a strategy tool.

168
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:59,794
My father equates business with war.

169
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:04,902
The Battle of Troy started because two
men were in love with the same woman.

170
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:09,765
Kind of like you and the quarterback.
That's why he strung you up in that field.

171
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:11,636
If we're at war, Whitney's won.

172
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,370
You lost one battle, that's all.

173
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:19,279
Besides, I don't believe Lana
is as infatuated as you think.

174
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:25,048
He captains the football team.
The town treats him like a god.

175
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,418
Game over.

176
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:33,258
If you hadn't pulled him out of that
truck, your problems would be solved.

177
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:38,668
I'm kidding, of course.

178
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:43,774
Don't worry, Clark,
I've got your Trojan horse.

179
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:56,310
Clark, you okay?

180
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,586
Yeah, I'm fine.

181
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:12,802
That's a cool box.
What's it made of?

182
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:17,237
Lead. My mother bought it
in a Casbah in Morocco.

183
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:20,276
It was made
from the armor of St. George...

184
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:22,873
...patron saint of Boy Scouts.

185
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:27,075
She gave it to me before she died.
Think she was trying to send me a message.

186
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:29,686
I can't take that.

187
00:22:30,121 --> 00:22:33,488
What is it about Kents and gifts?

188
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:37,025
It's yours. Hand it to Lana
and tell her what happened.

189
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:40,961
Trust me. Once she opens it,
you'll win her heart.

190
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:44,533
That necklace gives
you the power, Clark.

191
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:47,171
All you've gotta do is use it.

192
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:03,979
Where were you before the game
on Saturday?

193
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:08,418
Can we talk about this later?

194
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:11,653
It's a simple question, Whitney.

195
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:14,360
I was warming up.

196
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:18,998
So you didn't grab Clark
and hang him up in a field?

197
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:25,270
Lana, it was just a prank.

198
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:30,010
Can I please have my necklace back?

199
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:35,680
- I lost it.
- Were you planning on telling me?

200
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:38,755
Or was that a prank too?

201
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:54,604
Lana! I thought you'd forgotten.
I've been waiting for, like, an hour.

202
00:23:54,773 --> 00:23:58,174
You remember, the English paper?

203
00:23:58,343 --> 00:24:03,781
Sorry, Greg, something important
came up. Can we do it another time?

204
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:08,286
Are you blowing me off
for your boyfriend?

205
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:10,785
I'm not blowing you off.
I need to see Clark.

206
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,281
Kent?

207
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:18,828
You'd rather spend time with him?
Is he more important than me?

208
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:23,457
Greg, I can't talk about this
right now. I have to go.

209
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:30,027
Lana.

210
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:34,194
Your mom said I could wait here.
I hope you don't mind.

211
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:36,465
This is an amazing place.

212
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:42,278
My dad built it.
He calls it my "fortress of solitude. "

213
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:46,543
- I didn't know you liked astronomy.
- That's a hobby.

214
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:51,587
- You can see my house from here.
- No. Really?

215
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:58,753
We've lived a mile apart all our lives,
and you've never come over.

216
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,955
And you wonder why I'm here now.

217
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,395
Not that I don't enjoy the company,
but yes, I was.

218
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:13,203
I found out about what Whitney did
to you, the whole scarecrow thing.

219
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:18,077
- I came to apologize.
- It's not your fault. Forget about it.

220
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:24,188
I can't. He had no right to do that to you.
And you turn around and save his life.

221
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:27,880
I appreciate you coming over. You're not
the one who should be apologizing.

222
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:33,060
I didn't come here to defend him,
I came here to see you.

223
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:38,961
- Who told you?
- Lex Luthor.

224
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:44,440
Dropped some bread crumbs,
and I followed the trail.

225
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:49,938
I'm glad he did, Clark.
He was just being a good friend.

226
00:26:50,114 --> 00:26:54,278
- You're lucky, it's rare.
- Lex is definitely one of a kind.

227
00:26:57,755 --> 00:27:01,555
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not sure.

228
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:07,665
I thought I knew Whitney. Now I wonder
what else I've been blind to.

229
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:13,463
He even lost my favorite necklace.

230
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:21,409
Can't you get it replaced?

231
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:27,779
Sounds weird, but it's made from a bit
of the meteor that killed my parents.

232
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:32,616
Nell had it made, gave it to me
the day she officially adopted me.

233
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,884
She told me that life is about change.

234
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:39,390
Sometimes it's painful...

235
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:44,866
...sometimes it's beautiful.
But most of the time it's both.

236
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:50,163
I better go.

237
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:56,770
I'm glad you're okay, Clark.

238
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:49,899
Need a hand, Dad?

239
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:53,094
That's the best idea
I've heard all night.

240
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,410
Clark?

241
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:18,225
Clark, what happened?
Are you all right?

242
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,864
There's someone in the rafters.

243
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,720
Dad!

244
00:30:19,757 --> 00:30:22,351
What in the hell just happened?

245
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,768
- I never saw anybody move like that.
- Did you see him?

246
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,598
He came off the ceiling at me.
It was almost as if he-

247
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:39,641
Wasn't entirely human? I saw his face.
I think it was Greg Arkin.

248
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:43,508
You and Pete used to hang out
with him in grade school.

249
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:47,344
- Why would he want to hurt you?
- I don't know.

250
00:30:47,518 --> 00:30:50,715
- Are you still friends?
- I pass him in the halls.

251
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,253
But people change.

252
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:54,891
His mother used to keep him
on a short leash...

253
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,050
...but I can't believe he'd hurt a fly.

254
00:30:57,228 --> 00:31:01,096
Maybe that's because he was too busy
collecting them and every other bug.

255
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:04,894
Kids don't leap off
the ceiling and attack people.

256
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,367
How do you explain that?

257
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:18,037
I don't know, seems kind of out there.

258
00:31:19,317 --> 00:31:25,017
This, coming from the man who's been
hiding a spaceship for the last 12 years.

259
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:33,058
It's not that I don't
believe you, Clark.

260
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:36,359
I'm having trouble getting my head
around this one.

261
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:39,628
You ever wonder why all these
weird things happen in Smallville?

262
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:43,501
Every town has its share
of tall tales.

263
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:46,438
Except here they're all true.

264
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,512
Chloe showed me this wall. It was covered
with all these articles she collected...

265
00:31:51,682 --> 00:31:57,086
...about all the weird stuff that's
happened since the meteor shower.

266
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:59,917
It's all my fault.

267
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:05,552
If you're talking about 50-pound
tomatoes and two-headed calves...

268
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,757
...then I got a better explanation
for you: LuthorCorp.

269
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:14,769
God only knows what that fertilizer plant's
been pumping out over the last 12 years.

270
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:18,136
LuthorCorp. didn't kill
Lana's parents.

271
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:22,075
Neither did you, son.

272
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:25,682
You can't blame yourself
for something you had no control over.

273
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,980
I know. I still feel responsible.

274
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:41,822
What happened to Lana's parents
was a terrible tragedy.

275
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:45,992
But no matter how many
extraordinary gifts you have...

276
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,571
...you will never be able
to change that.

277
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:55,969
- How do I make this feeling go away?
- You can't.

278
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:59,945
But that's what makes you human.

279
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:11,561
<i>Chloe, is Greg Arkin still
a reporter for the Torch?</i>

280
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:16,291
If you're definition of a reporter is someone
who actually turns in articles, then no.

281
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:18,459
Greg hasn't been to the office
for a week.

282
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:22,003
- I've gotta find him.
- What's the sudden interest in Greg?

283
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,767
You coming out
of the entomology closet?

284
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:28,572
It's nothing.
I'll catch up with you later.

285
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:32,273
- I hate it when you do that.
- Do what?

286
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,944
Shut me out. One minute you're here,
and the next you're gone.

287
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:40,215
Are you outgrowing me as a friend?

288
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:44,953
I could never outgrow you.
Other than vertically.

289
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:48,860
It's amazing how far
that Kent charm will get you.

290
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:51,159
Now what's up with Greg?

291
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:54,264
I found an article
about Amazonian tribesmen...

292
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:56,873
...who took on traits of the insects
that bit them.

293
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,636
But nothing as extreme as what you
were talking about. You have any luck?

294
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:03,713
Only that Greg didn't move here
until after the meteor showers.

295
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:05,110
So he wasn't exposed.

296
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:08,480
But his bugs could have been.
Think about it.

297
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:11,053
Pieces of that meteor
are buried all over Smallville.

298
00:34:11,222 --> 00:34:12,484
The habitat is infected.

299
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:18,596
So when boy catches bugs and bugs
bite boy, you end up with "bug-boy. "

300
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:21,864
Look, you can't even walk out your door
in the summertime...

301
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:23,933
...without being bitten by a mosquito.

302
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:27,265
Why don't we have a whole town
of "bug-people"?

303
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:30,999
You need a high level of toxins
to cause a mutation.

304
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:35,578
Those Amazonian tribesmen
were all attacked by swarms.

305
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:38,682
Greg did keep tanks of bugs
in his room.

306
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:42,013
Maybe they got sick
of the view and revolted.

307
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:44,984
According to this,
bugs have a very short life cycle.

308
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:50,719
So if he really has gone Kafka, let's
hope he isn't in the mating phase.

309
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:54,721
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

310
00:34:58,403 --> 00:35:01,964
It's a mess. Remember what
a neat freak his mom was?

311
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,404
Yeah. She used to make us
take off our shoes.

312
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,441
One time I forgot, and she yelled at me.

313
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:08,340
Is that what broke up the friendship?

314
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:11,573
His parents got divorced,
and he stopped calling.

315
00:35:11,749 --> 00:35:14,775
Which sucked.
He had a killer tree fort his dad built.

316
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:17,581
- It was okay.
- Clark never liked it.

317
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,780
He used to get dizzy
just walking over there.

318
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,823
- How come?
- He was afraid of heights.

319
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:24,793
I didn't believe it was structurally sound.

320
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:26,988
You guys, come here.

321
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:32,301
Oh, man, that's disgusting.

322
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,236
- What is it?
- It's skin. He must be molting.

323
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:39,843
You guys better come in here.

324
00:35:40,011 --> 00:35:42,172
Guys?

325
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:51,650
Looks like you're not the only one
in Smallville with the hots for Lana.

326
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:54,917
I think Greg's found his mate.

327
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:20,848
Lana!

328
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:34,723
Your aunt said you were out here.

329
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:37,561
- How you feeling?
- Better.

330
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:40,663
That's not why I'm here, though.

331
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:46,140
Lana, when I saw you and Clark outside
your house that night, I freaked out.

332
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:50,372
What did you think we were doing?

333
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:55,383
I guess I got scared
and did something stupid.

334
00:36:55,553 --> 00:36:58,147
I would do anything to take that back.

335
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:03,416
It's too late, Whitney.
She's mine now.

336
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:05,255
Greg?

337
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,761
Get away from her.

338
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:12,227
- Greg, what's going on?
- It's time.

339
00:37:12,403 --> 00:37:14,394
Time for what?

340
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:17,067
For us.

341
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:30,148
Lana!

342
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:33,416
Lana!

343
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:37,254
- Greg's got her.
- What happened?

344
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:39,692
I'm not sure. Greg threw me
against the wall...

345
00:37:39,864 --> 00:37:41,764
...like it was nothing and grabbed Lana.

346
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,493
- I've never seen somebody that strong.
- Where did he go?

347
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:47,661
- Off into the woods.
- I know where he's going.

348
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,501
- I'll drive.
- You know the old foundry?

349
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:52,802
That got hit by the meteor shower?

350
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:55,673
Follow the dirt track,
100 yards back, there's a tree fort.

351
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:57,178
How do you know he's there?

352
00:37:57,348 --> 00:37:59,339
Greg collected bugs there
when we were kids.

353
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:01,883
Look, Kent, I want to apologize-

354
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,604
- Get away from her.
- Greg, I know what's happened to you.

355
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:26,574
- Then you know that I've been freed.
- No, you're a slave to your instincts.

356
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:29,907
I have no rules, Clark.

357
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:32,811
I eat what I want...

358
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:35,578
...I go where I want...

359
00:38:35,753 --> 00:38:39,883
- ... and I take what I want.
- You're not taking her.

360
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:43,458
- Then try and stop me.
- You're not the only one who's changed.

361
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,460
You haven't changed at all.

362
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:58,796
You still get sick around
this place like when we were kids.

363
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:05,470
Did you know the Buffalo ant can
lift 30 times its own body weight?

364
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,987
Clark!

365
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:29,492
Clark, where are you?
Come on out.

366
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,897
I just wanna play.

367
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:42,072
Clark, please...
Come out!

368
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:44,737
It's lined with lead.

369
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:54,747
Give it up, Clark.
You can't fight natural law.

370
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:59,028
Only the strong survive.

371
00:41:04,368 --> 00:41:07,428
Did you think you could hide from me?

372
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:17,944
Greg, watch out!

373
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,521
It's okay. It's me.

374
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:05,253
- Whitney?
- You're safe. You're safe. Come on.

375
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,589
Whitney, is that you?
