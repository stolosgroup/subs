1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,011
We're fighting a war to protect Nassau

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,679
in which our most effective weapon

3
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,766
is the fear that we can
instill in our enemies.

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,602
Everything is dependent upon that gold,

5
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,989
and right now it is sitting in a
fort with no guns and full of holes.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,941
You couldn't figure out
how to repair the fort,

7
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,693
so you lured me into capturing a
ship full of slaves to do the job.

8
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:31,029
I wonder if you can help me
locate an old friend of mine.

9
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,864
His name is Charles Vane.

10
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,950
I am to set sail for the West Indies,

11
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,368
the one element I lack

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,953
is someone who understands Nassau.

13
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,454
If you agree to be that person,

14
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,123
your sentence will be commuted

15
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,507
and the charges against you released.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,043
Crew of the Walrus, surrender,

17
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,045
and I am authorized to offer you full,

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,297
unqualified pardons.

19
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,384
We're not fighting and
we're not surrendering,

20
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,518
so what are we doing?

21
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,266
We're going that way.

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,269
That's a ship killer.

25
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,254
Captain.

26
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:18,089
He's closed the gap.

27
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,064
All hands to quarters.

28
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,767
Come on, lads. Rouse yourselves.

29
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:32,187
Quickly!

30
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:37,644
I've got starboard watch below,

31
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,730
caulking the gunports.

32
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,765
The pumps are keeping
up with the water-line,

33
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:42,900
but given what's ahead of us,

34
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:44,935
I don't imagine that'll last long.

35
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,493
Heave, lads!

36
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,710
He'll be withdrawing soon.

37
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:10,761
He'll drive us into the storm,

38
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:13,597
but he'll want no part of it himself.

39
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:16,767
Captain, perhaps we could
take the topgallants in now.

40
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:19,102
If we enter that storm under full sail,

41
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:21,471
it may become impossible
to take the canvas in.

42
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:24,141
If we take at least some of them now...

43
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,526
If he sees us slow,

44
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,477
if we show him the least sign of weakness,

45
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,696
it'll only encourage him to
press on and finish the job.

46
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,984
But we'll get men into the tops.

47
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:36,987
Soon as he turns, we'll
shorten sail immediately.

48
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:38,488
Aye, Captain.

49
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,873
I want crew aloft!

50
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,325
Quick as you can!

51
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:44,878
Taking and stowing all that
sail will be a challenge.

52
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:46,914
You'll see to leading the men in the rig

53
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:50,167
when the time comes, yes?

54
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,085
Yeah.

55
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:53,720
I'll pull all hands from below.

56
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:55,672
We'll need all the strength we can muster.

57
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:11,605
We should have taken the pardons.

58
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,576
Sign our name, swear to whomever

59
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:17,578
or whatever the fuck one
swears to on the occasion,

60
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,029
accept the pardons,

61
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,697
then go straight back to the account.

62
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,449
What the fuck could they do to us

63
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,868
they weren't gonna do anyway?

64
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,204
I don't imagine Hornigold's
offer still stands,

65
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:29,373
if that's what you're asking.

66
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,092
No, I don't imagine it does either,

67
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,461
but a few hours ago
when the offer did stand,

68
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:37,097
perhaps that should have
been a conversation...

69
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:39,383
Accept the pardons with
full intent not to honor it

70
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:41,935
rather than face what we now face.

71
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:43,971
The men, I understand.

72
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:45,973
Flint had them exactly
where he needed them...

73
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:48,725
Angry, resentful, afraid.

74
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:51,645
I understand why they would
rather do battle with that storm

75
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,698
than even consider
surrendering to Hornigold.

76
00:06:56,902 --> 00:06:59,786
But he had me there too.

77
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:03,240
He had me there.

78
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:06,076
And that is not supposed to happen.

79
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,949
May I help you?

80
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,535
The governor requests your
presence on the quarterdeck.

81
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:49,836
You should dress.

82
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:56,960
You'll have to pardon me.

83
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:59,046
I've never had a proper chambermaid before.

84
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:01,932
Is that how they address
all their employers?

85
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:07,104
Governor Rogers is my employer.

86
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,890
You are a convict in need of
someone to keep your things clean,

87
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,142
your movement restricted,
and your door shut.

88
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:14,644
As such, you're the first
daughter of privilege

89
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:17,898
I have been able to serve
while speaking my mind openly.

90
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,983
I would have thought my
story is well told by now,

91
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:21,201
but I come from no privilege.

92
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,653
Don't you?

93
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:26,656
My understanding is that your
father built a criminal enterprise

94
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,376
and you inherited it.

95
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,661
The only difference between you

96
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:36,216
and the ladies I have
served in the past is...

97
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:38,635
their families had better lawyers.

98
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:43,223
Let's not keep the governor waiting.

99
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,427
The HMS Milford.

100
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:50,430
150 soldiers, 60 guns.

101
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,149
My lead naval escort.

102
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:56,153
Uh, behind her, the HMS Rose. 48 guns.

103
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:58,989
The HMS Shark, 30 guns,

104
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,825
the Willing Mind. 20 guns.

105
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,860
She's carrying two thirds
of the farming implements

106
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,362
and most of our foodstuffs.

107
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:08,031
The Buck. 18 guns.

108
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,083
The amount of energy it took

109
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,702
to persuade my investors to fund this,

110
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:15,589
it's hard to properly convey.

111
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,427
This fleet, every ship at sea,

112
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:23,463
every man contracted, every penny lent.

113
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:26,850
I am personally answerable for all of it.

114
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:29,102
I'm impressed.

115
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:31,138
Though somehow I don't imagine

116
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,690
that that's what this exercise
is intended to accomplish.

117
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,194
The Gloucestershire.

118
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:39,362
I wasn't entirely sure I needed her,

119
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,231
but seeing as it was someone else's money,

120
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,533
I figured it couldn't hurt.

121
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:47,120
She's the one I can do without.

122
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:51,992
The moment I believe you are no
longer necessary to this endeavor,

123
00:09:52,044 --> 00:09:53,827
you go on that ship,

124
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,996
that ship turns back for London,

125
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:59,216
and soon thereafter,
you swing over Wapping.

126
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:02,419
Except that you can't actually
do any of those things.

127
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,222
No? Why?

128
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:09,392
'Cause you don't know that Samuel
Wayne has never once paid for a drink.

129
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,178
Because you don't know
that the Boyd brothers

130
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,229
can't be in the presence of anyone

131
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:14,064
from Captain Moulton's crew.

132
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,932
'Cause you don't know which
of the street merchants

133
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:18,318
is in the pocket of the brothel madam.

134
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:21,404
You don't know. You don't know...

135
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,607
you don't know.

136
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,193
But I do.

137
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:28,745
To slay Nassau, you must know her.

138
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,198
And amidst all those ships

139
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,583
and all these men and all that money,

140
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:36,036
I am the only one who can introduce you.

141
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:39,039
Provided you tell me the truth.

142
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,295
So let us assume those are
now the rules of the game.

143
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:49,299
I need to know everything
you know of Nassau.

144
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:51,351
If you withhold, if you manipulate,

145
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:54,638
if you lie... you die.

146
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:00,310
Shall we begin?

147
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,700
- 500 pieces.
- Yes.

148
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:13,990
You want to withdraw 500
pieces of eight from your share.

149
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:15,408
That's correct.

150
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,461
You were just here two days ago.

151
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,247
Yes.

152
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,633
To withdraw 500 pieces. It
was dispersed, was it not?

153
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:24,751
Yes.

154
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:26,970
- But you're back for more.
- Yes.

155
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:31,391
What in God's name did you spend
500 pieces on in two days' time?

156
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,843
Oh, I lost it.

157
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:36,846
Lost it? As in through a wager?

158
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,657
No. "Lost it" as in I had it in a sack

159
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,236
and I put it down,

160
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:44,272
and when I came back to pick it up,

161
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,523
it weren't where I put it.

162
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:48,302
Lost.

163
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:56,711
- Would you like me to...
- Thank you.

164
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,458
The crew has entrusted the captain and I

165
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:05,577
to watch over the prize
gold and to protect it

166
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,913
in all our interests, yeah?

167
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:12,334
Now, as your quartermaster
and as your friend,

168
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:14,336
I feel duty bound to suggest

169
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:17,306
that you reconsider
withdrawing sums this large

170
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,308
without a better plan for keeping it

171
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:21,560
once it's withdrawn, yeah?

172
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:23,262
Yes.

173
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:24,930
Good.

174
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:28,066
Now, is there a lesser amount

175
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:31,854
you might want to begin with for today?

176
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,689
Well, 500 pieces.

177
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:35,274
500 pieces. Why not?

178
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,942
- I need a new sack as well.
- Obviously.

179
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,911
Yeah.

180
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,779
Yes?

181
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,368
Mr. Featherstone,

182
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,121
may we have the room for a moment, please?

183
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:06,688
These are identical.

184
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,807
350 pieces on both sides,

185
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:12,110
yet one I can fit in the palm of my hand,

186
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:14,279
and the other is currently occupying

187
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,282
the entirety of the
vault beneath your fort.

188
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:20,068
Which of the two would you
rather have in your possession

189
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,287
the day Spain or England arrives

190
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:25,407
and sets its eyes on conquering that fort?

191
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,795
Yeah. I have that.

192
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,664
So I suppose what we ought to do

193
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,300
is ensure that the fort is not conquerable,

194
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,336
which, as good fortune would have it,

195
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:38,136
is what I'm doing.

196
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,005
You cannot truly believe that is possible.

197
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:42,341
You know as well as I do

198
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:43,976
that so long as that gold is sitting

199
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:45,477
in the belly of that fort,

200
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:47,145
we are doubly exposed.

201
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,349
Losing the fort guarantees
the loss of the gold.

202
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,901
Excuse me. What are you suggesting?

203
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,354
That we exchange it.

204
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:58,273
As much of it as possible.

205
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:00,525
Find partners and trade coin

206
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:03,528
for commodities far easier
to move and to protect.

207
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,448
If Nassau falls, we will
have something to set aside

208
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,200
to ensure our futures.

209
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:11,169
"Our"? Who?

210
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:13,956
Mine. And Anne's.

211
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:17,459
Lovely. Good old Jack gets
buried beneath a pile of rubble

212
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:20,212
while you two begin a
well-funded life of leisure.

213
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:21,214
I didn't say that.

214
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:23,015
It's bad enough the only
time I get to see her

215
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,550
is when she comes here to relay
something that you're displeased with.

216
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:27,886
Now we're just accepting
that if forced to choose

217
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:32,024
between a long future with
you and a short one with me...

218
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,560
there's no chance she'll
even consider the latter.

219
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:37,896
Of course she will choose you.

220
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:46,622
The fort is going to fall.

221
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:50,959
Tomorrow. Next week. Someday.

222
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,078
And I do not believe for a moment

223
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,246
that you are stupid enough

224
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:56,548
to let yourself be buried beneath it

225
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:57,582
when it does.

226
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:02,421
It will pain her to leave me behind...

227
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:05,507
What we have shared these past few months,

228
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,928
it will be very hard.

229
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,981
But you...

230
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:16,435
without you, there is no her.

231
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,941
I am here in part to secure my own future.

232
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:25,160
I will not apologize for that.

233
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:28,497
But that is not why I'm asking
you to cooperate with me.

234
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:32,451
I am asking because though I
know we have our differences,

235
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,920
I know there is one thing we share.

236
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,625
We both love her.

237
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:47,799
Let us make sure her
future at least is secure.

238
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,576
Heave!

239
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:28,256
Stand ready!

240
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:45,250
Ah!

241
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:46,334
You don't need to be doing this.

242
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:48,086
I can finish it.

243
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,422
I'm useless to 'em up top.

244
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:52,390
Gotta do my part somehow.

245
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:54,426
You shouldn't talk that way, you know.

246
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:57,312
We got our share of
useless fucks on this crew.

247
00:17:57,347 --> 00:18:00,432
You ain't one.

248
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,651
This is the second time
in the last few months

249
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:05,020
I'm facing certain death.

250
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:07,572
And you are again offering moral support.

251
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,107
Does that mean we're married?

252
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,786
Don't.

253
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,622
Fuckin' hell.

254
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:26,091
What part of "let us take care
of you" did you not understand?

255
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,952
If it wasn't for you,

256
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:31,129
we'd all be planted at the
bottom of the Charles Town bay.

257
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:33,682
We got a debt for that.

258
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:37,219
It ain't right not to let us pay it.

259
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:39,855
All the shit we been
through the last few months,

260
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,640
do you wanna know what
the most terrifying part

261
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:43,358
of all of it's been?

262
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:47,229
"We'll take care of you."

263
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,199
I get it.

264
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:53,068
Do you?

265
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,654
'Course I do. Look at me.

266
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,656
I know what it's like to be afraid

267
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:01,293
of being the one ain't
strong enough to stick.

268
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:03,962
But it don't work that way, yeah?

269
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,081
And even if it did,

270
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,466
it wouldn't work like that for you.

271
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,070
Captain!

272
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:31,523
We're standing by!

273
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:33,441
The rig won't hold!

274
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:36,161
We must break the sails
before we lose the mast!

275
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:45,453
Take down the course
and the topgallants now!

276
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:48,123
Now!

277
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:50,292
Now! Now!

278
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:05,285
Billy! Get those topgallants up!

279
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:09,561
Rogelio, is the halyard running free?!

280
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:11,613
It's stuck!

281
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:15,617
It's bound up by the
mast! It's not coming down!

282
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,306
At first, when my father
left, I only watched.

283
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,892
My guardian, a slave
belonging to my father,

284
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:41,110
ran the operation in his stead.

285
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,279
Eventually, I felt it
was time I stepped in.

286
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:45,365
How old were you at this point?

287
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,818
I was 17.

288
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,320
How does one persuade an island

289
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:51,404
full of thieves and murderers

290
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:53,573
to respect the authority
of a 17-year-old girl?

291
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,126
I identified the one
they were most afraid of

292
00:20:57,162 --> 00:21:00,330
and I threw him off the island.

293
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:02,799
What was his name?

294
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,335
His name was Edward Teach.

295
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,006
You're getting all of this, yes?

296
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,344
Um...

297
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:16,846
please. Continue.

298
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:19,566
He sailed at the head of a pirate fleet

299
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,317
with a man named Benjamin Hornigold.

300
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:23,102
I conspired with Hornigold,

301
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:25,271
offered him control of Fort Nassau

302
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:26,573
to turn against Teach.

303
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:30,193
Eventually, I isolated him
from all of his former allies

304
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:32,412
until it was just him and his protיgי,

305
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:35,448
a young captain he had
groomed in his image,

306
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,183
trained as a peerless fighter.

307
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:41,204
Had they stayed together,
they might have resisted me.

308
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,423
But the protיgי turned?

309
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:47,260
Yes. And once he'd sided with me,

310
00:21:47,295 --> 00:21:50,346
Teach had no choice but to withdraw.

311
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:52,682
After that, my credibility
with crews on the beach

312
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,550
was in good order.

313
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:56,386
And the protיgי, what was his name?

314
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:00,106
His name was Charles Vane.

315
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:04,727
Leave us, please.

316
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:08,781
Now.

317
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:24,580
I need very specific answers
to the following questions.

318
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:27,000
Ask me what you want to ask me.

319
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:30,003
Charles Vane sided with you?

320
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,220
Yes.

321
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:33,056
Betrayed his mentor,

322
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:36,309
betrayed Edward Teach for you?

323
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:37,510
Yes.

324
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:41,064
You were...

325
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,349
I was fucking him.

326
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:48,905
Where are you going?

327
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,857
To inform the captain
of the Gloucestershire

328
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:51,909
he's about to head home.

329
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,276
Plus one passenger.

330
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:54,527
You never asked me.

331
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,779
- I needed to ask?
- I never lied.

332
00:22:56,781 --> 00:23:00,083
I was fully prepared to set foot
on that island and say his name,

333
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:01,834
say that the universal pardon

334
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,338
had an exception, put
my credibility at risk

335
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:07,173
based solely on your counsel,

336
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,293
and it was all to settle a personal feud

337
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:14,297
with a former lover?

338
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:15,548
Why did you bring me here?

339
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
You know these men's names,

340
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:19,435
you know the things they have done.

341
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:22,105
But I know them.

342
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,774
I know Flint is dangerous,

343
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,776
but he can be reasoned with.

344
00:23:26,811 --> 00:23:28,561
I know Rackham is devious,

345
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:30,313
but all he cares about is his legacy.

346
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:33,066
And because I have
history with Charles Vane,

347
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:34,817
I know him most of all.

348
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:37,653
I'm all too aware what he
is capable of destroying

349
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:41,574
when he sets his mind on it.

350
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:43,946
I underestimated him and I lost my father.

351
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,163
The Lord Governor Ashe underestimated him,

352
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:48,127
and Charles Town burned.

353
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,666
What is it you would like
to have him take from you?

354
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:58,307
Why, in God's name, would I trust you?

355
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,398
Nassau is my father's house.

356
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:09,018
It is my birthright, and I am obligated

357
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,772
to see it set right, to
see its monsters driven out.

358
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:15,942
You don't have to trust me

359
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:18,861
because we have mutual self-interest.

360
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:24,700
And that makes for better partners.

361
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,771
Captain.

362
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:48,141
I understand why you are here,

363
00:24:48,193 --> 00:24:50,893
and I understand why this troubles you.

364
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:54,530
But they do not understand.

365
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,953
In the interest of getting this
done as quickly as possible,

366
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:01,954
perhaps it would be better

367
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,991
if all our roles were more clearly defined.

368
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:09,829
To avoid unnecessary and
uncomfortable confusion.

369
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:04,267
A man puts a dead thing in the ground,

370
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:07,637
he expects it to stay there.

371
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:11,474
Sometimes it comes back.

372
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,960
I harbored such resentment

373
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:32,295
in that moment all those years ago

374
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,630
when you turned your back on me...

375
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,999
though I sailed countless leagues with you,

376
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:39,168
fought countless battles with you,

377
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,053
taught countless lessons to you...

378
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:46,976
and you did it all for a girl.

379
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,744
Good to see you, old friend.

380
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:14,670
For years, I've laid my head down at night,

381
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,038
and no matter where I was,

382
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,258
there was an odor would
arrive at my nose...

383
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:22,545
Brine and hides and pitch and shit.

384
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,880
The perfume of this place.

385
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:29,602
Across eight years and as many wives and...

386
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:32,021
so many distractions.

387
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:35,057
Oh, then I meet wife number nine.

388
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,969
And to my surprise, I
stop thinking about Nassau.

389
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:42,648
The smell goes away.

390
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:48,070
For almost three weeks.

391
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:53,075
And then news comes across my door

392
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:55,244
that there are no more Guthries in Nassau.

393
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:58,914
One dead, the other in chains.

394
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:03,886
It seemed a sign it was time I returned.

395
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:06,505
They're both dead.

396
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:09,308
Really?

397
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,811
I heard that the spectacle
of Eleanor Guthrie's trial

398
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:14,096
could go on for months.

399
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:17,350
They are both dead.

400
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:19,318
Mm.

401
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:26,492
What happened between she and I,

402
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:29,278
our role in forcing you out of this place,

403
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,281
it's in the past.

404
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:33,582
So if you returned

405
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:35,584
looking to gloat about how it turned out

406
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,287
or looking for some
sort of apology from me,

407
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,206
then you can go fuck yourself.

408
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:41,674
Forced me out?

409
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:44,210
Is that the story you've been
telling yourself all this time?

410
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:45,878
That's how I remember it.

411
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,464
All I remember... A
young man's poor judgment

412
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:50,049
which forced me to
choose between killing him

413
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:51,884
and walking away and letting him live.

414
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:54,103
Not quite the same thing.

415
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:55,771
If you think I've been sitting around,

416
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:57,807
waiting for an apology all this time,

417
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,475
I don't know what to tell you.

418
00:28:59,477 --> 00:29:01,560
Then why are you here?

419
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:06,399
Whose is that?

420
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:07,533
What?

421
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:09,735
Man-of-war out there.

422
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:11,987
I assume that's the ship Flint
used to sack Charles Town.

423
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,072
It's here and he isn't.

424
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:14,657
I'm just asking whose it is.

425
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,375
Ours.

426
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,935
So don't get any fuckin' ideas.

427
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:25,251
Who's "ours"?

428
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:26,886
I have partners.

429
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:29,505
In a compact toward the
common defense of this place.

430
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:32,007
Provide a stipend to
the crews on the beach,

431
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,727
in exchange for their agreement
to follow our lead in battle,

432
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:37,263
should the need arise to defend the island.

433
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:39,014
Mm.

434
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:47,857
Smells differently than I remember.

435
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:49,358
Maybe it's changed,

436
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,277
or maybe I've just been
misremembering it all this time.

437
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,246
Let's go.

438
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:56,415
Where?

439
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:58,551
I'd like to meet these partners of yours.

440
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:07,426
Get up there! Slack off the truss lashing!

441
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:09,095
Get it moving!

442
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,213
Cut it loose if you have to!

443
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:04,266
Keep her steady!

444
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:05,651
Hold fast, men.

445
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,277
Knockdown!

446
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:30,176
Whoa!

447
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,432
Bub!

448
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,824
Captain! Captain!

449
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:04,076
With that topgallant loose,

450
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:06,161
it'll drive us into the sea!

451
00:32:06,163 --> 00:32:09,632
We must reduce the windage, or we'll sink.

452
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,637
Give me another block!
Give me another block!

453
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:20,092
Look out!

454
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:21,760
Gah!

455
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:24,480
Aah! Aah!

456
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:26,148
Oh, my fucking leg!

457
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:30,069
Pull 'em out!

458
00:32:30,104 --> 00:32:31,403
Get out!

459
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:36,325
Come on. Here, here, take my hand.

460
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:30,724
Help! Help!

461
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:52,434
Hey! Help!

462
00:33:52,436 --> 00:33:54,186
Help!

463
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:57,189
Help! Help!

464
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:33,419
Help! God... !

465
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,341
They say the worst of it don't last long.

466
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:50,385
What the water does to
you once it's got you.

467
00:35:52,606 --> 00:35:56,892
It makes you cold, makes you scared.

468
00:35:56,944 --> 00:35:59,945
It shows you things. Bad things.

469
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:04,733
But then it warms you.

470
00:36:04,785 --> 00:36:06,869
It settles you.

471
00:36:06,904 --> 00:36:09,488
It shows you the places you've been.

472
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:15,911
Like the people you've loved.

473
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,466
They're all there waiting for you.

474
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:28,590
It doesn't sound so bad.

475
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:30,342
Fuck.

476
00:36:30,394 --> 00:36:31,593
Come on.

477
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:44,439
Fuck...

478
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,445
Oh, fuck.

479
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:52,865
Hey! Wait!

480
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,584
Take my... God... God, come on!

481
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:03,625
Come on, come on, please!

482
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:08,680
Ah, God!

483
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,218
No.

484
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:20,642
Fuck!

485
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:23,312
Aah!

486
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:34,289
Fuck!

487
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:40,495
Fuck! Fuck!

488
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:04,820
Found that. At the inn by the bar.

489
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:07,406
Oh, I know. Mr. Warren
misplaced it yesterday.

490
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:10,242
No, that one we found
in the privy yesterday.

491
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:12,911
This is the new one he was dispersed today.

492
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:16,615
Are you certain?

493
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,834
Just how fucking stupid,
exactly, are your men?

494
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,722
It's hard to say.

495
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,740
Ah, to a momentous return.

496
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,660
A man of your ability and experience

497
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,779
will be a most welcome addition

498
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,198
to our ranks.

499
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,667
Jack.

500
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,369
Rackham.

501
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,956
That's my name.

502
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,341
You were the scrawny one...

503
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,343
who was trying so desperately

504
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,211
to join Charles' first crew.

505
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,098
Flint I can understand,

506
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,767
but this is your third partner?

507
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:17,219
Jack took the Urca de Lima prize.

508
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,271
Transported it, secured it.

509
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:21,690
He's been employing it to
provide for Nassau's defense.

510
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,110
Nassau, as I'm sure you recall,

511
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,896
lacks the will to form an identity.

512
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,063
It is and always has been

513
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,281
fragments of an idea,

514
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:30,699
and without identity...

515
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,997
An organized defense?

516
00:39:32,132 --> 00:39:33,119
Near impossible.

517
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:36,739
The stipends...

518
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,408
create an obligation to follow one command

519
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,544
in the event of a threat to the island.

520
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,880
Captain Flint, as the island's
most able naval tactician,

521
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,465
would command our forces on the water,

522
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:50,002
and Charles would captain the
militia to defend the land.

523
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,588
Why?

524
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,757
Beg your pardon?

525
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,310
Why are you so determined to defend Nassau?

526
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,598
Because Henry Avery set his camp here

527
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,433
and said, "This is a place for free men."

528
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,820
And because you sailed from
here and made this place feared.

529
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:10,656
Because Henry Jennings
and Benjamin Hornigold

530
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,075
and Sam Bellamy gave Nassau life.

531
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,994
And you think your name
belongs on that list.

532
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,947
Yes, I understand.

533
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,282
Captain Teach?

534
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,793
We hear you're taking on new men.

535
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,261
We'd like to join you.

536
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:39,301
If you please.

537
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,641
When I was a young man in this place,

538
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,028
it was a settled notion that in
order to join a crew of any repute,

539
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:51,981
one had to prove his worth.

540
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,484
Two men, evenly matched, bare fists,

541
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,319
the only measure of difference between them

542
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,989
being the measure of their will.

543
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:04,243
Now all a man need do is say "please."

544
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,417
You want us to fight each other for this?

545
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,430
I had such hopes for this place

546
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,015
when I heard the Guthries had gone.

547
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,517
Thought it had a chance to
return to what it once was,

548
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,352
return to that state.

549
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,022
But now I see there's
no hope of that anymore.

550
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,107
You have taken away

551
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,159
the one thing that made Nassau what it was.

552
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,863
You have given her prosperity.

553
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:44,366
Strife is good.

554
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,870
Strife makes a man strong.

555
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,956
For if a man is capable
of confronting death daily,

556
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,424
functioning in the face of it,

557
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,093
there's no telling what
else that man can do,

558
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:55,878
and a man whose limits cannot be known

559
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,547
is a very hard man to defeat in battle.

560
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:02,351
Now I look around me and
I see crews filled with men

561
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,354
who've only ever won a
prize through surrender.

562
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:09,358
I see captains who ought to
have been deposed months ago

563
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,061
keep their office because
their men are comfortable.

564
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:15,397
I see decay everywhere.

565
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:19,318
Now, I returned to go on
the account as I know it.

566
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,237
I returned because in this place

567
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,457
I believed I could find
the men necessary to do so

568
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:28,827
and, in particular, one
man that I thought worthy

569
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,548
of standing alongside me at
the head of a terrible fleet.

570
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,836
I wonder if he's still here.

571
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:33,392
Now, listen.

572
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,978
I am committed to defending the gold,

573
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,197
the fort, this place,

574
00:43:38,232 --> 00:43:39,982
to preserving it for an age.

575
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,283
I owe that to my partners.

576
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,284
I owe it to myself.

577
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,620
I cannot imagine failure.

578
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,656
But I cannot deny the
potential for it either.

579
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,744
You will organize the exchanges...

580
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,495
Gold for things of equal value,

581
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,713
yet small and light.

582
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:56,048
Mr. Featherstone and I

583
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,583
will facilitate moving the gold

584
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,003
from the treasury in secret
to the site of each location.

585
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,638
You will keep it quiet.

586
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,175
Only as many men as it takes
to secure the transactions.

587
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,676
I don't like how any of this looks,

588
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,429
our scurrying about, stashing
things away in dark places

589
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,431
like fucking rodents
preparing for the winter.

590
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,682
And most critically,

591
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,350
I do not want my partners,

592
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,487
Captains Flint or Vane, to hear about it.

593
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,856
If either of them catches wind of this,

594
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,574
shit, I don't know.

595
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,827
Just keep your mouth shut about it.

596
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,257
What did you say to him?

597
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:39,458
Tell me the truth.

598
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,427
What did you say to
make him change his mind?

599
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,684
You and I spoke of what will likely happen

600
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,687
the day England returns to this place.

601
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,689
We spoke of how I must stay.

602
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:57,192
Must find a way to enter into their world,

603
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,195
and I believe you would
want to enter it with me.

604
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,897
I believe that in this moment

605
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,066
you cannot fathom leaving me.

606
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:09,204
But if we are honest with each other,

607
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,656
I think we both know...

608
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,907
Stop.

609
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,710
Sooner or later, the day is going to come

610
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,662
when, no matter our feelings,

611
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,381
the world will demand that you and I...

612
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:47,969
We'll be heading into the wind!

613
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:51,923
Things'll get rougher!

614
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:53,475
Captain!

615
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,227
There's nothing more to be done.

616
00:45:55,262 --> 00:45:57,596
We should heave to, ride it out below.

617
00:45:57,648 --> 00:45:59,981
Hornigold knows our last position.

618
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:02,317
They'll be patrolling downwind.

619
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:05,237
The storm'll blow us right to him.

620
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:09,524
Head up now... Close as you can.

621
00:46:09,576 --> 00:46:12,661
Captain, this is mad!

622
00:46:12,696 --> 00:46:16,031
Billy, make it so.

623
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:21,870
You two, man the starboard braces.

624
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,293
You heard, man the braces!

625
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,426
Hold it. Hold it.

626
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:31,851
Got to close the hatch.

627
00:47:31,903 --> 00:47:33,436
Close the hatch!

628
00:47:35,991 --> 00:47:37,940
Where's the captain?

629
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:40,169
Not that I anticipate it will
alter your behavior in any way,

630
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:43,973
but you should know I
do not approve of this.

631
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:47,894
I know what I'm doing.

632
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:50,680
Like most of London, I read your memoir.

633
00:48:50,682 --> 00:48:54,267
Marveled at your privateering exploits.

634
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,351
It was quite a story.

635
00:48:55,403 --> 00:48:58,855
But I hear things.

636
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:02,692
Certain details of your grand voyage,

637
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:04,911
rash decisions and the
terrible injuries that followed,

638
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:07,914
the scars of which are...

639
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:10,416
left out of the pages of your account.

640
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:14,598
But perhaps harder to erase elsewhere.

641
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:22,762
Were you so confident then as you are now?

642
00:49:27,018 --> 00:49:30,019
Captain Hornigold. Welcome aboard.

643
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:33,806
Mr. Dufresne.

644
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:35,057
I have news to relay, sir,

645
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,809
but first, I'm sorry,

646
00:49:36,861 --> 00:49:39,979
I must address a rumor I've
heard since my arrival here,

647
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:43,449
a rumor most troubling about a fugitive

648
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:46,736
that you've made a part of your endeavor.

649
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:54,410
Jesus.

650
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:55,461
I would introduce you,

651
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:56,746
but, uh, from what I understand,

652
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:58,414
you're quite familiar with one another.

653
00:49:58,466 --> 00:50:00,750
Respectfully, that woman
is not to be trusted.

654
00:50:00,802 --> 00:50:02,084
I know,

655
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:05,087
but perhaps I don't need to trust her.

656
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,006
And, by way of context,

657
00:50:07,058 --> 00:50:10,143
I don't much trust you either.

658
00:50:10,178 --> 00:50:12,929
Let's assume you'll each
be a check on the other,

659
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,264
and I'll count myself fortunate.

660
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:17,600
What news, Captain?

661
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:21,154
I engaged Captain Flint as promised.

662
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:24,824
When he and his crew
declined my offer of pardons,

663
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:26,993
I pressed my advantage and drove him,

664
00:50:27,028 --> 00:50:29,245
already battered, into a tempest.

665
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,114
When it subsided, I
patrolled the area extensively

666
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:35,117
and recovered several
pieces of fresh debris.

667
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,119
Debris? What kind of debris?

668
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:39,505
The definitive kind.

669
00:50:43,211 --> 00:50:46,128
Captain Flint is dead.

670
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:33,002
We're not moving.

671
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:07,253
Where are we?

672
00:53:07,288 --> 00:53:09,088
The storm drove us east

673
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:11,173
into the Sargasso Sea.

674
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:13,509
We are becalmed.

675
00:53:13,544 --> 00:53:14,710
Stores?

676
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:15,711
Most of the fresh water

677
00:53:15,763 --> 00:53:18,214
was lost in the flooding in the storm.

678
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:19,882
The food that could be salvaged,

679
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:21,967
we have a few days.

680
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,185
Maybe a week.

681
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,639
How far to the nearest coast?

682
00:53:29,193 --> 00:53:31,477
At our current speed?

683
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:33,831
About three times that.

684
00:53:35,283 --> 00:53:37,498
Unless the wind returns soon...

685
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:41,471
we won't survive this.

686
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:58,771
