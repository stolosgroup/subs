If it is removed in the
light of this threat,

Flint's standing ultimatum

worry you that it might appear weak?

But to remove it in this moment

hard thing to define,</i>

329
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:23,479
which makes it such an easy label

330
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,197
to affix to one's enemies.

331
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:31,092
Once it had been applied to Thomas,

332
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:36,990
once our relationship had been exposed,

333
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,878
defiled, scandalized...

334
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:43,815
everything ended.

335
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:51,138
There were times that I was persuaded

336
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,473
to sue for peace since then,

337
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:56,143
but that was the day

338
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:58,671
that on some level I knew...

339
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:02,124
that England was broken...

340
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:08,539
and that sooner or later a
good man must resist it.

341
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:14,495
I don't know what to say.

342
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:16,214
You don't need to say anything.

343
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:19,833
You asked me where I began,

344
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,928
and I felt that you were
entitled to an answer...

345
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:25,472
To the truth.

346
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,825
I appreciate that.

347
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,005
And I am genuinely sorry.

348
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,318
But you can see how this
might be of particular

349
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,053
and immediate concern for me.

350
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:43,988
I can?

351
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:47,793
Well, before today I knew of two people

352
00:21:47,794 --> 00:21:49,503
who managed to truly know you,

353
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:53,289
to gain your trust, to be your partner,

354
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:56,502
and they both ended up dead
while playing the role.

355
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:59,004
- Now, wait a minute...
- Now you're telling me

356
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,840
there's a third member of this class,

357
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,342
making it even less credible
to characterize Mr. Gates'

358
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:05,799
and Mrs. Barlow's deaths as bad luck.

359
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:09,313
It would seem that those
closest to you meet their end

360
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:11,559
not just during their relationship,

361
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:14,876
but because of it.

362
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:18,289
<i>And as I sit here, I'm acutely aware</i>

363
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,158
there may be no one closer to you

364
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,559
in the world right now than I.

365
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,161
What exactly are you saying?

366
00:22:23,162 --> 00:22:27,499
That I've somehow sought
out my own tragedies?

367
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,167
Did you not tell me that
our darkest motives

368
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:32,003
will conceal themselves from us?

369
00:22:32,004 --> 00:22:33,838
Cloak themselves in whatever they must

370
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,107
in order to move us to action?

371
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:38,509
<i>And even if that's not true,</i>

372
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,344
<i>a pattern is a pattern,</i>

373
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,347
and only a fool ignores one

374
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:45,116
because he does not care
for the implications.

375
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:49,453
So you see yourself as a potential
fourth member of this class,

376
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,789
concerned that your association with me

377
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,924
will lead to your end.

378
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:57,582
My association with you
began out of necessity,

379
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:00,320
but I've come to find

380
00:23:00,321 --> 00:23:01,799
a great deal of respect for you.

381
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:04,469
Perhaps even friendship.

382
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,521
Hmm.

383
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,348
Which is why I find myself
unnerved by the thought

384
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,314
that when this pattern

385
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:19,066
applies itself to you and I...

386
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:23,896
that I will be the end of you.

387
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:26,195
Is that so?

388
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:27,958
Well, the three who preceded me

389
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,602
all had one thing in common.

390
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,294
They were vulnerable to you.

391
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,464
Had more to lose than you,

392
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:37,351
less means with which to
protect themselves than you.

393
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:41,438
Until recently, I thought
that was me as well,

394
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:44,425
but now...

395
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:48,811
I don't know that it is anymore.

396
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:51,481
It is natural for men new to power

397
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:54,150
to assume that it has no limits.

398
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:58,072
Trust me. It does.

399
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:01,925
We agreed that I would select a man

400
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:04,494
<i>to be responsible for
making a direct move</i>

401
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:07,830
<i>against Captain Hornigold
once the battle begins.</i>

402
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:09,765
<i>I chose Mr. Dobbs.</i>

403
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:11,485
You chose Dobbs?

404
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:14,871
Why the fuck would you do that?

405
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:16,873
It's a dangerous errand...

406
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,584
It's more than dangerous.

407
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,478
The entirety of our plan
rests on its success.

408
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:24,313
Why would you assign it to a man

409
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:26,348
harboring who knows what sort
of resentment against you?

410
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:27,911
Because it isn't resentment.

411
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:30,152
If you had disciplined him,

412
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:31,153
he would resent you for it,

413
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:32,889
but towards me...

414
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:35,508
I don't believe he feels resentment.

415
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,501
<i>I believe he feels shame</i>

416
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,208
<i>for having disappointed me</i>

417
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:46,235
and a great need to redeem
himself in my eyes.

418
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,170
Send someone else.

419
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,186
It's done.

420
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,433
He knows.

421
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:54,142
Were I to replace him now,

422
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,077
it might provoke the
response you wish to avoid.

423
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,120
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

424
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:01,872
if Mr. Dobbs takes this
opportunity to betray you...

425
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,446
<i>to betray us...</i>

426
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:14,712
this battle will be over
before it ever begins.

427
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:22,604
Flint sent you to kill me,
yet instead, you surrendered.

428
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,356
Why?

429
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:28,171
I sailed with that crew for months.

of those fucking savages

over a man who was supposed
to have been their brother.

432
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,117
Truth is, they didn't
give a shit about me

433
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:39,453
except that I did their bidding,

434
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,484
so now I'm ready to see it end,

435
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:44,723

many men from Nassau in my life,

which can be taken at their word.
