1
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:08,752
There is a place not far from here

2
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:11,022
where you could be feared and respected.

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,524
Eight men who support
Hamund. You said it yourself.

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:16,060
<i>We kill him, they all
become threats to both of us.</i>

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:19,313
<i>They disappear all at once tonight.</i>

6
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,783
Between you and Flint, I'm not
certain who I should be more afraid of.

7
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,653
- Leave with me.
- I've spent my life trying to build something here.

8
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:29,040
- (sobbing)
- What if I forgo payment for the schedule

9
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:30,741
in exchange for my share of the prize?

10
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,943
When the time comes for me
to reveal the last piece,

11
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:34,278
I will be right by your side.

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,630
It wasn't Singleton that stole the page.

13
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,582
<i>- It was him.
- You're lying to them.</i>

14
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,951
If no one knows, everyone wins.

15
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:43,137
I believe in this place.
If there's anyone who can do

16
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:45,956
what's necessary to make it
something better, it's you.

17
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,292
Once we have the money, Flint dies.

18
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:51,262
- No argument.
- Not from me.

Mr. Rackham, a word.

I've been expecting you, please Sit.

29
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,567
Won't you tell me what you
think of our little production?

30
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:11,402
The theme is "Evenings in Paris."

I'll give you three
guesses whose idea it was.

32
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:16,073
Mr. Rackham, I just saw the bursar.

33

He says I'm no longer to
receive my distribution

34
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:21,128
of the house's profits. Your instruction?

35
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:23,414
Yes, I did some rough
calculations to figure the amount

36
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:26,417
you've been skimming from the take
since we first began this arrangement.

37
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:29,503
It only seems fair to garnish
your proceeds to account for it.

38
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:32,923
(laughs) Mr. Rackham, I
understand your new friend

39
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:35,009
has helped to bring the girls into line,

40
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:39,313
<i>has them reporting their
income in a most honest fashion.</i>

41
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,465
<i>That must be very nice for you.</i>

42
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:43,967
But let us get something very straight.

43
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,604
I'm not one of the girls.

44
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,472
I will have my cut

45
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:51,942
or everyone in this street will
know what became of Mr. Noonan.

46
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:57,114
- You would do that?
- Don't you dare doubt it.

47
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,453
Well, Mrs. Mapleton, that sounds
like gross insubordination to me.

48
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:04,821
That, coupled with the graft
you've been responsible for,

49
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:07,541
leaves me with no choice but to
terminate your employment here.

50
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:10,044
- What?
- You're dismissed.

51
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,096
Thank you for your service.

52
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,997
Pardon me, but have you lost your mind?

53
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,933
Not that I'm aware of, no.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,636
I just told you that I am fully willing

55
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:20,854
to inform every merchant in Nassau

56
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,174
that you murdered your way
into ownership of this place.

57
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:26,944
They will band together to see you hanged.

58
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,396
Which ones exactly?

<i>Which merchants will
see Mr. Rackham hanged?</i>

60
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,953
Mr. Connors the wheelwright?

(laughing)

62
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,074
Or perhaps Mr. Peterson the butcher.

63
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:45,913
Maybe Mr. Rusch the lapidary?

64
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:48,699
<i>They all have enjoyed
steep discounts here lately.</i>

65

Affordable now that the
books are in good order.

66
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:55,372
I wonder, given their fondness
for the new management,

67
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,426
which one of them would much care
what you think happened to Mr. Noonan?

68
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:02,212
You forgot the only
name that matters, dear.

69
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:05,048
The lady across the street.
She finds out about this...

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,601
Oh, Madam Guthrie knows.
She's fine with it.

71
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:10,688
But by all means, go ahead, tell her
again. I can't see any harm in it.

72
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,994
<i>You will regret this, sir.</i>

73
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,913

You do not believe she will
attempt to strike back at you?

78
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:32,343
I wouldn't put it past her.

79
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,546
But at the moment I'll live with
the potential for future trouble

80
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:38,349
over the certainty of actual
trouble she was causing.

81

To a profitable venture.

82

And a partner significantly
more pleasing to the eye.

<i>Help you move around better.</i>

What's that?

My own reconnaissance.

120
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:40,697
There are a dozen bays and inlets
within a day's journey from here

121

<i>that will make reasonable locations
for the Urca to take on water.</i>

If the course you write
down leads to one of them,

123
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:48,238
odds are that your information is accurate.

124
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,324
And if it doesn't?

<i>(thunder crackles)</i>

Division Bay.

The course leads to Division Bay.

128
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,284
Shoals on the eastern shore,

129
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,119
but if we approach from the windward,

130
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,288
we should be able to take
up a strong opening position.

131
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:42,459
Take this to Mr. De Groot.

132
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,428
Tell him to adjust our course accordingly

133
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:46,463
and set up our final
approach for the morning.

134
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:50,934
Something else?

135

Well, now that I've fulfilled

A new course.

Captain Hornigold asked me to sit in

161
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,356
on Captain Lawrence's final
preparations before departure.

162
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,491
<i>They're just finishing upstairs.</i>

163
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:13,443
Mm.

164
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,330
I'm fine.

165
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:18,949
Believe it or not, this
place didn't collapse

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,367
the moment you walked out the door.

167
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:24,087
You really believe my
concern is for this place?

168
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:29,960
It's a ship killer out there.

169
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,963
I can't even imagine what
it's like further north.

170
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:36,266
You'd been opposed to hunting
the Urca from the beginning.

171
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,603
Perhaps God's on your side of this one.

172
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:45,508
I just think of all the trouble
that fucking schedule caused.

173
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,611
The trouble it caused Max and I.

174
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:49,029
Caused you and I.

175
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:51,865
The thought that it could all
end up being for nothing...

176
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:55,535
Perhaps the trouble was
going to happen anyway.

177
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,737
Schedule or no.

178
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:59,856
Perhaps.

179
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:02,959
Tomorrow a thing that you conceived

180
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,628
out of thin air becomes real.

181
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,913
<i>A thing that will give this place</i>

182
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:10,000
<i>a chance to find some
small measure of peace.</i>

183
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:12,669
That is not nothing.

184
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:17,841
<i>(thunder rumbles)</i>

185
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:21,511
Henderson?

186
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:22,929
It wasn't Henderson.

187
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:25,765
It was something like
Henderson. Harrison? Harvey?

188
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,234
I don't know who the
fuck you're talking about.

189
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:29,903
The man that nicked that
bottle was called Cregg.

190
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:31,938
Cregg! That's him. Cregg.

191
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,242
Mr. Cregg. Carpenter's mate.

192
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:38,161
Had a nose for sniffing out booze

193
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:40,113
on a prize ship like a fucking bloodhound.

194
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:43,750
Oh, Cregg. I remember
walking in on him once,

195
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:46,402
digging through a stash on a prize.

196
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:49,206
(laughs) He...

197
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:51,908
he found this bottle of
booze behind a baseboard.

198
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,962
Now he's convinced that the prize
captain's been hiding his best liquor.

199
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:59,933
So he pops the cork and takes this big swig

200
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,301
in front of all of us.

201
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:04,087
- And it was piss.
- It was piss.

202
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:06,973
(both laughing)

203
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,760
Aye, Cregg.

204
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,529
- Oh, God.
- Flint: Oh, Cregg.

205
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:14,314
I brought him over with me, you know.

206
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:16,449
We served together under
Avery when we was kids.

207
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:19,102
Huh. He was my first bunkmate.

208
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:22,789
For years he went on how he'd got this

209
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:26,993
huge stash hidden away.

210
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:28,795
And I should live to survive him

211
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,331
because one day I will be a rich man.

212
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:35,752
As you know, we lost him on the Pembroke.

213
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:39,973
So I open his locker and what do I find?

214
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:44,477
12 pesos, a busted pocket watch,

215
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,796
and a letter with instructions

216
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:48,631
to deliver it to his sister in New York.

217
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:51,735
<i>Lying sack of shit</i>

218
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:53,904
was Mr. Cregg.

219
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:58,575
<i>So I bought the boys
a round with the pesos,</i>

220
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:00,660
<i>traded the pocket watch for a bit of tail,</i>

221
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:03,646
<i>and spent two weeks that winter in New York</i>

222
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:07,083
trying to deliver that
fucking letter to his sister.

223
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:09,169
Looked high and low.

224
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,755
Never found her.

225
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:14,324
<i>So on the way home,</i>

226
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,092
<i>I waited till we were in open water</i>

227
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,594
<i>and I could see no land in any direction,</i>

228
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,963
and I dropped it over the side.

229
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,516
Returned to the sea.

230
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:33,560
There are no legacies
in this life, are there?

231
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:38,865
No monuments. No history.

232
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:43,370
Just the water.

233
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,358
It pays us

234
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,660
and then it claims us.

235
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:53,880
Swallows us whole.

236
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:59,002
<i>As if we'd never been here at all.</i>

237
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:08,812
Well...

238
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,647
I better be getting back.

239
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:24,110
<i>(door creaks, closes)</i>

(men grunting)

242
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,415
How the fuck can you cut Mapleton
loose without even telling me?

243
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,767
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware you
were her attorney in this matter.

244
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:50,387
She'll run her mouth all over
the fucking island about Noonan.

245
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:53,273
Who cares? The only people who
could conceivably make trouble for us

246
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,942
are currently elbow deep in
free prostitute downstairs.

247
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,261
What's worse, you keep
counsel with a whore about it.

248
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:00,196
Wait, what?

249
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:02,065
You think you can trust her, you dumb shit?

250
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,616
That's what this is about? Max?

251
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:05,452
You fucked her, didn't you?

252
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,153
Jesus H. Christ. I can't win with you.

253
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:09,622
She's in the camp with the
men and it's, "Come on, Jack",

254
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,958
let's go kill everybody and see
if we can't get her out of there.

255
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:13,576
"Hope you don't mind. Made
that decision on your behalf."

256
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,778
And now she's out, making us
a small fortune, by the way,

257
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,447
and you're pissed off about that, too.

258
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:19,999
Might you consider making up your
fucking mind about it, please?

259
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,551
- Fuck you, Jack.
- "Fuck you, Jack."

260
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,420
Yes, I know. Fuck me.

261

Listen here!

263

When we crest the point ahead
and spot the Urca in anchor,

264
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:07,223
we'll begin our final run at her.

265

<i>- Take it.

<i>of confusion before the captain
identifies us and opens fire.</i>

267
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:15,865
So we'll close fast on her,

268
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,867
hammer her well with our guns,

269
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:20,286
and then take the fight to her decks.

Check our position.

280
00:20:22,016 --> 00:20:23,766
- This is the course.
- Well, check it again.

281
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,818
Captain, this is the
location you requested.

282
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:59,218
Your true manifest. Your false manifest.

283
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:01,688
And, most importantly, your bribe money.

284
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:03,022
Godspeed, Captain.

285
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:05,558
Perhaps we should go over
the details one more time.

286
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:08,010
The harbormaster's name is Singer.

287
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,779
The foreman's name is Smith.

288
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:11,447
The warehouse manager's Clay,

289
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,782
and the customs man is Kent.

290
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:15,184
<i>Now if you don't let me board my ship</i>

291
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:16,786
<i>and leave this place,
none of it will matter</i>

292
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:20,189
as the goods in my hold will
be rotten by the time I arrive.

293
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,375
- Goodbye.
- Godspeed.

294
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,032
I have to hand it to you,

295
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:32,001
you said you'd rebuild things
here without your father,

296
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:34,203
and damned if you didn't do just that.

Still one step yet to accomplish.

298
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:40,927
Removing my father entirely.

299
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:42,378
Excuse me?

300
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,097
I know he's out in the Underhill estate.

301
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:46,015
If you think he isn't
scheming to undo everything

we've done here, you're kidding yourself.

You are truly amazing.

304
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,605
In a moment when stability is at
hand and the world is at your feet,

305
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,608
your first instinct is to go out
in search of someone new to fight.

306
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:57,560
Captain, a moment.

307

God.

308
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,782
Can't believe you left
me for that old lady.

309

00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,289
Someone has taken over the fort.

320
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:45,491
<i>(cannon fire continues)</i>

321
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:59,639
Captain, after an inventory of our stores,

322
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:01,507
the men have assented to your plan.

323
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:04,143
Provided we find a suitable
place to land the Walrus,

324
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:05,978
you'll have two days to send out scouts

325
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:07,847
and hopefully locate the Urca.

326
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:11,067
Given their mood, I'd say we
were lucky to get that long.

327
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:14,520
Do it, then.

328
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:21,244
- What?
- It's Mr. De Groot.

329
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,496
He's put his foot down.

330
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,948
Once we make landfall, he
wants Flint tried immediately.

331
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:27,784
Oh, Jesus.

332
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:30,286
He's bitter about the fact that we
didn't listen to him regarding the cook.

333
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,754
He says there's no Urca out here

334
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:33,656
and that justice has
been delayed long enough.

335
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:36,209
That's not gonna happen,
so let's discuss reality.

336
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:38,327
He said that you'd say that.

337
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:40,847
And after all your talk,
you're just protecting Flint.

338
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,266
I'm protecting all of us.

339
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,101
These men are right on the edge

340
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:46,502
and he wants to rile them up more

341
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:48,671
by talking about a lying, thieving captain,

342
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:51,841
then stand on a deserted beach
and talk about an election.

343
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:54,977
Before you know it, half a dozen men
will have laid claim to the captaincy.

344
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:56,813
Camps will divide.

345
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:59,148
It won't be dark yet
before the fighting starts.

346
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:03,853
We're gonna see Flint pay for his crimes.

347
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:06,405
But we'll do it at home

348
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,242
and we'll do it like civilized men.

349
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,994
That's how we avoid the abyss.

350
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:16,249
We knew you spent the
night drinking together.

351
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,718
How can we take you at your word?

352
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:24,173
You don't have to take my word.

353
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:32,565
Good enough for you?

354
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:36,352
Mr. Gates...

355
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,990
<i>Logan: Sails!</i>

356
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,575
To the south!

357
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,327
Is it the Urca?

358
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,083
Captain, is it her?

359
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:53,369
Captain, is it the Urca?

360
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:59,575
Man-of-war! She's a man-of-war!

361
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,260
<i>Spanish banners!</i>

362
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:02,929
In less than half an hour,
she'll be right on top of us.

363
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:05,014
Get orders to the Ranger.

364
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:06,849
Tell her to raise the black

365
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,468
and fire two shots over our bow.

366
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,754
<i>- Mr. De Groot.
- Captain?</i>

367
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:13,973
<i>Rig a spring to the forward
anchor, then drop her immediately.</i>

368
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:15,892
Drop anchor?

369
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:17,560
You mean to fight her?

370
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,562
You all have your orders!

371
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:26,702
Captain, join me.

372
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,405
- We don't have time.
- Make time.

373
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:37,630
If he engages that ship
in battle, we're dead.

374
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:39,131
- I know.
- I know you know.

375
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:41,167
But does Mr. Gates?

376
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:50,125
I can't let you go down this road.

377
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:52,261
As far that man-of-war knows,

378
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:55,014
we're Spanish merchantmen
under attack by pirate raiders.

379
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:56,816
We order the Ranger to flee,

380
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,401
the Spaniard passes us to give chase,

381
00:25:58,468 --> 00:26:00,436
and before she realizes her
error, we've got her trapped.

382
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,104
She's got 100 guns.

383
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,857
We do this properly, she'll
never get a chance to use them.

384
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,359
We'll rake her stern to bow,

385
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:07,910
the Ranger will rake her bow to stern.

386
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:09,662
With a little luck, we'll
hammer her into submission

387
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:11,247
before she can bring
her broadsides to bear.

388
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:13,482
To accomplish what, exactly?

389
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,369
The Urca. She's here. Can't you see that?

390
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,754
All I can see is an empty bay,

391
00:26:18,822 --> 00:26:20,256
a guardacosta warship,

392
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:22,258
and a captain that's lost
his fucking grip on reality.

393
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:24,460
Guardacosta? You think
that ship's here on patrol?

394
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:26,929
That she just happened by
this place at this time?

395
00:26:26,997 --> 00:26:28,514
That ship is an escort.

396
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,882
It's the only explanation.

397
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,435
The Urca has no escort.

398
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:35,337
Was that not the justification
for this entire endeavor?

399
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:37,607
They altered their plans.
Found a ship they could spare.

400
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,727
I'm taking the Ranger and I'm leaving.

401
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:44,113
What did you just say?

402
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,033
I'm gonna weigh anchor and
I'm gonna make a run for it.

403
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:48,401
If I can keep ahead of it before dark,

404
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:50,236
there's just a chance we can slip away.

405
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,406
Without the Ranger, I have
no chance against that ship.

406
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,375
I know.

407
00:27:01,581 --> 00:27:04,884
So you're deliberately
challenging my authority here?

408
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:07,336
Deliberately violating your duty?

409
00:27:08,922 --> 00:27:11,590
My duty?

410
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:15,311
My duty is to them, not to you.

411
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:17,680
Although I have violated it more times

412
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:19,482
than I can remember in your defense.

413
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:21,651
<i>Helped you deceive good men</i>

414
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:24,403
who put their trust in
me because I was convinced

415
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,405
they would be better off for it.

416
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,691
Well, not here. Not this.

417
00:27:28,742 --> 00:27:30,743
This is fucking madness.

418
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,328
Mr. Gates, if you walk through that door

419
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:34,196
with the intent of subverting my plans,

420
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:37,750
I will have no alternative but to
interpret that as an incitement of mutiny.

421
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,402
You think I'm inciting mutiny?

422
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,755
- You are inciting mutiny.
- I'm managing one!

423
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,240
There are men out there right now

424
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:46,592
that know about Singleton,

425
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:49,095
the book, the cook, all of it.

426
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:52,715
They know. And they mean
to see you hanged for it.

427
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:56,251
You told them?

428
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:58,253
After Billy, I just...

429
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:01,891
I didn't want to believe you could be
capable of doing something like that.

430
00:28:01,942 --> 00:28:04,527
But I couldn't convince
myself that you weren't.

431
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:08,781
<i>That's when I realized,
this has got to end.</i>

432
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:10,733
So what, then?

433
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:15,154
You preside over a trial
that sees me hanged?

434
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:19,041
No.

435
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,960
We're going to go home

436
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:23,779
and I will see you and
Mrs. Barlow secreted away

437
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,915
before anybody knows you're gone.

438
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:28,450
<i>You're gonna go to Boston.</i>

439
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:31,721
<i>You're gonna take the pardon
that she's offered you.</i>

440
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:35,174
And that is the last that you
and I will ever see of each other.

441
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,928
Please.

442
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,348
Please, don't do this.

443
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:46,402
I'm sorry.

444
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:49,271
Take a moment.

445
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:53,993
I'll deal with them.

446
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,917
<i>(door opens)</i>

This is not what I wanted.

This is not what I wanted.

<i>(door creaks)</i>

459
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,834
I came to lend credence to your case

460
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:54,086
that the Urca is still to be won.

461
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:08,050
What the fuck are you doing to him?

462
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,569
- Making sure there's nothing incriminating...
- Stop. Stop.

463
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,406
There's no way out of this.

464
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,227
Take it from me,

465
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:20,613
there's always a way.

466
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,590
Sir.

467
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:40,099
- What is it?
- A small band of men were seen approaching the fort

468
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:43,585
from the west this morning. No
one's been able to identify them.

469
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:45,054
Are all the home crews accounted for?

470
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,022
Aye. Every one. They had
nothing to do with this.

471
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,424
<i>Naft: Could this be a first move
by England to reclaim the island?</i>

472
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:50,943
<i>Frasier: Without a single ship involved?</i>

473
00:30:51,027 --> 00:30:53,896
This does not have the air of a
state move. This is something else.

474
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:55,898
Captain, how easily are the great guns

475
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:58,400
<i>- on the fort repositioned?
- What difference does that make?</i>

476
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:00,102
He's asking if the fort
can turn her guns around

477
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:02,454
<i>and bring them to bear
on the street... on us.</i>

478
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:05,958
Let's hope whomever's up there is
not mad enough to consider that.

479
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,277
That's less than confidence-inspiring.

480
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:09,995
I have lieutenants calling in favors

481
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,414
from the crews of the
Colonial Dawn and the Medusa.

482
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:16,802
I'll have 250 men assembled and ready
to storm the fort in a matter of hours.

483
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:19,972
By first light tomorrow,
I'll be back in my chair

484
00:31:20,056 --> 00:31:22,308
and whoever did this will
be hanging by his goddamn...

485
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:24,093
- What is it?
- Quick, you all need to see this.

486
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:34,436
<i>Man: Go back inside.</i>

487
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,447
Miss Guthrie.

488
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:50,419
I think it's time we talked.

489
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:06,185
Mr. Gates's heart has given out.

490
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:08,938
He's dead?

491
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:12,858
Mr. Logan.

492
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:15,027
<i>Signal Mr. Thompson on the Ranger.</i>

493
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,196
Inform him he's now in command.

494
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,064
His orders are to sail north.

495
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:22,701
When we fire on the target, he's to
tack hard to port and do the same.

496
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:25,454
Hoist the signals from the
foremast below the yard.

497
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:28,324
Get 'em up and down quickly
before the Spaniard sees them.

498
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,838
(door closes)

499
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:51,313
The question you need to ask yourself

500
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,183
is "What good can I do?"

501
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:56,218
<i>You can call this murder.</i>

502
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:57,853
<i>A number of the men might even believe you,</i>

503
00:32:57,904 --> 00:33:00,889
but will that be enough

504
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,075
to stop this fight that is about to happen?

505
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,279
<i>Because if it's not, a fight we might win</i>

506
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,782
<i>becomes a battle we are doomed to lose.</i>

507
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:13,669
<i>Because the men went into it
infected with your suspicions,</i>

508
00:33:13,736 --> 00:33:16,755
<i>with your doubts.</i>

509
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:21,743
So, Mr. Quartermaster,

510
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:25,014
is that truly what's
in their best interests?

511
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:48,287
St. Augustine.

512
00:33:48,371 --> 00:33:49,655
Beg pardon?

513
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:50,906
When the warship draws close,

514
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:52,741
she'll ask our last port of call.

515
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:54,710
St. Augustine's the closest.

516
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,778
<i>And as she's likely a customs ship,</i>

517
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,381
<i>we must identify our cargo
as anything but tobacco.</i>

518
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:02,301
Seville regulates the trade heavily.

519
00:34:05,004 --> 00:34:07,139
Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.

520
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:27,076
What the fuck did you do?

521
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:30,162
Spend enough time on an island,

522
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:33,248
begin to forget there's
a whole world out there.

523
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:36,618
A world where the rules are different.

524
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:43,675
I went out there, found men
who don't know the rules here

525
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,545
and who don't much care to learn them.

526
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:49,181
They helped me surprise
Captain Hornigold's men,

527
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:52,801
we took his fort, and not
once were any of them burdened

528
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:56,555
with the thought, "What if this
were to upset Eleanor Guthrie?"

529
00:34:58,274 --> 00:35:01,643
Well, they're about to
learn the rules, Charles.

530
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:04,313
The hard way. You think
I'm gonna let this stand?

531
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:07,199
That Hornigold will? We have men lining up

532
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,401
<i>in droves to back us in retaking it.</i>

533
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:12,154
I'd expect nothing less.

534
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:13,872
Just out of curiosity,

535
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:16,625
how long do you think that's gonna take?

536
00:35:16,692 --> 00:35:20,212
Can you take back that fort before...

537
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:22,381
I sink another ship in the bay?

538
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:24,699
Three more?

539
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:26,752
All of them?

540
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:28,670
<i>Who knows?</i>

541
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:30,639
<i>If my men hold out long enough,</i>

542
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:32,541
<i>we may just decide to sink the Walrus</i>

543
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:35,227
when she returns with
your precious Spanish gold

544
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:37,896
just out of spite.

545
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:39,848
So that's what this is.

546
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:42,384
You're annoyed at me, so you're
gonna destroy everything I've built.

547
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:44,219
Never said I wanted to destroy anything.

548
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,887
Then what do you want?

549
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:48,524
Hornigold controlled the fort.

550
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:51,994
The fort controls the bay.
The bay controls commerce.

551
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,829
That meant he was your partner.

552
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:57,866
<i>Now, I control the fort.</i>

553
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:01,420
So I will be your partner.

554
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,339
You are kidding me.

555
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:06,625
I was a tenant in this
place for a long time.

556
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:08,410
Didn't work out so well.

557
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,212
Now I'd like a stake.

558
00:36:10,263 --> 00:36:12,714
You've absolutely lost your mind.

559
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:16,051
I remember the first time I saw you.

560
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,770
You were about 13.

561
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,755
You'd snuck down to the beach

562
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:23,058
despite Mr. Scott's rules forbidding it.

563
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:25,978
A girl that age

564
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:28,530
looking like you did.

565
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:31,867
And you just walked up
and down between the camps

566
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:33,902
like you owned the place.

567
00:36:33,953 --> 00:36:35,320
Fearless.

568
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:38,773
Then you saw me watching
you and you didn't look away.

569
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:40,876
Didn't cower.

570
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:43,295
You just gave me this look...

571
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:45,330
this little smile...

572
00:36:45,415 --> 00:36:48,050
that said you refused to be afraid of me.

573
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:51,169
What the fuck are you talking about?

574
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:53,788
I know you.

575
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,958
<i>Better than your father, better than Scott.</i>

576
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,427
<i>Maybe better than anyone.</i>

577
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:01,430
You don't give a shit
about money or respect.

578
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:03,965
Or the things you've built here.

579
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:06,351
I think you're just tired of fathers

580
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:08,570
telling you what to do.

581
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:13,692
And so I'm offering you
a life free from them.

582
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:17,829
With me in that fort, you do as you like.

583
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:19,665
As long as it doesn't cross me,

584
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:22,784
you'll hear no complaints.

585
00:37:24,787 --> 00:37:27,372
You know I have no choice but to say yes.

586
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:31,376
But before I do, know this,

587
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:34,963
<i>you'll sit in that fort for a
while. You'll get comfortable.</i>

588
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:39,134
And that's the day I'm
gonna push you and your men

589
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:41,720
right into the fucking sea.

590
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:46,358
God, I missed that look.

591
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:54,616
Ben.

592
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,405
What the hell did he say?

593
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,492
He wants your seat on the
consortium. To be a partner to us.

594
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:07,245
Well, I have 300 men out there
more than happy to deny him.

595
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,131
- You can't, Ben.
- Oh, watch me.

596
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,550
I told him about the tunnels.

597
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:14,886
The tunnels that you would use to
launch a surprise attack into the fort.

598
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:17,306
- I told him.
- Jesus!

599
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:19,975
You told me to keep emotion
from clouding judgment.

600
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:22,394
To act in everyone's best interest.

601
00:38:22,478 --> 00:38:24,146
I believe that's what I'm doing.

602
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:27,065
This is not the end of this.

603
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:34,072
Captain. Welcome back.

604
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:36,558
I hear congratulations are in order.

605
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,578
Steward of the fort. Stroke of pure genius.

606
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:42,497
In some ways, Jack, it had to come to this.

607
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:44,833
- Don't you think?
- Come to what?

608
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,252
Me deciding if you live or die.

609
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:48,537
Captain, I don't know what you've heard...

610
00:38:48,588 --> 00:38:50,539
Hamund pulls you out of bed...

611
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:54,259
<i>marches you down to the wrecks</i>

612
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:58,347
to look for a stash of stolen pearls.

613
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:02,300
And somehow, only you and
your dog make it back alive.

614
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:07,389
<i>- (sighs)
- Quite a moment.</i>

615
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,525
Jack Rackham with nothing to say.

616
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:13,862
<i>Had I a shrewd quartermaster right now,</i>

617
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:16,698
<i>he would tell me that I
can't let what you did stand.</i>

618
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:19,034
He would say an offense like that

619
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:21,770
demanded an example be made of both of you.

620
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:24,239
<i>The bloodier the better.</i>

621
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,163
But today, I'm a little less worried

622
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:33,965
about perception than I used to be.

623
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,334
As long as I hold that fort,

624
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:38,220
doesn't really matter.

625
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:44,476
So the street will know what you did.

626
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,430
<i>They will know you betrayed
your brothers for a woman.</i>

627
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:52,467
That story will spread far and wide

628
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,770
and you'll never sail
beneath the black again.

629
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:59,641
<i>You'll sit in this place and rot</i>

630
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:02,244
with the rest of the whores.

631
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:06,448
Something tells me that'll
sting worse than dying.

632
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:10,202
<i>Loyalty, Jack.</i>

633
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:12,170
<i>It's supposed to mean something.</i>

634
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:14,873
It does to me, anyway.

635
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:19,544
Oh.

636
00:40:19,629 --> 00:40:22,297
Love what you've done with the place.

637
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:38,146
(speaking Spanish)

638
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:44,486
Here she comes.

639
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:54,746
(speaking Spanish)

640
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,384
Cazadora. Marco Fernandez, captain.

641
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:03,638
Cazadora. Marco Fernandez, capitבn.

642
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:05,724
(speaking Spanish)

643
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:12,264
St, Augustine. Tobacco trade.

644
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:14,816
(speaking Spanish)

645
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:21,239
If I'm not mistaken,
you told him to name us

646
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:22,991
anything but a tobacco trader, did you not?

647
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:24,693
I did.

648
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:28,079
He means to prove that that
ship is not guardacosta.

649
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:29,564
That it's here for the same reason we are.

650
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,366
The Urca.

651
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,918
That ship lets us pass,

652
00:41:33,002 --> 00:41:35,420
he will have managed to both
renew the men's lust for gold

653
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:38,423
and their faith in his judgment.

654
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:40,425
<i>(speaking Spanish)</i>

655
00:41:53,422 --> 00:41:55,190
Hello.

656
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:08,486
All hands to their stations.

657
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:10,271
Quietly, if you please.

658
00:42:10,323 --> 00:42:12,290
At 300 yards, we open fire.

659
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:16,878
Time and again he gambles with our lives.

660
00:42:16,946 --> 00:42:19,798
That is, when he's not
taking them in cold blood.

661
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:23,284
And once more his influence grows.

662
00:42:23,336 --> 00:42:25,587
And we're at his mercy with
no way to challenge him.

663
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:27,305
No, sir.

664
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,925
It only looks that way.

665
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:42,404
Turn us around slowly, boys.

666
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:44,406
They need to think we're just drifting.

667
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:03,425
Range?

668
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:05,210
Hundred yards, Captain.

669
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:12,100
- Open.
- Crewman: Open.

670
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:18,056
(men shouting)

671
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:25,530
<i>- Come right a few degrees.
- Aye, Captain.</i>

672
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:28,950
We only get one shot at
this. We miss, we die.

673
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:32,487
- Clear, tack hull.
- Range?

674
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:34,739
Approaching 200 yards, Captain.

675
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:37,542
All crews, fire on my mark.

676
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:41,296
Steady.

677
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:47,168
Almost there.

678
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,673
Captain Flint.

679
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:56,845
As quartermaster, I hereby accuse you

680
00:43:56,896 --> 00:43:59,097
of tyrannical crimes against your crew.

681
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,182
All crews, fire!

682
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:03,735
<i>Dufresne: Belay that order!</i>

683
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,942
Your duties as a member of
this crew have reached an end.

684
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:13,244
Take a seat.

685
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:18,283
Beginning with the
murders of Mr. Singleton,

686
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,586
Billy Bones, and Mr. Gates.

687
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:24,405
What exactly do you hope
to accomplish by doing this?

688
00:44:24,457 --> 00:44:27,292
In your case, Mr. Silver, justice.

689
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:30,628
Once Dufresne exposes Flint's
lies in their totality,

690
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:32,246
the crew are gonna want
answers from you, too.

691
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,382
And as I explained to Mr. Dufresne,

692
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:36,434
it's his word against Flint's.

693
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:37,852
Why would anyone believe him?

694
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,421
I hold in my hand a letter

695
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:44,275
written by Mr. Gates
confessing his knowledge

696
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,312
and complicity in the
captain's myriad crimes.

697
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:50,264
We're going to lose them.
We don't have time for this.

698
00:44:50,316 --> 00:44:54,736
As well as his knowledge of the
captain's continued treachery

699
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:58,790
up to and including his plan to steal

700
00:44:58,874 --> 00:45:02,660
a portion of the treasure
fleet proceeds for himself.

701
00:45:02,745 --> 00:45:05,080
I gave you all an order! Fire!

702
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:09,167
Fire!

703
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:13,338
Mr. Logan.

704
00:45:18,394 --> 00:45:19,928
It's in Mr. Gates's hand.

705
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,314
Where are you going?

706
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:26,935
<i>- (gunshot flashes)
- (Grunts)</i>

707
00:45:30,523 --> 00:45:32,824

00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:42,450
(grunting)

709
00:45:46,505 --> 00:45:48,590
Justice, thief.

710
00:45:48,657 --> 00:45:50,125
This time there's no escaping it.

711
00:45:54,964 --> 00:45:57,799
You're welcome.

712
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:01,352
Raise the sails. We're going home.

713
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:11,946
Who's shooting?!

714
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:14,532
Sorry.

715
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:16,234
Had to be done.

716
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:19,154
There's no running now.

717
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:25,827
<i>Logan: The Ranger's coming about.</i>

718
00:46:25,878 --> 00:46:29,914
The Spaniards have got men in the rigging.

719
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:32,417
Fire, Mr. Dufresne. Everything you've got.

720
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:34,135
Don't waste this moment.

721
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:47,182
(cannon fire blasts)

722
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:53,605
All cannons, open fire!

723
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:55,690
<i>Open fire!</i>

724
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:07,035

725
00:47:08,204 --> 00:47:10,755

726
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,261
Gunner: Ready with this cannon!

727
00:47:16,345 --> 00:47:17,545
Fire!

728
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:19,714
<i>The Ranger's opened fire!</i>

729
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:20,782
Again!

730
00:47:31,477 --> 00:47:33,528
<i>Fire!</i>

731
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,818
She's coming about!

732
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:44,739
Fire!

733
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:55,884
Fire!

734
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,421
<i>Below!</i>

735
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:07,428
<i>To your stations!</i>

736

739
00:48:38,677 --> 00:48:40,128
Set sail!

740
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:49,971
(men shouting, screaming)

741
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:57,979

742
00:49:01,116 --> 00:49:03,484

<i>Max: No-man's-land.</i>

747
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:29,203
There was a time when stopping
halfway across this bridge

748
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:30,988
would have been unthinkable to you.

749
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:33,607
How things change.

750
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:34,826
I can see that.

751
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:42,116
Max, I know we haven't spoken,

752
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,751
but I just want you to
know how sorry I am...

753
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:45,586
Don't.

754
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:50,624
You have nothing to be sorry about.

755
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:53,811
I was standing between you
and your dreams for this place.

756
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,430
You did what you had to do.

757
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:58,516
I thought you said this
place was just sand.

758
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,735
Sand has its virtues.

759
00:51:00,802 --> 00:51:02,470
On sand, nothing is fixed.

760
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,439
Nothing is permanent.

761
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,474
And fates change so quickly.

762
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:09,827
Yesterday Captain Hornigold
was immovable from that fort

763
00:51:09,912 --> 00:51:13,081
and Captain Vane was a beggar.

764
00:51:13,148 --> 00:51:14,665
Now look at them today.

765
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,336
<i>Yesterday I was a whore
of little consequence,</i>

766
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,321
easily dismissed,

767
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:22,256
easily forgotten.

768
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:24,375
<i>Today I am a madam</i>

769
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,161
with an income and allies

770
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:31,766
<i>and a woman who has learned
the most important of lessons.</i>

771
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:35,303
Never let anyone stand in
between you and your ambitions.

772
00:51:37,022 --> 00:51:39,107
Thank you for teaching it to me.

773
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:43,478
Ma'am, they're ready.

774
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,816
Congratulations on the launch
of your endeavor, by the way.

775
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:52,153
Today you have everything
you have ever wanted.

776
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:57,158
I suppose we can only guess
what tomorrow will bring.

777
00:53:05,027 --> 00:53:07,061
(coughing)

778
00:53:22,444 --> 00:53:24,879
They think it'll be a while
before she sails again.

779
00:53:27,449 --> 00:53:29,617
<i>In the meantime, you
and I have been charged</i>

780
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:32,553
<i>with provoking this whole mess.</i>

781
00:53:41,813 --> 00:53:43,931
Why am I still alive?

782
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,268
Why didn't you kill me?

783
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:54,025
Get him up.

784
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:08,339
(groans)

785
00:54:21,353 --> 00:54:25,222
Told you I was certain about my
information regarding the Urca.

786
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:27,892
Unfortunately, you and I failed
to take into account the weather.

787
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,462
The Urca de Lima wrecked at sea last night.

788
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,131
Dashed by the storm.
