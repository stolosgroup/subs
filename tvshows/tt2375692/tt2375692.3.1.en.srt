<i>I think you intend</i>
<i>to return to that beach,</i>

3
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:11,082
<i>and seize every last ounce</i>
<i>of gold off of it,</i>

4
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:13,501
and I think you're going
to need my help to do it.

5
00:00:13,553 --> 00:00:17,722
I have committed men and resources
to aid you in retrieving the Urca gold,

6
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:19,340
<i>in exchange for which</i>
<i>you assured me,</i>

7
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:21,142
<i>expelling Captain Vane</i>
<i>from that fort.</i>

8
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:22,177
<i>We'll procure a ship,</i>

9
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:23,428
we'll recruit men,

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,897
<i>and we'll create from nothing,</i>
<i>a new crew.</i>

11
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,315
<i>You asked for better captains.</i>

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,933
<i>I give you Captain Jack Rackham.</i>

13
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:30,435
<i>I can't be your wife, Jack.</i>

14
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,687
You and I are gonna be partners

15
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:33,688
<i>till they put us in the ground.</i>

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,440
<i>That is the crown jewel taken</i>

17
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:37,275
<i>from the good fortune prize.</i>

18
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:39,027
Her father's Lord Peter Ashe,

19
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,778
<i>governor of the Carolina Colony.</i>

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,997
Her father is a very influential man,

21
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,415
<i>he and I were friends.</i>

22
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:45,783
<i>When you return her</i>
<i>to her father,</i>

23
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:46,918
<i>you're going to explain</i>

24
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:48,703
what it is you're trying
to accomplish here.

25

<i>A Nassau that can self-govern.</i>

26

You are no longer a hostage.

27
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,341
I'm gonna get you out of here.

28
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,794
You will turn on absolutely
anyone, won't you?

29
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:57,886
<i>Listen to me clearly.</i>

30
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,098
<i>You will hear from me again.</i>

31
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,933
You think there's something
valuable enough to make

32
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:04,769
the British Navy forget that
you and I are pirates?

33
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,387
Not what, who.

34
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,723
<i>This is Eleanor Guthrie,</i>
<i>the trade boss in Nassau.</i>

35
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:10,558
Imagine sir,
how London would react

36
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,860
to the arrival
of the queen of thieves.

37
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:14,228
I am so very sorry for what...

38
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,731
- You destroyed our lives!
- Miranda...

39
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,033
<i>I want to see that</i>
<i>noose around your neck,</i>

40
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:20,190
<i>and I want to pull the lever</i>

41
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,370
with my own two ha...!

42
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,572
<i>I have placed</i>
<i>Captain Flint under arrest!</i>

43
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:27,458
<i>His trial will be swift and final!</i>

44
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,544
Flint stole from me,
and I'm making it right.

45
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,163
<i>You hate Flint, I hate Flint.</i>

46
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:35,083
But right now, he's talking
about how we survive,

47
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:36,217
what comes next.

48
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:39,003
I suggest we get him
the hell out of there.

49
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:41,089
Everyone is a monster to someone.

50
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:43,391
<i>Since you are so convinced</i>
<i>that I am yours,</i>

51
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:44,726
I will be it.

52
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,227
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

53
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,596
Figured if anyone was going
to make a trophy of you,

54
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:49,931
<i>it really ought to be me.</i>

55
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:58,773
Her word
will be the last word for this place.

56
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,442
<i>My men will need</i>
<i>to lean on something solid.</i>

57
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:02,777
<i>They look to me for that,</i>

58
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,530
but they'll also look
to their new quartermaster.

59
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:07,415
There's something you ought to know,

60
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,619
<i>before my misfortune at</i>
<i>the hands of Vane's leftenants,</i>

61
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:14,205
<i>our friend, the scout,</i>
<i>confessed something to me.</i>

62
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:16,541
<i>He told me that he could</i>
<i>sell the gold's location</i>

63
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:20,345
<i>to another crew in exchange</i>
<i>for a larger share of the prize.</i>

00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,369
May I help you?

71
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:11,405
You're Drummond.

72
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:15,293
Mary's your wife.

73
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:18,746
<i>Mary's our sister.</i>

- Edgar.
- Edgar, that's right.

76
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:30,758
And you came all the way
from Williamsburg

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,510
just to be upset with me?

78
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:35,096
We came from Williamsburg

79
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:38,349
to make sure that you
honored your vows to her.

80
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:42,854
End of today, either you're gonna
be her current husband

81
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:44,605
or her late one.

82
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:51,112
I'm sorry, but, um, there's
someplace I have to be.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,666
You're coming with us.

84
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:59,370
<i>I understand your anger,</i>

85
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:00,705
<i>but I've lived long enough</i>

86
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:04,125
to know that any promise made

87
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:07,261
beside the word "forever"

88
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:11,182
<i>is no more than a lie agreed upon.</i>

89
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,184
<i>There is no forever.</i>

90
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:17,355
Everything moves towards its end.

91
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,309
And the closer we get to ours,
the louder that clock ticks,

92
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,778
<i>the less a sane man</i>
<i>would let a promise</i>

93
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,479
<i>deprive him of happiness.</i>

94
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:29,233
I explained all this to Mary,

95
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:30,818
who told me she understood

96
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,405
and that she would not
protest our separation.

97
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:37,625
Are you calling my sister a liar?

98
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:42,246
Well...

99
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:44,999
you're here.

100
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,218
I can think of at least three lies

101
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:50,137
she must have told you
to bring that about.

102
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:53,507
<i>First, I imagine she told you</i>

103
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,593
<i>I retired from a prosperous trade</i>

104
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,678
<i>to settle with her here.</i>

105
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,514
But what she likely did not mention

106
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:03,568
is that that trade
was high seas piracy.

107
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,745
<i>Second, she told you</i>
<i>my name was Drummond,</i>

108
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,749
but when I plied that trade,

109
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:14,635
I was called Teach.

110
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:17,338
<i>And third,</i>

111
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,142
she clearly led you to believe

112
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:25,847
that you could point your sword
in my direction

113
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,234
<i>and survive the experience.</i>

114
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:42,113
This, too, was something
less than the truth.

I said, "Who goes there?"

120
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,494
You are the magistrate here.

121

Hazzard.

122

Bridgetown, St. Kitts,

their magistrates
hanged men for piracy.

125
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,710
They all receive visits from me.

126
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:09,713
The word went forth...

127
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,383
any capital sentence
served against a pirate

128
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:15,719
would hear my answer.

129
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:20,391
You must'a known. You must'a heard.

130
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:25,196
And yet you chose to hang
those three men in your square.

131
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,900
Why?

132
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:31,902
If I didn't...

133
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:39,376
if I let my fear of you
prevent me from enforcing the law,

134
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,079
then civilization in this place is dead.

135
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:48,502
I also know that most
of those other magistrates you visited,

136
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:53,474
they were corrupt men, dishonest men.

137
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,393
<i>I wagered that despite</i>
<i>all I'd heard about you,</i>

139
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,899
that you could tell the difference.

140
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,484
That you could see
I was an honest man.

141
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,486
<i>No!</i>

142
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:09,940
No, no, no.

143
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,495
No!

144
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,112
<i>Keep 'em coming!</i>

<i>Another three.</i>

150
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,512
Is it done?

151
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:07,798
It is.

152
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,135
Once the plunder is stowed,
get us underway.

153
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:12,770
Every man to his charge.

154
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:14,805
Looks like we garnered
a good haul out of it.

155
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,440
<i>Get everything into the hold.</i>

156
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,275
The men did well
under the circumstances.

157
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,810
Not all of them.

158
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:25,483
Lost his nerve.
I want him replaced on the Vanguard

159
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,451
before we go over the side again.

160
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,320
He lost his footing.

161
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,572
I don't think it had anything to do
with his nerve.

162
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,741
Replace him.

163
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,913
He's getting worse.

164
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,715
He's fine.

165
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,166
Are you sure about that?

166
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,834
We just faced a band
of colonial regulars out there.

167
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,169
He's entitled to a mood.

168
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,944
Is it her?

169
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,696
It's her.
Right where she's supposed to be.

170
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,837
Bring us alongside.

171
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,706
Spread your sheets!
Stand ready with grapples!

172
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,508
<i>Spread the sheets!</i>

173
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:25,793
<i>Ready the grapples!</i>

174
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:29,024
<i>His men are jumping ship.</i>

175
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,515
They aren't his men.

176
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,768
They're his cargo.

177
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:37,104
When Jack asked me to hunt her,

178
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,939
he said she was hauling timber.

179
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:41,725
He said the supplies were badly needed
for fort repairs.

180
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:45,062
Funny...

181
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:47,865
I don't remember him
saying anything about slaves.

182

__

194
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,804
You know who I am?

195
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:04,108
<i>What you cannot know</i>
<i>is where I come from,</i>

196
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,443
<i>what I once was.</i>

197
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,898
If you knew that,

198
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,068
I imagine you would've made
different choices today.

199
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:36,507
<i>The evidence has been delivered.</i>

200
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,592
<i>The accused has been measured.</i>

201
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,396
<i>Now let us talk about judgment.</i>

202
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,851
Miss Guthrie, do you have
anything to say in your defense

203
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:51,489
before sentence is pronounced?

204
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,281
I have but one regret...

205
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,094
<i>...that though the pirates of Nassau</i>

206
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,396
<i>filled my purse with coin,</i>

207
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:01,682
I never took the opportunity

208
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,817
to let them fill me with anything else.

209
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,608
<i>- I apologize.</i>
<i>- Miss Guthrie...</i>

210
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,695
This must seem in such
poor taste to you.

211
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:16,863
I assume this is your production.

212
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:20,000
Were the world as I wished it,
news of Eleanor's trial would be received

213
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:24,121
with the gravity due to someone
who did so much for this place.

214
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,123
They are who they are,

215
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,675
and someone must provide them
with the things they need.

216
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:30,511
Right now, this is what they need.

217
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:34,765
<i>...found guilty of these</i>
<i>and countless other crimes</i>

218
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:38,152
for which the sentence...

219
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,820
is death.

220
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:54,701
Any news from London?

221
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:57,421
The trial is set to begin
sometime next week.

222
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,122
The spectacle around it
is said to be so great,

223
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,291
the king himself
receives daily updates.

224
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:04,962
Hmm. With that much attention
on the politics in play,

225
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:06,129
do you believe there is any way

226
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:08,632
she will be offered
some sort of clemency?

227
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:10,767
I would think there is
always a chance for mercy

228
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,136
for one willing to beg for it.

229
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:33,373
But I do not imagine
you came to see our play.

230
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,492
What is it I can do for you?

231
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:38,962
When Captains Flint and Rackham
made their pact those months ago,

232
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:42,165
settled their differences over
the possession of the Urca gold,

233
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:45,335
they asked me to oversee
the restoration of the fort.

234
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:47,054
To ensure Nassau was protected.

235
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:50,173
But without the men to do the
work, there is no progress.

236
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,743
The fort remains compromised
and we are all exposed.

237
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:55,229
<i>And since Captain Vernon's
crew walked off the site,</i>

238
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,598
<i>there's been little to no
labor provided to me at all.</i>

239
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,933
It's only been a few days.

240
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,134
Give him a break.

241
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,853
It's been two weeks.

242
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,427
You wanted to replace Eleanor.

243
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,112
She was the one Nassau relied upon

244
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:16,166
to solve those problems
no one else could or would.

245
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,119
I hope for all our sakes
you are up to the task.

246
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,678
- He said he would see this done.
- I know.

247
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:31,848
He assured everyone he would be
responsible for restoring the fort.

248
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:34,418
The street comes to me with the
problems it cannot solve for itself,

249
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,536
and right now Jack
is first among them.

250
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:38,588
I know.

251
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:43,010
Fuck's sake. I'll go talk to him.

252
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,832
__

253
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:49,776
Thank you, Celeste.

254
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,666
I have no notes.

255
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,873
Fuckin' leeches down there.

256
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,958
You ain't careful, they're
gonna bleed you dry.

257
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,927
What man wouldn't,
given the opportunity,

258
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:09,046
purchase the adoration
of the masses

259
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,630
when the cost is so small?

260
00:21:10,632 --> 00:21:12,466
That mess is costing you
100 pound a day.

261
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:15,135
Well, in about 800 years,
you'll be able to say, "I told you so."

262
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,938
In the meantime, perhaps we
might at least enjoy ourselves.

263
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:19,556
Why ain't there anyone
up at the fort?

264
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:23,455
I'd like to thank you for at least
allowing me to finish wiping

265
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:25,062
before starting that song.

266
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:28,065
It's been two weeks.
What you waiting for?

267
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,866
- I'm working on it.
- Are you?

268
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:32,702
'Cause it sure as shit don't look like
you're working on anything here.

269
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,154
Well, you should spend more time here.

270
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:38,158
- It's a process.
- I'm not fuckin' around. I need to know.

271
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,459
Do you need to know
or does your husband?

272
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:41,044
You know I hate it
when you call her that.

273
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,830
Course I do.
That's why I call her that.

274
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:45,499
She's got a right to be angry.

275
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,334
Her share of the gold
is sitting up there,

276
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,336
- along with mine.
- And mine.

277
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,754
Please, relay to whom you must,

278
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,390
Jack Rackham is not lazy.
Jack Rackham is not stupid.

279
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:54,825
Jack Rackham is not blind.

280
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,143
And Jack Rackham is not
unaware that currently

281
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:57,778
there are no men
working on that fort.

282
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,147
That said, on the list
of people on this island

283
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,566
who are most concerned with
seeing that fort restored,

284
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,184
there is everyone else,
and then there is one name

285
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:07,270
that's... that's way at the top of it.

286
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:10,857
- Jack Rackham.
- Yeah.

287
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,109
Jack Rackham, exactly.

288
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,527
Don't treat me like I'm someone else.

289
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:15,612
I'm on your fucking side of this,

290
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:17,747
same as I've always been.

291
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:21,034
I am just asking you
to tell me what the plan is.

292
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:22,702
Jack!

293
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,708
You're about to find out.

294
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:04,578
Your days of approaching
unannounced are behind you.

295
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:11,585
I reassigned Mr. Dobbs
off the Vanguard, as you asked.

296
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:12,969
I told him his skill in the rig

297
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,839
was too valuable to risk
putting him in harm's way.

298
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:18,642
<i>Thank you.</i>

299
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:19,976
Then now that that's sorted,

300
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:21,692
there is another replacement
on the Vanguard

301
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,630
that we should discuss.

302
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:24,764
Who's that?

303
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:27,566
You.

304
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:29,402
Is that so?

305
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:33,106
<i>I understand we faced colonial
regulars out there last night.</i>

306
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:34,824
So?

307
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,893
These raids were difficult enough

308
00:23:36,945 --> 00:23:39,779
when the element of
surprise was in our favor.

309
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:42,816
But now?
Now it would seem your days

310
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:46,653
of approaching unannounced
may also be at an end.

311
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,539
<i>Every time you go ashore,</i>

312
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:52,292
<i>there is a risk you don't return...</i>

313
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:55,662
<i>a risk Nassau loses</i>
<i>its most recognizable figure</i>

314
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,715
<i>and a risk that would seem</i>
<i>to be escalating.</i>

315
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,752
I am suggesting it's time we take
you out of harm's way as well.

316
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:06,506
We're fighting a war
to protect Nassau.

317
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,309
A war in which our most
effective weapon

318
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:12,395
is the fear that we can
instill in our enemies.

319
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,682
<i>We've succeeded</i>
<i>in making Captain Flint</i>

320
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:19,853
the name of grim death
to all of them.

321
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,739
The only way that we can ensure
that that story continues

322
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:25,024
is if he is the one telling it.

323
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:28,411
That story is telling
itself, and you know it.

324
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,531
We've been assigned responsibility
for raids we were nowhere near.

325
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,199
Jesus, I've been given credit

326
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:35,118
for having been
a part of some of them.

327
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,538
They are so terrified of you,
they're terrified of me.

328
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,540
You think that's a reason
we should relent?

329
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:42,876
Who the fuck said anything
about relenting?

330
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,794
Look, I am talking about
letting someone else

331
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:46,346
stand in and play
your role now and again.

332
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:49,098
Thank you for your concern,

333
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:53,269
but I'll decide when it's time
to start altering our tactics.

334
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:56,806
No, I'll decide.

335
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:59,142
This crew has spilled
a great deal of blood

336
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:01,778
to make your name what it is.

337
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:03,863
It doesn't belong to you.

338
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:06,065
It's a jointly held asset

339
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:07,901
belonging to every man on this crew

340
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:11,738
who sacrificed some part
of himself to build it.

341
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,491
They have a say
about how it is managed,

342
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:16,075
and I am the voice of it.

343
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:19,746
It is clear to me that this raid
was more dangerous than the last.

344
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,799
They are adapting, and it
is of some concern to me

345
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:25,635
that you either cannot
or will not acknowledge it.

346
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:32,976
I understand this is all
incredibly personal to you

347
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:34,811
after the loss of Mrs. Barlow.

348
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:36,312
Now, wait a minute...

349
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:39,098
And I understand the burden of
playing the role you currently play

350
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,818
must be taking a toll even you
cannot fully comprehend.

351
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:43,436
Stop.

352
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:49,325
Now you have wormed your way into
the heads of the men out there.

353
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,113
And they've granted you authority
over them because of it.

354
00:25:56,785 --> 00:26:01,287
But in my head,
you are not welcome.

355
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:08,761
<i>It's worse than I feared.</i>

356
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:12,682
The wound should've been far further
along towards quieting itself.

357
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:16,302
It's less than ideal.

358
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:22,609
<i>Have you been cleaning it
as we discussed?</i>

359
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:24,861
When I can.

360
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,446
It's harder when we're at sea.

361
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,200
I understand your aversion to
being seen using the crutches.

362
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,986
Well, if you understand it,

363
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,238
I wish you'd stop
hectoring me about it.

364
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,825
But the boot was never
intended for a wound this new.

365
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:41,556
Unless you remove
some of the pressure,

366
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,213
the wound will only continue
to get more irritated.

367
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:45,999
I'll lean more on the ropes.

368
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:48,167
With all your weight?
On a moving deck?

369
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:50,169
I'll manage.

370
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:54,173
If the decay progresses,
I'll have to remove more of your leg.

371
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:14,055
<i>Please let me explain.</i>

372
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,361
<i>What is there to explain?</i>

373
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:17,447
You couldn't figure out
how to repair the fort,

374
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:20,366
so you lured me into capturing
a ship full of slaves to do the job.

375
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:23,703
It was the first solid lead
on a slaver we'd had in weeks.

376
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,556
I needed someone who I could
be certain would win her.

377
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:28,708
So you lied to me about it.

378
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:33,741
What the fuck made you think
I would just hand them over to you,

379
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,798
knowing what you know of me?

380
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:42,972
The three of us stood in this
room... you, Flint, and I...

381
00:27:43,024 --> 00:27:45,108
and we agreed
that the fort's restoration

382
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,060
was critical to Nassau's security.

383
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:49,312
We agreed you would
hire men to restore it.

384
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:51,280
- I tried that!
- You're going to need to try harder!

385
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:52,398
How?

386
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,330
I offer the men exorbitant
wages to do the work.

387
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,102
Do you know what they say?
"You can afford more. We want double that."

388
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:57,484
All right, double it, it's a deal.
Fuck it.

389
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:59,506
You know what they say then? "You can't
tell us what to do. We're free men."

390
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:02,125
"We'll work when we please." Would you
like to take a guess how <i>that</i> is going?

391
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,328
It's five different crews,
it's hundreds of men,

392
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,797
untold thousands in wages,
and I swear to God,

393
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:10,883
I think that hole in the wall
is bigger now than when we started.

394
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,136
I stood between you and him, Jack.

395
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,088
When Flint was ready
to wage war against you

396
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,140
over the gold,
I was the one who said

397
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:19,092
you would manage it
as well as anyone could.

398
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:21,728
For the good of this place, I was
the one who said you could be trusted.

399
00:28:21,763 --> 00:28:23,479
<i>Why?</i>

400
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:26,683
Why did you stand behind me
in that moment?

401
00:28:26,735 --> 00:28:28,351
I'll tell you why. Because you and
I had been through enough shit

402
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,269
for you to know that I
would do the same for you,

403
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:32,939
that I have done the same for you,
and would again without hesitation.

404
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,575
I made a commitment
to you, with you,

405
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,610
to restore this place,
to make it strong again.

406
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:40,079
I see no other way to have it done.

407
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:41,115
And I will have it done.

408
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,666
I will move heaven
and earth to have it done

409
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:45,451
because I refuse to let you down.

410
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:57,380
<i>I knew this would be difficult
for you, so I kept it from you.</i>

411
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:03,519
Please know that I meant
no slight by it.

412
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:07,473
No lack of respect or friendship.

413
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:09,809
It's quite the opposite.

414
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:24,719
<i>Ship on the horizon!</i>

415
00:29:24,826 --> 00:29:26,375
<i>Ship on the horizon!</i>

416
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,711
<i>Under bare poles!</i>

417
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:39,839
Whose banner is that?

418
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:42,842
- Hallendale.
- Here.

419
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:47,346
<i>What the fuck's
he doing out there?</i>

420
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:51,184
- Lying in wait?
- With his banner raised?

421
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:53,820
Sails furled.

422
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,239
Not a soul on the deck
or in the rig.

423
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,241
Possible they abandoned her?

424
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:00,526
Took a prize and decided
to sail away on it?

425
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:02,662
Had to have been a hell of a prize.

426
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:05,038
Even Hallendale isn't stupid enough
to leave a ship like that behind.

427
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,033
He could've sailed it back to
Nassau with a few dozen men.

428
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:08,201
<i>Less.</i>

429
00:30:12,707 --> 00:30:15,291
Why don't we go in closer,
see what's what?

430
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:17,176
What if they're in distress?

431
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:21,714
Alter our course to close with her.

432
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,349
Bear away to port.

433
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:25,218
<i>Bear away to port!</i>

434
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:29,806
What?

435
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:33,726
You'll lose our advantage
in this wind.

436
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,813
Delay our return to Nassau
by a day, maybe two.

437
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:39,732
And we're in dire need of resupply.

438
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,318
Short on foodstuffs,
very short on shot.

439
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,454
That storm in the southwest
isn't dying away.

440
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,291
And we dawdle, we'll find ourselves
right in the middle of it.

441
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,806
And there's a good chance that
that ship we're about to approach

442
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:54,297
is quiet because all its men
are below deck with a plague.

443
00:30:56,918 --> 00:30:59,135
You think I should've tried
to talk them out of this.

444
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,753
Yeah.

445
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:06,259
You rally the men
to fight behind the idea

446
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:08,895
that these are days in which all
of Nassau must stand together.

447
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:13,733
Either that means
something or it doesn't.

448
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:15,184
And how the hell
would I argue the latter,

449
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,736
just so we could avoid a delay?

450
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:19,856
These days any man
who can sew a black flag

451
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:23,409
and get 10 fools to follow
him can take a prize.

452
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:25,244
They can take it because of the fear

453
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,664
that I and men like me
have instilled in their prey.

454
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,083
But they can't do what I can do.

455
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,501
They're not built for it.

456
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:34,637
And sooner or later,
they'll be exposed.

457
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:37,506
Any fool who followed Hallendale

458
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,843
deserves whatever end
they got in his company.

459
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:45,214
You were right. This war
is getting more dangerous.

460
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:48,467
The strong among us must
stand together and face it.

461
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,970
But the fools and the pretenders...

462
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:55,474
they were never truly
among us to begin with.

463
00:31:57,312 --> 00:32:00,062
As their quartermaster,
it's your decision.

464
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:03,482
But that's how I might've
argued it to my men...

465
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:05,701
to avoid unnecessary delay.

466
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:31,510
<i>Bring your captain on!</i>

467
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:40,019
There's no damage.

468
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,574
Longboats are gone.

469
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,360
Looks like they just
up and left her here.

470
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:59,338
Sweep the hold before the captain
goes across just in case there's...

471
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,091
"We die alone."

472
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,460
Someone get me a glass.

473
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:30,883
Fresh water's been pumped out.

474
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:32,885
Food stores as well.

475
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,471
They've scavenged half the rig
to anchor this far from shore.

476
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:39,475
They marooned him,
left him for dead.

477
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,733
Seawater.

478
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:49,768
Bastard went mad.

479
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:02,364
<i>The whole crew, every man,</i>

480
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,250
<i>all decide to maroon him</i>

481
00:37:04,285 --> 00:37:07,086
and they go to this much
effort to do it in deep water

482
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:11,123
rather than keeping the ship
and leaving him ashore?

483
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:13,792
<i>Why the fuck would they do that?</i>

484
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:18,075
We need to get out of here.

485
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:19,619
What is it?

486
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:22,101
Get out of here now.

487
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:24,520
- Sail!
<i>- Sail!</i>

488
00:37:24,555 --> 00:37:26,639
<i>- Heading?</i>
- Headed this way!

489
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,307
<i>East-southeast!</i>

490
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:31,110
Get us underway!

491
00:37:31,145 --> 00:37:33,395
<i>Do it now!</i>

492
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:43,072
<i>British colors.</i>

493
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:44,790
Not Navy.

494
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:49,878
She's a hunter.

495
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:53,499
Carrying 50 guns, maybe more.

496
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,051
It's already a mile inside the horizon.

497
00:37:56,087 --> 00:38:00,422
Must've been trailing us with her
sail reduced until we took the bait.

498
00:38:00,474 --> 00:38:02,558
Drew us into a position where
he's got the weather gauge.

499
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:05,811
Landmass to the west,
storm to the south,

500
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:09,265
and no point of sail
on which we can outrun her.

501
00:38:09,317 --> 00:38:11,433
- Someone get me a chart!
<i>- Chart for the captain!</i>

502
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:14,687
Full and by on the starboard tack
as close as you can.

503
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,355
- Can we fight her?
- Behind the wind?

504
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:17,856
With barely a broadside
worth of shot on hand?

505
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:19,441
We won't stand a chance.

506
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:23,445
We may not have a choice.

507
00:39:02,036 --> 00:39:04,403
We got all the money in the world.

508
00:39:04,405 --> 00:39:07,489
Maybe we could find a room
that ain't in the middle of a whorehouse.

509
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:14,246
I own a tavern, a brothel,
a tanner, a butcher...

510
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:19,084
interests in a dozen other
concerns on the street.

511
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:21,970
I am the one they come to here
when they need things,

512
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:25,758
want things, fear things.

513
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,178
In another time and another place,
they would call me a queen.

514
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:33,349
I built this from nothing.

515
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,820
And none of it is real.

516
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:40,356
What ain't real about it?

517
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,780
Because it is built upon things
I cannot control, cannot predict.

518
00:39:48,332 --> 00:39:51,033
It is built on sand.

519
00:39:52,703 --> 00:39:55,621
And when the day comes
when that foundation shifts,

520
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,172
when civilization returns,

521
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,458
do you know what they
will call me then?

522
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:04,213
The whore that lost everything.

523
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:11,470
I like it in this room.

524
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:13,889
Reminds me that nothing
has changed yet.

525
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,980
You saying this ain't real?

526
00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:25,984
Of course it is.

527
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:32,074
The fort will be repaired.

528
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:34,626
If he says it, he'll do it.

529
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,861
When you first opened that door
and showed me the Urca gold,

530
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,384
do you know what I saw?

531
00:40:44,054 --> 00:40:45,421
A solution.

532
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:49,975
The mortar that would secure
the sand beneath our feet.

533
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:53,145
The thing I could offer
to England or Spain

534
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,848
or whomever arrived here and
threatened to reorder things,

535
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:59,017
and say,
"Take this and leave me be."

536
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:03,021
Everything is dependent
upon that gold,

537
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:06,608
and right now it is sitting in a fort
with no guns and full of holes.

538
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,194
Charles is gonna agree
to Jack's plan.

539
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:12,197
In a month,
the fort will be whole.

540
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:14,533
Made so by slave labor?

541
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,702
Has it not occurred to anyone

542
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:20,255
that if Jack has not been able to
persuade men to repair the fort,

543
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,959
it is even less likely he will be
able to persuade them to defend it?

544
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,179
The fuck are you saying?

545
00:41:27,214 --> 00:41:30,215
I am saying that if England
were to return right now,

546
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:33,135
there is nothing to stop them
from capturing that fort.

547
00:41:33,187 --> 00:41:35,721
And so long as that gold
is inside it,

548
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:39,024
they will be capturing
our futures along with it.

549
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:41,393
The gold must be
removed from the fort

550
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:44,480
whether Jack wants it or not.

551
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:46,398
You're getting awful close

552
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,617
to doing the one thing
you said you'd never do.

553
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:54,573
Don't ask me to take sides
between you and him.

554
00:41:56,744 --> 00:41:59,378
It doesn't matter. Can't be done.

555
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:01,797
There's a reason it's up
there in the first place.

556
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:03,673
There's no other place
to put it and secure it.

557
00:42:04,752 --> 00:42:07,386
Not in its current form, no.

558
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:22,434
<i>Heave! Heave!</i>

559
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:34,496
He's well within range.

560
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:36,748
Then why isn't he firing?

561
00:42:36,784 --> 00:42:39,251
Closing in, making sure
he doesn't miss.

562
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:40,619
And he doesn't need to rush.

563
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:42,120
There's nothing
we can do to stop it.

564
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:44,172
On this side of that coast,

565
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:46,091
he'll always be faster,
more maneuverable.

566
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:51,964
Whoever that is out there,
he has us.

567
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:53,181
Bullshit.

568
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,270
That man has a goddamned
answer for everything.

569
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:01,473
He's working on an answer for this.

570
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:04,443
<i>She's opening her gun ports!</i>

571
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:10,399
Gun crews, prepare to return fire!

572
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:12,284
<i>Gun crews at the ready!</i>

573
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:17,656
Cartridge.

574
00:43:20,794 --> 00:43:22,160
<i>Gun crews ready!</i>

575
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:31,169
<i>Crew of the Walrus!</i>

576
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:36,508
<i>In my capacity as duly</i>
<i>appointed servant</i>

577
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,012
<i>of His Majesty</i>
<i>King George the First,</i>

578
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:41,563
<i>I address you directly.</i>

579
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,432
Hornigold.

580
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:45,484
<i>Time is short, so I will be plain</i>

581
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,653
<i>and offer you</i>
<i>the same terms as accepted</i>

582
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:50,522
by the late
Captain Hallendale's men.

583
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:57,195
Surrender, and I am authorized

584
00:43:57,197 --> 00:44:01,199
to offer you full, unqualified pardons.

585
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,503
<i>Your ship will be commandeered</i>

586
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:08,173
<i>and you will be given a choice of
either entering into my service</i>

587
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:11,343
<i>or being set free at the
nearest convenient port,</i>

588
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:14,930
<i>your names cleared</i>
<i>and your accounts squared.</i>

589
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:17,966
<i>Refuse and I shall grant no quarter.</i>

590
00:44:27,695 --> 00:44:30,362
Do you think they'll take it?

591
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:33,315
I don't care.

592
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:34,950
Make the guns ready.

593
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:54,252
There'll be no battle today.

594
00:44:56,223 --> 00:44:58,423
Our disadvantage is too great.

595
00:45:00,844 --> 00:45:03,095
<i>But what price surrender?</i>

596
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:08,734
To beg forgiveness from a thing
that took my woman from me?

597
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:13,689
My friend?

598
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:16,191
<i>Murdered her,</i>

599
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:19,611
<i>displayed her body</i>
<i>for their amusement.</i>

600
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:25,522
I can walk away from this fight
if I just sign my name

601
00:45:25,536 --> 00:45:30,505
beneath a solemn oath
never again to do violence against it.

602
00:45:36,797 --> 00:45:37,846
No.

603
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:43,435
Not after all it has taken from me.

604
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:49,307
Not after all it has taken from you.

605
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:58,133
I will do great violence
against that thing.

606
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:05,824
They say they will pardon us all,

607
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:08,493
but I say to offer to pardon

608
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:12,164
something one fears
is the act of a coward.

609
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:15,917
To offer them in volume

610
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:20,472
suggests that their fear of us
is becoming unmanageable,

611
00:46:21,175 --> 00:46:24,142
that we have shown them
what we are capable of

612
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:26,178
and it terrifies them.

613
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:37,022
Do any of you want to surrender
to men who fear you?

614
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:41,026
Lay down arms in a battle
that we are winning?

615
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:53,121
Neither do I.

616
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:59,711
Fuck Benjamin Hornigold,

617
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:02,881
his king, and their pardons.

618
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:07,385
This war isn't nearly over.

619
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:13,859
We're not fighting,
and we're not surrendering.

620
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:18,063
So what are we doing?

621
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,734
We're going that way.

622
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:28,073
That's a ship killer.

623
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:31,743
Then he'd be mad to follow us
into it, then, wouldn't he?

624
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:39,417
Billy, soon as he makes
his break to fire, we run.

625
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,769
Port side batteries are readied.

626
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:00,322
Let's encourage them to see reason.

627
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:03,608
Prepare to head up and bring us
into position to fire.

628
00:48:09,116 --> 00:48:10,116
Now.

629
00:48:10,117 --> 00:48:11,416
Now!

630
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,620
There she goes! She's winding up!

631
00:48:15,672 --> 00:48:17,422
Hard to port.

632
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:23,044
What the hell is he doing?

633
00:48:23,096 --> 00:48:25,764
He'll end up
in the middle of that storm.

634
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:27,215
Hold on!

635
00:48:32,856 --> 00:48:34,139
There. Hold her there.

636
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:38,193
- Fire!
<i>- Fire!</i>

637
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:54,993
Bring us hard to port.
Make a course to pursue her.

638
00:49:08,842 --> 00:49:11,009
Make sure the hatches are fully battened.

639
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:12,677
Secure the lashings.

640
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:15,730
Mr. Silver, we got hits
all along the starboard side.

641
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:18,850
When we reach that weather, we're
gonna be taking on water down here.

642
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:26,274
Well, seal it up as best you can.

643
00:49:26,326 --> 00:49:27,776
I'll be down to lend a hand soon.

644
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:35,333
<i>It isn't just him.</i>

645
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:39,254
What?

646
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:44,009
Captain Hume said it took him
every ounce of leverage he could muster

647
00:49:44,044 --> 00:49:46,461
to secure just 10 pardons.

648
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:48,213
And now Hornigold holds 80 of them.

649
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,349
Maybe Flint's right.
Maybe they are getting nervous.

650
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:54,019
Or maybe someone else
secured them for him.

651
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:57,055
Someone larger
than Hume or Hornigold.

652
00:49:57,057 --> 00:50:00,358
Someone to whom the rules
as we understand them don't apply.

653
00:50:02,195 --> 00:50:04,612
Flint was right about one thing.

654
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:08,950
<i>This is only the beginning.</i>

655
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:11,403
Something else is coming.

656
00:51:11,965 --> 00:51:15,967
<i>Judge: "For years
you lorded over the operations</i>

657
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:20,138
<i>of hundreds, if not thousands,
of hardened pirates.</i>

658
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,857
<i>How exactly were you</i>
<i>able to manage this?"</i>

659
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:26,978
Accused:
"One day at a time, I suppose."

660
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:31,566
I enjoyed that.

661
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:42,243
There is a funny thing
about notoriety,

662
00:51:42,295 --> 00:51:44,662
and I have a little
experience with this.

663
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:47,332
The more people know of you,

664
00:51:47,384 --> 00:51:52,053
the more of you those people
feel belongs to them.

665
00:51:52,506 --> 00:51:55,673
Now, right now,
there is a barrister

666
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:57,892
who feels entitled to say,

667
00:51:57,928 --> 00:52:01,646
"I am the one who convicted
Eleanor Guthrie."

668
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:05,233
A judge who wants to say,
"I was the one who hanged her."

669
00:52:05,268 --> 00:52:08,069
A throng of people outside...

670
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:10,855
"I was the one
who cheered as she swung."

671
00:52:10,907 --> 00:52:13,858
They all feel entitled
to a part of your story.

672
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,410
And it's a hell of a story.

673
00:52:15,445 --> 00:52:17,028
So you can imagine
how difficult it was for me

674
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,281
to arrange it so that I could say,

675
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:22,283
"I am the one who set her free."

676
00:52:22,335 --> 00:52:24,419
Who the fuck are you?

677
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:30,175
My name is Woodes Rogers,

678
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,261
and I am the next governor
of New Providence Island.

679
00:52:33,296 --> 00:52:37,298
Well, assuming I can subdue her.

680
00:52:39,302 --> 00:52:41,102
That is where you come in.

681
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:45,557
I am to set sail
for the West Indies in two days' time.

682
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,109
I am prepared.

683
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:51,446
But the one element
I lack is knowledge,

684
00:52:51,481 --> 00:52:53,948
<i>someone who understands Nassau</i>

685
00:52:53,984 --> 00:52:56,201
<i>and can help me know</i>
<i>what I'm going to find there.</i>

686
00:52:56,236 --> 00:52:59,154
<i>If you agree</i>
<i>to be that person for me,</i>

687
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,706
<i>your sentence will be commuted</i>

688
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:04,459
<i>and the charges</i>
<i>against you released.</i>

689
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:06,411
And what would you ask of me?

690
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:10,715
I understand it is an
uncomfortable position for you,

691
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,251
feeling like you're betraying
people you've known so closely...

692
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:15,753
Specifically,
what would I have to do?

693
00:53:15,805 --> 00:53:19,641
To begin with?

694
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:21,176
A list.

695
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:25,430
<i>The names of those on the island</i>
<i>who could be made allies,</i>

696
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:28,516
<i>those who would be harder to sway.</i>

697
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,166
You want to civilize Nassau?

698
00:53:46,786 --> 00:53:49,287
That is the only name
you need concern yourself with.

699
00:53:59,883 --> 00:54:02,300
As long as he is alive,
you cannot succeed.

700
00:54:34,334 --> 00:54:36,668
<i>Your slaves are making progress.</i>

701
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:48,646
You know I take no pleasure in it.

702
00:54:48,682 --> 00:54:49,931
If there were any other way...

703
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:54,152
Jack, if I thought it
gave you any pleasure,

704
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:57,438
I'd have killed you
the moment you suggested it.

705
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:01,943
Hmm.

706
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:05,113
<i>The first moment</i>
<i>I saw it on the beach,</i>

707
00:55:05,165 --> 00:55:08,166
I thought, "My God,

708
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:11,669
the things I'm going
to build with this."

709
00:55:11,705 --> 00:55:13,705
A city...

710
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:17,175
alive in a place
it has no right to be,

711
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:21,346
in defiance of all reason
and refusing to be dislodged,

712
00:55:21,381 --> 00:55:25,016
but growing and...

713
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:32,807
a place that, 50 years hence
and when I'm long gone

714
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:36,394
<i>would force the world</i>
<i>to acknowledge</i>

715
00:55:36,396 --> 00:55:38,146
Jack Rackham was here.

716
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:44,202
I swear to God,
when I sit here long enough,

717
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:45,987
I can hear it laughing at me.

718
00:55:51,745 --> 00:55:54,045
You don't have to be here, you know.

719
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,082
I have made it clear to all involved
they are to be treated fairly.

720
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:02,553
You think if you refrain from
beating them, it's any better?

721
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:09,177
It isn't the violence.

722
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:15,600
It isn't the labor or the hunger

723
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:17,435
or the heat or the chains.

724
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:23,574
You know what those men
fear right now?

725
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:28,246
It's the unknown.

726
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:33,868
<i>Lash that comes from nowhere</i>
<i>for reasons never explained.</i>

727
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,170
<i>A visit from the taskmaster</i>
<i>in the dead of night.</i>

728
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,874
<i>But I remember that fear.</i>

729
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:44,796
Right now, I feel it returning.

730
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:48,633
<i>What we're doing here,</i>

731
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:51,853
<i>sitting on Spain's gold</i>
<i>on England's island,</i>

732
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:54,105
demands a response.

733
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,061
<i>What that response will be,</i>

734
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:03,781
<i>what form it will take,</i>

735
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:05,817
<i>what face it will wear...</i>

736
00:57:09,155 --> 00:57:12,540
<i>by the time we do know it,</i>
<i>there will be no time</i>

737
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:14,409
<i>to prepare for the blow</i>
<i>that follows.</i>

738
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,705
Hmm.

739
00:58:38,278 --> 00:58:39,861
Excuse me, sir.

740
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:45,033
I wonder if you could help me
locate an old friend of mine.

741
00:58:47,787 --> 00:58:49,621
His name is Charles Vane.
