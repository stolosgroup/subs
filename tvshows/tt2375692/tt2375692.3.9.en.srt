1
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:13,438
The governor has everything he needs

2
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:16,368
and no reason to suspect
anything is amiss.

3
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,153
If we can intercept that caravan,

4
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:20,687
we can secure both the
money to start our war

5
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,623
and the partner to help us fight it.

6
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:24,691
Either we get Jack and the cache...

7
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,665
- or we get nothing.
- Where's Vane?

8
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,030
The militia arrived
before he could get away.

9
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,798
We had no choice but to run.

10
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:32,667
Charles Vane swinging over Nassau

11
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,713
is a statement we cannot
afford to be made.

12
00:00:34,714 --> 00:00:38,172
You cannot stay. I'll go back
and address the situation.

13
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:39,339
By the time I'm through,

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,675
the governor won't be able to hang Vane

15
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:42,509
out of fear of losing the street.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,478
Set a course to intercept her.

17
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,448
That ship will be upon us
in two hours. Maybe less.

18
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,483
I know you now. I trust you now.

19
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:52,186
I love you now. So I will
tell you the absolute truth

20
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,521
about how I'm going to react
when faced with the thing

21
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,490
sitting in that cell in your fort...

22
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,908
I honestly don't know.

25
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,281
We're not far now.

26
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,358
We should be sighting the island soon.

27
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:10,600
And Hornigold?

28
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:14,089
He's two miles astern, give or take.

29
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,193
Managed to keep ahead of
him through the night.

30
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:21,930
It will be tight ferrying everyone
ashore before he's upon us,

31
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:27,720
but, Mr. Silver has suggested
a radical solution.

32
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,307
I noticed that you've locked it.

33
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:37,112
Do you mind me asking who has the key?

34
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,114
Neptune.

35
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:42,601
I threw it over the
side a few hours ago.

36
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,857
If you're concerned about
the men stealing from it...

37
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:51,692
I am concerned about the
men stealing from it.

38
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:53,794
There's treasure inside that box,

39
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:56,696
a handful of which could provide
a lifetime of prosperity.

40
00:03:56,697 --> 00:03:58,032
Facing that kind of temptation,

41
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:00,224
there are few men I would
trust to self-deny.

42
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:03,928
But it is not the treasure
that concerns me most.

43
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:08,107
Charles Vane's sacrifice is in that box.

44
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:12,845
If your man is unsuccessful
in seeing to his rescue,

45
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:16,453
Charles Vane's death is inside that box.

46
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,103
Along with my good name.

47
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,836
Along with her lost love.

48
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:26,387
Along with your late
quartermaster's life.

49
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:32,497
All the awful sacrifices
made to assemble that box

50
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:34,000
are now part of its contents,

51
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,494
and those things...

52
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:41,357
are sacred things that I
trust in no man's hands.

53
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,044
The next time that chest is opened

54
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:48,213
will be after Anne and
I walk away with it,

55
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:50,745
And once the smoke is cleared...

56
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,641
and all is done.

57
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:59,175
Captain, it's time.

58
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:42,834
"I, Charles Vane, do hereby plead guilty

59
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:47,074
to the charges of treason
and high seas piracy.

60
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:50,674
I understand that the
sentence for my crimes

61
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,779
is to be hanged by the neck until dead.

62
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:59,316
It is my hope that in
exchange for this plea

63
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:02,195
I might be spared the humiliation

64
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,653
of a public trial,

65
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,863
and that my execution be carried out...

66
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,834
privately and mercifully."

67
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:23,007
At noon tomorrow, you'll be
transported under guard to the bay,

68
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,340
where you'll be boarded onto the Shark

69
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,037
and sent to London to face
a Court of the Admiralty.

70
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,114
Agree to this plea, and the
governor will endorse it.

71
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:35,886
We'll see to it that
it is heard favorably

72
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,238
and your experience in London
will be short and dignified.

73
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,011
Refuse to sign it, and your
experience will be anything but.

74
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:53,019
You came all the way down here
to ask me to beg for mercy?

75
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:57,393
What a fantasy this
must have been for you.

76
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:01,876
Well, even if I did sign that,

77
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:05,204
we both know how empty
the victory would be,

78
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:08,316
seeing as you don't give a shit

79
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,682
about my piracy or my treason.

80
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,389
The only crime of mine that angers you

81
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,359
is the one that no one
else cared enough about

82
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,928
to even call a crime.

83
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:22,280
Am I wrong?

84
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:27,385
Is the murder of Richard Guthrie
mentioned anywhere on that page?

85
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:30,624
You fucking coward.

86
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:37,678
When Charles Vane takes
something from a man,

87
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,013
he looks him in the eye and
gives him a chance to deny him.

88
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,426
It's all bullshit.

89
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:44,555
It was always bullshit.

90
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:47,854
You stole my father from
me in the dead of night

91
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:49,178
like a rank fucking cutpurse,

92
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,691
and you did it because you
weren't man enough to face me,

93
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:53,327
to show yourself.

94
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:59,057
So you found the lowest, cruelest,
weakest deed imaginable

95
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,426
and acted it out upon an innocent man

96
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,212
with whom you had no quarrel...

97
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,033
knowing that I had finally

98
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,434
begun to build something with him,

99
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,237
that I was finally able
to see the good in him.

100
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:13,624
He was a shit.

101
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:17,460
What did you just say?

102
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,479
He was a cowardly,
selfish, treacherous shit

103
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,269
who cared only for himself
and for you not at all.

104
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,650
You know this.

105
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:26,912
All your life you knew this.

106
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:30,727
Then suddenly he walks
back through your door,

107
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,720
tells you he can give you
all of the things you want,

108
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:38,228
tells you I'm your enemy,
and, just like that,

109
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,167
his love is sacred and mine
is a inconvenient obstacle

110
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,168
to your ambitions.

111
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:47,283
The life cycle of your affections...

112
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:52,502
A man you love who speaks the truth

113
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,670
shunted aside in favor of the next

114
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:57,524
who will tell you whatever
you want to hear.

115
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,393
Goodbye, Charles.

116
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,631
He betrayed you, Eleanor.

117
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,089
When my men brought him to me first,

118
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,958
he begged for mercy.

119
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,176
Then he promised to make me rich.

120
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,165
But when he realized
neither had any effect,

121
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,092
he promised to deliver you to me.

122
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,664
Promised to exchange your life for his.

123
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:36,311
That is who your father was, Eleanor.

124
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,313
And you know it's true.

125
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,086
You're not a man.

126
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,730
You're deformed. Unformed.

127
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,611
Flesh, bone, and bile,

128
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:20,605
and missing all that which takes
shape through a mother's love.

129
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,993
You cannot comprehend
what you took from me

130
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,477
or why it was good,

131
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:32,349
because there is no goodness in you.

132
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:37,531
There is no humanity in you,

133
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,287
no capacity for compromise,

134
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,070
nor instinct toward repair,

135
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:48,703
nor progress.

136
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:52,453
Nor forgiveness.

137
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:01,597
You are an animal.

138
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:15,691
Nassau is moving on
from you, and so am I.

139
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,068
Open up.

140
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,803
What is this?

141
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:48,072
He insisted upon seeing
his senior counselors.

142
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,940
I see that. Why's he
doing it in his bedroom?

143
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,410
Because I confined him to his bed.

144
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:55,402
Confined him? He was
fine a few hours ago.

145
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,514
He collapsed after you left.

146
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,316
I believe his fever is worsening.

147
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:02,334
I will do what I can.

148
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,422
How long can we wait for
Captain Hornigold's return

149
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:09,626
before we can assume that he's failed
to seize Captain Flint's ship?

150
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:12,356
At which point I must strongly urge

151
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,664
that we shift preparations

152
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,700
from retrieving the stolen Urca treasure

153
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,102
to preparing for a Spanish
move against the island.

154
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:23,005
Gentlemen, if Captain Hornigold
fails to retrieve the cache,

155
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:26,009
then we will redouble our
efforts and try again.

156
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,477
However, when he returns,

157
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:30,446
it would be easier for me
to prosecute those efforts

158
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,215
if I am not dead from exhaustion.

159
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:34,650
Now, your counsel is invaluable,

160
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:36,986
but until I'm able to recover my health,

161
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,355
I ask that all information
you need to relay to me

162
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,135
be done through Ms. Guthrie here.

163
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,524
I beg your pardon, my lord.

164
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:46,007
On this issue, I need no counsel,
Mr. Soames, thank you.

165
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,013
Thank you all.

166
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,080
Go away.

167
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:22,944
You collapsed.

168
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:25,850
You saw him.

169
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:29,688
Yes.

170
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,440
I know what you took
with you into that cell.

171
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,911
I don't care what happened.

172
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,012
Just tell me whether you were able

173
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:41,626
to leave it behind in that cell.

174
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,810
There is no leaving it behind,

175
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,760
but I'm ready to move forward.

176
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,496
Depth at 14 fathoms!

177
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:33,950
Mr. De Groot, depth at 14 fathoms.

178
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:38,804
Hang the starboard and stern anchors.

179
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,572
Hang the starboard and
the stern anchors.

180
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,774
He thinks we've lost our minds.

181
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,294
Always a possibility.

182
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:47,546
Well, he's carrying out the order,

183
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:50,482
so have to hope he sees
some credibility in it.

184
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:52,150
That or he doesn't know how to say no

185
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:53,877
to the both of us at the same time.

186
00:14:56,674 --> 00:15:01,710
You still see some credibility
in the idea, don't you?

187
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:06,631
Are you fucking kidding me?

188
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,099
When I offered this suggestion,

189
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,334
I told you it was just a suggestion.

190
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,136
You said it would work.

191
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:15,139
Well, it's a certainty if
we anchor and try and ferry

192
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,942
ourselves and all our cargo ashore,

193
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:19,643
our long-boats will be easy targets

194
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,212
for Hornigold's guns.

195
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,679
In the absence of any
better suggestions,

196
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,933
yours was worth a try.

197
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,155
Depth at 12 fathoms!

198
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:33,882
Depth at 12 fathoms!

199
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:39,363
Captain, both anchors
are hung and ready.

200
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:40,830
Awaiting your order.

201
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,820
Depth at 10 fathoms!

202
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:54,128
Why isn't he reducing sail?

203
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:57,662
Depth at eight fathoms!

204
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:59,674
Depth at eight fathoms!

205
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:04,067
Captain, if we miss our mark
by as little as a boat length,

206
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:05,870
it could be catastrophic.

207
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,918
He knows.

208
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:14,896
Depth at five fathoms!

209
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:17,415
Depth at five fathoms!

210
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,711
Hard to port, Mr. Williamson.

211
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,047
Aye, sir.

212
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,315
Let fall the starboard anchor.

213
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:35,617
Take courses and topgallants.

214
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:37,495
Let go starboard anchor.

215
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,293
Let go of starboard anchor, quickly.

216
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:02,226
Hard to starboard if you
please, Mr. Williamson.

217
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,184
Let fall the stern anchor.

218
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:15,072
On your stern anchor, let fall!

219
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:30,202
Surge the stern cable.

220
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:33,524
Surge the bow. Ready for impact.

221
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:56,845
Douse the topsails!

222
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,431
Open the gunports.

223
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,723
Take the courses and come
about on a starboard tack.

224
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,586
Break off our pursuit, sir?

225
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:24,817
Unless you'd like to approach
into the teeth of his broadsides.

226
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:26,557
Bring us up the coast.

227
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,025
We'll deploy our men onto the sand,

228
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,628
free of his great guns,

229
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:31,068
and then march them in to...

230
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,108
engage.

231
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:42,830
Jesus.

232
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:04,760
Whoa. Whoa.

233
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:18,556
You know, my father used to tell me

234
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,466
that when the world promises
undesirable outcomes,

235
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:25,014
only a fool believes he
can alter the latter

236
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,612
without first addressing
the state of the former.

237
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:30,251
Now, we are living in a world

238
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,288
where Nassau has embraced English rule,

239
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:36,092
where former pirates now
exchange pleasantries

240
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,959
with soldiers in the street,

241
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,363
and where the last man to
stand up and defy England

242
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:44,442
is about to be shipped
back there to be hanged.

243
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:48,787
And exactly no one seems
to give a shit about it.

244
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,337
So...

245
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,574
I'm here to remedy all that.

246
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,281
Before we go any further, there's
something you need to know.

247
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,383
Circumstances have changed in town

248
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:05,653
dramatically since Jack's escape
and Captain Vane's capture.

249
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:07,555
The governor knows there was a spy

250
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:08,930
that made the escape possible.

251
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:11,192
His people are on high alert.

252
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:12,393
The street is anxious.

253
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:13,860
Getting that kind of information again

254
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,905
- may be impossible.
- There'll be time for spies again.

255
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:17,282
We're not up to that yet.

256
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:19,999
The first order of business

257
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,735
for which I will need your help

258
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:24,536
- is rescuing Captain Vane.
- Rescuing?

259
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:26,207
There are a hundred redcoats

260
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,575
between him and the
front door of the fort.

261
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:30,177
Even if there was a way to get to him,

262
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,012
he's set to be shipped out tomorrow.

263
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,246
There isn't nearly time to find it...

264
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:34,766
Of course there isn't.

265
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:37,530
So we need to make sure
they don't ship him out.

266
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,493
Not tomorrow, not ever.

267
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:41,683
We force them to try him here.

268
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:43,523
Buy ourselves days, maybe weeks,

269
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:45,024
while they figure out a process

270
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:47,093
and we find a plan to set him free.

271
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:48,138
How?

272
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,781
How do we keep him off the ship?

273
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,359
By making sure people
give a shit about it.

274
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,559
You sent for me?

275
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,862
Dr. Marcus says that the
stress of receiving visitors

276
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:25,296
is aggravating his condition,

277
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,355
so I will seal off this room from today.

278
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,134
No one will be permitted in

279
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,896
other than myself and the doctor.

280
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:34,236
As long as this state of
affairs is necessary,

281
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:35,819
I would like you to tend to him.

282
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,051
Of course.

283
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:46,440
How long has he been asleep?

284
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:49,808
He woke a few hours ago
just for a moment.

285
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:54,028
Did you inform him of this
plan to sequester him?

286
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:57,077
- No.
- Why not?

287
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:00,014
Because he looked at me and
addressed me as Sarah.

288
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:01,366
He thought I was his wife.

289
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:09,011
He was delirious with fever.

290
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:12,714
If his condition changes,
please send word.

291
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:52,490
Is that it?

292
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:54,709
It is.

293
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:58,265
How long before their force arrives?

294
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:01,173
A few days for Captain
Hornigold to return to Nassau

295
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:04,577
and report that the cache is
defended by a small army.

296
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:08,380
Three days to muster
soldiers and supply ships.

297
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,383
A week, more or less,

298
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:14,219
before the governor's forces
arrive on our coasts.

299
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,839
Then we have much preparation
to do and little time to do it.

300
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,251
What happened to him?

301
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,129
It was all a misunderstanding.

302
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:44,038
What was that?

303
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:45,722
What was what?

304
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:50,003
You told me that that man was
taken to task by her bodyguard.

305
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:51,485
Was that not the case?

306
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,872
Dobbs assaulted him.

307
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:55,959
He believes him responsible

308
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,463
for choosing the men to
be interrogated by them.

309
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,693
I didn't mention it to you because...

310
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,720
I don't know. I just didn't.

311
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:07,580
But it's been sorted.

312
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:11,508
Good.

313
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:13,944
Sorted how?

314
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:18,481
I had three men hold him down while
Dooley and Wayne administered a beating.

315
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,748
The message was received.
I'm quite certain.

316
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:24,990
Sorted.

317
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:54,334
We were successful.

318
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:57,619
The war we sought will
soon be under way.

319
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,029
On our terms.

320
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:10,518
I was there in Nassau,

321
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:13,702
and she's there.

322
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,805
Eleanor is there.

323
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,235
In a position of great
influence, they say,

324
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:24,093
at the right hand of the governor.

325
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:27,254
She is one of them now.

326
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,441
I stood in Nassau and I realized

327
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:37,932
when this war begins,

328
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:40,994
it will have many different meanings,

329
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:42,576
but to you

330
00:25:43,104 --> 00:25:45,477
this war is a civil war

331
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:49,970
between two cities you
held together for so long

332
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,925
with unseen bonds.

333
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,094
You will have people
on both sides of it.

334
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,996
You will have daughters
on both sides of it.

335
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:05,485
And I want you to know...

336
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,399
Only...

337
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,272
you.

338
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:36,176
You have information about the identity

339
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,202
of the spy within our midst.

340
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:44,752
It's Idelle.

341
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,895
She's the one that
learned the secret route

342
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:51,250
for the governor's caravan.

343
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:55,599
The one that made possible
Captain Rackham's escape.

344
00:26:58,144 --> 00:27:00,240
Have you told anyone of this?

345
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,212
No.

346
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:06,923
Why not?

347
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,270
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

348
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:14,760
I know Eleanor engaged you
those months ago to watch me.

349
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,610
If you took this information to her,

350
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:21,541
it would likely garner you
credit with her at my expense.

351
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,809
I know you have considered it.

352
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:28,232
I am asking why you did not do it.

353
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:32,959
Eleanor Guthrie used that chair

354
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,394
not just to vanquish her enemies,

355
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:38,077
but to create new ones.

356
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,401
Because some people can
only understand themselves

357
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:45,521
through the eyes of those who hate them.

358
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,342
They thrive only on sowing the seeds

359
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:52,312
of their own eventual destruction.

360
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:54,950
Miss Guthrie has new clothes now.

361
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:57,043
Miss Guthrie has new friends now.

362
00:27:57,438 --> 00:28:01,070
But to my eye, she looks the same.

363
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,457
You think I will outlast her here,

364
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,504
so you would cast your
lot with me and not her?

365
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:11,996
Something like that. Yes, ma'am.

366
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:20,872
Will you please make sure, when
the governor's men visit the inn,

367
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,675
they are serviced by girls you trust?

368
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:27,488
There will be no more information
seeping out of the inn.

369
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:29,571
Of course.

370
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,245
Will you tell her? Miss Guthrie.

371
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,289
Will you inform her of our suspicions

372
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,007
about the source of the leak?

373
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:46,963
Davis... Davis, you remember
the time the captain...

374
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:48,199
Do you know him?

375
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:50,889
I do not.

376
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:54,904
But Featherstone says he's one of the
most gifted purveyors of bullshit

377
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:56,110
he's ever met.

378
00:28:56,675 --> 00:29:00,244
And a man determined, above anything
else in life, to be famous.

379
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:02,812
Which makes him the perfect fit for us.

380
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:05,628
Stronger and safer
than ever was before.

381
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:07,942
What's he saying?

382
00:29:08,651 --> 00:29:10,886
The governor wants him to
believe that Charles Vane

383
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:12,387
is the cause of all their ill.

384
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,489
It's a lot easier to watch a man swing

385
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,528
if you're comfortable hating
him just a little bit.

386
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:20,528
His task is to start reminding everyone

387
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,863
there's someone else out there

388
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:24,009
that they're far more
comfortable hating.

389
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:26,001
Who?

390
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:44,845
What is it?

391
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:49,545
When I sent for you, there
were approximately 20 of them.

392
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:53,084
In ten minutes, it has grown two-fold.

393
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:55,332
What is he saying?

394
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:59,232
That the law and order
promised by the new regime

395
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,900
is little more than a veneer,

396
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:03,637
behind which Eleanor
Guthrie has returned

397
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:08,558
to settle old scores and restore her
tyranny over Nassau once again.

398
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:13,546
I hear they will threaten
to stand in the way

399
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:16,416
of any attempt to remove
Charles Vane off the island,

400
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:21,120
that if he's to be tried,
it must be here, in the open,

401
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,056
where they can see it
with their own eyes.

402
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:24,671
Fucking kidding me.

403
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,626
Vane is scheduled to be moved

404
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:28,843
from the fort to the
Shark in a few hours.

405
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:31,397
Chamberlain is making
arrangements right now.

406
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:32,771
Is there anything you can do about this?

407
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:34,467
To dispel what is building down there,

408
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:36,769
it is going to require appeasement

409
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,938
or it is going to require force.

410
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:41,507
Appeasement. Hold his trial here.

411
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:44,343
To begin with, the lawyers
aren't even sure

412
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,510
that we have the authority to do that

413
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,075
without a judge yet appointed,

414
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,042
and even if it were legitimate,

415
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:51,684
proceeding like that would last weeks.

416
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:55,121
Dredge up a dark past just when
progress is so near at hand.

417
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,356
If the alternative is an armed clash

418
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,290
between those men and
the dozens of soldiers

419
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,759
it would take to subdue them,

420
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,961
a little time spent confronting the past

421
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,363
may be the lesser evil.

422
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,031
I can't believe this is a coincidence...

423
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,267
A plot to steal the cache
followed so closely

424
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,788
by something as choreographed as this.

425
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,543
I'll take this to the governor.

426
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,855
You should be careful.

427
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,182
I understand the governor has tasked you

428
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,658
with being his eyes and
ears while he convalesces.

429
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:29,987
In this particular instance,

430
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,522
you would be wise to make sure,

431
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,190
whatever happens to Captain Vane,

432
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:37,184
those men have no reason to believe
it happened because of you.

433
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,066
Whatever happens will be
the governor's decision.

434
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,685
Of course.

435
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:57,758
- Any change?
- No.

436
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,103
May I have a moment with him, please?

437
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,524
I warned you...

438
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,711
the closer you let me get to you,

439
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:30,207
the more dangerous I would be.

440
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:37,216
I've never given a damn
what people think of me.

441
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:39,989
But I give a damn what you think.

442
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,726
I hope that when you wake,

443
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,463
you will understand
why I did what I did,

444
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:50,899
you will see that it was
all I could think to do

445
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,318
to protect you...

446
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,555
the only way I know how.

447
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,056
Any news?

448
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:20,913
They say it shouldn't be long now
before Mr. Scott leaves us.

449
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:29,546
We need to talk about that.

450
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:34,623
What about it?

451
00:33:35,777 --> 00:33:37,644
We're about to enter into a battle

452
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,679
where every man must be behind us

453
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,682
as any man with motive not to be so

454
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:43,017
could sink us.

455
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:45,519
It would seem that you have made sure

456
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,150
that he has one.

457
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:51,826
If it'd gotten out, what he did,

458
00:33:52,383 --> 00:33:54,616
you would likely be
stranded back in Nassau.

459
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:56,462
Most of our men would be dead,

460
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:59,359
and those that weren't would be
back in those cages right now.

461
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:04,993
So you sent the vanguard to make
sure that he understood this?

462
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:08,040
To prevent him from getting any ideas

463
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,709
about doing it again, yes.

464
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,051
If you have something to add,
you should just fucking say it.

465
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:20,185
That's not why you did it.

466
00:34:20,186 --> 00:34:23,971
Really? Would you like to
tell me why I did it, then?

467
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:26,553
Well, I wasn't there,

468
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:31,163
but, um, I'd hazard the guess

469
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:35,200
that you learned of what had happened,

470
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:38,470
told him how fucking stupid he was,

471
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,138
and in that moment,

472
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,741
he gave you a look that
amounted to something

473
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:44,410
less than contrite.

474
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,837
And in that moment, you felt it.

475
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,872
- Felt what?
- Darkness.

476
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:54,973
Hate.

477
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:59,023
Showing indifference to the authority

478
00:34:59,024 --> 00:35:01,594
that you sacrificed so much to acquire,

479
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:06,431
disdain for refusing to acknowledge

480
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:09,053
that his actions,
had you not intervened,

481
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:10,727
would have led to an outcome

482
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:13,441
that he would have held you
responsible for reversing.

483
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,618
Pride.

484
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:19,843
Questioning what kind of man you are

485
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:22,830
if you don't seek retribution
for the offense.

486
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:26,919
So what are you saying?

487
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,299
You saying I went too far with him?

488
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:33,023
Maybe you went too far.

489
00:35:33,024 --> 00:35:34,524
Maybe you didn't go far enough.

490
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:36,292
Maybe you did it just right.

491
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:38,562
The point is that while
you were doing it,

492
00:35:39,368 --> 00:35:43,700
you heard a voice telling
you that disciplining him

493
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:46,477
would prevent him from
repeating the offense,

494
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,739
a voice that sounded like reason,

495
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,474
and there was reason to it,

496
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:53,943
as the most compelling lies

497
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:57,026
are comprised almost
entirely of the truth.

498
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,068
But that's what it does.

499
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,788
Cloaks itself in whatever it must

500
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,489
to move you to action.

501
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,291
And the more you deny its presence,

502
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,826
the more powerful it gets,

503
00:36:11,632 --> 00:36:14,930
and the more likely it is
to consume you entirely

504
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:17,372
without you ever even
knowing it was there.

505
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:22,203
Now,

506
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:27,142
if you and I are to lead
these men together,

507
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:31,014
you must learn to know its presence well

508
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:36,670
so that you may use it...
Rather than it use you.

509
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:42,803
You have some experience
with this, I imagine,

510
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,108
living in fear of such
a thing within you?

511
00:36:47,145 --> 00:36:48,365
Yeah, I do.

512
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:57,669
I can't tell if this was a warning

513
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,257
or a welcome.

514
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:58,323
I need to make an
offering at his burial.

515
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:03,018
Something of mine that
he can take with him.

516
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:10,793
I'm sorry. I...

517
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:14,051
I don't know what to say.

518
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,981
What?

519
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:52,650
I'm sorry. I didn't get
word until it was done.

520
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:55,119
- I came immediately.
- Well, what happened?

521
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:57,754
The crew of the Shark is standing down.

522
00:38:57,755 --> 00:39:00,991
The governor has scrapped his plans
to move Captain Vane off the island

523
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,627
and then scheduled an accelerated trial
for the captain here in Nassau.

524
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:07,129
Shit. When did they
schedule it to begin?

525
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,164
In the middle of the night. Last night.

526
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:10,600
It's already happened.

527
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,901
You said there was no
judge appointed here.

528
00:39:11,902 --> 00:39:14,236
It was supposed to take days before
they could start the process.

529
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:16,339
They appointed a judge,
they impaneled a jury.

530
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,007
It was over before anyone knew it began.

531
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:21,010
- Where is Vane now?
- Still in the fort.

532
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:23,913
But when I left the street,
they were carrying the timber

533
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:25,572
to assemble a gallows in the square.

534
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,582
They mean to hang him today.

535
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,826
The governor is still
in need of bed rest,

536
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:40,362
but Dr. Marcus will inform us
when that situation changes.

537
00:39:40,363 --> 00:39:42,414
Gentlemen.

538
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:57,445
When the governor arrived and
the island embraced him,

539
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:59,681
a bargain was struck.

540
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,185
Authority was ceded, in exchange
for which the law returned.

541
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,554
Law, which constrained that authority,

542
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,690
made outcomes more predictable.

543
00:40:09,691 --> 00:40:14,127
But this outcome would
seem most unpredictable.

544
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:15,996
The law was adhered to.

545
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,399
If the bargain changes,

546
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,514
there is no telling what else
will change as a result...

547
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,171
What trust may be lost

548
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,290
and what chaos may abound.

549
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:32,118
I am your friend,

550
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:36,349
and I will help you weather
whatever challenges

551
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,086
may lie down whatever
road you may choose,

552
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:42,388
but as your friend, I
am simply asking you

553
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:45,258
to consider how treacherous
this road may be...

554
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:48,478
While there is still time to avoid it.

555
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:52,535
No one is taking this decision
lightly, I assure you.

556
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,325
This is no attempt to
circumvent the law.

557
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,170
Indeed, the governor felt
that it was necessary

558
00:40:58,171 --> 00:40:59,786
in order to protect it.

559
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:05,172
It was a hard choice.

560
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,505
But an earnest one.

561
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:04,673
I assume you understand
what is to happen,

562
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:07,920
as soon as everything begins.

563
00:42:10,024 --> 00:42:12,391
It'll be loud, confusing.

564
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:19,333
Men who've never experienced fear
are said to know it for the first time.

565
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:23,421
But in this moment, there is quiet.

566
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,776
An opportunity to find
some measure of peace.

567
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,045
I would like to help you do that.

568
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:35,799
You've done this before?

569
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:37,392
I have.

570
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,931
Regretfully, I have.

571
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:42,278
Get many takers, do you?

572
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:45,591
For the kind of peace you're offering?

573
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,147
It is a different experience

574
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:52,513
to what you may imagine it being.

575
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:56,552
Surely a man like you
has faced death before,

576
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:58,095
but never so nakedly.

577
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:01,190
And cloaked in glory or sacrifice,

578
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,399
fully exposed in all its
horror and finality.

579
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:09,131
In this moment, you have the opportunity

580
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:12,099
to enter into that moment
with a clear conscience.

581
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,621
I can help you do that.

582
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:19,089
To repent.

583
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,478
I have nothing to repent for with you.

584
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:27,155
Don't you?

585
00:43:34,056 --> 00:43:36,711
I understand the code you subscribe to.

586
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:39,861
I understand you believe your violence

587
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:42,930
is justified in the name
of a defiance of tyranny,

588
00:43:43,861 --> 00:43:46,783
but there are mothers who buried
their sons because of you.

589
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:50,551
Wives widowed because of you.

590
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:53,673
Children awoken in their sleep

591
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:56,074
to be told their father was never
coming home because of you.

592
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,846
What kind of a man can experience
no remorse from this?

593
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:03,516
Whatever remorse I have
or do not have is my own.

594
00:44:04,169 --> 00:44:07,440
That I choose not to share it with you

595
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,505
says more about you
than it does about me.

596
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:14,683
Me?

597
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,403
I am a shepherd

598
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:21,033
sent to help you find a
path to God's forgiveness.

599
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,445
A shepherd?

600
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:26,232
You are the sheep.

601
00:44:31,663 --> 00:44:33,545
And whatever I have to say to God,

602
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:36,165
I'll tell him myself or not at all.

603
00:44:40,821 --> 00:44:44,423
When our lord governor arrived here,

604
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:47,325
he promised you things.

605
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,063
Order. Prosperity.

606
00:44:52,451 --> 00:44:55,200
- How many men are with you?
- A dozen.

607
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,721
I don't know how far they'll go.
Not in the face of all that out there.

608
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:01,299
That'll have to be enough.

609
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:04,842
Position your men around the crowd.
Tell them to be ready to move.

610
00:45:04,843 --> 00:45:06,310
I'm gonna try to shout him down,

611
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:08,746
raise Eleanor Guthrie,
raise whatever I have to

612
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,314
to try and strike a chord.

613
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:12,416
Turn as much of that crowd
as I can in our favor.

614
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,393
Your men should take my lead.

615
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:16,495
Hopefully it'll be enough
to start a frenzy,

616
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:18,844
cause enough confusion to break
the ranks of the soldiers.

617
00:45:19,438 --> 00:45:22,006
Then in the chaos of it, we'll make
a move to free Captain Vane.

618
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:23,951
Go.

619
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:25,935
Do it!

620
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:29,545
Men who are not men at all,

621
00:45:29,546 --> 00:45:32,381
but beasts governed
by the base instinct,

622
00:45:32,382 --> 00:45:35,270
incapable of anything but
the most primal behaviors.

623
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:40,589
A constant threat to every decent,

624
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,008
God-fearing citizen among us.

625
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:46,227
As long as those men roam free,

626
00:45:46,228 --> 00:45:50,098
strife will endure, fear will abound,

627
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,701
and progress will elude us.

628
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:55,603
Today marks the silencing

629
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:57,940
of the most disruptive of those voices

630
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:03,279
and a step towards the return
of civilization in Nassau.

631
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:06,012
But we must always remember

632
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,751
however strong the need
for the removal of these traitors,

633
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:12,529
these relics of a more savage age,

634
00:46:12,755 --> 00:46:15,311
there is no relish in this moment,

635
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,803
but there is righteousness

636
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,394
and comfort in the knowledge that...

637
00:46:20,395 --> 00:46:22,856
- What's happening?
- Wait.

638
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:25,724
- Billy, they're about to tie the noose.
- I know, just...

639
00:46:27,302 --> 00:46:28,769
wait.

640
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:34,073
And that God's will
will be done again in Nassau.

641
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,897
Bastard! Hang him!

642
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:45,085
Does the
condemned have anything to say

643
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:47,702
before the sentence is carried out?

644
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:59,181
These men who brought me here today

645
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,544
do not fear me.

646
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:06,639
They brought me here today
because they fear you.

647
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:10,694
Because they know that my voice,

648
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:14,303
a voice that refuses to be enslaved,

649
00:47:14,848 --> 00:47:16,527
once lived in you.

650
00:47:17,661 --> 00:47:19,368
And may yet still.

651
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,580
They brought me here
today to show you death

652
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:29,922
and use it to frighten you
into ignoring that voice.

653
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,537
But know this.

654
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:38,928
We are many. They are few.

655
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:42,054
To fear death is a choice.

656
00:47:44,276 --> 00:47:46,286
And they can't hang us all.

657
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,749
Get on with it, motherfucker.

658
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:07,056
Billy.

659
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,717
It's all right.

660
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:39,013
Proceed.

661
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:34,833
Now. Go.

662
00:50:13,674 --> 00:50:15,169
Why?

663
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:18,908
It was the only way to start it.

664
00:50:20,794 --> 00:50:22,694
He knew it was the only way.

665
00:50:23,276 --> 00:50:24,841
Start what?

666
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,918
Look at them.

667
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:38,315
Men, move along.

668
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,679
Move along.

669
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,733
The resistance in Nassau
is now under way.

670
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:41,287
Another sacrifice for the cause.

671
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:46,126
And that chest of ours
only gets heavier.

672
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,513
How many, do you imagine?

673
00:51:50,514 --> 00:51:52,348
Soldiers in the English force.

674
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:54,038
How many do you imagine we'll face?

675
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:57,336
500, more or less.

676
00:52:02,277 --> 00:52:03,726
Is that so?

677
00:52:03,727 --> 00:52:06,667
From what I saw, I'd say
seven is a reasonable guess.

678
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:09,698
And that's assuming he doesn't
call in reinforcements

679
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:11,958
from Carolina, Virginia.

680
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:15,936
There's no shortage of men eager
to kill pirates these days.

681
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,032
I walked that beach today.

682
00:52:22,745 --> 00:52:25,380
The terrain inland may
be to her advantage,

683
00:52:25,381 --> 00:52:26,881
but that beach is not.

684
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:29,217
The shore is too broad,
the water too deep.

685
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:31,787
Their anchorages will get
far closer to the sand

686
00:52:31,788 --> 00:52:32,864
than you'd like.

687
00:52:34,873 --> 00:52:37,125
Even with defensive positions
engineered in the bluffs,

688
00:52:37,126 --> 00:52:38,358
it will be an uphill struggle

689
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:41,929
to offer any meaningful resistance
at all to their landings.

690
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:45,027
All struggles are uphill.
That's why they're called struggles.

691
00:52:46,268 --> 00:52:47,969
That's quite true.

692
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,005
But there is an aspect to
this particular struggle

693
00:52:51,006 --> 00:52:52,998
I don't believe you've yet cracked.

694
00:52:54,135 --> 00:52:57,645
I understand your tactical
deployment of the Walrus.

695
00:52:57,646 --> 00:53:00,981
She'll be massively outnumbered,
but still a critical asset.

696
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:03,283
I also understand you intend

697
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:05,637
to place your Mr. De Groot
in command of her.

698
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:08,855
He'll manage.

699
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,132
Yes, but he wasn't your first choice.

700
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:16,646
It was supposed to be
Charles, wasn't it?

701
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:22,245
Are you suggesting a better replacement?

702
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:24,614
Me.

703
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:27,807
England may have removed
Charles Vane from our number,

704
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:29,709
but there is too much of him in me

705
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,678
for England to fully will him away.

706
00:53:31,897 --> 00:53:34,593
In his absence, with
everything that's at stake,

707
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:37,401
I will be our Charles Vane.

708
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:54,666
I've just come back from the beach,

709
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,402
and I couldn't help but notice

710
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,838
the three additional ships
anchored in the bay

711
00:53:59,276 --> 00:54:01,639
being outfitted for this
battle right along with mine.

712
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,710
Captain Hornigold will be
sailing in consort with you,

713
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:06,933
accompanied by his private militia.

714
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:09,681
Mr. Underhill has formed
a special company of men

715
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:11,984
from the ranks of his plantation staff,

716
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:15,020
men with experience hunting
and capturing slaves.

717
00:54:15,398 --> 00:54:16,855
I will not go into battle

718
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:19,324
alongside undisciplined conscripts.

719
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:23,228
The force I bring to bear is sufficient
to combat whatever awaits us.

720
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:25,896
Jesus. He wants the force
you bring to bear.

721
00:54:26,535 --> 00:54:27,870
He wants it.

722
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:30,701
I know this enemy, Commodore.

723
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:32,065
I know his mind.

724
00:54:33,616 --> 00:54:35,772
He took that cache with
the express purpose

725
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,075
of compelling us to commit your force

726
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:39,936
to a battlefield of his choosing.

727
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:42,313
Your force is factored
into his thinking.

728
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:43,781
He has planned for it.

729
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:46,884
And I assure you, if you allow him

730
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:50,614
to dictate the terms of battle,
you court a disastrous outcome.

731
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,422
If he expects your force,

732
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,009
then we must send that
which he does not expect.

733
00:54:57,343 --> 00:54:59,596
For we will have victory
against this enemy.

734
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:01,453
There simply is no alternative.

735
00:55:32,781 --> 00:55:34,889
Just returned from around the point.

736
00:55:36,101 --> 00:55:38,690
The word is spreading
throughout the Bahamas

737
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:44,424
that the governor in Nassau
hanged a pirate in his square.

738
00:55:46,361 --> 00:55:48,944
Made an example of him, they say,

739
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:52,013
to show that he is the
steward of law and order

740
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,849
in the West Indies.

741
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,451
He is resolved to be the Englishman

742
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:59,205
who ends piracy in the New World.

743
00:56:02,476 --> 00:56:06,745
The pirate he hanged in the
square to underscore his point...

744
00:56:08,015 --> 00:56:10,199
was Charles Vane.

745
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:15,971
I have yet to inform the men,

746
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:18,105
as I imagine they'll have questions

747
00:56:18,106 --> 00:56:19,926
I don't know how to answer,

748
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,565
so I wanted to ask you first.

749
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,580
What do you want to do about it?

750
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:32,803
