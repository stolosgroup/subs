1
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:12,898
We're going that way.

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,316
That's a ship killer.

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:15,702
We should have taken the pardons.

4
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:17,680
The men, I understand.

5
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:19,489
Flint had them exactly
where he needed them.

6
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:22,537
But he had me there, too.

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,495
- These are identical.
- What are you suggesting?

8
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:27,714
That we exchange it, find partners,

9
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:30,833
and trade coin for commodities
far easier to protect.

10
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:33,386
I returned to go on
the account as I know it,

11
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,553
because in this place

12
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:36,756
I believed I could find
the men necessary to do so.

13
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:38,341
And in particular one man

14
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:39,809
that I thought worthy
of standing alongside me

15
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:41,728
at the head of a terrible fleet.

16
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:44,397
I'm all too aware what Charles
Vane's capable of destroying

17
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:45,815
when he sets his mind on it.

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,651
What is it you would like
to have him take from you?

19
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:50,153
Captain Flint is dead.

20
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:54,084
We're not moving.

21
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:56,522
The storm drove us east. We are becalmed.

22

24
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,905
Son of the wealthiest man
in St. Kitts, they say.

25
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,294
Also say he fucked his partner

26
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,882
out of their trading company.

27
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,845
Stole it all.

28
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,919
A world where he's the civilized
one and we're the savages

29
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:27,423
is a world I'm never
gonna fuckin' understand.

30
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,909
Oh.

31
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,028
That was nice.

32
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,863
Hopefully we have shown you our thanks

33
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:53,783
for agreeing to conduct
this transaction on our soil

34
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,785
and that we can be most hospitable

35
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,528
to our partners in trade.

36
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,356
Now shall we conclude our business?

37
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:05,592
316 black pearls to be exchanged

38
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,630
for 46,121 pieces of eight.

39
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:12,802
The method of our figuring
this value for each item

40
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:15,279
has been recorded if either
party wishes to know it.

41
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,639
I would like to see it, please.

42
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,769
A literate Negress.

43
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,484
Is there no end to the surprises
this place has to offer?

44
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,618
What the fuck did he just say?

45
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,110
I imagine she comes from slave stock.

46
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:36,531
Of some sort, yeah?

47
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,145
I understand she can dress
as a civilized woman,

48
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:44,050
but to behave as one, that is impressive.

49
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:47,169
The accounts are acceptable.
We have a deal.

50
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,164
You seem like a lovely creature.

51
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:56,312
When the governor arrives,
if you do indeed flee,

52
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:57,396
there will be a place for you in my employ.

53
00:04:57,432 --> 00:05:00,399
Governor? What governor?

54
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:05,404
You are disposing of your treasury

55
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,273
of ill-gotten plunder

56
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:10,826
so you might leave this place
before the new regime arrives.

57
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:13,863
That's what I thought this was
all about in the first place.

58
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,584
You don't know, do you?

59
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,505
- Invasion?
- A fleet.

60
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,707
Eight ships, soldiers, 700,

61
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,510
all led by a man claiming to have
been appointed governor of this place

62
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,844
and empowered to take it back

63
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,713
by force if necessary.

64
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:33,215
News of this is spreading quickly.

65
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,634
How long until they arrive here?

66
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,387
12 days, approximately.

67
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,309
How many batteries have been
repaired on the fort walls?

68
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,027
Two. Two guns each.

69
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,979
The fifth and sixth guns
are going up tomorrow.

70
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:48,531
Did he say how the fleet was comprised?

71
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:49,532
How many men of war?

72
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,150
He didn't say.

73
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,535
Well, how many guns did he say?

74
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,536
He didn't say.

75
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,820
Well, whatever it is,

76
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:55,905
six guns ain't gonna be enough to stop it.

77
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:58,407
If they were supporting a fleet in the bay.

78
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,929
A line in defense of the harbor mouth.

79
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:02,044
Yeah, but how many of those crews

80
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,079
can we honestly expect
to participate in that fight?

81
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:05,987
A third? Half if we're lucky?

82
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:08,057
What if it were all of them?

83
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:09,683
All the crews.

84
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:11,935
All that matter, yes.

85
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:18,158
Burgess. Woodall. The Cockrams.

86
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,693
Have you met those people?

87
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:22,380
They're not exactly
a rally around a flag sort.

88
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,080
How could you possibly convince them all

89
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:26,249
to join a fight like this?

90
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,952
Because if they all join,
there may be no fight.

91
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,870
A show of force.

92
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,506
A massive show of force.

93
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,125
A thousand men, a dozen ships,

94
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,676
plus the man o' war,

95
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,295
all organized for battle.

96
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,764
Organized under who? Flint is
still nowhere to be found.

97
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,966
He'll return in time, and
if he doesn't, I'll do it.

98
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,719
Look me in the face
and tell me you doubt it.

99
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,474
If we all unite, the fight that
we will present to our invaders

100
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:53,700
will appear so costly and painful,

101
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,138
they will choose to walk away from it

102
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:57,230
rather than risk humiliation at our hands.

103
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:58,898
Increase their fear of defeat,

104
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,430
and we decrease the cost of our victory.

105
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,227
I believe it is to be done.

106
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:06,461
Tell me you do, too,

107
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,908
and we'll make it happen together.

108
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:20,921
I've just concluded meeting

109
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,756
with Commodore Chamberlain and his staff.

110
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:25,809
The date has been set
for our arrival in Nassau,

111
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:27,594
roughly two weeks from today,

112
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,262
and when that happens,

113
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:30,930
decisions are gonna be made
over a matter of hours

114
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:34,150
that will determine the future of
the island for decades to come.

115
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:37,771
And almost all of it
is going to depend upon that.

116
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,430
What is this?

117
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:43,443
The address I intend to make
to the inhabitants of Nassau

118
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,828
in which I will invite them all

119
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,413
to accept the King's pardon

120
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:49,249
and join my efforts to restore law, order,

121
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:51,582
and commerce to new Providence island.

122
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:56,539
So you're just going
to sail into the harbor,

123
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,876
row yourself onto the beach, and read this?

124
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,462
Captain Hornigold believes
that without Captain Flint,

125
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,014
there is no one left on that island

126
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,800
capable of mounting an
organized defense of the bay.

127
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,635
Do you disagree?

128
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,303
An organized defense?

129
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:13,273
Captain Flint was the only
true strategist among them.

130
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:14,808
But that doesn't mean that the others

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,609
won't mount a disorganized one.

132
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:19,979
Well, I'm not concerned
about the odd skirmish.

133
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,366
All that matters is whether that works.

134
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,984
Commodore Chamberlain is resolved

135
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,454
that either the pirates
take to the pardon immediately

136
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:31,207
or Nassau will be considered
hostile territory.

137
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,461
He would then mount a full-scale
invasion of the beach,

138
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,046
costing me any chance I might have

139
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,703
of a peaceful transition.

140
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:40,667
And you need my help to ensure

141
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,802
that this address is drawn
to win the most converts?

142
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:45,004
Precisely.

143
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:47,331
How sure are you
that it would be a bad thing?

144
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:49,843
What's that?

145
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,011
If the Navy took over, stormed
the beach and cleared it,

146
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:53,928
and why would that be such a bad thing?

147
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,734
I wouldn't say "law and order" here.

148
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,653
Either is fine. The
phrase they find upsetting.

149
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,689
If the Navy takes the beach,

150
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,657
there is no way I will recapture the trust

151
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,526
of the men who would
otherwise have surrendered.

152
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,027
You wouldn't need their trust

153
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,863
if they were either
dead or terrified of you.

154
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,332
Seems the Navy is offering
to see to one or the other.

155
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,200
It could take months to
pacify the island by force.

156
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,169
It would be preferable to me

157
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:18,037
to spend those months building commerce

158
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,039
instead of putting out fires.

159
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,008
Yes, but if the Navy were to remove anybody

160
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:23,259
who was setting those fires,

161
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,011
again, would that not be preferable?

162
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:27,365
How exactly did you become
the one asking questions here?

163
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,549
And anyone who thinks it's so easy

164
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,050
to win a war by force

165
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,183
has never actually been
responsible for fighting one.

166
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,310
You're not saying that you can't win.

167
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,860
You're saying it would
take too long to win it.

168
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,149
With all these resources,
you could outlast them.

169
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,344
Clearly you could outlast them.

170
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,841
So why are you so concerned about the time?

171
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:59,245
There were a number of parties

172
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,214
to whom I had to make promises

173
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:03,633
in exchange for their
support of this operation,

174
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,419
schedules that had to be met.

175
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:08,304
And with many of these parties,

176
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,974
Whitehall, my equity
investors, my creditors,

177
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,892
the lapse of a deadline or two

178
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,260
might be bargained away.

179
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:17,147
But there is one particular party

180
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,732
whose Patience I do not wish to test,

181
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,268
a party whose history
with the pirates of Nassau

182
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,104
suggests an extreme
reaction would likely follow.

183
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:26,823
Spain.

184
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,863
What did you have to promise them?

185
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,699
That I would seize fort Nassau,

186
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,086
secure the remains of the Urca
de Lima's gold stored within it,

187
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,621
and return it to Havana.

188
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,719
Promptly.

189
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,459
Failure to do so would confirm for them

190
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,545
that I am simply a pirate by another name,

191
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:49,929
not to be trusted,

192
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:52,966
and would result in a launch
of a fleet of ten ships

193
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:56,968
and soldiers numbering 1,500
to raze Nassau to the ground.

194
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,138
How long did they give you?

195
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:02,566
Eight weeks.

196
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,527
Eight? Jesus.

197
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,447
As long as the fort is taken
quickly and in its entirety,

198
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,482
everything should be fine.

199
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,323
We're all dead men.

200
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,353
Smote by a storm,

201
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,666
the product of his rage.

202
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,056
We are dead men.

203
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:37,510
Consigned to a place
where we are no longer worthy

204
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:40,430
even of the good lord's anger

205
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:44,100
and must endure his indifference.

206
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:47,820
We are dead men.

207
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:49,822
Left to suffer,

208
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:52,492
knowing that he no longer hears our cries,

209
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:55,778
because in this place...

210
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,530
He is absent.

211
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,334
How bad is it?

212
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:02,785
Since we've been becalmed,

213
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,370
our rate of drift has suggested

214
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,122
we had a good chance of making landfall

215
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:07,674
on one of these islands

216
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,094
in approximately a week to ten days' time.

217
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,212
Based on our readings today
and yesterday, however,

218
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,932
I would say that that
estimate is far too optimistic.

219
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,233
We'll have to cut the men's rations again.

220
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:26,276
I agree.

221
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:30,311
If anything, stores are
dwindling faster than we thought.

222
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:33,066
Fresh water is just about gone.

223
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,117
Food stores have been empty

224
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,785
for about three days,

225
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,237
and the haul from the eel
nets isn't keeping pace.

226
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,456
Mr. silver and I will inform the crew.

227
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,226
It can't be uniform,

228
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:45,824
the decreases in rations.

229
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:48,081
At a certain point,

230
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,415
if we're all weakened beyond the point

231
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,917
at which any of us can hoist our sails,

232
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,385
we're all dead anyway.

233
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,637
Then what would you suggest?

234
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,140
I would suggest that we draw up two lists.

235
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,641
One with the names of the men

236
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,677
critical to sailing this
ship once the wind returns,

237
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,981
and second, the men who aren't.

238
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:08,685
You think we should feed some
of the men more than others?

239
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:12,286
No, I think we should feed
some of the men and not others.

240
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,409
The survival of the greatest
number of men on this crew

241
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:18,077
rests entirely on our ability

242
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,079
to maneuver this ship to land.

243
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,198
Any food that is diverted away from men

244
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,784
necessary to that end
only increases our chance

245
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,620
that every one of us on this ship dies.

246
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:29,372
You can't divide the men like that.

247
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:30,757
Most of the men on that list

248
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:31,924
will survive in a weakened state.

249
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,760
Most of them.

250
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:38,131
Well, why not just take the second list

251
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,460
and push 'em over the side right now?

252
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:42,301
Wouldn't that save us all a lot of trouble?

253
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,803
Hey, hey, hey.

254
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,638
Those men out there hear
the two of you arguing,

255
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,640
and they might just lose
whatever faith they've got left

256
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:49,482
that we have any idea
what we're doing in here.

257
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,447
I will challenge you

258
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:57,263
with the men and resist this plan.

259
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:03,990
If you challenge me in any way
while we exist in this state,

260
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,541
I will be forced to make an issue

261
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:07,710
of how we entered into
it in the first place.

262
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,829
How your failure to inform them

263
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:11,381
of the danger inherent

264
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,716
in investigating Hallendale's ship

265
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,752
led us into the trap that began all this.

266
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,724
It is his responsibility to challenge you.

267
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,273
Not now.

268
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:22,642
Not in this state.

269
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,647
I'm asserting that as captain

270
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,982
in a life-threatening situation,

271
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:34,018
it is my right to have complete
control over ship and men

272
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,689
for the sake of their collective welfare

273
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:39,242
until such time as we emerge
from this situation.

274
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:42,862
In the meantime, I will compile two lists.

275
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,868
Those men entitled to full
food and water rations,

276
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,038
and those only on limited
water for the time being.

277
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,183
We'll need to keep a close eye on him.

278
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,552
As dehydration sets in,

279
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,740
we will all be subject to its effects.

280
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:12,891
Loss of reason, anger...

281
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:16,446
Eventually hallucinations.

282
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:19,336
He isn't losin' his mind.

283
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,960
He's been concerned
about this for some time.

284
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,288
About you.

285
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,233
He thinks I have lost my reason.

286
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,576
That the events of Charlestown

287
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:32,462
and everything since is driving me mad.

288
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,629
Is it?

289
00:15:57,605 --> 00:16:00,490
You want us to combine our forces

290
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,909
and engage a fleet of a half a dozen ships,

291
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:04,494
and you want us to do it

292
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,113
with six guns supporting us from the fort

293
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:09,916
so that we can frighten
the British Navy into retreat?

294
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,752
We understand
there are eight ships, not six.

295
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:14,036
Yes, to the rest of it.

296
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,121
Jesus Christ, Jack.

297
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:16,788
Uh, if I may.

298
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,626
It stands to reason that if we
threaten to defend this place,

299
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:23,129
then we need to have a plan
to follow through.

300
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:24,380
If the bluff is called, then we...

301
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,299
there is no bluff here.

302
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,466
If we can discourage them from engaging,

303
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:28,601
so much the better.

304
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:31,103
If not, we fight to protect the island.

305
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,388
With who in command of the fleet?

306
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,557
No one's seen Flint in weeks.

307
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,392
When he hears news
of the invasion, he'll return.

308
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:37,944
But if he doesn't?

309
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,947
No man has his skill
in leading a fleet in battle.

310
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,597
Not even you.

311
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:45,472
What the fuck's the matter with you people?

312
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,237
We haven't done enough for you?

313
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,405
You turn your back on us now?

314
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:51,073
You can see his point, though.

315
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,159
If no Flint, the strategy involved

316
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,360
in coordinating this fleet will be...

317
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:57,380
That's enough. You, sit down.

318
00:16:57,415 --> 00:17:00,166
And the rest of you, please listen closely.

319
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:02,168
I never approved of Eleanor Guthrie's

320
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,003
harsh mothering of this place.

321
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,505
I believe my record
on that issue is in good order.

322
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,057
That said, if you're going
to behave like children,

323
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,308
then I will be your daddy.

324
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,477
When this meeting breaks,

325
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,930
I will address the street, your crews,

326
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:16,566
and I will persuade them

327
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,318
that a defense of this place
isn't just desirable,

328
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:22,688
it is critical to their ability
to call themselves men.

329
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,107
I'll have them in such a state

330
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,993
that any captain in this room

331
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:30,446
who speaks in opposition to this plan...

332
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,999
opposition borne from what?

333
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,388
A fear of losing.

334
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,569
Will not long call himself captain.

335
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,757
Hmm?

336
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,342
I'm committed to this.

337
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:44,677
Charles is committed to this.

338
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,379
Captain Flint will be returning soon.

339
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:49,048
He is most committed to this.

340
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,216
And if that weren't enough,

341
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:51,634
you will recall that Anne and I

342
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:54,103
have put thousands
of pieces into your pockets

343
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,554
in contemplation of the day

344
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,440
when your cooperation would be called upon

345
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,141
to defend this place.

346
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:02,528
That day is today, and
you will answer the call.

347
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:05,314
Flint is dead.

348
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:13,739
News was in St. Kitts.
Went down in a storm,

349
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,993
pursued by the leading
edge of this invasion force,

350
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:20,876
the pirate hunter by the
name of Benjamin Hornigold.

351
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:25,551
Before anyone commits to anything,

352
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:28,337
just know that you'll be
doing it without Flint.

353
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:35,094
But I may be able to offer an alternative.

354
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,273
Let us agree that if you walk downstairs

355
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:48,824
without something to
bring those men together,

356
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,162
to unify them, there will
be no defense of this harbor,

357
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,281
that you will fall the moment challenged.

358
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,750
And you can offer me that something?

359
00:18:57,785 --> 00:19:00,870
Yes. Me.

360
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,457
I'm prepared to step into
Captain Flint's shoes,

361
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,676
unify those men, prosecute
a defense of the harbor,

362
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:09,545
and repel the Navy from here definitively

363
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:13,597
if once I've done it,

364
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:16,602
you agree to join me in
sailing away from here for good.

365
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:28,397
You would enter into a fight

366
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:31,567
to defend something you
have so little regard for

367
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:33,507
just to have my partnership?

368
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,039
Yes.

369
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,291
I know you're incapable
of running from this fight,

370
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:42,249
going back on your word
to your friend downstairs,

371
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:44,365
so I won't ask you to.

372
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:49,468
But I will offer you the
best of all possible worlds...

373
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,996
beating the English,
keeping your word to Rackham,

374
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,094
and being free of the burden
of this place all at once.

375
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,512
Burden of this place?

376
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:02,014
You not heard a word I've said?

377
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,266
I am committed to it.

378
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:06,235
Your commitment is your burden.

379
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,105
Consider what this place
has forced you to become

380
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,574
since you made that commitment...

381
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,693
a slaveholder, a man
forced to beg his peers

382
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,112
to join him in battle.

383
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,580
There's not a man in that parlor

384
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:18,831
who would lift a finger in your defense,

385
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,499
yet you would die in theirs.

386
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,752
Jack would. Jack has.

387
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,286
Of course he has.

388
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:25,755
How else does a man like that

389
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,289
survive in a place like this

390
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,417
except cleave himself
to one stronger than he?

391
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:32,815
And for this, he offers you what?

392
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:37,681
Loyalty? That is how a dog survives.

393
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:39,435
Not a man.

394
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,303
I do not seek your partnership

395
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:43,773
because I am too weak to defend myself.

396
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,248
I don't seek it to protect my things

397
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:46,276
or to increase profit.

398
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,050
Then why do you?

399
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,275
You've been gone eight years,

400
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:53,980
and suddenly my partnership
is this valuable to you?

401
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,272
Why?

402
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,140
Eight years.

403
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,891
Nine wives.

404
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:06,662
No sons.

405
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:13,252
There is an instinct to leave behind

406
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:15,625
something made in one's own image.

407
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:19,725
Nature has denied me the
ability, it would seem,

408
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,143
but not the need.

409
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,927
But whereas the natural way

410
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:29,122
requires no consent from the other party,

411
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,104
in this case, I'm not so lucky.

412
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:38,398
So there it is.

413
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:40,779
Yes or no?

414
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:04,854
He's leaving.

415
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:07,473
Once this is done,
assuming we're still alive,

416
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,441
he's leaving with Teach.

417
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,870
I heard.

418
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:15,921
It bothers me...

419
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,235
I don't know why, but it bothers me.

420
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:20,736
Why do you think that is?

421
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:22,872
'Cause you give a shit
what he thinks of you?

422
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,039
You always have.

423
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:27,209
- You think?
- Yeah.

424
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,295
You ain't alone.

425
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,579
Plenty of men in this place

426
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:33,666
have done plenty of stupid shit

427
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:36,719
just to hear Charles Vane
call him a proper pirate.

428
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:39,255
Though might be you're the only one

429
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:41,090
who actually made a career of it.

430
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,384
Heard you refused your
water ration yesterday.

431
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,265
I wish you wouldn't do that.

432
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,975
Flint's only granting me the ration

433
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:37,027
as a fuck you to prove
that power's in his hands.

434
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:39,448
I won't give him the satisfaction.

435
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:40,733
It doesn't matter.

436
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,620
And I don't like how it looks,

437
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:47,323
me having a full ration
while they waste away,

438
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,907
and then asking them to trust me.

439
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,058
It doesn't matter.

440
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,080
Those men, all of them,

441
00:23:55,082 --> 00:23:57,228
even the ones left out,

442
00:23:58,252 --> 00:23:59,918
they trust you to be able
to stand up to the captain

443
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,887
when the time comes.

444
00:24:01,922 --> 00:24:03,806
And you can't do that
if he's got his strength

445
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:05,020
and you don't.

446
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,731
That has been the problem all along.

447
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:12,598
That's the thing gates never understood

448
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,483
and a thing you never understood.

449
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:19,571
You cannot decide to follow a man like that

450
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,781
and then pick and choose when you deny him.

451
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:26,161
It's your job to deny him.

452
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,852
If I challenge him directly,

453
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:38,123
he and I will be at such
extreme odds in front of the men,

454
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:39,258
it will be the end of this crew

455
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:40,602
one way or another,

456
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:44,129
and I can't allow that to happen.

457
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:46,598
So, once again,

458
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:50,302
he is able to conjure
the reality he desires

459
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:52,221
just as it was in Charlestown.

460
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,806
And just as it was in that storm.

461
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:57,808
There is no denying a man
with that kind of power.

462
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:00,479
What are you talking about?

463
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,281
You're saying Flint conjured that storm?

464
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:05,150
He conjured us into it.

465
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:07,202
And who's more powerful?

466
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,454
The one who made the storm

467
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:09,488
or the one who convinced us

468
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,614
into battle to defeat it?

469
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:15,077
A man of his capacities,

470
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:19,129
his state of mind becomes reality.

471
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,084
We are subject to it.

472
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:23,919
And right now his state of mind's so dark,

473
00:25:23,971 --> 00:25:25,884
it threatens to kill us all.

474
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,811
Take your rations.

475
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,644
I mean it.

476
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,693
I'm clearheaded, Billy.

477
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:40,162
I see him.

478
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:45,074
During that feud with Vane over the fort,

479
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,859
I sat in his cabin and I watched him

480
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:49,528
turn himself inside out over the idea

481
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,113
that anyone in Nassau would see him

482
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:52,762
as the villain in that story.

483
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:56,499
Well, now he's the greatest
villain in the new world.

484
00:25:57,538 --> 00:25:59,378
We all see it. We all
follow him because of it.

485
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:01,984
I think it's torture for him,

486
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,844
and I think the only way
he can imagine it stopping

487
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,597
is when there are no more
of us left to witness it.

488
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,436
Fucking thieves!

489
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:21,352
You both stand accused
of a crime most serious.

490
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:26,382
Theft of food held in
reserve in a time such as this

491
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:30,665
is a betrayal of trust
of the most profound sort.

492
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:34,072
The penalty for such a betrayal is,

493
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,910
by necessity, extreme.

494
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:40,245
You were both charged with keeping watch

495
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:43,248
over what little remains
of our food stores.

496
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,069
A full day's rations are now gone,

497
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,060
yet each of you accuses
the other of the crime.

498
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:56,927
As your quartermaster, as your friend,

499
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,518
I'm going to implore you one last time,

500
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,342
whichever of you is the
guilty man, to confess.

501
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:09,274
Repair in some small part

502
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:10,909
the trust you've breached
with your brothers.

503
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:14,112
I swear, I wouldn't have done such a thing.

504
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,949
I don't have it in me.

505
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:18,784
Please don't fucking hang me.

506
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,702
Shut the fuck up.

507
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:22,454
You all seen me these
last few weeks out here.

508
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:25,624
Never blubbered, never bitched.

509
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:27,960
I weathered this shit
as well as any of you.

510
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:29,928
So don't fucking tell me I'd do something

511
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:31,547
this fucking cowardly

512
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,382
and then blame it on a
sniveling shit like this one.

513
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,050
One of us is a liar, all right,

514
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:37,269
but it sure as fuck isn't me.

515
00:27:56,123 --> 00:27:57,539
Oh, shit.

516
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,662
Captain.

517
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,192
Thank you. Oh, dear god,
thank you for seeing the truth.

518
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:15,757
Wait. No.

519
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:20,229
No. Wait.

520
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:23,765
You need to say something.

521
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:32,265
Don't do this. I ain't done nothing.
I swear it.

522
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:49,124
Forgive me.

523
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,529
Does everyone understand?

524
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:17,452
Does anyone have anything to say?

525
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:35,253
If you're not strong enough
to do what needs to be done,

526
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:38,590
then I'll do it for you.

527
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:21,887
What the hell is that?

528
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:23,305
It is a balance.

529
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,673
Yeah, what's it here for?

530
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:29,610
There is no point in delaying any longer.

531
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:34,399
There will be no more
merchants, no more exchanges.

532
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:36,154
Sooner or later,
that fleet will be upon us.

533
00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:40,272
Sooner or later,
it will be time for you and I

534
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:42,274
to go our separate ways.

535
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,442
It would be wise if we are prepared

536
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,661
and our shares are split evenly.

537
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:50,282
Tell me why.

538
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:54,744
We've been through this.

539
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:56,538
No, you told me why

540
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,623
I wouldn't stay here with you.

541
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,689
But you ain't said why
you won't come with me.

542
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:05,859
If we lose, if we have to leave this place,

543
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:08,633
why are you so set on staying?

544
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:10,485
Why the fuck could you
want to live in a world

545
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,138
that says that fat pig on the
beach is a man to be respected?

546
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:17,025
A world that wants its sons to become that?

547
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,200
When I was very small,

548
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:28,320
I would sneak out of the slave
quarters at night to the main house.

549
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:33,158
I would stand outside
the window to the parlor.

550
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:39,285
I would stand amongst the heat and the bugs

551
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:41,750
and the filth on my toes to see inside.

552
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:48,620
Inside that house was
a little girl my age...

553
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,594
With the most beautiful skin.

554
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:57,649
I watched her dance while
her father played music

555
00:33:57,684 --> 00:33:59,128
and her mother sewed.

556
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:06,024
I watched her read and eat

557
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:09,245
and sing and sleep,

558
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:15,081
kept safe and warm and clean by her father.

559
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:20,956
My father.

560
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:27,045
The things it took to
make that room possible,

561
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:29,047
they were awful things.

562
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:32,077
But inside that room was peace.

563
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:35,937
That is what home is to me.

564
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:41,614
When you and I began,
you did not choose me.

565
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:44,562
Something that lives inside you

566
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:46,496
beyond choice made it so,

567
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:48,566
so I know you understand

568
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:50,902
how this lives beyond choice for me, too.

569
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:57,373
Our roads are going to diverge.

570
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:03,999
Let it be now so we may
not live in fear of it.

571
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,596
Yeah.

572
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:58,436
You should stay...

573
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,472
To see it be divided evenly.

574
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:05,310
I trust you.

575
00:36:31,252 --> 00:36:32,368
Maybe you were right.

576
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:38,009
Maybe he is dangerous to us in this state.

577
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:42,564
And maybe there is nothing we can do

578
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,599
to stop him right now
without shattering the crew.

579
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,770
But if he kills another
innocent man in this crew

580
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:54,826
to make a point, or tries to...

581
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,171
I'm going to do something about it.

582
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,288
So I suggest you get this
situation under control

583
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,413
before that happens.

584
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:16,381
I told you, eh? I just don't see a way.

585
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,105
Gates figured it out.

586
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:21,523
The Barlow woman figured it out.

587
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,217
He listened to them,

588
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:26,107
altered his plans when they told him to.

589
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,679
It's possible.

590
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:33,007
The difference is he saw them as his equal.

591
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:38,951
He respected them that way,
so he was willing to listen.

592
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:44,790
You need to find a way to do the same.

593
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:51,299
Both of those people ended up dead.

594
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:03,093
When I lost Thomas,

595
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,324
I raged.

596
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:10,218
I was distraught.

597
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,412
I wept.

598
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,269
But with you...

599
00:39:17,003 --> 00:39:19,420
I'm ruined over you.

600
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,787
When I first met you, you were so...

601
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:34,639
Unformed.

602
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:40,366
And then I spoke and bade
you cast aside your shame,

603
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:44,779
and Captain Flint was
born into the world...

604
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,998
the part of you that always existed

605
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:50,367
yet never were you willing to
allow into the light of day.

606
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:54,240
I was mistress to you when you needed love.

607
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:59,625
I was wife to you when
you needed understanding.

608
00:40:01,264 --> 00:40:03,514
But first and before all...

609
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:07,157
I was mother.

610
00:40:17,113 --> 00:40:19,376
I have known you like no other.

611
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,368
So I love you like no other.

612
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,491
I will guide you through it,

613
00:40:29,826 --> 00:40:33,067
but at its end is where you must leave me.

614
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:37,877
At its end is where you will
find the peace that eludes you,

615
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:41,598
and at its end lies the
answer you refuse to see.

616
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:08,279
It's hard to tell how big she is.

617
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:10,114
There isn't much above the surface.

618
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:12,283
But it hasn't moved since we spotted it,

619
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:13,785
so it's almost certainly dead.

620
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:16,287
Whale carcass.

621
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:19,207
That's a week's worth of water.

622
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,459
Food times three.

623
00:41:23,296 --> 00:41:26,848
They float when they rot. After they rot.

624
00:41:31,638 --> 00:41:34,472
Make ready the launch.

625
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:36,140
It's a waste of energy.

626
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:38,476
Make ready the launch.

627
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:48,569
I'm going to see it myself.

628
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:51,406
There's too much at stake.

629
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,157
You gonna row out there on your own?

630
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,746
I'm one of two men who've
been on full rations

631
00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:01,966
for the last few days.

632
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:06,001
You're the other. Let's go.

633
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,835
I stole it from you.

634
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:39,420
What?

635
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,674
The Urca gold.

636
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:51,716
I told you we were deceived

637
00:42:51,718 --> 00:42:54,118
about its having been
recovered by the Spanish.

638
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,996
Wasn't entirely true.

639
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,557
You were deceived.

640
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,394
I built the lie...

641
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:08,154
Enlisted the scouts,

642
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,379
arranged the sale of the
information to Captain Rackham.

643
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:15,540
I conceived it all.

644
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:19,293
You know, I've had my fill

645
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,711
of hearing you go on about this crew

646
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:23,414
being too weak to keep up with you.

647
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:26,551
Some of them may be weaker than you,

648
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:28,396
some of them may be less smart,

649
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:32,148
but don't you for a second
believe I fit that description.

650
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,614
Whatever happens out
here, one thing is certain.

651
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:40,097
You will account for me.

652
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:45,593
Why are you telling me all this?

653
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:48,550
So you can decide...

654
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:51,366
To fight me,

655
00:43:52,445 --> 00:43:54,278
maybe kill me, and figure out a way

656
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,567
of hauling yourself back to that ship alone

657
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:58,783
or acknowledge the fact

658
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:00,670
that you and I would be
a hell of a lot better off

659
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,620
as partners than as rivals.

660
00:44:04,257 --> 00:44:06,958
You conceived all of this?

661
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,761
The cover story, the end game on the jetty?

662
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:13,097
Waiting for the scouts to return?

663
00:44:15,301 --> 00:44:16,851
Yes.

664
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:33,901
What did you do with your share?

665
00:44:37,323 --> 00:44:38,990
I gave up my claim to it.

666
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:44,829
Why did you do that?

667
00:44:48,835 --> 00:44:50,384
Because I saw no way to hold it

668
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,503
and remain a part of this crew.

669
00:44:55,308 --> 00:44:57,411
And without these men,

670
00:44:59,145 --> 00:45:01,479
all I am is an invalid.

671
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,544
Oh, god.

672
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:36,881
Oh, it stinks.

673
00:45:36,883 --> 00:45:39,350
Oh...

674
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:43,054
Oh, it's long gone.

675
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:44,722
Oh, we can't eat that.

676
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:49,904
Let's head back to the ship.

677
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,984
We can eat those.

678
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:40,448
Fuck!

679
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,349
Again?

680
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:57,975
What happened out there?

681
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:03,311
Progress.

682
00:50:06,152 --> 00:50:08,402
How can you know for sure?

683
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:13,991
Because I'm still alive, I suppose.

684
00:50:58,337 --> 00:51:00,704
Sails on the horizon!

685
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,801
It would appear, sir,

686
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:15,719
that your information
is less than complete.

687
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:21,558
Perhaps you should ask this one who it is.

688
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:25,145
There are masts at the mouth of the harbor.

689
00:51:25,197 --> 00:51:27,064
Appear to be in a firing line.

690
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:32,985
Do you recognize any of their banners?

691
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,083
What did you see?

692
00:51:46,085 --> 00:51:47,251
North... northeast.

693
00:51:47,303 --> 00:51:48,585
Just cresting the horizon.

694
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:49,753
How many ships?

695
00:51:49,755 --> 00:51:52,640
Looks to be eight, maybe nine.

696
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:54,925
Three hours, give or
take, till they're near.

697
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:56,260
Let's get the men aboard ship.

698
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,949
That formation ensures

699
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,701
that any approach in the harbor mouth

700
00:52:20,753 --> 00:52:23,454
will result in significant
damage to our fleet.

701
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:25,422
Apparently, Captain Teach

702
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,708
is every bit the tactician they say he is.

703
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,044
What are you suggesting?

704
00:52:30,096 --> 00:52:32,296
That we withdraw?

705
00:52:32,298 --> 00:52:34,715
I'm suggesting that I see no obvious means

706
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:36,550
by which we can reclaim Nassau town,

707
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:37,801
not without risking the loss

708
00:52:37,803 --> 00:52:41,605
of significant assets
of his majesty's Navy.

709
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:45,809
Then I'll go to the beach myself.

710
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:47,728
Beg pardon?

711
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,530
I will have a launch
ferry me to the sand alone,

712
00:52:49,565 --> 00:52:50,864
and I will make the pardon address.

713
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,297
- It is out of the question.
- Why?

714
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:55,285
Because my charge is to ensure
this endeavor's safety and yours

715
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,988
and I'll not answer to
a plan that reckless.

716
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,156
It shouldn't be you.

717
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:06,663
If you send someone else
to read the pardon address,

718
00:53:06,665 --> 00:53:09,883
someone known to the men on
that beach, it might work.

719
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,251
Someone have her removed.
I don't have time for this.

720
00:53:11,303 --> 00:53:13,220
Hold... hold on. What are you suggesting?

721
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:14,805
That you go to read the address?

722
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,090
No, it can't be me either.

723
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:18,425
I have too many enemies
between here and that beach.

724
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:20,427
Then who?

725
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:21,562
Him.

726
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:25,065
Half the men in that bay

727
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,651
have sailed under him
at one point or another.

728
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:29,486
They respect him

729
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:31,238
as much if not more than any other man

730
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:32,773
that's sailed under the black.

731
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:35,993
They'd Grant him passage
under a flag of truce,

732
00:53:36,028 --> 00:53:37,745
and they'd listen to what he had to say.

733
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:43,167
And you don't give a shit
if he dies in the process.

734
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,283
Why are we letting him pass?

735
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,318
Shoot on that man and
under the flag of truce

736
00:54:20,706 --> 00:54:22,906
and the half of Nassau that remember him

737
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:24,074
as the foundation of this place

738
00:54:24,126 --> 00:54:26,215
will rebel against the other half.

739
00:54:27,496 --> 00:54:30,414
Whatever's about to happen,
there's no stopping it now.

740
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,113
In the name of the governor
of New Providence Island,

741
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:04,948
the Honorable Woodes Rogers,

742
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,669
"the time has come to bring a
wayward child back into the fold,"

743
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:12,623
an island that rejected its parent empire,

744
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:14,541
but that must long for the embrace

745
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:17,211
of civilization once again.

746
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:20,297
Be it proclaimed that
any man on this island

747
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:22,466
who will accept that embrace,

748
00:55:22,518 --> 00:55:25,135
who will renounce violence
against the crown,

749
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:27,330
who will renounce piracy,

750
00:55:28,307 --> 00:55:30,474
that man will be offered

751
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:34,194
a full, complete, and unqualified pardon.

752
00:55:34,987 --> 00:55:37,261
No matter what you've done,

753
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,624
no matter how irredeemable
you believe it to be,

754
00:55:40,886 --> 00:55:43,320
your king and your governor

755
00:55:43,322 --> 00:55:45,372
wish to offer you a clean slate,

756
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,575
a new beginning here in Nassau.

757
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:51,530
All of you, that is, but one.

758
00:55:52,464 --> 00:55:56,464
One so committed to disorder and chaos

759
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:59,720
that his presence is incompatible

760
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:01,873
with civilized society.

761
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,926
Be it known there shall be a bounty

762
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,848
of 10,000 pounds sterling

763
00:56:07,346 --> 00:56:09,513
for the capture of the pirate Charles Vane,

764
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:12,015
"dead or alive."

765
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:45,166
What the fuck's he doing?

766
00:56:51,023 --> 00:56:52,522
Captain.

767
