You're concerned about me.

167
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,347
The alliance between your crew

168
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,248
and my people is critical.

169
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,347
Without it, we are all nowhere.

170
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,247
If your mind is not clear

171
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,247
and the alliance cannot hold,

172
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:29,047
all will be lost.

173
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:33,081
So, yes, I am concerned.

174
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,281
Hmm. Yes.

175
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:40,080
Last night was not an experience

176
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,614
I hope to repeat anytime soon.

177
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:46,614
But my mind is clear.

178
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,513
[knock on door]

179
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:52,380
Mr. Silver, I need to speak with you.

180
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:53,581
Alone, please.

181
00:11:56,881 --> 00:12:00,114
[crew chattering]

182
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,247
What the fuck happened?

183
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:28,513
In that... camp,

184
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,313
they killed Parker.

185
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,146
They killed Louis.

186
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:36,613
They killed Graves
and they killed Simon.

187
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:39,914
They chose them from among
us to be tortured and killed.

188
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:43,680
And that one was the
one doing the choosing.

189
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,880
[moaning and gasping]

190
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,580
[gasping]

191
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:07,213
[gasping continues]

192
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,847
[gasping]

193
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:16,780
[panting]

194
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:27,013
What is it you're hiding from?

195
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,313
Excuse me?

196
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:33,880
I only meant I know
you must be very busy,

197
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:37,313
what with your responsibilities.

198
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,713
But to still be here
so late in the morning,

199
00:13:39,714 --> 00:13:42,014
I assume there's
something you're avoiding.

200
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:47,880
For what it's worth,

201
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:51,646
I believe the madam chose
me for you because I am new.

202
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:55,880
I have no notions about
what you once were.

203
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:58,380
No motive to gossip.

204
00:13:58,381 --> 00:13:59,780
Georgia.

205
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:03,080
Yes?

206
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,580
I know the games.

207
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,281
I have played them all.

208
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,146
If you ever wish to be in my bed again,

209
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:16,146
that is the last one you
will ever play with me.

210
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,846
[knock on door]

211
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:19,080
Yes?

212
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,046
WOMAN: Miss Guthrie's downstairs.

213
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:22,547
She's asking for you.

214
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:29,213
[chatter and laughter]

215
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,047
[parrot squawks]

216
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:35,213
[parrot squawks]

217
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,547
Yes?

218
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,913
What happened?

219
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,879
The cache is in our possession.

220
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,079
It's on its way as we speak

221
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,179
to the transport and then to Havana.

222
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,179
With Jack.

223
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,312
Yes.

224
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:56,379
The governor is seeing to it personally

225
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,679
that the transport sets
sail with its cargo.

226
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,679
Within a matter of hours,

227
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,079
the Spanish issue will be closed

228
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,913
and we will be free to move forward.

229
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,280
And Anne?

230
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,646
The men said she was angered.

231
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:13,446
When she realized
that Jack wasn't there,

232
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,179
she let the cache go.

233
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,713
Anne was unharmed.

234
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:23,446
- Unharmed?
- Yes.

235
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,646
I advised the governor to
send eight men to the exchange

236
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,179
to deter any attempt
on her part to fight...

237
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,446
When did she realize?

238
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:31,812
I'm sorry?

239
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,812
That Jack was not there.

240
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,946
When did Anne realize
that she had been lied to?

241
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,279
Was it before or after
they secured the cache?

242
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,480
Before, I think. Why?

243
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:46,379
When you told me this was to be,

244
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,879
I was upset by the thought
of having lied to Anne.

245
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,512
I was devastated by the certainty

246
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:54,346
it would unavoidably lead to her death.

247
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:58,212
For the moment she realized
that Jack was not there,

248
00:15:58,213 --> 00:15:59,746
that she had been crossed

249
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:02,012
and that she would likely
never see him again,

250
00:16:02,013 --> 00:16:04,212
she would attempt to kill anyone

251
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,012
she deemed responsible.

252
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:08,646
Eight?

253
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:11,012
You could have sent a thousand men.

254
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,012
It would not have deterred her.

255
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,112
And now you are saying to me

256
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,112
that she knew she had been crossed

257
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:19,479
and chose to walk away to save herself?

258
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:24,013
[horse whinnies]

259
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:40,679
Do you speak Spanish?

260
00:16:42,313 --> 00:16:43,312
Beg pardon?

261
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:45,613
rHabla español?

262
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,679
A little.

263
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,579
- You?
- Hardly at all.

264
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,879
If I'm in Havana in a day or two,

265
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,579
I assume I'll be hearing a lot of it...

266
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,379
shouted by bitter old women in a crowd,

267
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,579
growled by angry officials.

268
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,179
It seems a rotten thing
to wish upon anyone,

269
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,879
an unflattering eulogy
in an unfamiliar town.

270
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,912
It'll be quick,

271
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:15,112
to whatever extent it
sets your mind at ease.

272
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,112
The gold is theirs.

273
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:19,112
The gems are theirs.

274
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,812
They don't need anything
from you anymore,

275
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,212
and as such they're likely to want

276
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:26,213
to put the entire affair
behind them and move on.

277
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,579
I'm sorry. "If"?

278
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,679
Beg pardon?

279
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,812
You said, "If I'm in Havana."

280
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:37,805
In your mind this
outcome is still in doubt.

281
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:44,279
Well, the odds are
certainly in its favor,

282
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:48,178
but it is by no means a certainty.

283
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,911
How so exactly?

284
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,211
You said Anne is alive, did you not?

285
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:55,011
I would argue as long as that is true,

286
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:57,511
there's a chance, however remote,

287
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,011
that she will frustrate your efforts

288
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,811
to send me off to my death.

289
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,411
Out of curiosity,

290
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,678
how would she go about doing that?

291
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,279
Well, I have no idea.

292
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,911
Everything and anything
in her power, I imagine,

293
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:10,144
up to and including walking out

294
00:18:10,145 --> 00:18:11,844
in the middle of the road ahead of us

295
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:13,344
to be run over by your horses

296
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:16,845
in the hope of slowing
you down for even a moment.

297
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,844
It is fascinating to me

298
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,644
how stubbornly you people expect

299
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,311
the unlikeliest of outcomes
because you prefer them.

300
00:18:28,312 --> 00:18:30,644
You expect the world to
become what you want it to be

301
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:34,111
despite all available evidence
and experience to the contrary.

302
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:39,044
This was not the way I'd hoped
this affair would play out.

303
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:40,211
But I can assure you

304
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:41,211
it is most certainly
not going to play out

305
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:43,711
the way you hope it will either,

306
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:46,411
because even to stand
in the road ahead of us,

307
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:48,544
she would have to know
which road to stand in.

308
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,111
You held the route secret.

309
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:53,711
I held a number of
potential routes secret

310
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:56,711
before settling upon this one

311
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:59,111
so that even if the
secrets were compromised,

312
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,611
anyone intending to hit us
would be more than likely

313
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:05,178
in possession of the wrong route.

314
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:17,378
CHAMBERLAIN: Let me be
sure I have this right.

315
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:19,878
So the plan to recover
the stolen cache of gems...

316
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:22,378
your plan to recover
the stolen cache of gems

317
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:25,111
has worked in exactly the
manner you suggested it would.

318
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:28,378
Only now you believe
this is a bad thing...

319
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:30,378
evidence of a plan to rescue Mr. Rackham

320
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,478
and once again recover
the cache of gems.

321
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:34,944
That is what you're suggesting, yes?

322
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:37,178
I can understand why this
may be hard to believe,

323
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,878
but I know Anne Bonny well enough

324
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,978
to know that it is a certainty
something here is amiss.

325
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:43,878
That her behavior should coincide

326
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,478
with the presence of
Captain Flint on the island

327
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,978
only hours before

328
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,711
most certainly points
to a plot being underway.

329
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:50,478
I beg your pardon.

330
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,878
So now Captain Flint is

what had been taken away.

but I was determined...

claiming to hold debts
belonging to my father.

Debts accumulated as my father drank.

Debts he claimed that
now belonged to me.

500
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:34,308
Debts I could not possibly
have hoped to repay.

501
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:37,608
Debts over which this man
would have seen me imprisoned...

502
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,074

debts would have been discharged

world handed everything.

for it will only attack those
unfamiliar to this place.

661
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:55,335
You and I know Flint and can fight him.

662
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:57,235
You and I, though outmatched,

663
00:40:57,236 --> 00:40:59,835
at least know what Spain
is and can make best efforts

664
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:02,335
to confront whatever
they may send our way.

665
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:04,235
But there is nothing more dangerous

666
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:06,101
than the unfamiliar enemy.

667
00:41:06,102 --> 00:41:08,535
If the governor's caravan was attacked,

668
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:10,468
it means someone knew where to find it.

669
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:14,868
It means our secrets are no longer ours.

670
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,202
It means there is a spy among us.

Fetch Dr. Marcus.

00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,994
MAN: Please see to it!

676
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:18,861
Where's Vane?

677
00:42:20,094 --> 00:42:23,227
The militia arrived
before he could get away.

678
00:42:23,228 --> 00:42:25,061
We had no choice but to run.

679
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:28,594
Fuck.

680
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:33,593
Take him and the cache back to
the ship and get out of here.

681
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,593
BILLY: What? You can't stay behind.

682
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,260
I'll go find Vane.

683
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:40,727
Once he's free, we'll find
our own way back to the camp.

684
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:41,727
Captain...

685
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,027
Charles Vane swinging over Nassau

686
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,127
is a statement we
cannot afford to be made.

687
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:47,061
You cannot stay.

688
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:50,993
We're about to get the war you wanted

689
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:53,793
and perhaps a credible path towards
something resembling victory,

690
00:42:53,794 --> 00:42:56,660
but the war is going
to follow that chest

691
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,927
and you're the only one
of us who can marshal it.

692
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:02,760
RACKHAM: He's right.

693
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:05,660
He's right.

694
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:07,993
If Charles knew we
were even contemplating

695
00:43:07,994 --> 00:43:11,660
jeopardizing the grander
effort to save him,

696
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:13,394
he'd kill us all.

697
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,893
Give me two men.

698
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:19,794
I'll go back and address the situation.

699
00:43:22,594 --> 00:43:23,593
How?

By stirring resentment,

701
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:26,293
finding sympathetic ears,

702
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:28,793
reminding them that Charles
Vane was once the best of them...

703
00:43:28,794 --> 00:43:29,993
still is the best of them.

704
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:32,893
My parents were agitators.

705
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:34,293
If we are to win this war,

706
00:43:34,294 --> 00:43:35,527
that may be exactly what we need.

707
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:38,793
By the time I'm through,

708
00:43:38,794 --> 00:43:40,093
the governor won't be able to hang Vane

709
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:42,027
out of fear of losing the street.

[sighs]

713
00:44:13,394 --> 00:44:14,994
Charles is here.

714
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:21,860
It's a very small consolation
given what we lost today.

715
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,393
But you had the foresight
to put Captain Hornigold

716
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:28,393
in pursuit of Flint's ship.

717
00:44:28,394 --> 00:44:30,893
It's the only reason we
have any prayer at all

718
00:44:30,894 --> 00:44:34,494
of recovering the cache
and avoiding disaster.

719
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:39,527
If Hornigold is unable
to capture Flint's ship,

720
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:43,123
Flint is able to dictate

721
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,959
the next chapter of this story.

722
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,459
The choices we will likely then face

723
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,959
will be of the most awful kind...

724
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,759
the ones that promise only bad
outcomes in every direction.

725
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,393
Eleanor, look at me.

726
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:12,959
The challenges I see
ahead for both you and I

727
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,460
are of the gravest sort.

728
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:18,392
I need to know that I can rely upon you

729
00:45:18,393 --> 00:45:19,792
to help me navigate through it.

730
00:45:19,793 --> 00:45:22,459
Of course you can.

731
00:45:24,593 --> 00:45:27,092
You understand...

732
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:29,592
my concern about calling you a partner,

733
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,559
from the moment I first walked
into your cell in London,

734
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,092
was whether you'd be able to
resist Nassau's temptation,

735
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:39,292
the gravity of your personal history

736
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:41,459
urging you to resume petty rivalries

737
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,359
and repeat the costliest
of your mistakes,

738
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,459
preventing you from ever
truly moving into the future

739
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,659
I wanted to build here

740
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,359
rather than gravitating
back into your past.

741
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,459
And now...

742
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,159
in the moment I need you the most,

743
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,459
need the best of you the most,

744
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,159
I fear the temptation you are feeling

745
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,026
is about to be at its strongest.

I am not wrong.

750
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:30,093
That man sitting in a cell in my fort

751
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:32,626
is the embodiment of
that temptation for you.

752
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:33,859
It is self-evident.

753
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,226
Now, I am asking whether you're able

754
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:42,759
to see past the petty and the personal

755
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,192
to remain focused on what is right now

756
00:46:44,193 --> 00:46:48,292
of vital importance to
both of our futures...

757
00:46:48,293 --> 00:46:49,992
to our very survival.

758
00:46:49,993 --> 00:46:53,492
If you have any regard for me,

759
00:46:53,493 --> 00:46:56,792
any respect at all,

760
00:46:56,793 --> 00:46:59,292
then I'm asking you to tell me the truth

761
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,693
about what you're capable of right now.

762
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,192
The moment you walked
into my cell in London,

763
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:12,060
do you want to know
what I first thought?

764
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,059
I wasn't thinking about
the charges against me.

765
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,059
I wasn't thinking about
a reprieve from the noose.

766
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,559
I wasn't thinking about piracy,

767
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,059
nor pardons, nor Nassau.

768
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,893
In that moment, I was consumed by
one thought and one thought only...

769
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,759
... the idea that this
may be my opportunity

770
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,426
to gain some measure of revenge

771
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:40,059
against my father's murderer,

772
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,893
that I might play a role in
the execution of Charles Vane.

773
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:48,292
I know you now. I trust you now.

774

I'm devoted to you now.
