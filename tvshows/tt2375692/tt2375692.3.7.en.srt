If we cannot retrieve that cache,

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,527
then the dread fleet in Havana sets sail

16
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,662
to raze all of Nassau to the ground.

17
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,998
I will deny him the cache,
and in doing so,

18
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:55,102
I will ensure that whatever Nassau is

Spanish intelligence.

32
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,948
They learned of the cache.

33
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:31,252
They demanded the governor
recover it and return it.

34
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:36,090
And they made clear failure to do so
will result in the end of Nassau.

35
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,793
The governor is a reasonable man.

36
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:42,764
He is a compassionate man,
but he needs that cache.

They are hurting him, Anne.

- What?
- You were right.

42
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:56,444
He is defiant.

43
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,381
So they are trying to coerce
him into cooperating,

44
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,083
into asking you to cooperate.

45
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:09,289
He refuses, so I am
asking on his behalf.

46
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,994

It will tear her to pieces.

But sooner than later,
she will acquiesce.

Jack Rackham? Who is Jack Rackham?

63
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:18,857
At the moment, he's the most
wanted man in the West Indies,

64
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:21,760
owing to a cache of rare
jewels in his possession,

65
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:24,094
proceeds from a massive Spanish prize

66
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,397
and, as luck would have it,

67
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:31,068
our only hope of victory against
Rogers's regime in Nassau.

68
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:33,871
You left here to secure a fleet of ships

69
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:38,543
so that we might harass Nassau's
trade and bleed away her strength.

70
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,577
<i>You told me that without those ships,</i>

71
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:44,281
you could see no other way to
achieve victory in this fight.

72
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:47,818
Now you have returned
with nothing but him

73
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:50,120
and a plan to make up
the difference with money?

74
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,057
Not money, bait.

75
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:55,959
I came upon a trove of information

76
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:57,927
belonging to Spanish intelligence.

77
00:05:57,962 --> 00:06:00,930
In it was mention of this cache of gems,

78
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:03,900
<i>cache I know to be in Jack's possession.</i>

79
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:06,403
Spain is furious
over its very existence.

80
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:08,405
<i>They see it as an affront.</i>

81
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,140
They are so furious, in fact,

82
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:15,277
they are willing to burn Nassau to
the ground just to prove the point.

83
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:17,479
<i>The only way Rogers can prevent this</i>

84
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:20,249
is to find the cache and return it.

85
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:23,452
Which means if we were to find it first,

86
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,322
we could dictate what happens next.

87
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:28,591
And what are you
proposing that might be?

88
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:32,428
Rogers's strength resides
in his naval consort...

89
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:36,332
ships and soldiers on loan
to him from the Crown.

90
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,300
They're well-trained and well-armed.

91
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:41,270
Against them on even terms, we
wouldn't have a prayer of success,

92
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:45,641
but if we can get them
to meet us on uneven terms,

93
00:06:45,676 --> 00:06:48,276
terms that dramatically
favor our efforts,

94
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,377
things might be different.

95
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:52,881
Use the cache to lure him
to committing his forces

96
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,283
onto an undesirable battlefield.

97
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,485
Committing all of his forces there.

98
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,487
<i>With the stakes this high,</i>
<i>he'll have no choice</i>

99
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:02,790
<i>but to put everything</i>
<i>at his disposal in play.</i>

100
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:06,394
We compel him into a
single, decisive fight,

101
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,895
<i>one in which we have a massive advantage</i>

102
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,565
and one in which, with a little luck,

103
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,967
we might deal him a catastrophic defeat,

104
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,969
break the back of his military strength,

105
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:18,406
and open up Nassau
for a direct invasion.

106
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:22,877
What battlefield is this that will
allow us to defeat that kind of force?

107
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,212
Here.

108
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:26,881
Here?

109
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,116
Your plan is to lure
the British navy here?

110
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:36,222
I'd like to speak
with the captain alone.

111
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,491
Now.

112
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,502
How many men?

113
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:52,238
We imagine Rogers has 500
regulars at his disposal.

114
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:55,275
What about militia?
Conscripts? The total force?

115
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,011
Twice that, thereabouts.

116
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,512
And what plans for their ships?

117
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,214
<i>Without means to engage them,</i>

118
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:05,084
their heavy guns would repel any
attempt to defend the beach.

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,719
Surely there can be no victory

120
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,288
if you cannot harass their landing.

121
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:10,189
<i>How do you propose to account for that?</i>

122
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,424
I don't know yet.

123
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,559
And let's say somehow you're able

124
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,061
to eliminate some of their
numbers on the beach.

125
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,230
We have neither the
manpower nor the ammunition

126
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,966
to fight the kind of
battle you're suggesting,

127
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,369
even with the terrain in our favor.

128
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:24,903
How do you propose to gain these things

129
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,371
on the schedule you're suggesting?

130
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,040
I don't know yet.

131
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,275
I'm not going out there
with "I don't know yet."

132
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,547
These people know their
lives are about to change.

133
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,749
They know they'll need
to fight to survive,

134
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,417
but I will not go before them

135
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,387
and argue to have that fight all at once

136
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,890
and risk losing everything all at once

137
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,926
unless I am certain
that fight can be won.

138
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,565
Am I certain that we will prevail?

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,933
No.

140
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,502
But the odds will never
be better than they are

141
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:01,939
right now, in this moment.

142
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,108
Of that, I am most certain.

[sighs]

144
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,922
To find Jack Rackham, you'll
need to go to Nassau, yes?

145
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,825
We assume that he's long gone by now,

146
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,628
but Nassau is where we will
pick up his trail, yes.

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,833
There are other things you will
need to secure while you're there.

148
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,436
My husband supplied us
with weapons and shot

149
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:36,506
to arm ourselves
and to defend this camp.

150
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,309
He also maintained a stockpile on Nassau

151
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,312
in preparation for a day such as this.

152
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:45,815
As far as we know, it is still
there, guarded by his agents.

153
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,718
Tell me where to find them
and I'll retrieve it.

154
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,319
They will not trust you

155
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:52,988
<i>nor even acknowledge</i>
<i>the existence of this place</i>

156
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,491
<i>to anyone other than my husband,</i>

157
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,660
<i>and he's too weak to leave our care.</i>

158
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:02,665
<i>So we will have to send</i>
<i>the next best thing.</i>

159
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,703
<i>She will help you get what you need,</i>

<i>but one more thing.</i>

161
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:14,076
<i>I know your way is to invest a captain</i>

<i>as much as yours.</i>

164
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:24,986
<i>My word and your word will

<i>And when I'm not present, that word

Sir.

168

Touch of the grippe is all, sir.

169
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:51,145
I'll be all right.

170
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:55,182
You're the third man to say as
much to me in the last four hours.

171
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,051
I'll see you relieved.

172
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:00,454
Please report to Dr. Marcus immediately.

173
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,889
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:04,391
<i>[door opens]</i>

175
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:20,273
It's almost over,

176
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,710
this unfortunate arrangement
between you and I.

177
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:31,551
- What?
- <i>Contact was made with Anne Bonny.</i>

178
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,653
The situation was explained to her

179
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:35,454
that the sooner she returns the cache,

180
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,390
the better it would be for you.

181
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:43,396
She was disturbed but, we
believe, ultimately persuaded.

182
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:44,763
Disturbed?

183
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,404
You told her I was being tortured.

184
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:54,973
If the street would hear
you were being mistreated,

185
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,742
if they were to see you
emerge from this place

186
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:59,245
damaged or not at all,
I'd risk losing them.

187
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,612
I know this.

188
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:03,015
<i>I imagine you were counting on it,</i>

189
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,084
the notion that all you had
left me were bad options

190
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,820
guaranteed, ultimately,
to serve your ends.

191
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:12,791
This way, no one hears it but her.

192
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,860
I get what I need,

193
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:16,694
the island survives,

194
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:19,464
and no one is harmed.

195
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:23,368
I face a number of dangers
ahead in stabilizing Nassau.

196
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:25,703
The one I will resist
to the limits of my ability

197
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:29,807
is to allow myself
to be cast as its villain.

198
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:32,677
<i>When the cache is delivered, you'll
both be free to do as you please.</i>

199
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:40,651
Do you have a wife?

200
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,890
Beg pardon?

201
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:48,125
Do you have a wife?

202
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:51,962
I do.

203
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:55,132
How do you imagine she would feel

204
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,700
if she were told you were suffering

205
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,869
some awful, degrading abuse

206
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,505
and that the only way she could end it

207
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,907
would be to betray your trust?

208
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:06,710
How do you think she would
feel if she betrayed you,

209
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,412
knowing she likely lost
that trust forever,

210
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,448
and then learned the whole
thing was based on a ruse?

211
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,853
And no one was harmed.

212
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,858
We're all villains in Nassau.

213
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:25,161
Don't think because you're
new you're any different.

214
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:30,566
[knocks]

<i>- [bell dings]</i>

<i>- [goats bleating]</i>

217

[quietly] The exchange
is to take place tomorrow.

218
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:50,953
Captain Rackham will be set
free in exchange for the cache.

219
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:54,857
Once that happens and the
cache is shipped to Havana,

220
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:56,791
the entirety of the Urca
de Lima's prize gold

221
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,560
will be in Spain's possession.

222
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,363
Captain Rackham...

223
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:02,730
he's in the governor's custody.

224
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:07,269
You never mentioned this.

225
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,271
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's all right.

226
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:13,941
[sighs]

227
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,046
I've given thought to our
previous conversation.

228
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,916
I'm not without sympathy
for your situation.

229
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,118
I have no desire
to see harm come to you.

230
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,588
If the governor returns
all of the Urca gold,

231
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:31,024
my superiors have promised not to set
loose the fleet upon this place.

232
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:37,064
And my superiors are proud men,

233
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,599
and they're angry.

234
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,936
Were I you...

235
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:47,240
I might encourage Governor Rogers

236
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:51,411
not just to send the gold,
but to send something more.

237
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:55,448
<i>An offering to demonstrate</i>
<i>good faith and friendship.</i>

238
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:59,619
<i>Not just the stolen gold,</i>
<i>but the man responsible</i>

239
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:01,254
<i>for stealing it in the first place.</i>

<i>[door opens]</i>

<i>And tell him that we asked for

242
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,660
<i>No one will ever know.</i>

243
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:11,764
<i>But Nassau's safety</i>
<i>and yours is best served</i>

244
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,066
<i>if, when the gold</i>
<i>is surrendered in Havana...</i>

245
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,670
<i>it's accompanied by Mr. Rackham.</i>

246
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,276
I swore to Anne that these
terms would be honored.

247
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:26,846
Surrender the cache and Jack goes free.

248
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:29,381
- I gave her my word.
<i>- ELEANOR: I know.</i>

249
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,451
<i>They changed the rules</i>
<i>so very late in the game.</i>

250
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:34,819
We could resist, but we have
nothing to bargain with.

251
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:37,389
Were there anything I could do,

252
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,557
were there anything
the governor could do,

253
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,459
I assure you, it would be done.

254
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:42,294
<i>But either Jack is
surrendered with the gold</i>

255
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,028
<i>or Nassau burns.</i>

256
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,064
<i>- [knock on door]</i>
- Yes?

257
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:49,601
[door opens] A few things
that require your approval.

258
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:54,672
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, what is it?

259
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:59,978
My apologies. Nothing that can't wait.

260
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,880
I beg your pardon.

261
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:30,573
When the governor's men
arrive at the transaction

262
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:33,210
without Jack and Anne sees this,

263
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,412
she will resist.

264
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:38,115
I would humbly ask that the
governor's men refrain...

265
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,084
They have been forbidden
from firing first.

266
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,888
They've been forbidden
from provoking her.

267
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:48,391
They've been forbidden from using
any violence against her at all

268
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:51,761
unless in dire and
unavoidable self-defense.

269
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:54,263
Why?

270
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:56,933
Because I demanded it.

271
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,737
Out of respect for your partnership.

272
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,048
I do not know which is worse...

273
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,819
that she perish fighting for Jack...

274
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:18,487
[wine pouring]

275
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:21,757
...or that she survive without him.

276
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,626
If it is even truly surviving,

277
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:27,363
losing half of herself this way.

Eleanor Guthrie, is she

Yeah.

The fuck's your problem?

283
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:03,964
I thought I heard them
say something about...

284
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,134
Something about what?

285
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,606
Nothing. Never mind.

[chatter and music continue]

<i>FLINT: We should be sighting the
island in just a few hours' time.</i>

288
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,556
We'll approach just west of Nassau
Town under cover of darkness.

289
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:34,060
Two longboats will ferry
the landing party to shore.

290
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:38,364
You'll slip into town to pick up the
trail to find Rackham and Bonny.

291
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,467
The sooner we know where to go
to find the cache, the better.

292
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:44,537
You'll join our party
towards the tavern,

293
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:47,173
make contact with
your father's agent there

294
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,575
and arrange for the
acquisition of guns and shot.

295
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,876
She'll not enter the tavern.

296
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:52,678
She won't enter the tavern.

297
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:54,413
She'll have an escort of your choosing.

298
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:56,916
She'll be back on the water
before anyone knows she's there.

<i>Meanwhile, Billy and I will enter
the tavern and begin recruiting.</i>

Still don't understand how you
think that's going to help us.

301
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:06,625
- Recruiting more men?
- Recruiting<i> those</i> men.

302
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:10,228
Any man still left on that island

303
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:11,896
made a choice to desert the black.

304
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:14,899
Even if they do join us,

305
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:18,270
what makes you think they won't
just desert us all over again

306
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:20,272
the moment the fight begins?

307
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:23,208
It's about more than the men we win.

308
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:26,177
It's the message we send
to those we don't.

309
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:29,213
If they won't take up arms
and fight alongside us,

310
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:32,917
I want them terrified of the
thought of doing it against us.

311
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:35,019
BILLY: Well, then, it shouldn't be you.

312

If you want them to fear you,

it shouldn't be you
delivering the message.

You're returning from the dead.

But no ghost story I've ever heard of

00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,629
begins with the ghost
introducing himself.

317
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:49,400
I mean, you walk in there and
insist on your own fearsomeness

318
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:52,536
sort of threatens
to do more damage than good.

319
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,572
The message I understand, but I think
someone else needs to deliver it.

320
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,608
Someone?

321
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,909
Who?

322
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,946
Him.

323
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:06,149
I can think of no one more effective
at capturing men's minds.

324
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:08,986
And, maybe just as importantly,

325
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,822
given the need to invest the moment
with as much impact as possible...

326
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:15,225
Who'll be able to take their eyes
off the one-legged creature?

327
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,096

330
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,674
Do it.

331
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,076
And make ready the launches.

332
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:36,646
I'll lead the shore party
as soon as we arrive.

That fucking chair.

336

To gain it, it demands you win partners,

337
00:20:56,567 --> 00:21:00,369
call them friends,

338
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:03,205
make them promises.

339
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,208
To keep it, it demands
you break them all.

340
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:08,843
One day when all is settled here,

341
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,479
we should burn that fucking chair.

342
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:19,688
My God, how I hated you.

343
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,725
There was a time in which
I could not conceive

344
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,827
of how I could ever forgive you.

345
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,832
And in this moment, I am you.

346
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,870
I think my footing in this moment

347
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:39,106
is far more precarious than yours.

348
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:43,410
That is not what I hear.

349
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:45,879
What does that mean?

350
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:49,717
Once pirates visited the inn

351
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:52,820
and I heard what pirates said.

352
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,554
Now that soldiers visit the inn...

353
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,557
You hear what soldiers say.

354
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:59,058
[chuckles softly]

355
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,960
And what is it they're saying about me?

356
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,100
They say you are inseparable.

357
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:10,069
<i>They say he relies upon you</i>
<i>more than any other.</i>

358

They sometimes say more.

359

<i>Did you know his men speak this way?</i>

360
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:22,715
No.

<i>The governor's chair is no doubt</i>

<i>as unforgiving as mine.</i>

00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:41,900
<i>It will demand the same

If you don't say something,
I'm going to have to.

379
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,398
Eight of my men have fallen ill.

380
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,871
One of your warehouses has been
converted into a sick bay.

381
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:44,077
If we had been honest with
ourselves, we'd have seen it coming.

382
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:48,381
Where chapter one is
"Conquest of a Foreign Land,"

383
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:52,084
chapter two is always "Suffer the Illness
to Which the Natives Are Immune."

384
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:57,256
Those eight men won't be the last.

385
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,260
Many of my people will die.

386
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,565
Every man and woman that
followed me onto this island

387
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,300
will be susceptible to it.

388
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:14,773
Yet as I lay here, the three words

389
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,576
I keep hearing in my mind
over and over again are...

390
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:21,112
"except for her."

391
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,991
You're one of them.

392

Whether I choose
to acknowledge it or not,

393
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,198
nature is going to keep
reminding me of this fact

394
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:43,467
in the coming days
with every death we suffer.

395
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:47,238
You think I'm a danger to you?

396
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,277
I know I can feel my
connection to London diminish

397
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,213
with every day I'm here.

398
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,316
I can only assume your connection to
this place is growing at a similar rate

399
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,452
and that sooner or later

400
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:05,456
the instincts that led you into the
prison cell I found you in will return.

[sighs]

402

You asked me once if it was
true what my enemies say of me.

403
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,675
That I would turn on anyone,
no matter how close,

404
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,676
if it served my ambition.

405
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,116
It was that way once.

406
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,822
But I do not wish
to be that way ever again.

407
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,960
I'm resolved to shed it.

408
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,065
I'm resolved to have
my word mean something.

And I give you my word...

410

my commitment to you is inviolable.

411
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,554
Not because my freedom
depends on your success here.

412
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,690
Not because I seek to regain
that which was taken from me

413
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:18,759
nor vengeance upon those who took it.

Max made mention of an exchange

between the governor's
men and Anne Bonny.

421
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,644
I think Anne believes she's handing over

her share of the Urca prize money
in exchange for Jack's release.

- By the time Anne realizes they lied to her,

00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:00,499
all of you.

477
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:05,070
Every last rotten fuck on this island

478
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,072
has crossed a man far less forgiving

479
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:09,341
than old George will ever be.

480
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,379
I come as his right hand.

481
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:20,485
I come on a mission of mercy,

482
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,156
to show you a path to his forgiveness.

483
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:31,061
I come on behalf of Captain Flint.

484
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,233
Captain Flint is dead.

485
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:41,339
Not anymore, he's not.

486
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:44,008
- [whispering]
<i>- [distant dog barking]</i>

487
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:47,577
Go now, quickly.

488
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:52,249
The stockpile is nearby.

489
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:55,052
My people will transport it
directly to your ship.

490
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:56,586
Thank you.

491
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,361
Is everything all right?

492
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:07,631
This was hers, wasn't it?

493
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,700
Eleanor Guthrie's?

494
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:12,703
It was.

495
00:34:12,738 --> 00:34:15,038
Strange.

496
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:16,373
I have been here before.

497
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:20,576
I have no memory of it, but I
know I have been here before.

498
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:26,316
The last time I saw Eleanor
Guthrie, we were children here.

499
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:27,383
Playmates.

500
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:33,256
Now we are on opposing sides
of this thing ahead of us

501
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,258
which will get so very bloody.

502
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:40,563
What is it all for?

503
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:42,765
What is it that is coming?

504
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:53,842
Every name in this volume
belongs to a man

505
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:57,179
who first pledged his
service to Captain Flint,

506
00:34:57,214 --> 00:35:02,084
to defend Nassau against the Crown.

507
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,652
Every name in this volume
belongs to a man

508
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,923
who turned his back on that pledge.

509
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,125
This volume...

510
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:15,162
now belongs to me.

511
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:20,101
Captain Flint returns
to Nassau tomorrow.

512
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:23,304
Any man who meets us on the sand

513
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,974
will be accepted back into the fold,

514
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,611
<i>his name redacted from this book,</i>

515
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:35,649
<i>forgiven for his sins</i>
<i>against his brothers.</i>

516
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,686
But when we set sail,

517
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:43,223
I will keep the list of names remaining.

518
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:47,027
Now, those men will not be forgotten.

519
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:50,196
And I assure you,

520
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,633
those men will hear from us again.

521
00:35:56,104 --> 00:35:58,004
<i>DUFRESNE: Is that it?</i>

522
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,879
Surely there must be more.

523
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:13,686
Surely, if Captain Flint
were truly alive,

524
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:17,557
he can do better than
to send a handful of men

525
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,593
led by half a man

526
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:24,497
in the dead of night to deliver
a threat as weak as this.

527
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:27,500
A threat that amounts to what?

528
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:31,904
"Fear my name."

529
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:38,410
Contented men have short memories

530
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,246
and they have little
reason to fear the dark.

531
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,584
Captain Flint's name
is already half forgotten.

532
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:47,419
As for you...

533
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:53,525
I know enough of you
to know that even whole,

534
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,561
you were unworthy of half of
the attention we paid you.

535
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:05,203
And now, as a goddamn invalid,

536
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:06,871
you expect that to change?

So John smashed him in his head

Miranda drove me to.

I perceived its effects on you.

What I assumed was sorrow, loneliness.

584
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,926
And worst of all terror at
the thing you were becoming.

585

There is an element of this
journey into the dark that...

the message they left behind was clear.

606
00:42:08,398 --> 00:42:11,165
They claim Flint will
be returning tomorrow

607

east of the bay to take on recruits.

608

Well, if Flint is alive,

609
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:18,872
if he arrives at that beach,

610

I can't have him finding 200
men waiting there for him.

I can't have him finding 10 men there.

The image of any men leaving
this place to join him

613
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,182
would unsettle the street.

What does that suggest?

That I, too, am so weak
as to fear a ghost?

No, I prefer there be
no one there to meet him

Instead of coaxing information

00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:34,445
I need for this place to be

00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:53,027
Because had we held it,

800
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:56,230
right now we'd be in a standoff
with a superior force,

801
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,332
time working against us,

802
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,234
and no way to secure Jack's release.

803
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:04,638
This way, the governor
has everything he needs

804
00:56:04,673 --> 00:56:07,674
and no reason to suspect
anything is amiss,

805
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:09,876
leaving him to proceed with his plan.

806
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:13,013
A plan you think that we can frustrate?

807
00:56:13,048 --> 00:56:16,517
Jack and the cache are to be
moved aboard a secret caravan

808
00:56:16,552 --> 00:56:21,187
to a ship waiting somewhere
off the southern coast.

809
00:56:21,223 --> 00:56:23,490
If we can intercept that caravan,

810
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:26,727
we can secure both
the money to start our war

811
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:28,695
and the partner to help us fight it.

812
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,600
Either we get Jack and the cache

813
00:56:33,635 --> 00:56:35,401
or we get nothing.
