<i>HUDSON: About six months ago,</i>

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,236
<i>I was approached by the
intelligence department</i>

4
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,372
<i>of the Casa de Contratación.</i>

5
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:19,075
They offered me a
significant amount of money.

6
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:20,459
<i>I said yes.</i>

7
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,662
The department's spies
had learned of an attempt

8
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:25,164
to walk away with their money
without them knowing of it.

9
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:28,384
<i>If you do not return the
entirety of the hidden cache,</i>

10
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:30,252
know that Nassau will
likely burn for it.

11
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:32,054
With everything I've
lost in recent days,

12
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,889
I can't afford to lose the name, too.

13
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,591
<i>We walk into the tavern,
we sign our names,</i>

14
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:38,477
<i>and then not only are we square
with the law our money is, too.</i>

15
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:40,980
The wound should be far further
along towards quietening itself.

16
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:42,515
If the decay progresses,

17

21
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:55,244
Maybe bring it all down.

22

23

that you'd never make
the same mistake again,

00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,802
if the cache is not returned whole.

167
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:39,398
Ship's manifest, sir.

168
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,732
The entirety of the gold from the fort

169
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,734
is now stowed and ready
for transport to Havana.

170
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,903
We should be under way within the hour.

171
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:46,571
Put it in my office, please.

172
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:54,379
I just left Miss Hudson.

173
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,584
I had the instinct once or twice,

174
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:02,254
the way she'd been watching me of late.

175
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,139
I dismissed it,

176
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,640
just assumed it related to some concern

177
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:08,760
over my relationship with you
and its becoming inappropriate.

178
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:12,764
What did she say?

179
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:15,767
Did she report that
we're earnestly attempting

180
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,018
to find and return the missing money?

181
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:20,405
It's not about the money
for them, not anymore.

182
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:23,658
When the gold from the Urca
was stolen, it was bad enough.

183
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,577
Now they hear the
gold is being converted

184
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,579
into something more
easily hidden from them,

185
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:30,031
more easily smuggled away.

186
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:33,835
That isn't theft. It's an insult.

187
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:36,872
And insults to empires require answers.

188
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,210
So it's personal, then?

189
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:47,632
A binary question of my trustworthiness.

190
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:51,853
Either I return the full
cache and prove it or I fail,

191
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,606
and in trying to excuse the shortfall,

192
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,057
only aggravate their existing suspicion

193
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,611
that I am part of the pirate
problem, not its solution.

194
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:02,614
And the dread fleet in Havana
sets sail the very next day

195
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,900
to raze all of Nassau to the ground.

196
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:08,904
Then we'll fight them,
defend the island.

197
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:11,206
The odds would be dire, but
we are not without resources.

198
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,574
No, not "we."

199
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:14,576
I mean, someone might fight
them, but it won't be you and I.

200
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:16,495
If the result of my endeavor here

201
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,880
is a Spanish attack
against British forces,

202
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,666
an act that threatens to
drag the empire into a war,

203
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:24,336
I would be recalled to London
and likely debtors' prison

204
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:27,005
and your capital sentence
would be reinstated.

205
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:30,675
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance
at survival is with me guiding it.

206
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:33,678
But if we cannot find Jack
Rackham and Anne Bonny,

207
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,897
if we can't find the
cache in their possession,

208
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:39,484
whatever happens to Nassau,
you and I are likely finished.

it seemed better to have

I thought as an added prize,

I'd at least be able
to see it for myself,

the new governor up to his ears

in the very same bullshit
in which I've been drowning

253
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:57,489
for the past few months.
And what do I find?

254
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:59,324
The streets are swept,

255
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:00,959
industry is in fashion,

256
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:02,794
you're dressed like a Turkish whore,

257
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:04,245
and all because a man arrived,

258
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:07,799
stood on the beach, and said please.

259
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,251
- You're angry.
- I'm confounded.

260
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:12,587
He offers them less in
wages than I offered,

261
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,005
demands more from them in labor,

262
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,724
restricts more from them in license,

263
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,344
and yet despite all of that,

264
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:21,680
he's won them.

265
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,898
How can that be?

266
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,433
I know it may be hard to believe

00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:15,150
- I know you did.
- I don't want help.

281
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:29,881
It'll pass.

282
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,751

What I don't understand

is why you choose to
suffer in the first place.

286

You must have access to
better medicines than that.

287
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,180
We've got access to
better medicines than that.

288
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:46,848
This has nothing to do with medicine.

289
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,316
It has something to do with medicine...

290
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:51,269

293
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:59,611
Not at all.

294
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,112
For some time now, I have been holding

295
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:03,498
my entire world
together with both hands,

296
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:07,168
<i>keeping my men in line,
seeing to their needs,</i>

297
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:11,923
and the only way that
endures is if I look the part.

298
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,342
And I cannot look the part
while being poked and prodded

299
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,177
or while drooling through an opium haze

saying who the fuck knows what.

301
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,716
So I will endure this

302
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:24,719
the way I have been enduring it.

303
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:33,194

I have been prepared for the day

307
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:43,037
I would take my mother's place.

308
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:46,207
To know that from that day forth,

309

You're frustrated. You're angry.

You're tired.

Perhaps no one else knows why.

I believe that not even you know why.

But I know why.

316
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:15,403
The crown is always a burden...

00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,565
What kind of future do
you propose that to be?

328
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:05,286
I intend to gather forces
and move to reclaim Nassau.

329
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:06,905
The conquest is always weakest

330
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:10,241
when the conqueror allows himself
to believe that it is done.

331
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,827
For Nassau, that point is now.

332
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,330
Now, England may hold the island,

333
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:17,248
but it still needs supplies brought in.

334
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,301
It is still dependent upon trade.

335
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:22,637
We will make that impossible for him.

336
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,473
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.

337
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:28,893
We will force him to
bleed capital and support

338
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,395
and the goodwill of
the men surrounding him

339
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,764
until he is weak enough
to challenge directly.

340
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:35,567
Until we can bring the fleet to bear

341
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:37,268
and retake the bay.

342
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:39,771
You know, when I called Nassau home,

343
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:42,323
most of the men on this
beach weren't even men.

344
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,525
<i>I sailed with Ben Hornigold.</i>

345
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:47,445
<i>I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.</i>

346
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:51,282
Feuded with them, stole from them,

347
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,918
questioned their motives,

348
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:57,288
but we all knew what we were.

349
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,707
Then a man arrives
who would explain to us

350
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,260
that what we've been doing
was wrong all those years,

351
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:06,464
what Nassau ought to
be, what he could make it

352
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:10,134
if we would all just follow his lead.

353
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:14,722
And here you are again to do the same.

354
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:18,943
You let it go well before its time.

355
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:22,397
It was past its time.

356
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:26,401
That you cannot see this
only makes it clearer to me

357
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:30,655
that you never even knew
it in the first place.

358
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:34,459
This fleet is all that remains of it,

359
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:37,462
and as long as it's mine,
Nassau shall remain in its past.

360
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:38,830
It isn't yours.

361
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:41,332
It never was.

362
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:45,003
Those ships, their commanders and crews,

363
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:48,923
they were pledged to
my command, not yours.

364
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:51,476
Oaths were taken,

365
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:54,178
and I have come to see them honored.

366
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,682
Do you honestly believe
that I would just step aside

367
00:22:57,734 --> 00:22:58,983
and let you make that claim?

368
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,354
I honestly don't give a shit
what you would or would not do.

369
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:06,741
The decision isn't yours.

370
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:09,077
It's his.

371
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:17,502
I've come to resume our compact,

372
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:20,455
the one we swore upon
our lives to uphold.

373
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:23,091
If you stand up and acknowledge it,

374
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,509
this fleet will follow us.

375
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:25,677
I'm certain of it.

376
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,845
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.

377
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:31,296
But had I been there,

378
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,611
there would be no
question about any of this.

379
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,792
Had I been there, we would have mounted

380
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:38,648
the defense that we had agreed to mount.

381
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,037
Had you been there, you
would have seen their faces,

382
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,194
the ones who laid their arms down

383
00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:44,896
and turned their backs on us.

384
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:47,732
The ones who took our money for months

385
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:50,234
and were happy to try and
deliver my head to our enemies

386
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:51,786
for a little more of it.

387
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:55,206
Nassau is dead.

388
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:57,208
It doesn't deserve anything else from me

389
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:59,377
or the men on this beach.

390
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:01,746
We are finally free from it,

391
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:04,248
and I see no reason to change that.

392
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:13,091
If you wish to leave
this place, I'll allow it,

393
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:20,064
although somehow I don't think
you have any intention of leaving.

394
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:22,767
No, I don't.

395
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:25,153
And I think you know that
I would never allow you

396
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:26,604
to call a vote to settle the matter

397
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:30,274
of who this fleet follows and
risk you depleting my force

398
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:34,612
by luring away some misguided minority.

399
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:37,081
No, I don't imagine you would.

400
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:40,618
So we have one fleet
and two men claiming it.

401
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:47,341
There is only one way I
know of to resolve that.

402
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,347
Pistols, then swords.

403
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:07,145
Captain Rackham.

404
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,479
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

405
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:10,815
<i>Give us the room, please.</i>

406
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:13,151
Drink?

407
00:25:13,203 --> 00:25:15,653
Thank you.

408
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:18,039
I apologize for the
strangeness of this meeting.

409
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:19,991
I know you and I don't know each other.

410
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:21,325
<i>[door closes]</i>

411
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:25,079
I know you... some.

412
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,497
I read your book.

413
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:29,667
Did you?

414
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:31,052
Well, most of it.

415
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:32,670
I confess, I may not quite have

416
00:25:32,722 --> 00:25:33,754
soldiered through to the end.

417
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:36,340
But, you know, I got the gist of it.

418
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,345
If you don't mind my asking,

419
00:25:41,347 --> 00:25:44,148
what did you take to be its gist?

420
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:47,185
Wealthy son of a wealthy
man takes to the sea

421
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:51,355
to prove something to
the parents, presumably.

422
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:55,359
Seeks adventure, finds the
limits of his own capacity.

423
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:57,328
Loses everything in the process

424
00:25:57,363 --> 00:26:01,499
and then stumbles upon a hell
of a story in the process.

425
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:04,836
Please understand, I'm quite
particular about my library,

426
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:07,872
but people seem to have liked it fine,

427
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:10,174
and it seems to have
done wonders for you.

428
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,427
So congratulations on all that.

429
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:19,267
Thank you.

430
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:24,555
All of that notwithstanding...

431
00:26:26,025 --> 00:26:29,727
you and I share an
experience in this place.

432
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:32,563
And as such, I'm hopeful
that you'll understand

433
00:26:32,615 --> 00:26:34,699
why it is I brought you here today

434
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:36,901
and what it is I'm about to ask of you.

435
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:39,871
What's that?

436
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:45,243
I know you removed a significant
amount of gold from the fort.

437
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:47,295
<i>I know it is in your possession,</i>

438
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,793
<i>and I need you to give it up... </i>

439
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:52,376
or we're all dead.

440
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:07,014
- [men muttering]
- <i>[seagulls screeching]</i>

441
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:14,739
You can't win.

442
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:16,324
[grunts]

443
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,659
I hear you spent weeks becalmed,

444
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:20,111
deprived of food and water.

445
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:22,496
At your best, it would
have been a dogfight,

446
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:25,666
but diminished...

447
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:27,668
I'm not that diminished.

448
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:33,341
He's been off the account for years.

449
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:36,510
He'll be more vulnerable than
he remembers himself being.

450
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:38,512
He's not that vulnerable.

451
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,515
And for what?

452
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:43,351
You subject yourself to certain death

453
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:45,469
for an island full of
weaklings and ingrates?

454
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:48,356
Those men will go where they are led.

455
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:52,860
Rogers captured their
minds before you could,

456
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:56,030
but let's not pretend that
they can't be won again.

457
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,532
And let's not pretend that
either of us believes for a moment

458
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:00,534
that I'm doing this for their sakes.

459
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,155
I gave you my word.

460
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:06,123
Shook your hand.

461
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,126
Pledged to defend the island with you.

462
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:12,830
But my pledge to him began a long
time before I ever knew your name.

463
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:15,716
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.

464
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,503
I don't care that you shook my hand.

465
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:21,973
I don't care what you feel you owe him.

466
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:25,926
This is too important to
be clouded by any of that.

467
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:28,679
They took my home.

468
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:32,433
I can't walk away from that.

469
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,069
Can you?

470
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:40,324
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty,

471
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,494
compacts, honor, debts, all of it.

472
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:46,113
The only question that matters is this.

473
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:50,034
Who are you?

474
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:03,381
Spain knows about the exchanges?

475
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:06,967
They do, and they are displeased.

476
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,189
How do you know they know?

477
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:22,817
So what does that look like?

478
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,453
Return it all or it's the
Rosario raid all over again?

479
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:28,072
- <i>[pouring]</i>
- Something like that.

480
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,828
I understand why you did it.

481
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:37,164
I know what it feels
like to lose everything

482
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:40,167
and feel powerless to
do anything about it.

483
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:42,670
The temptation to keep
something to show for it all,

484
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:45,673
I understand it.

485
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:49,226
But it does not change
the reality we face.

486
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:52,313

One man goes into the

instructions written in
his hand to his partner

504

He said she may be wary,

505
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:15,343
asked there be only one

506

Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.

Have him prepare to
depart for the interior.

I'll pass him details momentarily.

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,813
A thought as simple as "run"?

651
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:45,366
A letter that said everything
the governor wished it to say

652
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:46,650
in exactly the way he'd want to say it

653
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:49,319
would not sound like
anything I'd ever say.

654
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:51,488
<i>A thought here or two
between the lines... </i>

655
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,407
<i>I assure you, she understood.</i>

656
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:59,747
So I have begun the duel

657
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:01,965
between myself and our Lord Governor.

658
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:04,051
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

659
00:43:04,086 --> 00:43:05,753
<i>I will deny him the cache.</i>

660
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:09,256
<i>No matter what sort of inducements
he offers or pain he inflicts,</i>

661
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:10,891
I will deny him the cache,

662
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:14,094
and so I will deny him the victory.

663
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:18,148
And in doing so, I will ensure that
whatever Nassau is come Christmas,

664
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:21,769
English will be not it.

665
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:24,271
[silent]

666
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:34,281
Do not do this.

667
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,366
It's done.

668
00:43:48,514 --> 00:43:50,798
<i>RACKHAM: So, one of two
outcomes will result.</i>

669
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,966
Rogers will understand his defeat

670
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:55,102
to be ultimately inevitable
and leave this place,

671
00:43:55,137 --> 00:43:57,137
in which case I'll have it back.

672
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:01,024
Or he'll stubbornly refuse

673
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,194
<i>and eventually Spain will
raze this place to the ground.</i>

674
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,946
<i>The English flag will burn,</i>

675
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:08,782
and a second pirate
republic will be born

676
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:10,033
from the ashes of the first.

677
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:11,985
Only this time, every
man who calls it home

678
00:44:12,037 --> 00:44:14,655
will know it came about because of me.

679
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:22,913
- <i>[crickets chirping]
- [people chattering in native language]</i>

680
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,816
I worry...

681
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:46,520
that we have made a terrible mistake.

682
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:48,906
I see what you see in them...

683
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,941
Silver and Flint.

684
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:54,361
But their relationship is so volatile

685
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:57,531
and we have put our
lives in their hands.

686
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:03,370
Those men rose to their stations

687
00:45:03,422 --> 00:45:06,590
because they are peerless

688
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,593
when it comes to shaping
the world to their will,

689
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:13,714
in creating a narrative and wielding it

690
00:45:13,766 --> 00:45:17,885
to compel men's hearts and minds.

691
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:21,388
<i>But the most compelling story</i>

692
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,057
<i>requires a villain at its center.</i>

693
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:27,778
And if either Captain
Flint or Mr. Silver

694
00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:31,281
sees the other as a villain...

695
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:33,867
or worse...

696
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:36,069
us as that...

697
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:39,239
<i>then all is lost.</i>

698
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,879
They are of great value to us,

699
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:50,584
but they must be managed
by us to avoid that outcome.

700
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:53,420
How?

701
00:45:57,343 --> 00:45:59,426
I wish...

702
00:45:59,428 --> 00:46:03,513
you and I had not been so
separate all those years.

703
00:46:06,185 --> 00:46:08,485
I wish I could have found a way

704
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,356
to be a better father to you.

705
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:18,278
<i>But over time, I was determined</i>

706
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,781
<i>to leave you something behind,</i>

707
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,282
to give you the one thing

708
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:26,420
that no one could ever take away...

709
00:46:27,957 --> 00:46:30,007
and that would make you strong enough

710
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:33,710
to understand their world,

711
00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:36,296
interact with their world...

712
00:46:37,182 --> 00:46:41,602
wage war on their world.

713
00:46:41,637 --> 00:46:44,805
<i>But if their identity
lies in their stories,</i>

714
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:46,056
<i>I wanted you to know them</i>

715
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:49,476
<i>so that when we are ready
to call them enemies,</i>

716
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:52,312
<i>you would be ready for it.</i>

717
00:46:52,314 --> 00:46:55,065
<i>The villain makes the story.</i>

718
00:46:55,117 --> 00:46:56,650
<i>So to manage our current partners,</i>

719
00:46:56,652 --> 00:47:00,237
<i>we must ensure that we
all agree at all times</i>

720
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:03,206
<i>who our common villain is.</i>

721
00:47:06,745 --> 00:47:09,162
<i>MAN: The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.</i>

722
00:47:09,164 --> 00:47:11,498
<i>She's going for a capture of £500.</i>

723
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,134
[chattering]

724
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:16,837
MAN: ... several miles away
on the road out of town.

725
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:19,006
<i>[chatter continues]</i>

726
00:47:21,226 --> 00:47:23,393
<i>[horse neighs, hoofbeats depart]</i>

727
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:25,062
Earlier today,

728
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:28,398
before we knew Rackham
was still on the island,

729
00:47:28,434 --> 00:47:32,519
you seemed confident that we could
locate him and his friend in time.

730
00:47:33,238 --> 00:47:34,354
You said it was possible

731
00:47:34,356 --> 00:47:38,158
because they didn't know
that we were looking for them.

732
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:42,329
Why do I get the feeling,
now that they do know,

733
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:44,665
now that they've made
it their personal crusade

734
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,416
to see this regime fail,

735
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:49,086
that your estimate will
be far less optimistic?

736
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:53,040
The militia will help.

737
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,042
It will keep the pressure on,
and perhaps we'll get lucky.

738
00:47:55,094 --> 00:47:57,544
<i>But if we don't, then you
may have to be prepared... </i>

739
00:47:57,596 --> 00:48:00,180
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.

740
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:07,354
Anne Bonny must be found.

741
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:10,440
The cache must be found.

742
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:12,693
Right now, that is all that matters.

743
00:48:15,197 --> 00:48:17,397
And that said,

744
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:19,316
the goodwill that we have engendered

745
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:23,453
among the people of Nassau
is not without limits.

746
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:27,374
The longer this drags out,
the riskier it becomes,

747
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:30,293
because if I find that money
only to lose the street...

748
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:31,828
You will not.

749
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:37,968
If you have me, then
you have the street.

750
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:40,754
I am all the reassurance they need.

751
00:48:40,756 --> 00:48:45,425
Yes, Jack and Anne were
my partners, my friends.

752
00:48:47,646 --> 00:48:48,812
More.

753
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:50,931
But now they have made themselves

754
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:52,566
something else to me.

755
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,936
I have sacrificed too much
to build something here.

756
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:59,322
I will not let them take it away.

757
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:14,371
[bell ringing]

758
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:40,981
All he ever did was
offer me his friendship.

759
00:49:40,983 --> 00:49:45,485
I cast him aside once,
spent years regretting it.

760
00:49:46,955 --> 00:49:49,623
And now here we are again.

761
00:49:52,377 --> 00:49:54,578
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.

762
00:49:56,832 --> 00:49:58,882
Well, I won't lie to you.

763
00:50:00,169 --> 00:50:01,635
It would have helped having the fleet.

764
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,513
We have assets, we have allies.

765
00:50:13,565 --> 00:50:16,433
The question is what we make of them.

766
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:19,436
I may be able to help in that regard.

767
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:23,940
Something to add to our pool of assets.

768
00:50:25,944 --> 00:50:30,080
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize...

769
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:31,781
a Spanish prize

770
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:35,619
ferrying a significant
trove of intelligence.

771
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:37,787
Most of it was destroyed
by the time we found it,

772
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,375
but among the remains was
one piece of information,

773
00:50:42,427 --> 00:50:44,461
something everyone else
was quick to dismiss

774
00:50:44,513 --> 00:50:47,881
as it held no value
to them in that moment.

775
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,716
Information about what?

776
00:50:49,718 --> 00:50:52,135
Money...

777
00:50:52,187 --> 00:50:54,771
<i>separated from the Urca
gold within the fort</i>

778
00:50:54,806 --> 00:50:57,440
<i>and rendered into a new form... </i>

779
00:50:57,476 --> 00:50:59,392
<i>a cache of gems</i>

780
00:50:59,444 --> 00:51:03,613
<i>for which Spain is holding
the new governor accountable.</i>

781
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:07,067
<i>A cache which, if used creatively,</i>

782
00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:11,705
<i>could be the key to defeating
British forces in Nassau.</i>

783
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,740
<i>The only question is,</i>

784
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:16,476
<i>can we find it before he does?</i>
