1
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:13,873
<i>I'm prepared to prosecute
a defense of the harbor</i>

2
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:16,459
<i>and repel the navy</i>
<i>from here definitively</i>

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,429
if you agree to join me in
sailing away from here for good.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,348
I stole it from you, the Urca gold.

5
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:24,384
<i>Whatever happens out here,</i>
<i>one thing is certain...</i>

6
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,052
you and I would be
a hell of a lot better off

7
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,054
as partners than as rivals.

8
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:29,772
I will have a launch
ferry me to the sand alone,

9
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:30,973
and I will make
the pardon address.

10
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:32,558
It shouldn't be you.
If you send someone

11
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,278
known to the men on
that beach, it might work.

12
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,280
Be it proclaimed that
any man on this island

13
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:39,532
<i>who will renounce piracy</i>
<i>will be offered</i>

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,617
<i>a full and unqualified pardon.</i>

15
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,403
<i>All of you, that is, but one.</i>

16
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:46,239
There shall be a bounty
of £10,000 sterling

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,542
<i>for the capture of Charles Vane,
dead or alive.</i>

18
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:52,211
<i>Since we've been becalmed,
our rate of drift has suggested</i>

19
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:55,321
<i>we had a good chance of making
landfall on one of these islands.</i>

22
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:41,998
Does it hurt?

23
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,967
Less so.

24
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:47,669
You know, fresh water helps.

25
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,927
The men have been asking questions.

26
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,813
Soon we'll need an answer.

27
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:00,149
What's next for us?

28
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,457
I've been thinking about
our engagement with Captain Hornigold.

29
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:09,108
He offered pardons to our entire crew.

30
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,278
<i>He had no way of knowing</i>
<i>how many men we even had,</i>

31
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:15,948
which suggests he had the number
covered by a wide margin.

32
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:17,950
And once someone's given him 100,

33
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,920
what's to say they
haven't given him 200?

34
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:23,205
500? More?

35
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:26,626
Go on.

36
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:29,128
And Billy said something to me.

37
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,349
Said that someone else likely
procured those pardons for Hornigold.

38
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,301
<i>I started wondering.</i>

39
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:38,354
<i>If you're Whitehall</i>
<i>and you have it in your head</i>

40
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:41,390
you want to finally retake
Nassau from the pirates,

41
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:44,644
isn't the opening move in that attack

42
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:47,563
the introduction of a universal pardon?

43
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:50,232
You been putting this
together all this time

44
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,951
and never saying
anything to me about it?

45
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,657
Well, you and I haven't exactly been

46
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:59,492
on the warmest of terms lately.

47
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:02,160
No, I... I suppose not.

48
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:05,748
<i>Well, then it's clear.</i>

49
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:10,836
The men must be prepared
to return to an embattled Nassau.

50
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:14,840
They must know we're about to join
a fight to resist a British incursion.

51
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:18,094
It's likely over already.

52
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,514
The fight. If there was one at all.

53
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:24,766
It's likely it didn't last long.

54
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:52,345
The pardons will be tempting,

55
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:53,929
but our men resisted.

56
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,681
Our men resisted because
you and I told them to.

57
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:01,270
<i>For whatever reason, when you
and I speak with one voice,</i>

58
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:04,306
<i>we seem to be able</i>
<i>to compel them to any end.</i>

59
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:09,228
But Nassau will not be able to
maintain that sort of resolve.

60
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,980
Not without you or I there
to help instill it.

61
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:17,235
How can you be so sure about this?

62
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:17,129
When I assembled my staff of
advisors for this enterprise,

63
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,265
I spared no expense.

64
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,350
Some of the most promising sons

65
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,969
of the most prominent
families in London.

66
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,722
Brilliant minds. Full of ambition.

67
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:29,191
In this moment, I think it fair to say

68
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,443
I wouldn't trade you
for any 10 of them.

69
00:07:33,864 --> 00:07:35,980
You're very kind.

70
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:40,569
No, I'm very accountable.

71
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,789
<i>By daybreak tomorrow, I'm told
more than half of the pirates</i>

72
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,825
will have accepted the King's pardon

73
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:48,627
and we will be ready to move
my flag onto the island.

74
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:51,130
<i>In the 30 days that follow,</i>

75
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:52,998
I will need to accomplish
90 days worth of progress

76
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:55,217
just to keep schedule.

77
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,670
I will need someone
by my side at all times

78
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,672
to aid in seeing it done.

79
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:04,093
A senior counselor
serving without portfolio.

80
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:07,346
At the moment, I believe you
represent the best candidate for it.

81
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:11,767
Because I suggested
sending Hornigold to the beach?

82
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:14,520
Because you're smart

83
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:18,357
without needing anyone
to explain to you how to be.

84
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:21,327
And because you're not afraid
of being thought to be wrong

85
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:24,195
<i>when you know that you're right.</i>

86
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:27,750
Won't the promising sons

87
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:31,419
resent my presence
in such a senior capacity?

88
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:35,174
I'm fairly certain I don't care.

89
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:37,376
<i>Do you?</i>

90
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:39,929
No.

91
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,547
Good.

92
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:43,516
Then you're hired.

93
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,100
Let us begin.

94
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,892
<i>£10,000 they're paying
for Vane's head, Jack.</i>

95
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:55,227
<i>Now, I know you ain't got</i>
<i>no need for the money,</i>

96
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:58,447
<i>but for fuck's sake,</i>
<i>don't be greedy.</i>

97
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:00,699
<i>You and I have known</i>
<i>each other for years.</i>

98
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,568
<i>It's the least</i>
<i>you could do for a friend.</i>

99
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:04,069
Who is he?

100
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,538
<i>Look, sooner or later,</i>

101
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,540
<i>there's gonna be 100 more</i>
<i>men out here, Jack,</i>

102
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,242
<i>and this ain't gonna be</i>
<i>your decision anymore.</i>

103
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,711
Open it.

104
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:30,646
You recognize him?

105
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:32,348
<i>What the fuck, Jack?</i>

106
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:34,733
Paul something or other.

107
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:39,321
<i>- Come on, Jack. Let us in.</i>
- Why just you?

108
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:41,607
<i>Island full of murdering,</i>
<i>thieving fucks</i>

109
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:44,693
and you were the only one
they can't forgive?

110
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:47,279
How does that make any sense?

111
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,365
I don't know.

112
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:52,618
But whatever the reason,
the men behind that door

113
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,337
will soon be joined by hundreds
more seeking the bounty.

114
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:58,623
- In an hour.
- We'll be besieged.

115
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,181
The men have cast their lots.

116
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:08,968
They are resolved that
you convince Captain Vane

117
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:10,936
to depart the fort.

118
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:13,806
They believe that turning him over
might convince the British commander

119
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:17,141
to allow them to keep
the fort and the gold.

120
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:23,365
Safe to say the fight to defend Nassau
is off to an inauspicious beginning.

121
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:25,567
Teach is still on the bay.

122
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:27,786
There may yet be a way
to salvage some defense.

123
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:28,987
It's over.

124
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:35,960
It's over.

125
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:42,918
Now all that remains is that
we escape this place and survive.

126
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,004
All the doors are covered
by men seeking the bounty.

127
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,423
And I have to imagine the tunnel
exits are being watched as well,

128
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:49,475
given Hornigold's
familiarity with them.

129
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:53,144
Then I suggest we
manufacture a new exit.

130
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:59,068
<i>♪</i>

131
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:36,722
You all right?

132
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:38,607
No.

133
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,559
Who are they?

134
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,562
Maroons. Escaped slaves.

135
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:45,698
They must have a camp upriver.

136
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,733
Judging by their numbers,
a large one.

137
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,902
They must have spied
the ship from a distance.

138
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:51,286
From up in the hills there.

139
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,372
We've taken slaves
onto the crew before.

140
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:56,125
Freed a lot of them. Won't that
put us in good stead with them?

141
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:59,244
We've sold more than we've
freed, and they know it.

142
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:01,412
And even if we hadn't,
they'd assume we did.

143
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:07,252
Pick up your man.

144
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:09,253
It's all right.

145
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:16,427
Shit.

146
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:47,792
Ah!

147
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:07,431
Which is your captain?

148
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,602
I am.

149
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:24,616
What is your name?

150
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:26,584
Flint.

151
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:34,959
Which one is your quartermaster?

152
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:43,801
I am.

153
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:57,783
You speak for your men?

154
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:00,619
Yes?

155
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,205
Then I speak with you.

156
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:06,741
How did you find this place?

157
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:11,880
We were defeated in battle.

158
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:14,750
Thrown by a storm onto your shore.

159
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,336
There was no design in it.

160
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:19,671
Who else knew your position?

161
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,808
Who else knows where to find you?

162
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:25,644
No one.

163
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:28,146
We're alone.

164
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:30,432
I give you my word.

165
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:34,486
Were you me, would you wager the lives

166
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,905
of all those in your care

167
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,856
on the word of a pirate?

168
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:47,916
That one.

169
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:21,566
<i>Where are they taking him?</i>

170
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,785
<i>They'll interrogate us one by one,</i>

171
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:27,572
make sure our stories jibe.

172
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:31,043
And then what?

173
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:34,578
<i>For those that survive the
first purge, it'll be hard labor.</i>

174
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:39,167
Though not like any you've ever known.

175
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:42,137
But of the kind they've known.

176
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:43,638
Cruel and violent.

177
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:46,308
Whatever methods they've
seen done to their own kind,

178
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:50,429
they feel resolved to repeat it
upon those they deem complicit.

179
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,596
Who are you?

180
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,768
My name is Ben Gunn.

181
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,438
I'm the last of 13 crewmen
on a slave trader

182
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:02,656
captured whilst careening on the
windward side of the island.

183
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:08,613
I've learned 12 hard
lessons from that woman.

184
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,999
Each with the same end.

185
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,453
That sooner or later,
death awaits any man

186
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:17,506
who lays eyes on this place.

187
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:22,460
And that before it arrives,
she is determined to make you fear it.

188
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:27,632
We need to get out of here.

189
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:30,384
Rapidly.

190
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,950
Where the fuck have you been?

191
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,986
- Just putting some things in order.
- You said you'd put him out, Jack.

192
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:50,988
Quite right. Quick goodbye.
Last cigar. Surely you don't mind.

193
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:54,993
<i>- Did you do it?</i>
- Yeah.

194
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:56,828
Fuse is lit.

195
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:59,631
In a few minutes, that wall
is going to be a lot shorter.

196
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:03,885
Finding it hard to believe there is
near enough material in that magazine

197
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:05,971
to cause the sort of damage
you seem to think it will.

198
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,507
Believe it.

199
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:10,642
I have lost years of my
life these last months

200
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:11,977
trying to rebuild this place.

201
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:13,311
I'll be goddamned if the new governor

202
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:15,397
is going to inherit
the fruits of all that labor.

203
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,015
Not whole, at any rate.

204
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:19,017
Now, when it happens,

205
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:21,653
we should have a clear
path over the rubble.

206
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:24,356
We'll cover your escape to the jetty.

207
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:25,574
It's not going to be easy.

208
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:27,859
The whole island
is seeking that bounty.

209
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,361
My escape?

210
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,255
You plan to stay?

211
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,841
Teach respects you.

212
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:44,793
You'll sail with him without looking
over your shoulder the whole time

213
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:47,095
wondering whether he's gonna back
someone else to take your place.

214
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:50,882
But me, I have no interest in
living as a target of his.

215
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:54,386
Jack, you know there's no way
I'd ever let that happen.

216
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,637
Nor would I be a ward of yours.

217
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,358
I've made something for myself here.

218
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,943
I'll make it again somehow,

219
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:05,396
but I've come too far to go back.

220
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,234
You'll take the pardon, I presume.

221
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,736
Who knows?
I haven't got that far yet.

222
00:20:11,737 --> 00:20:15,207
But wherever we land, Anne
and I will be taken care of.

223
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,957
Taken care of? How?

224
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:22,581
You set aside some of the gold?

225
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:24,748
She did.

226
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:28,503
How much?

227
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,589
Mmm.

228
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,557
Quit fucking around. Put him out.

229
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:33,675
Right, just a moment.

230
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:35,310
Fucking never liked you.

231
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:40,899
What?

232
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,100
I was just gonna say,
"I'll see you soon,"

233
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:45,270
but that would probably
be a lie, wouldn't it?

234
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:47,271
Probably.

235
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,582
Godspeed, Charles.

236
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,084
Fuck you, Jack.

237
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:09,711
Commodore reports
no change in their posture,

238
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:10,962
but he believes
it's only a matter of time

239
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:13,014
until we can expect their surrender.

240
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:16,551
Teach and his men will
never take the pardons.

241
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:19,721
His crew will be filled with fanatics.

242
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:22,473
Even fanatics need to eat.

243
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:26,227
With the beach secured
and no escape possible,

244
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:28,530
they have no means
to replenish supplies.

245
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:31,865
Time is against them.

246
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:35,369
You haven't asked.

247
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,957
About the status of Captain Vane.

248
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:45,664
I understand that there are a great
many elements to this operation,

249
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:48,216
of which Charles is just one.

250
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:51,336
I trust that if there's any
development on that issue

251
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:53,137
you will let me know.

252
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,676
Good.

253
00:21:57,677 --> 00:22:00,678
Then may I ask what it is
that's causing you to make that face?

254
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:06,017
My appointment as your advisor.

255
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,019
I understand that you don't care

256
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,021
what reaction your people
may have to it,

257
00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:13,825
but your people, I'm afraid,
are only half the issue.

258
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:16,194
I have enemies on that island.

259
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:19,781
Enemies who may be far less likely
to accede to your authority,

260
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:22,450
seeing me beside you
offering my counsel.

261
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:25,337
I have no idea what the
future may hold for me here,

262
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:27,871
but I believe your success
is key to it.

263
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:33,128
The last thing I would want
to do is undermine you.

264
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:51,730
Jesus Christ.

265
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:54,282
Mr. Dufresne, pass word to the men.

266
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:56,401
Captain Vane is very likely at large.

267
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:59,403
Remind them of the prize that
awaits his captor, please.

268
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:21,926
<i>She's everything here.</i>

269
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:25,930
<i>Priestess, governess, warlord.</i>

270
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:29,100
They say there's a king,
her husband,

271
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:32,153
<i>that he exists abroad,</i>
<i>salvaging those rare items</i>

272
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:35,322
necessary for life here,
but impossible to produce.

273
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,745
<i>I've seen no evidence of him.</i>

274
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:43,781
<i>Here her word is supreme.</i>

275
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:49,621
She's not to be underestimated.

276
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:51,789
What about the other one?

277
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:58,796
Down there.

278
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,017
<i>Daughter, I believe.</i>

279
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,353
<i>From the deference she's shown,</i>

280
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:08,356
I imagine she's next in line.

281
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:09,890
Why?

282
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,650
If we do nothing, they likely kill us.

283
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:21,369
If we attempt to escape,
they likely kill us

284
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,371
or the forest does it for them.

285
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:28,042
Oughtn't we be searching
for a third option with a better ending?

286
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:30,161
Like what?

287
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:33,715
I think they want us to think
they're all of one mind here.

288
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:37,050
But in a place like this,
how can that be?

289
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:42,090
<i>There is a sympathetic</i>
<i>ear out there.</i>

290
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:44,007
<i>We just need to find it.</i>

291
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,737
<i>♪</i>

292
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:28,363
Pass word to the commodore.

293
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:30,915
Resistance within the fort
has been defeated.

294
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:34,335
The fort wall already breached,
there was little chance to resist.

295
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:35,787
And the gold?

296
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:37,622
What will I say was the
effect of the blast

297
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:39,624
on our efforts to retrieve it?

298
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,459
Jesus, I don't know.

299
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,095
Tell him... tell him
it didn't help matters.

300
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,014
<i>Name, please.</i>

301
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:48,683
<i>William Tennyson.</i>

302
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:50,300
<i>Where were you born?</i>

303
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:55,223
- Please prepare a document for Mr. Scott.
- Of course, sir.

304
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:57,609
Good to see you, friend.

305
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,228
Glad you'll be joining our efforts.

306
00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:02,230
If this is what Nassau is to be,

307
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:06,067
I see no value in resisting
what is clearly inevitable.

308
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:08,653
Hardly a ringing endorsement.

309
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:11,656
I admit, I have my reservations
with the new regime,

310
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:13,958
but I sleep better on
this side of the pardon

311
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,077
than I did on the other.

312
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:20,331
So how can I be of help to you?

313
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:22,834
Funny you should ask.
I've just returned from the fort.

314
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,919
Damage is extensive.

315
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,722
I know you were tasked with
restoring it the first time.

316
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:30,842
- And I would be happy to do so again.
- Don't be too eager.

317
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:33,845
Captain Rackham's slave laborers
are nowhere to be found.

318
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:35,063
They escaped?

319
00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:36,981
Someone must have left
the pen unlocked.

320
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:39,017
They overran a handful of guards.

321
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:42,403
Well, perhaps I can help in finding
them and bringing them back.

322
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:44,439
You'd do that?

323
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,659
I oversaw them for weeks.
They know me.

324
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,910
They might be persuaded to return

325
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:50,611
knowing that they
would be treated fairly,

326
00:27:50,612 --> 00:27:53,531
rather than risk
being caught by, uh...

327
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:55,365
less-understanding redcoats.

328
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:02,457
Can we slip through the east channel
when the tide rises?

329
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,509
They've maneuvered
a frigate around the Hog.

330
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,128
They'd rake any ship that
emerged on the other side.

331
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:09,013
Don't think there's any
way we can challenge

332
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:10,714
that blockade directly, do you?

333
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,851
Not exactly.

334
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:17,388
We're working on something,
though, to even the odds a bit.

335
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,725
But there's something else
that you should know first.

336
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:23,111
What?

337
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:24,779
Is she on deck?

338
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,564
Yes, sir.

339
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,399
There's good reason, it would seem,

340
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,402
that you were the only one to
whom they refused a pardon.

341
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:34,204
The Delicia, quarterdeck.

342
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:40,410
<i>♪</i>

343
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:17,498
It's been hours.

344
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:19,416
Imagine they're through
interrogating us.

345
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,506
Well, they've tortured the same story
out of four different men now.

346
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:29,260
I imagine that'll convince
them of the truth of it.

347
00:29:29,261 --> 00:29:32,463
Ben says this is how
it went with his crew.

348
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:35,016
Killed a handful to show they could

349
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:37,601
and then the chains and hard labor.

350
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:42,807
If they put them to work,
how did they all die?

351
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:44,474
Trying to escape.

352
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:47,644
Escape?

353
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:51,949
How far did they get?

354
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,485
Not far, most of them.

355
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:58,656
Overseer shot all but half a dozen
before they made it to the tree line.

356
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:00,458
Four of those six
that made it into the woods

357
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:01,993
died within a few hours...

358
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:05,129
traps, dead ends, hunted down.

359
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,998
The other one made it

360
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,884
a full two days before
they recaptured him.

361
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:12,386
Him?

362
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:14,304
<i>Couldn't find a way out.</i>

363
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:17,809
But if he made it that long,

364
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,343
maybe he knows enough
to piece together a plan.

365
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:36,777
I hate to be the one to say this,

366
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:40,865
but is it possible we've missed
the point of that story?

367
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:42,949
They all died.

368
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:47,037
So why are we entertaining this?

369
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:53,376
It may be flawed, but it's a plan.

370
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:57,048
Gives him focus.

371
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:00,684
Keeps his mind off the fact that
there might not be a better plan.

372
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:06,389
Why would we want to take
that away from him?

373
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,037
I see no way out of this.

374
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:26,793
No matter what I do,
it leads to the same outcome.

375
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:32,466
And I wonder if it wouldn't be best

376
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:35,252
just to accept that I have
no choice in the matter.

377
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,424
You're curious again.

378
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:42,894
Ready to follow me through a door

379
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:45,596
that is somehow less frightening

380
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:47,847
knowing I await you
on the other side.

381
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,771
I miss you.

382
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:58,992
I miss you, too.

383
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:04,781
When we arrive out there...

384
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:09,503
I am to leave you behind?

385
00:32:09,504 --> 00:32:12,122
Yes.

386
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:18,929
What if I were to stay?

387
00:32:31,143 --> 00:32:33,978
<i>I hear Brussels is nice.</i>

388
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:36,147
<i>Paris, maybe.</i>

389
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:39,400
Though I don't speak French.

390
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:42,536
Whatever the fuck it is
they speak in Brussels.

391
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:44,572
Mm-hmm.

392
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:47,708
Oh, fucking hell, Jack.

393
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:50,661
Is it really as bad as all that?

394
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:54,215
Tomorrow we can be on our way
to anywhere in the world

395
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:56,917
with enough money
to live however we like.

396
00:32:56,918 --> 00:33:00,338
Even where we was when we started.

397
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:02,807
Some people might
even call that success.

398
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:05,091
Fuck those people.

399
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:11,432
We got the world right now.

400
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:14,018
Any part of it we choose.

401
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:17,738
We were so close
to accomplishing something

402
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:20,858
that would have written
our names into history.

403
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:24,661
There's no piece of the world
for sale that can replace that.

404
00:33:27,282 --> 00:33:29,532
It ain't good and it ain't fair.

405
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:32,919
But it is what it is.

406
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:38,792
We need to leave Nassau behind us.

407
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,483
Up.

408
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:21,501
Go, please.

409
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:28,676
Do you know who I am?

410
00:34:28,677 --> 00:34:31,227
You're her daughter.

411
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:37,351
I understand from your men that
you were defeated in battle.

412
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:39,403
Then you were offered
pardons for all your men.

413
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:41,822
- Is that true?
- Yes.

414
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:44,575
But you refused. All of you.

415
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:47,444
To a man you refused
to be pardoned. Why?

416
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:51,998
Why did we refuse the pardons?

417
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:55,785
<i>Every man has his own reasons.</i>

418
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:01,125
Some remember the injustice
of the merchant service

419
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:04,512
and are too angry
to ever to return to it.

420
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:06,046
Some hate England too much

421
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:07,964
to ever call themselves English again.

422
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:13,187
And some, I suppose, feel
Nassau's been theirs for so long,

423
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:14,972
<i>they have no interest</i>
<i>in signing a document</i>

424
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:17,475
<i>that would surrender it to the king.</i>

425
00:35:17,476 --> 00:35:20,361
No.

426
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:22,363
<i>There are 1,000</i>
<i>men and women here.</i>

427
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:25,783
Among them there is no
shortage of anger

428
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:28,068
or hate or fear.

429
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:30,037
Perhaps you have noticed.

430
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:33,874
They have suffered cruelties
you cannot possibly imagine.

431
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,494
Sisters separated from brothers.

432
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:38,162
Husbands from their wives.

433
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:40,998
Mothers from their sons.

434
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:44,051
No one has greater cause
to swear England an enemy

435
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:46,169
and desire vengeance
against her as we do.

436
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:52,476
Yet I believe if we were offered
the same choice as yours faced,

437
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:55,179
a chance to be made free
in the eyes of the law,

438
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,399
it would not have been
so roundly rejected.

439
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,734
I'm asking you
why you think that is.

440
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:08,526
I'm very much aware my men's
lives hang in the balance.

441
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:12,913
So I would like to give you the
answer you're looking for,

442
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:15,198
but I don't think you're
going to want to hear it.

443
00:36:16,835 --> 00:36:18,836
Perhaps you are mistaken
in this moment

444
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:21,288
as to which of the two of us
is in need of protection.

445
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,957
Answer the question.

446
00:36:27,045 --> 00:36:30,381
Your men are filled
with anger towards England,

447
00:36:30,382 --> 00:36:32,766
as are mine,

448
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:36,720
but my captain wanted
England to see that anger

449
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:38,721
and make them fear it.

450
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:43,477
And for whatever reason,

451
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:47,113
your mother would prefer
your men fear England.

452
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:51,150
I see.

453
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:56,740
Take him back, please.

454
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:58,909
You asked the question.
I answered.

455
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,213
Wait a minute. Wait...
wait... wait a minute.

456
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:06,383
I think you see our interests are more
closely aligned than your mother does.

457
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:08,752
I have two dozen men
in a cage out there

458
00:37:08,753 --> 00:37:10,838
of the opinion that
she intends to kill us all

459
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,307
sooner than later.

460
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:17,093
And you're going to do
nothing about it?

461
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,501
You done this before?

462
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:42,086
No, you?

463
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:43,753
No.

464
00:37:46,925 --> 00:37:49,760
I suppose she's due some credit.

465
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:52,129
Dragged off to London
in shackles

466
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,516
and returns
in a governor's service.

467
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:58,768
And convinces him to turn the
whole of the world against you.

468
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:03,807
I don't doubt
your anger towards her,

469
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:05,725
but I have to ask...

470
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:09,530
if, in the course of our maneuver,

471
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:12,866
we are forced to choose
between escape and her death,

472
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:14,484
where are you?

473
00:38:16,154 --> 00:38:18,322
She was on that deck for a reason.

474
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:19,957
So I'd see her.

475
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,625
To provoke me into making a mistake.

476
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:29,466
What matters most
is achieving our goal.

477
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:32,636
To exit this bay
with the fleet intact

478
00:38:32,637 --> 00:38:36,173
and to move on from this place.

479
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:38,058
Charles Vane sees past his anger

480
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,259
to achieve the greater end.

481
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,815
How did that happen?

482
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:47,101
I was taught a lesson once.

483
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:48,652
It's been effective.

484
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,187
Taught by whom?

485
00:38:50,188 --> 00:38:51,522
Her.

486
00:38:51,523 --> 00:38:53,906
It's ready.

487
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,702
They are without option now.

488
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:07,204
Sooner or later they'll
realize their only escape

489
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:09,589
is to surrender
Captain Vane and stand down.

490
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:14,210
Gentlemen.

491
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,285
<i>I should be going.</i>

492
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:41,321
What would they say?

493
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:42,905
Who?

494
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:47,077
Your enemies on the island.

495
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:50,748
<i>You seem concerned about what I'm
gonna hear them say about you.</i>

496
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:53,333
<i>Maybe it would be better</i>
<i>to hear it now</i>

497
00:39:53,334 --> 00:39:55,668
<i>while all else is quiet.</i>

498
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:02,259
They would say I'm untrustworthy.

499
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,428
That I would turn on
anyone at any time,

500
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:06,813
no matter how close
they were to me...

501
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:12,319
no matter who it hurt
or how severely.

502
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,771
That, given my history,

503
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:15,938
only a fool would allow me
to get close to them again.

504
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:20,576
Would they be right?

505
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:34,625
You tamed this place once.

506
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:36,794
Despite what anyone may say of you,

507
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:39,046
and I desire your counsel,

508
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:42,549
despite what anyone
may say of you.

509
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,551
So let us move forward,

510
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:48,355
despite what anyone, whether
from your world or from mine,

511
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:51,275
may say of you.

512
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,311
What is it?

513
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:23,307
<i>She's under a white banner.
Gunports closed.</i>

514
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:26,009
How the hell did she get so close?

515
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,228
She was hidden behind their line.

516
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:29,847
<i>By the time she emerged,</i>
<i>she was fully underway.</i>

517
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:32,516
She's subject to our full broadside.

518
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:35,318
She's either surrendering,
or we have her dead to rights.

519
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:56,206
Slip the anchor cables.

520
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:58,041
Break our line over the
approach of a schooner?

521
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,376
I think you overestimate...

522
00:41:59,377 --> 00:42:02,378
While there is still time,
cut the goddamn cables.

I was right.

541
00:45:24,716 --> 00:45:27,884
There is conflict amongst them.

542
00:45:27,885 --> 00:45:29,336
I don't know how deep it runs,

543
00:45:29,337 --> 00:45:32,638
but it is there to be exploited.

544

The daughter?

545
00:45:36,978 --> 00:45:41,431
This seems to be a significantly
more promising option

546
00:45:41,432 --> 00:45:44,267
than charging into
a trap-laden forest.

547
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:46,986
I'm not sure why I needed
to say that out loud.

548

Where are you?

549
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:02,502
Earlier I told you that I was certain

550
00:46:02,503 --> 00:46:04,287
that the pardons would eliminate

551
00:46:04,288 --> 00:46:06,256
all resistance in Nassau

552
00:46:06,257 --> 00:46:09,458
and you asked me
how I was so certain.

553
00:46:14,132 --> 00:46:16,215
It's because I helped build them.

554
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:23,140
Peter Ashe, Miranda,
her husband, and I,

555
00:46:23,141 --> 00:46:26,726
we worked to obtain
a universal pardon

556
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:28,145
and introduce it to Nassau

557
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:31,363
to eliminate piracy and
restore colonial rule there.

558
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:39,156
I moved away from those things.

559
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:42,492
Inch by inch,

560
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:45,127
I forgot it all.

561
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:51,418
And now, in this cage,

562
00:46:51,419 --> 00:46:53,804
in the belly of this thing

563
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:56,005
that has swallowed us whole...

564
00:46:57,225 --> 00:46:59,759
I wonder...

565
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,229
if the civilization of Nassau

566
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,148
isn't exactly what I tried to
achieve all those years ago.

567
00:47:08,603 --> 00:47:13,190
If resisting it doesn't
set me in opposition

568
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:17,409
to everything I once understood
to be good and right.

569
00:47:19,614 --> 00:47:22,165
To forgive.

570
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:25,584
To make order of chaos.

571
00:47:28,956 --> 00:47:33,593
I wonder if the pardons
are the victory

572
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:38,298
and that the most enlightened
thing that I can do is

573
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:40,800
sit still.

574
00:47:40,801 --> 00:47:45,555
Accept what appears to be inevitable

575
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:48,858
and let this be the end
of Captain Flint.

576
00:47:50,194 --> 00:47:52,779
No.

577
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,950
No, no, no.
Nothing is inevitable here.

578
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:00,153
I'm showing you a way in
which we can survive this.

579
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:03,907
You're new to this,

580
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:08,078
being responsible for men's lives.

581
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,665
But I know what the woman
who leads this place

582
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:14,217
is facing right now.

583
00:48:14,218 --> 00:48:18,889
The weight of her people's
welfare on her shoulders.

584
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,091
She will not let us
leave this place alive.

585
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:27,346
She simply won't permit it.

586
00:48:30,685 --> 00:48:32,319
We'll all face certain death

587
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,153
with our own kind of lie.

588
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,275
Billy's is that he can
fight his way out of it.

589
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:44,580
Yours is that you can
talk your way past it.

590
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:48,751
But for me...

591
00:48:51,422 --> 00:48:54,957
I don't know that I have
any more lies left in me.

592
00:49:16,197 --> 00:49:18,982
<i>I know all you want</i>
<i>is to protect us,</i>

593
00:49:18,983 --> 00:49:21,151
<i>to protect me,</i>

594
00:49:21,152 --> 00:49:24,487
but what you intend to do
tomorrow toward that end,

595
00:49:24,488 --> 00:49:26,456
I think it is a grave mistake

596
00:49:26,457 --> 00:49:28,792
and I'm asking you once more
to please reconsider.

597
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:30,710
- Madi.
- We share a common enemy.

598
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:32,379
- Does that not make us friends?
- Madi!

599
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,665
The men in that cage
are deceitful men.

600
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:38,134
They will say things that
will sound appealing to you,

601
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:41,221
especially to you.

602
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:43,390
But you must not let them sway you.

603
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:45,842
Your father and I built this place

604
00:49:45,843 --> 00:49:48,345
to separate ourselves
from their world.

605
00:49:48,346 --> 00:49:51,398
But we rely on the things that
father sends back from their world.

606
00:49:51,399 --> 00:49:52,983
We're not that separate from them.

607
00:49:52,984 --> 00:49:55,602
We are separate enough that
we have no need to see them.

608
00:49:55,603 --> 00:49:57,604
To steal from them.
To fight with them.

609
00:49:57,605 --> 00:49:59,355
To know their chains again.

610
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:05,028
I have worked so hard

611
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:07,914
to ensure that you've never
had to see those things.

612
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:10,533
But I have seen those things.

613
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:14,004
And I will hold them at bay
for as long as I'm able to.

614
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:16,706
For every day that we avoid
colliding into their world

615
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:18,341
is a day children are born here,

616
00:50:18,342 --> 00:50:22,045
<i>is a day families exist here.</i>

617
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:24,881
I'm in no hurry to see that end.

618
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,799
Nor should you be.

619
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:37,193
Come.

620
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:40,563
That separation rests entirely

621
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:42,482
on our existence remaining a secret.

622
00:50:42,483 --> 00:50:45,285
The pirates, for as long
as they draw breath,

623
00:50:45,286 --> 00:50:47,153
could and would for a profit

624
00:50:47,154 --> 00:50:48,905
compromise that secret.

625
00:50:48,906 --> 00:50:52,125
So they must be eliminated.

626
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:54,044
Why not consult father?

627
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:55,912
You can get a message to him.

628
00:50:55,913 --> 00:50:57,997
He knows these men.
He sailed with them.

629
00:50:57,998 --> 00:51:00,500
He might have something
to say about killing them.

630
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:03,670
Your father aids us
from his position in Nassau.

631
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:06,256
<i>He might have lived</i>
<i>among these men.</i>

632
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:08,591
<i>He may have fought
beside these men.</i>

633
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:11,394
<i>He may have even called</i>
<i>some of these men friends.</i>

634
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:15,265
<i>But when it comes to the safety
of the people in this place,</i>

635
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:19,985
<i>your father knows</i>
<i>the final decision is mine.</i>

636
00:51:25,242 --> 00:51:27,911
- You know where you're going, yes?
- Yes.

637
00:51:27,912 --> 00:51:31,281
When you reach the beach, make
no attempt into the trees.

638
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:32,866
They will find you
and guide you through.

639
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:34,284
Once you reach the camp,
