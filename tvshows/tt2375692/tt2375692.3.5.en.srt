1
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:12,013
<i>Who are they?</i>

2
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:14,182
<i>Maroons. Escaped slaves.</i>

3
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:16,050
<i>They must have a camp upriver.</i>

4
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,218
<i>She is everything here.</i>

5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,354
<i>Priestess, governess, warlord.</i>

6
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:21,189
<i>She's not to be underestimated.</i>

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,393
Spain. What did you
have to promise them?

8
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:24,392
That I would secure the remains
of the Urca De Lima's gold

9
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:25,860
<i>and return it to Havana.</i>

10
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,528
<i>You set aside some of the gold?</i>

11
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:28,729
- She did.
- How much?

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,198
- Eh.
- You don't think there's any way

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,000
we can challenge that
blockade directly, do you?

14
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,436
<i>We're working on something
to even the odds a bit.</i>

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,188
Get her inside!

16
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:40,508
<i>I wonder if the pardons
are the victory</i>

17
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,443
<i>and that the most enlightened
thing that I can do</i>

18
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,678
is let this be the end
of Captain Flint.

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,881
The pirates must be eliminated.

20
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,349
<i>Why not consult Father?</i>

21
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,551
Your father aids us
from his position in Nassau.

22
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,587
- Please, come with me.
- Lower your weapons. Now!

23
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,789
No, no! No!

26
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:35,385
<i>I saw a dead dog
lying in the grass when I was young.</i>

27
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:44,660
<i>She was an old bitch in life,</i>

28
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:46,895
<i>but just a pup in death.</i>

29
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:54,436
<i>I remember seeing
the first flies set on her eyes.</i>

30
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,579
<i>How strange it was
that they looked so alive</i>

31
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,014
<i>and yet did not move.</i>

32
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,252
<i>That was the first moment</i>

33
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:13,454
<i>that I wondered what
this moment would feel like.</i>

34
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:19,261
<i>James, you resented me</i>

35
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:22,496
because we were so close...

36
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,867
and I threw it all away.

37
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:30,271
<i>If you join me now,</i>

38
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:34,175
<i>what if I resented you
for the same reason?</i>

39
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:36,677
<i>What would I be throwing away?</i>

40
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,181
You can't see it yet, can you?

41
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:46,152
<i>You are not alone.</i>

42
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:23,188
Who is that?

43
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,134
That is the king.

44
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,499
Wind's in our favor.

45
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,904
Should be arriving in Ocracoke
in three days' time.

46
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:24,549
My fourth wife, Constance...

47
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,752
a sweet girl, bright,
but she had her notions.

48
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:33,057
Cricket in the house means good luck,
a moth in the house, bad.

49
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:36,860
And the bed... Jesus, the bed.

50
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:40,231
No hats on it, no brooms near it,

51
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:43,533
nor any clothes in it
that were worn outdoors.

52
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:46,904
Any violation of this
brought great misfortune.

53
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,872
I mean, for an otherwise sane woman,

54
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:53,010
she had these pockets of complete
and thorough madness within her.

55
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:58,448
Although it's been six years
since I've seen her face...

56
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,918
to this day, if I...

57
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,053
if I see a broom by a bed,
I... I have to move it.

58
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:09,692
What the fuck are you talking about?

59
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,363
A woman has that power, God-given,

60
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:16,966
to leave her marks on you.

61
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,968
And it's far harder
to dispose of the marks

62
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,536
than the woman who left them.

63
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,872
You think I'm having second thoughts

64
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:25,141
about leaving Nassau?

65
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:28,044
That that is the mark
Eleanor Guthrie left on me?

66
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:29,145
I know it is.

67
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:31,447
And I know that you're conflicted

68
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:34,550
about what you have left behind.

69
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,453
But the question is
whether you can cling fast

70
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:39,555
to the truth we both
hold in our hearts,

71
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:41,823
the truth that makes us
of the same mind.

72
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,425
And what truth is that?

73
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:47,896
That a lion keeps no den.

74
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:51,499
Because the savanna,
all the space within it,

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,603
everything that walks
and crawls upon it belongs to him.

76
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:59,474
When I talked like that, they all
looked at me like I was mad.

77
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:00,842
They never understood.

78
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,343
There's hardly any of us who do.

79
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,381
<i>Sails!</i>

80
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:16,757
- Three masts.
- Colors?

81
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:22,228
Spanish.

82
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,134
Signal the fleet.

83
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,601
Set a course to pursue.

84
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,478
It was never a rule.
No one ever decided it.

85
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,181
It was just something
of an understanding.

86
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:43,517
Spanish ships are to be avoided.

87
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:46,186
Yeah, for fear of reprisals
against Nassau.

88
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:48,821
I suppose that's one less thing
to worry about now, then.

89
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,858
Give us the room.

90
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:55,387
They say you are dead.

91
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:58,622
They say you were defeated
by Captain Hornigold.

92
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,210
They only truly ever have
half the story, don't they?

93
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,528
Yeah.

94
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:22,880
It's fallen. Hasn't it?

95
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:26,049
A pardon was offered,

96
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,552
and it brought down our defenses
without a shot bein' fired.

97
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:37,059
Did no one put up any resistance?
Not even Vane?

98
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:41,664
Obviously he took no pardon,

99
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,182
but it was all he and Captain Teach
could do to escape.

100
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,837
Teach?

101
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,172
Teach was there on the island?

102
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,009
He was. But he and Captain Vane

103
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,678
slipped away
with most of the men and ships

104
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,080
that might have been willing
to resist the occupation.

105
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:05,988
I wonder if ever a war
so loudly anticipated

106
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:09,723
ended so quietly.

107
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:18,300
How?

108
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,136
How did you do all this?

109
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,171
Before the Rosario raids,
there were warnings,

110
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,107
whispers that Spain
intended to retaliate

111
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:30,311
against Richard Guthrie
and his growing pirate empire.

112
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:36,818
I could not leave my wife
and daughter in harm's way,

113
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,886
so I secured them passage here.

114
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:43,124
It was smaller then, disorganized,

115
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,194
but it was far more remote
than other camps like it,

116
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,997
safer.

117
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:52,333
They agreed to take my family in,

118
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:56,036
and I agreed to offer them support
from my position in Nassau.

119
00:10:56,037 --> 00:11:00,841
Of the hundreds of slaves
killed by the Spanish soldiers

120
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:04,011
during the raid,
no one even questioned me

121
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:08,215
when I suggested that my wife
and daughter were amongst them.

122
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,350
Not even Eleanor.

123
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:14,754
When Richard Guthrie left the island,

124
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:18,658
I was left to oversee his business,

125
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,260
<i>but the scrutiny of wearing the crown</i>

126
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:23,930
<i>made secrecy difficult
and travel near impossible.</i>

127
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:27,434
<i>Once Eleanor
was ready to assume control,</i>

128
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:31,671
<i>I encouraged it
so that I might manage</i>

129
00:11:31,672 --> 00:11:34,340
the survival of both places

130
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:38,143
outside the scrutiny of either.

131
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:44,250
For as long as I have known you,

132
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,851
you've been two wholly separate men.

133
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:54,325
Until now.

134
00:11:56,863 --> 00:12:02,534
Now I can no longer do that
which I am needed to do.

135
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:06,271
Now my wife, my daughter,
and all who live here

136
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,607
are in the gravest of danger.

137
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:12,310
They must find a way to steal
what they need to live.

138
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:17,382
They must learn the skill fast and well
lest it lead them to be discovered here.

139
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,716
And they will need help to do so.

140
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Your help.

141
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,661
A partnership?

142
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,298
He said that?

143
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:37,401
With Nassau gone,
they've lost a vital supply line.

144
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:39,670
We would go out
on the account... hunt for them,

145
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:42,573
using this place as a
hidden base for operations.

146
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:46,844
However, he acknowledged
that he lacks the ability

147
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:49,013
to ratify any such arrangement.

148
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:52,848
He has authority here, but he
doesn't have the final word.

149
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:56,685
The queen.

150
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:02,326
Her concerns about
our trustworthiness remain.

151
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:05,262
He said that he would arrange for
me to appeal directly to the queen,

152
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,497
try and convince her
that we are worthy allies,

153
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:11,367
and that given the fall of Nassau,
we are partners well matched.

154
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:13,803
They have a home
with no means to supply it,

155
00:13:13,804 --> 00:13:15,171
we the other way around.

156
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:19,843
And what if you can't convince her?

157
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:22,544
I will put the case as best I can.

158
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:26,248
But if I feel that it isn't happening...

159
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:34,857
<i>Then I get in close to the queen</i>

160
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:36,526
<i>and make it clear</i>

161
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,961
that either everyone
on this crew is released

162
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:41,897
with a guide to take them
safely back to the beach,

163
00:13:41,898 --> 00:13:45,667
or the queen dies
within days of the king.

164
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:51,339
Even if you could get to her without
being killed in the process,

165
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,241
even if you could
get the knife to her throat

166
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:56,510
and convince them to let us go,
you would never get out of this alive.

167
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:22,203
Told you once lived here.

168
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:24,739
For a short time,
when I was very young.

169
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,407
Before my father
moved us to the interior

170
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,243
and the opium traders
claimed it for themselves.

171
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,279
Home to a smuggler,
den to opium fiends,

172
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,348
salon to a pirate king.

173
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,050
Suppose I'll fit right in.

174
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,353
Before any of that, it was home
to a long line of governors.

175
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,554
It will remember.

176
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:43,828
Yes, well, let's hope I don't
fit in too well with<i> them.</i>

177
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:46,559
Sir?

178
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,061
- For your signature.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

179
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,867
What is that?

180
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:55,902
Petitions to the Lloyds,
attesting to the fact

181
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,704
that the damage to
the "Willing Mind" last night

182
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:01,540
was no fault of ours
and thus insurable.

183
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,111
A month from now,
somewhere in Cornwall,

184
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,213
a clerk will be asked to draft
a letter to Charles Vane,

185
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:08,781
asking for his version of events.

186
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:13,432
And they'll withhold payment for years,
awaiting his response.

187
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,221
Between you and I,
if there were ever a moment

188
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:17,490
in which I sympathized with the
desire to tear down the flag

189
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:20,126
and declare myself in open
rebellion against the Crown,

190
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,360
it's when dealing
with the insurance company.

191
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,669
He isn't coming back.

192
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:37,108
Charles Vane is no longer
a part of Nassau's story.

193
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,077
You know that, yes?

194
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:41,913
<i>My lord.</i>

195
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:42,981
Do you have it?

196
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:46,318
Excavation of the northwest
tunnel is complete.

197
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,755
- After significant work to...
- Do you have it?

198
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:54,259
The main vaults are secured,
as are its contents...

199
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,693
a sizable fortune in Spanish gold.

200
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:01,666
Thank you, Captain.

201
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,268
The Commodore will
take control of the structure

202
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,670
and ready the gold
for transport to Havana.

203
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:06,971
Wait.

204
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:10,374
Any news from the fort as to
Captain Rackham's whereabouts?

205
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:14,111
I'm told he and Anne Bonny
fled before our arrival.

206
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:16,979
Their... their
whereabouts are unknown.

207
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,888
Why?

208
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:29,626
Spain may be appeased, but the
street is still an open question.

209
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:33,230
If you want me to help you play that game,
I need to know where all the players are.

210
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,632
I see.

211
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:38,734
And when do you presume
this game begins?

212
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,837
It already has.

213
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:56,618
Next man.

214
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,688
<i>- Sir.
- Your name.</i>

215
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:00,756
<i>Fowler...</i>

216
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:05,494
I am once again
a citizen of the British Empire.

217
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:08,430
Mm-hmm. Congratulations.

218
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:12,601
<i>- And your profession?
- Sailmaker, sir.</i>

219
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,203
Thank you.

220
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:18,874
<i>Next man. Name?</i>

221
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,845
It's done?

222
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,380
I do solemnly swear.

223
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,916
<i>Signed my name, and my account
with the law is now square.</i>

224
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,519
A few hours ago,
any magistrate in the Empire

225
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,854
would have hanged me
without hesitation.

226
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,856
Children would have cheered,

227
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:37,959
women would have taken comfort...
one less villain in the world.

228
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,095
<i>Men would have looked on in awe,</i>

229
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:42,197
wondering what adventures and mischief

230
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:45,700
they'd missed in their lives
that I'd lived in mine.

231
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,803
And with the stroke of
a pen, it's all gone

232
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,205
as if it never existed,

233
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:54,875
rendering me nothing more
than a humble tavern bookkeeper.

234
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:03,683
I sincerely hope this doesn't
diminish your attraction to me.

235
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:10,056
<i>- Move aside.
- Coming through. Step aside.</i>

236
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,208
When weeks went by

237
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,579
with no news of your sentence
having been carried out,

238
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,915
<i>I assumed an arrangement
had been reached</i>

239
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,150
<i>to carry it out privately</i>

240
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:38,517
<i>or a deal had been brokered</i>

241
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,154
<i>to commute your execution
to a long prison stay.</i>

242
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:45,825
I suppose I should have seen this,

243
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,660
that somehow your grip on this place

244
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,629
would be too strong
to be denied by a king,

245
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,132
his laws, or even your death.

246
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,171
In the winter, the sun drives
hard through those windows.

247
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,374
You'll be blinded there lest you
keep them shuttered all day long.

248
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,077
I had the desk
where it was for a reason,

249
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,679
though I suppose you haven't
been here long enough

250
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,446
to know how to sit in that chair.

251
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,718
So here you are,

252
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,688
and I do not imagine
you came to decorate.

253
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:23,628
The governor is going to announce today
the formation of a governing council.

254
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,163
12 seats.

255
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,998
Six filled from his ranks,

256
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,567
six filled from merchants
native to the island.

257
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,503
It will signal
the governor's clear intent

258
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,037
to give the people
of New Providence Island

259
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,808
a meaningful say in their own futures,

260
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,842
and we would like you to bless it.

261
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,580
I am sorry.
Are you offering me a seat?

262
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,850
No. The six names
have already been chosen,

263
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,851
and yours is not among them.

264
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,598
I own title to more of the
street than you ever did.

265
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,836
I earn as much legitimate
income as you ever did.

266
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,039
I have no enemies and strong friends.

267
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,408
I am the one they all come to here

268
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:14,344
to make peace between them
when no one else can.

269
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,012
You are a pirate.

270
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,014
Excuse me?

271
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:21,918
The first thing he asked me to do

272
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,954
was to identify pirate
ringleaders on the island.

273
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,289
Organizers.

274
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,859
And you named me?

275
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,794
Undermined my reputation
with him before he...

276
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:34,430
You abetted the practice.

277
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,866
You signed articles, for Christ's sakes.

278
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,901
You held a share in an active crew.

279
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,270
What I have done so thoroughly
pales in comparison

280
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:42,805
to what you did before me.

281
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:45,808
And I lost everything for it.

282
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,644
I lost everything.

283
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:51,079
Remember that
when you sit in that chair.

284
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:56,485
You were wise to come to me.

285
00:20:56,486 --> 00:21:01,790
If I remain silent about this council
or, worse yet, oppose its formation,

286
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:06,828
it will sow all manner of mistrust and
apprehension amongst my colleagues.

287
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:12,801
For if I can be so easily
discarded, who next?

288
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:15,103
Which is why you won't remain silent.

289
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:17,572
Really? Why?

290
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,273
'Cause this is important to him,

291
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,910
that the street understands
that his intentions are genuine

292
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:25,679
and he means to be a friend.

293
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,948
If you undermine that,

294
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,683
he can make life very difficult for you.

295
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,288
You should know

296
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:37,690
people do not speak to me
that way anymore.

297
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:41,328
Be smart.

298
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:43,429
Was I on that list?

299
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:49,503
That night before you were taken,

300
00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:53,674
when you made the first of your lists
of those you wanted to see dead...

301
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:57,844
Mr. Stayton, Mr. Atz,
Mr. Featherstone,

302
00:21:57,845 --> 00:22:01,448
Jack, Anne...

303
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:04,316
<i>was I on that list?</i>

304
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,586
No.

305
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:11,858
The night I was taken,

306
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:14,492
did you inform Hornigold
where he could find me?

307
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,329
No.

308
00:24:00,497 --> 00:24:02,265
Ellers.

309
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,834
<i>Captain?</i>

310
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:07,535
Get me some rum.

311
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:18,314
You think that this
is something you can ignore.

312
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,515
It isn't.

313
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:23,619
I said I would hear him.

314
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,155
How is that ignoring anything?

315
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:27,790
You said you would hear him.

316
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,325
I need you to listen.

317
00:24:30,326 --> 00:24:33,495
I understand that you think that
Flint is the answer to all of it.

318
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:35,597
I would like to tell you that I agree

319
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:39,134
if for no other reason than to
appease you so you can rest.

320
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:40,935
But in the state that you're in,

321
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:44,673
the one thing I swear
I will not do is lie to you.

322
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:45,707
I will hear him.

323
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,643
I will look in his eyes
while he tells me

324
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:50,679
that he can be trusted
to be a partner to us.

325
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,449
But if I for a moment doubt him...

326
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:02,290
Do you trust me to make this decision?

327
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:05,158
Of course I do.

328
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,634
Shall I come back?

329
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:16,669
Come.

330
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:22,342
Rest.

331
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:33,854
Did she listen to you?

332
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:36,522
No.

333
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:38,023
You?

334
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:45,665
I removed one of them
from the cage last night,

335
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:49,268
<i>spoke briefly with him.</i>

336
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:50,369
Why?

337
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:59,277
You're my father, and I love you...

338
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:03,314
but I do not know you.

339
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:07,552
<i>Those men, they are your life.</i>

340
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:12,623
I wanted to know it, at least a little.

341
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,236
I will be all right.

342
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:58,401
You're against it.

343
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,410
An escape plan that involves
the certainty of losing our captain

344
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:09,413
in lieu of potentially
getting a powerful ally.

345
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,781
"Potentially" being the operative word.

346
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:14,184
And if he tries and comes up short,

347
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:17,154
we may lose our only shot
of gettin' out of here alive.

348
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:20,623
This would seem to be no choice at all.

349
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:24,995
Maybe, though you seem awfully
eager to get rid of him.

350
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:26,528
'Course I am.

351
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,634
We propped him up because
his strength as a captain

352
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:35,004
was the thing that was gonna
keep us alive.

353
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:39,676
But now his death becomes that thing.

354
00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:41,845
I understand that you've made gains

355
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:44,347
towards a rapport
with the captain in recent days,

356
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:47,549
but if he wants to sacrifice
himself so that we might go free,

357
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,819
I mean, that might
be the first selfless thing

358
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,288
he's done for our benefit
since we've known him.

359
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:58,826
I'd ask you not to get in his way.

360
00:30:58,368 --> 00:30:59,600
Open.

361
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:35,468
<i>Charles.</i>

362
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:49,183
My lord.

363
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,921
I think you know who I am.

364
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:56,555
May we have a word in private, please?

365
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>With everything I have sacrificed</i>

366
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:22,215
to be a part of Nassau's future,
please understand,

367
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:24,484
I cannot endorse
a version of that future

368
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,152
in which I am still on the
outside of it looking in.

369
00:32:37,397 --> 00:32:39,966
You want a seat on the council.

370
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,101
You say you want
to be a friend of Nassau.

371
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:45,738
Well, I am Nassau.

372
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:49,308
<i>You question whether
I deserve this friendship.</i>

373
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:50,909
<i>It is a fair thing to ask.</i>

374
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,913
So I suggest, like the longest
lasting of friendships,

375
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:57,849
the one that lasts to the grave,

376
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,086
I substantiate my worthiness
to enter into it with a dowry.

377
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,861
For obvious reasons,
that is only a sample.

378
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,863
<i>There are several
thousand more behind it,</i>

379
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,366
assuming we are able to reach
an agreement here today.

380
00:33:18,003 --> 00:33:20,438
These are profits
from running a tavern?

381
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:23,040
<i>Jesus.
It's from the Spanish gold.</i>

382
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:26,143
Money you held out
from the fort... your share.

383
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:27,679
<i>Not as far as you know.</i>

384
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,614
Not as far as Spain knows.

385
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:31,015
As far as anyone knows,

386
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,649
the entirety of the Spanish gold

387
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,152
was captured today
in the fort by your men.

388
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:37,654
And this?

389
00:33:37,655 --> 00:33:39,323
This comes from nowhere.

390
00:33:39,324 --> 00:33:41,892
That is its virtue.

391
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:44,829
No covenants, no conditions.

392
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,832
No history.

393
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:51,535
Just an unexpected investment
from a loyal resident.

394
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:54,237
An investment so
substantial, I might add,

395
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:56,906
it would dramatically,
if not definitively,

396
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:59,843
improve your prospects for success.

397
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:02,746
And what exactly
would you want in exchange

398
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:06,316
for this investment?

399
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:08,051
An end to this conversation.

400
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:10,353
An end to questions about my past

401
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:12,355
and a new beginning
in which we all agree

402
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:16,159
there is no history
in this place anymore,

403
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,330
only a future in which
you and I are truly friends.

404
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,324
Billy doesn't give a shit
if you die tomorrow.

405
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:56,997
But I suppose you knew that already.

406
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:02,871
You know, the strange thing is, I...

407
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:05,874
I should be with Billy.

408
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:09,811
Until most recently, I'm quite
certain I would have been.

409
00:35:09,812 --> 00:35:14,014
Unbothered by the idea of trading your life
for the rest of the crew's.

410
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:20,754
And yet, for some reason,

411
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:22,822
right now I am bothered by it.

412
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:28,261
But I understand it.

413
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:31,298
<i>I understand the allure</i>

414
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:33,133
<i>of ensuring that no one
will ever think you</i>

415
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:35,167
<i>the villain you fear you are.</i>

416
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:44,677
What a waste, it seems to me,

417
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:48,481
knowing it doesn't have to be this way,

418
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:53,153
knowing the man who talked me
into giving a shit about this crew,

419
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:56,255
why, he could talk those people
out there into anything.

420
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:02,060
If he wanted to.

421
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,002
Jesus.

422
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,006
<i>Billy.</i>

423
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,869
I have great respect for your husband,

424
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,272
and I know what he wants me to say...

425
00:37:56,273 --> 00:38:00,776
that you have no choice but to use
me and my men to hunt for you,

426
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:05,146
<i>that I am your only means of survival.</i>

427
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:10,752
But let's be honest.

428
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:12,455
If that is all I can offer you,

429
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,959
then my men and I are dead
before the sun rises tomorrow,

430
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:21,743
<i>because you know there
is always a choice to be made,</i>

431
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,999
<i>and you don't trust me at all.</i>

432
00:38:28,337 --> 00:38:31,439
So...

433
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,145
let us assume that I can
offer you something better.

434
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:39,780
<i>You have hidden in this place
for a lifetime,</i>

435
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:43,418
hidden from the harsh realities

436
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:47,655
that lie beyond this veil
that you have constructed here,

437
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:52,692
but the moment that
that shot entered his belly,

438
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:55,762
that veil began to unravel,

439
00:38:55,763 --> 00:38:57,631
and sooner or later,

440
00:38:57,632 --> 00:39:01,134
you are going to have
to confront these realities,

441
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:04,771
chief among them being
that England takes

442
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:10,309
whatever, whenever, however it wants.

443
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,877
Lives.

444
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:14,980
<i>Loves. Labor.</i>

445
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:17,216
<i>Spirits. Homes.</i>

446
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:20,886
It has taken them from me.

447
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:26,659
I imagine that
it has taken it from you.

448
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,294
And when that veil drops altogether,

449
00:39:29,295 --> 00:39:31,997
they <i>will</i> come for more.

450
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:35,500
You're suggesting
that you could help us

451
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,636
prevent England
from taking these things?

452
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:43,408
No, I am suggesting
that we help each other

453
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:47,345
start taking things back,

454
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,481
and it starts with Nassau.

455
00:39:52,218 --> 00:39:54,252
<i>You cannot stay here.</i>

456
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:57,189
<i>This camp's secrecy is its virtue,</i>

457
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,823
<i>but that secrecy is going.</i>

458
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:02,727
Nassau is defendable.

459
00:40:02,728 --> 00:40:06,197
Nassau can supply itself.

460
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:08,499
Is that not exactly the sort of place

461
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,569
that could replace this?

462
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,504
A place that you could settle?

463
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:16,773
Settle? Governor Woodes Rogers

464
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:20,211
holds Nassau Town
with a full company of British regulars.

465
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:22,279
He holds the harbor with a small navy.

466
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,448
He holds the men on the street
with his pardons.

467
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:28,219
Woodes Rogers has an inoperative fort,

468
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,054
responsibility for an
administrative nightmare

469
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:33,289
that isn't going away
just because he wants it to,

470
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,027
and an island full of hunters
that may be placated for now,

471
00:40:37,028 --> 00:40:39,529
but could be awoken.

472
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,298
That<i> I</i> could awaken.

473
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:45,167
How do you propose to do that?

474
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:51,541
They pledged to follow me
when they thought I was alive.

475
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:55,878
They turned
when they thought I was gone.

476
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:58,748
So I will come back from the dead

477
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:01,883
and lay claim to what I am owed.

478
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:05,121
Let's say that by some miracle

479
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:08,323
we could dislodge
the British from Nassau.

480
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:11,460
I could not possibly hope
to defend it with my numbers.

481
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:13,062
<i>Your numbers?</i>

482
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:14,063
<i>For every man in your camp,</i>

483
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:16,632
<i>there are thousands
somewhere in the West Indies</i>

484
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,134
<i>living under the same yoke,</i>

485
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:21,470
chained in fields, pressed on ships,

486
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:24,339
sold into indenture.

487
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,975
When they see a sitting governor

488
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:29,478
protected by His Majesty's Navy,

489
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:34,082
deposed by an alliance
of pirates and slaves,

490
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:37,986
how many consider joining that fight?

491
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:40,789
<i>How many thousands of men</i>

492
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,659
<i>will flock to Nassau,
join your ranks,</i>

493
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,427
<i>and help you defend it?</i>

494
00:41:46,428 --> 00:41:49,264
What does a colonial power do

495
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:52,633
when the men whose toil powers it

496
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:55,770
lay down their shovels,
take up swords,

497
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:57,937
and say, "No more"?

498
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:03,377
<i>Bring down Nassau,</i>

499
00:42:03,378 --> 00:42:05,978
maybe you bring it all down.

500
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:14,688
<i>Spanish intelligence.</i>

501
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:17,357
They'll carry files
from station to station,

502
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,160
relaying information up
the chain of command.

503
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:23,297
Looks like this was a heavy load.

504
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:25,298
What do you think
they could have had in there?

505
00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:30,337
<i>Well, it could be inventories
for silver shipments.</i>

506
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:31,805
<i>Could be treasure fleet schedules.</i>

507
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:33,573
Could be private letters
of the goddamn king.

508
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:35,174
Could be anything.

509
00:42:35,175 --> 00:42:38,510
Captain. Your name's in here.

510
00:42:40,648 --> 00:42:43,148
What?

511
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:53,658
The reports from the Bahamas.

512
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:59,665
English operations in the area

513
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:01,667
and a dossier on the new governor.

514
00:43:01,668 --> 00:43:03,569
Part of an invasion plan

515
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,903
in case they decide to go in.

516
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:06,505
No, this isn't remotely a plan.

517
00:43:06,506 --> 00:43:10,075
It's just someone's notes.
Fragments.

518
00:43:10,076 --> 00:43:13,011
Is there anything of value in it?

519
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:16,081
Not unless we have an
interest in invading Nassau,

520
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:17,582
which I don't think we do.

521
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,585
<i>Do we?</i>

522
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:22,686
No, we don't.

523
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:28,226
<i>Governor hasn't
even been here that long.</i>

524
00:43:28,227 --> 00:43:30,495
<i>How do they learn anything
about him so quickly?</i>

525
00:43:30,496 --> 00:43:34,031
Well, same way they do all the
British governors in the Americas.

526
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:36,332
<i>They have a spy in his office.</i>

527
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:05,094
What are you thinking?

528
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:11,234
At the end of every great
achievement that has ever been,

529
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:15,305
I imagine one looks back
and is reminded

530
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:17,407
of the one moment
when good fortune reached out

531
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:19,743
and gave the thing its blessing.

532
00:44:20,578 --> 00:44:23,980
I think this is the equivalent
of five years' worth of tax revenue

533
00:44:23,981 --> 00:44:27,515
without an ounce of the resentment
that traditionally comes with it.

534
00:44:29,786 --> 00:44:32,322
I've felt fortune's
other hand so many times,

535
00:44:32,323 --> 00:44:34,924
the one that takes instead of gives,

536
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:38,308
<i>had it snatch away victories
that by all rights should have been mine.</i>

537
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:42,798
<i>That feeling I know too well
and still bear its scars.</i>

538
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:44,699
But this...

539
00:44:47,003 --> 00:44:48,770
This feels different.

540
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:57,812
What happened that time?

541
00:44:57,813 --> 00:44:59,646
<i>How did you get that scar?</i>

542
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,222
Combat with a Spanish galleon
off the coast of Mexico.

543
00:45:09,492 --> 00:45:12,827
We had routed her.

544
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:14,462
By all rights, her colors
should have been struck.

545
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:18,032
And they were,
just minutes after the event.

546
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:20,368
But in that moment,

547
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:25,974
one of her stern chasers fired a
shot at the most implausible angle.

548
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:28,175
Nothing more than the
desperation of a dying thing,

549
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:32,578
but that shot hit us right at the helm.

550
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:39,920
When the smoke cleared,
my brother was dead

551
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:41,854
and I had this.

552
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:50,531
Though I suppose it's some strange
irony that if he hadn't died,

553
00:45:50,532 --> 00:45:52,065
it wouldn't have made for
nearly as interesting a book

554
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:54,299
and I probably wouldn't
be here right now.

555
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:17,189
I'm sorry. Were you summoned?

556
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:24,396
Please forgive me.

557
00:46:24,397 --> 00:46:26,231
<i>This is so foreign to me.</i>

558
00:46:26,232 --> 00:46:30,134
<i>I... I don't know how to do it.</i>

559
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:38,477
About six months ago,

560
00:46:38,478 --> 00:46:42,281
I was approached by a man
who introduced himself as John

561
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:46,051
and said his employers wished
to monitor your operation to retake Nassau,

562
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:49,555
<i>said they had a vested interest.</i>

563
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,624
<i>I assumed this had something
to do with your investors,</i>

564
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,992
which seemed perfectly legitimate.

565
00:46:57,964 --> 00:47:01,231
They offered me
a significant amount of money.

566
00:47:02,602 --> 00:47:06,203
I said... yes.

567
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:12,843
It turns out the man's name
is Juan Antonio Grandal

568
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:15,179
and his employer
is the intelligence department

569
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,847
of the Casa De Contratación.

570
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:33,797
Upon our arrival,
I received a query from them.

571
00:47:33,798 --> 00:47:37,367
It said the department spies
had learned of a series of transactions

572
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:41,771
to exchange a significant portion
of the Urca De Lima's prize gold

573
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:43,939
for more portable commodities.

574
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,944
An attempt to walk away
with their money

575
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:51,148
without them knowing of it...

576
00:47:51,149 --> 00:47:52,981
a scheme they find most insulting.

577
00:47:57,121 --> 00:48:01,456
I was then asked if you had yet
learned of this converted cache.

578
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:06,896
So standing outside the door just now,

579
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:11,467
I found myself faced
with two choices...

580
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:14,803
report what I had just heard,

581
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:16,838
that you are considering
keeping this money

582
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:20,441
and know that Nassau will likely
burn for it and me with it...

583
00:48:24,147 --> 00:48:26,415
or I could open the door

584
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:28,684
and warn you of the full scope
of the danger you face

585
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:32,187
if you do not return the
entirety of the hidden cache

586
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:34,488
along with the gold from the fort.

587
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:45,600
I cannot even begin to imagine

588
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:48,802
what would motivate you
to tell a lie like this.

589
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:54,441
So let's assume for the moment

590
00:48:54,442 --> 00:48:56,541
that you are telling the truth.

591
00:49:01,115 --> 00:49:04,451
I will see this money secured

592
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:07,486
and return it with the rest of
the gold in a matter of hours.

593
00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:11,990
You'll relay this to your contact.

594
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:14,961
No.

595
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:18,131
No?

596
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:20,332
Why not?

597
00:49:22,536 --> 00:49:27,240
The department has estimated
the approximate total value of the cache

598
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:30,382
based on the scope
of the exchanges involved,

599
00:49:32,779 --> 00:49:35,447
and that is only half of it.

600
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:50,629
I've been thinking about our plan.

601
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,630
Yeah?

602
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:53,298
A skiff to Port Royal,

603
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:55,267
connect with your acquaintances there,

604
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:57,236
purchase ship, hire crew,

605
00:49:57,237 --> 00:49:58,803
make way back to the continent,

606
00:49:58,804 --> 00:50:00,272
at which point the money
will be secure

607
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:02,974
and we can establish
whatever future we choose...

608
00:50:02,975 --> 00:50:04,942
the plan.

609
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:06,344
Yeah?

610
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:08,612
Yeah, there's a problem
with the plan.

611
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:12,716
- It was<i> your</i> plan.
- I know.

612
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:18,656
But I'm afraid I might have
overlooked a critical step,

613
00:50:18,657 --> 00:50:20,925
something I'm not prepared to do.

614
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:22,459
What step?

615
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,695
We'd need to change our names.

616
00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:28,465
Eventually,
the money will protect itself.

617
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:30,301
It'll hire guards,
it'll make us friends,

618
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:32,803
it'll shield itself
with investments and partners,

619
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:35,005
but as long
as it is in its current form,

620
00:50:35,006 --> 00:50:38,309
it is as vulnerable as a newborn babe.

621
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,645
To protect it, given the attention
our names will draw to it,

622
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:42,979
we'll need recourse to the law.

623
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,315
And at the moment,
the only thing the law wants

624
00:50:44,316 --> 00:50:47,150
with Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny
is their necks in nooses.

625
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:50,620
To have that protection,
we'll need to assume new identities.

626
00:50:50,621 --> 00:50:53,223
So we change our names for a bit.

627
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:55,859
- Who gives a shit?
- I do.

628
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,861
A little bit. I do.

629
00:50:57,862 --> 00:50:59,629
With everything I've lost
in recent days,

630
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,165
I can't afford to lose the name, too.

631
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:05,300
Not when it is so easy to keep.

632
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:10,807
- No.
- Just listen.

633
00:51:10,808 --> 00:51:12,709
Are you out of your fucking mind?

634
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,210
Charles was the only one
they singled out.

635
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:15,345
They could have mentioned us.
They didn't.

636
00:51:15,346 --> 00:51:18,147
They had pardons for unrepentant
murderers back there.

637
00:51:18,148 --> 00:51:20,516
If that is the case, then there are
certainly pardons for us, too.

638
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:23,552
- Jesus Christ, Jack.
- It'll take us half a day, if that.

639
00:51:23,553 --> 00:51:24,854
We walk into the tavern,
we sign our names,

640
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:28,157
and then not only are we square
with the law, our money is, too.

641
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:31,593
We did it.
We beat the fucking game.

642
00:51:31,594 --> 00:51:35,764
Walk another half mile,
we get in that boat,

643
00:51:35,765 --> 00:51:39,000
and we win.

644
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:40,168
And you wanna go back?

645
00:51:40,169 --> 00:51:43,405
Then this... You stay.

646
00:51:43,406 --> 00:51:45,540
Maybe it's better that way.
You can watch the money.

647
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,743
I'll return within a few hours.

648
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:50,345
We'll be on the water by nightfall.

649
00:51:50,346 --> 00:51:52,847
I'll meet you here. Stay off the road.

650
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:56,516
No more than a few hours.

651
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,820
Promise.

652
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:48,734
Mate.

653
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,685
I'm going to admit something to you.

654
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,113
Please don't take this
the wrong way...

655
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:05,952
but I didn't think
there was a chance in hell

656
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,753
that was actually going to work.

657
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:10,355
Me neither.

658
00:53:13,626 --> 00:53:16,295
Thank you...

659
00:53:16,296 --> 00:53:18,128
for opening that door.

660
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:27,805
So what happens now?

661
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:33,945
Now we marshal whatever
resources we can,

662
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:38,049
as many ships as we can muster
and allies to sail them,

663
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,685
men resolved to defy the pardon

664
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:42,911
and ready to join a war.

665
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,598
Now we go find Charles Vane.

666
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:54,800
