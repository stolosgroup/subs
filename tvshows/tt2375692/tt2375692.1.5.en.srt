<i>You took one of me best
whores for your private use.</i>

2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,331
Every day she's not under
my roof costs me money.

(grunts)

4
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:18,961
Wait, listen to me!

(gagging)

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:23,503
Good men will die for some hidden agenda,

7
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:25,533
<i>the Barlow woman's agenda.</i>

8
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:28,265
Things will get better here.
I promise you they will.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,801
We'll need some additional items.

10
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,738
New guns, 12-pounders.

11
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:33,338
You'll have it.

12
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:36,103
You want the guns from my
ship to hand over to a pirate?

13
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:37,269
That is correct.

14
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:38,635
<i>Richard: Help me, Mr. Scott.</i>

15
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,335
Please, help me save her.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,597
Why don't I take over?

17
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,769
<i>Eleanor: The Andromache, it can't be.</i>

18
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,464
<i>Captain Bryson hasn't had time to unload.</i>

19
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:48,134
He didn't. She's riding low.

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,668
<i>Those guns are still on board.</i>

21
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,966

- Get them back.

<i>Billy: Captain?</i>

27
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:49,186
We're steady at six
knots, north by northeast.

28
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,197
You don't trust me, do you?

sight the Andromache soon.</i>

31
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,646
You and I will have our roles to play.

32
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:13,123
We have the chance for a
few minutes' honesty first.

33
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,859
Honesty?

34
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,532
Men died yesterday

35
00:03:23,597 --> 00:03:26,294
careening our ship faster than was safe.

36
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,134
Men are going to die today

37
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,902
attacking that merchant ship out there,

38
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:33,470
and they'll die not knowing
it was all based on a lie.

39
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,436
A lie?

40
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:37,467
We don't even know if the
Urca's schedule is accurate.

41
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,404
We're completely relying on the cook.

42
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,306
How can you just pretend you
have no doubts about any of this?

43
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,903
Years of practice.

44
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,972
There's always doubt, Billy.

45
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:48,444
No sane man would deny that.

46
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,980
No good captain would acknowledge it.

47
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:54,184
Take our present route, for instance.

48
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,655
We tacked north by northeast,

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,187
along Andromache's best point of sail.

50
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:02,022
If you're Bryson, that's the smart course.

51
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:03,255
Yeah...

52
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,193
Well, he knows that I know that.

53
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,927
So wouldn't he have at least
considered heading northwest

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,501
to follow the coast, lose us in the dark?

55
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:15,604
Or due east on the chance that
we might sail right past him?

56
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,310
There must be at least one chance in three

57
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,171
that that horizon will remain bare

58
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:24,376
and we'll never see the Andromache again.

59
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:27,440
That's the truth.

60
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:29,711
But what good would that knowledge do

61
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:34,242
for any man on this crew trying
to focus on doing his job?

62
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,516
This crew needs certainty,

63
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,789
and I need their support to achieve an end

64
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:45,391
which is in all our best interests.

65
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,360
So we dance the dance.

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,370
Never was there a Caesar
that couldn't sing the tune.

67
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:57,979
Who's Mrs. Barlow?

68
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:02,083
Ah.

69
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:07,850
You've heard the stories, haven't you?

70
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:11,418
She's a witch who pledged
my soul to the devil,

71
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,460
and anoints me with the blood of infants

72
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,926
to keep me safe in battle.

73
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:19,304
- Come on, I'm not stupid.
- No, you're not.

74
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:23,106
So you can probably
guess it isn't as much fun

75
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,609
to tell stories about how
your captain makes a home,

76
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:28,882
with a nice Puritan woman
who shares his love of books.

77
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:34,784
Is that the truth?

78
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:37,787
<i>Man: Sails!</i>

79
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,660
<i>Man your posts!</i>

80
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,693
<i>Man 2: Posts!</i>

81
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,262
<i>Man 3: Have a look.</i>

82
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:45,134
<i>Man: It's the Andromache!</i>

<i>(dogs barking)</i>

86
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,261
Well, this is a stupid fucking idea.

87
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:12,264
Given the straits we're in, I would
suggest there is no such thing.

88
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,537
If we don't find a way to
earn an income and soon,

89
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:17,471
we will lose what little
we have left of a crew.

90
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,365
Or worse yet, we will be eaten

91
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:22,038
<i>by what little we have left of a crew.</i>

92
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,272
Wish me luck.

93
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:25,976
You gave him permission, dear.

94
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,513
We must stand by our word.

95
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:30,956
But I said he could put one
finger in my bum, not three.

96
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,956
Then next time, charge him by the digit.

97
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:36,289
Mrs. Mapleton, a word, please.

98
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,290
What the fuck are you doing here?

99
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,562
Mr. Noonan expressly
forbade it, did he not?

100
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:44,099
It turns out Mr. Noonan
has had a change of heart.

101
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:51,037
A transfer? What is this?

102
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,970
It means, madam, that the dispute

103
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:55,507
over the whore with Mr.
Noonan has been settled

104
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,151
through an agreement to
purchase this establishment

105
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:00,686
from him... by us.

106
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:04,383
<i>- Noonan sold you the inn?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

107
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:06,086
And where is he now?

108
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:09,791
From the tone in his voice,
it sounded as if Mr. Noonan

109
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,687
couldn't wait to be rid of this place

110
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,155
and of its screeching pig of a bawd.

111
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:17,354
His words, not mine.

112
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:19,826
The last I saw him, he was
seeking passage to Port Royal,

113
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,698
and then to who knows where.

114
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:24,232
You're telling me that Mr. Noonan,

115
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:28,435
who just a few hours ago had the intent
of seeing your captain beaten to a pulp,

116
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,674
that Mr. Noonan decided instead
to sell you his life's work?

117
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,172
Yes.

118
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,782
And you expect me to accept it

119
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:38,119
based on a piece of paper and your word?

120
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,847
And to keep my mouth shut about it

121
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,257
<i>when any half-wit can see
that there's foul play at hand?</i>

122
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,521
Yes.

123
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:47,564
I want a raise.

124
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,067
- What did you make before?
- Three percent of gross.

125
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:51,931
I'll give you 40.

126
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,636
Welcome aboard, sonny.

127
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,741
We are the proud new owners of a brothel.

128
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:09,353
Let's hope no one notices.

129
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,887
No one has seen or heard
from Scott all morning.

130
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,855
He must have left with Bryson.

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,329
You're certain he said nothing
to you about why he would do this?

132
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:21,100
Nothing, ma'am.

133
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:23,131
- Before I knew what was happening...
- Get my horse ready.

134
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:25,602
I'm going to see my father. I want
to know what the fuck's going on here.

135
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:30,904
(sighs)

136
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,745
Hello.

137
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,777
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

138
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:39,882
Flint stashed me here.

139
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:41,586
Presumably to stop what's in my head

140
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,817
from spilling onto the
deck of the Andromache.

141
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:48,089
Oh, that's Randall.

142
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:50,227
Why is Randall lying on my sofa?

143
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,795
(chuckles)

144
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,995
Well, he's not exactly going
to be leading the charge

145
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,627
after the day he had yesterday.

146
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,101
Why are you chained to him?

147
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,940
So I don't try to run.

148
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:02,877
Thank you.

149
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,280
Sorry, have I done something to you?

150
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,847
Excuse me?

151
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:16,416
Well, you seem to harbor quite
a bit of anger towards me,

152
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,486
<i>and considering we hardly
even know each other,</i>

153
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,250
I'm wondering if there's
something I'm missing.

154
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:23,145
Flint and his crew offer you a
life of freedom and prosperity

155
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:25,319
for which you repay them
by stealing the product

156
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:26,982
of months of their labor and sacrifice.

157
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:29,319
But you're not finished. Then you
lure Max into your selfish scheme.

158
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:30,591
Hold on.

159
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,658
I specifically tried to talk her out

160
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,761
of getting wrapped up in my selfish scheme.

161
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,263
I know all I need to know
about the kind of man you are.

162
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,027
Ma'am, you should come outside right away.

163
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,935
<i>Richard: For years, we've
all profited in this place,</i>

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,304
trading on the stability
of my family's name.

165
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:52,976
<i>But unfortunately, our
circumstances have changed.</i>

166
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:57,648
A fortnight ago, His Majesty's Navy
attempted to place me under arrest.

167
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,416
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

168
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:02,289
I am, since that day, a fugitive

169
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,828
marked for execution by the Crown.

170
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:06,493
(crowd groaning)

171
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:09,229
Unbeknownst to me, my family in Boston

172
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:12,499
learned of this and ordered Captain Bryson

173
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:14,401
to liquidate our holdings here.

174
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,066
<i>- (crowd yelling)
- Man: What about our goods?</i>

175
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,609
I convinced him to leave behind
the contents of our warehouse,

176
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:21,944
but that is all.

177
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:23,576
<i>To those of you owed credit</i>

178
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:26,511
or for whom we held goods on consignment,

179
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:31,380
I leave it to my daughter to see
you made whole as best we can.

180
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:34,411
But once that is settled,
our business with you

181
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,148
must be considered complete.

182
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:37,652
<i>(crowd groaning, yelling)</i>

183
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:40,986
I'm very sorry. Godspeed to you all.

184
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:43,491
<i>Man 2: I want my money back!</i>

185
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:45,661
<i>- (grunting)
- (Water splashing)</i>

186
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:58,070
We aren't closing on her!

187
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:04,375
I said to raise all the canvas!

188
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,205
<i>- What's our speed?
- Sails are all raised!</i>

189
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:09,741
No, they're not.

190
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:12,013
Where are my t'gallants
on the main and mizzen?

191
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:13,550
<i>De Groot: Captain, we're fully loaded.</i>

192
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:15,783
If we raise the t'gallants,
the mast won't hold.

193
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:18,352
<i>Man: Stand by to stretch that starboard!</i>

194
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,768
Time.

195
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:33,367
Present speed: six knots.

196
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,301
We need at least another knot
if we're to catch up by dark.

197
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,276
- Raise the t'gallants.
- Captain...

198
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:46,545
Shift aft the back stays if
you're worried about the masts.

199
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,249
Shift 'em to the stern if you have to.

200
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,016
Even if the back stays
hold at such an angle,

201
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:51,981
and I wager they won't,
the load on the sails

202
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,044
will exceed capacity and
she'll dig in hard at the bow.

203
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:55,283
She'll hold.

204
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,651
Hard enough to shake
loose the rigging entirely.

205
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:02,192
Captain, Mr. De Groot makes a good point.

206
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,760
The speed we'll pick up will
come with dire risks for the ship.

207
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,230
But I think she can take it.

208
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:17,101
<i>Mr. De Groot, quickly, please.</i>

209
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:20,137
<i>- Raise the t'gallants!
- Man: Raise the t'gallants!</i>

210
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,949
<i>Man 2: Out of the way!</i>

211
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:30,086
Brace up another five degrees!

212
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:33,053
- Five degrees!
- Five degrees!

213
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,430
Bring her up into it.

214
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:44,902
(wind gusting)

215
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:47,599
(grunting)

216
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,376
More!

217
00:12:57,786 --> 00:13:00,386
Brace up a little more!

218
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:01,555
More!

219
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:05,693
That's well!

220
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:07,863
<i>- That's well.
- Man 2: Hold on!</i>

221
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:14,337
(yells, grunts)

222
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,913
Now bring her up into it.

223
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:28,258
More, damn it. (grunts)

224
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:31,761
Like this!

225
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,863
(yelling)

226
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:46,041
Aye, Captain!

227
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:48,674
There.

228
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:50,409
Hold it there. Hold her tight.

229
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:56,717
Speed! Again, please!

230
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,925
Time!

231
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:03,323
Seven and a half knots!

232
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:06,460
(crew cheering)

233
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:15,834
All right, ladies, get some rest.

234
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:19,504
In a few hours, things are
gonna get awfully interesting.

235
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,652
Good morning, dear.

236
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,492
"Orders from Boston,

237
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:44,827
unbeknownst to me."

238
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:47,259
You sent Bryson away.

239
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:48,500
Yes.

240
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:51,269
You lied to my face, you shit.

241
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:54,204
And what choice did you leave me?

242
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,006
You let Flint seduce you

243
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,913
into his madness about the Spanish galleon

244
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,282
all in furtherance of the fantasy

245
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:04,587
that you can resist English rule,

246
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:09,091
that your authority in this place
is yours to do with as you please.

247
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:11,693
I am more to this place than you ever were.

248
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,028
You are a child.

249
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:17,068
I'm fully aware that Captain Flint

250
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,503
left in pursuit of the
Andromache last night.

251
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,007
But you should know

252
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:24,206
Captain Bryson sailed the Velasco route

253
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,308
for 10 years and was never boarded.

254
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:27,812
Not once.

255
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:33,456
Flint will be returning either
empty-handed or not at all.

256
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,890
This treasure galleon business is over.

257
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:38,226
As for our future here,

258
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,699
I am working on a deal
that'll make a safe place

259
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,734
for us among the farmers in the interior.

260
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,672
- (scoffs)
- When the pirates are gone,

261
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,008
<i>the landowners will drive commerce here.</i>

262
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:49,608
<i>They'll be indispensable to
the lords and to Whitehall,</i>

263
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,146
<i>and so we will make allies of them.</i>

264
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:55,588
We will adapt and we will survive.

265
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:59,624
<i>I won't ask you to walk
out with me right now.</i>

266
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,688
I know your pride would never permit it.

267
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,330
The Barlow cunt who was
supposed to watch over you,

268
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:08,100
that's Flint's problem.

269
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,602
But Scott...

270
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,506
what the fuck did you
have to threaten him with

271
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,075
to get him to betray me?

272
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,782
We talked like men and he saw reason.

273
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:23,017
Fuck you.

274
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:36,367
I been sayin' it. You ain't been listening.

275
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:37,799
And now it's come to pass.

276
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,070
<i>The day that gentleman and his daughter</i>

277
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,070
<i>tell you that the money they took</i>

278
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,070
<i>ain't never coming back.</i>

279
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,008
<i>(crowd yelling)</i>

280
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,649
<i>Lilywhite: Yeah, that
were just fucking theft!</i>

281
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,480
<i>Right now, that little girl</i>

282
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,615
<i>is sitting in there counting your money</i>

283
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,654
<i>and laughing her scrawny ass off</i>

284
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,656
on how much she has
lifted out of your pockets.

285
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,190
This is fucking nuts!

286
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:03,621
- We're not working!
- Good riddance, yeah!

287
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,893
(gasps)

288
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:12,637
I thought my men could help
keep tempers from boiling over,

289
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,468
for a while at least.

290
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,144
But for those owed money out there,

291
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,410
<i>it's only a matter of
time before their tempers</i>

292
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,549
<i>can no longer be held in check.</i>

293
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:25,686
Now, if I may, I suggest an
announcement of payments to settle debts.

294
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,191
The longer it takes them to hear it,

295
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,161
the more fuel Lilywhite
can throw on the fire.

296
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:30,832
I can't pay them all.

297
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,264
You're short?

298
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,337
How short?

299
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:39,569
Well, get out your books, then.

300
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,609
Certain crews may defer
their debts if I ask them.

301
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:46,376
<i>Any leads you have on future
scores would soften the blow.</i>

302
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:48,479
<i>Troublemakers we need
to pay off first...</i>

303
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:49,615
No.

304
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,045
I'm not winding things up here.

305
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:54,886
My business continues.

306
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:00,295
Captain Naft of the Intrepid.
Mr. Walker, her quartermaster.

307
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,261
Captain Lawrence of the
Black Hind and Mr. Harrison.

308
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:06,032
And our friend Mr. Frasier.
Get them all here now.

309
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,435
Miss Guthrie?

310
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:13,142
I'm not sure you recognize
the gravity of this situation.

311
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:17,118
Have a drink. Relax.

312
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,120
Everything's under control.

313
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,194
<i>(crowd yelling)</i>

314
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:24,530
<i>Hamund: She's fucking done!</i>

315
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:27,130
That Guthrie cunt is done.

316
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:32,231
Have you not heard?

317
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:34,029
We've heard.

318
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,300
Well, then what the fuck
are we doing in here?

319
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,067
At the moment, I'm
remembering what it feels like

320
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,435
to have food in my belly.

321
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,002
- Care to join us?
- Jesus, Jack.

322
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:45,005
We're free of her. Free to hunt again.

323
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:47,742
So get off your ass and find us a ship.

324
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:50,549
To assume that we've seen
the last of Eleanor Guthrie

325
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:52,917
is, well, not to know her.

326
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:55,988
The fact that she appears to have Captain
Hornigold and his men propping her up

327
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,419
only adds to my conviction.

328
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,259
Right now, we'd do well
to keep our mouths shut,

329
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,692
be thankful we have some
income from this place,

330
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:04,922
for the moment, and bide our time.

331
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,258
Fuck that.

332
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:09,127
She's got no ships. She's got no business.

333
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,862
That means she's out.

334
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:15,199
And I'm going over there
to make sure she knows it.

335
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,766
Captain?

336
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:23,205
I'll be upstairs.

337
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,921
Well, then, fuck you both.

338
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,784
Who's with me?

339
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:37,883
Nothing can ever be simple.

340
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:40,984
(scoffs) I can make it simple.

341
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:44,552
Darling, this is a lovely stopgap,

342
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,995
but if we are to ever hunt
as a proper crew again,

343
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,267
we will need, well, a crew.

344
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:52,999
Right now, those men are all we have.

345
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:54,432
It's unfortunate, perhaps,

346
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:55,904
but no less a reality.

347
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:01,073
Why don't we take advantage of
Mr. Hamund's momentary distraction

348
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,073
and have Mrs. Mapleton tend
to the whore on the beach?

349
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,777
(drops fork)

350
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:09,478
(scoffs)

351
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:21,046
<i>- Man: Two six!
- Heave!</i>

352
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,782
<i>- Two six!
- Heave!</i>

353
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,517
<i>- Two six!
- Heave!</i>

354
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:27,925
<i>Stand by! Stand by!</i>

355
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,481
<i>(knock on door)</i>

356
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:52,485
Ahem.

357
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:54,420
Yes, Mr. Hayes?

358
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:56,523
<i>Hayes: The Walrus will be
upon us in roughly four hours,</i>

359
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,027
<i>present speed.</i>

360
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,996
I assume preparations have been made.

361
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,700
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

362
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:03,734
And the shipment of china plate?

363
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:06,533
I beg your pardon?

364
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:09,839
We have 70 plates of Chinese
porcelain in the hold,

365
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:13,376
which I have undertaken to
deliver to Boston unharmed.

366
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:18,643
May I suggest more straw in the chest?

367
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:20,880
Yes, sir.

368
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,918
He's certain this is all we have?

369
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,782
We emptied the girl before we careened her.

370
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,983
This is the best I could
do before we set sail.

371
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,719
Same for food and water, I assume?

372
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:35,124
Food, water, powder, all of it.

373
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,557
Right. Take it all up top.

374
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:39,128
No reserves on this one.

375
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:42,233
Either we take Bryson's ship or we're...

376
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:45,674
I believe the word you're
looking for is "fucked."

377
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,010
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah.

378
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:51,672
Dufresne?

379
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,713
You can't be serious.

380
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,014
Andromache's manned like a warship.

381
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:02,823
60 men at least, and they're fighters.

382
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,422
So we'll need every body we can
muster on this one, yours included.

383
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:06,988
Come on.

384
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,490
<i>(birds screeching)</i>

385
00:22:13,563 --> 00:22:15,931

<i>(goats bleating)</i>

Come on, everything's at sixes and sevens

388
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:28,874
back at the house

389
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:30,747
and I have to come and tend to this.

390
00:22:34,412 --> 00:22:36,150
All right. Come on, love.

391
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:38,152
Here we go.

392
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,592
Open your legs.

<i>- (water squirts)

394
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,827
Oh, hush, unless you want to find yourself

395
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,899
carrying one of those fools' brats.

396
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:58,975
<i>- (water squirts)
- Ow!</i>

397
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,709
Get out.

398
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:05,812
(whimpers)

399
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:14,723
She wasn't using enough lotion.

400
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:31,465
<i>- (water squirting softly)
- (Whimpering)</i>

401
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:35,436
You could've left.

402
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,068
<i>(water squirting softly)</i>

403
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:41,244
When that cunt beat Hamund
off of you, you could've left.

404
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:43,044
You didn't.

405
00:23:44,948 --> 00:23:47,482
Thought you could
sweet-talk them all, did ya?

406
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:50,316
What do you care?

407
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:52,554
Once, one of them came and put his balls

408
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,290
on my shoulder whilst I was asleep.

409
00:23:55,355 --> 00:23:57,753
Thought it was funny.

410
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:00,322
Last time he put them anywhere.

411
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:10,293
If you take it, they'll give it.

412
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:14,242
Why do you say these things?

413
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:19,010
You were the one who threw
me to them in the first place.

414
00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:23,481
I only thought they'd kill you.

415
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:35,592
<i>Lilywhite: Do you feel that
soreness between your haunches?</i>

416
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,328
Yeah, well, that's what you get

417
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,957
when you let some cunt
who's never raised a sail,

418
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,629
set foot on a deck tell you your business!

419
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:43,894
<i>(crowd shouting)</i>

420
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,430
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

421
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:46,964
<i>she'll have her boot on your throat</i>

422
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:49,236
<i>and her hand in your fucking pocket.</i>

423
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,542
I think he's talking about you.

424
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:54,142
<i>Lilywhite: That's what you get when
you're letting a wench tell you...</i>

425
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,174
If you're pretending to remain unconcerned

426
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,512
for my peace of mind, please don't.

427
00:24:58,585 --> 00:25:00,721
It amuses me that you think
I would even give a shit

428
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:03,417
<i>- about your peace of mind.
- Silver: Of course.</i>

429
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,992
Still, I don't think you're giving that
problem out there its due attention.

430
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:08,256
<i>(door opens)</i>

431
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:10,456
Naft and Walker just
arrived. That's everyone.

432
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:17,401
You've never seen a mob turn, have you?

433
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,075
<i>Funny thing.</i>

434
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,508
The people most surprised when it happens,

435
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:23,947
usually the ones that gave
rise to it in the first place.

436
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:29,111
Can you join me, please, Captain?
I want you to hear this, too.

437
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:31,111
<i>Hamund: Is the cunt still here?</i>

438
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:33,449
- Out on the street, friend.
- Where is she?

439
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:41,490
It's a rough world out there, isn't it?

440
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,360
Someone opens their mouth,

441
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,095
you can lose everything.

442
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,069
Tell me, lass...

443
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:56,638
how's it feel?

444
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:00,510
Out now.

445
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:04,508
Well, if we're not welcome in here,

446
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:06,675
I suppose we can go spend more time

447
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:08,681
with our friend on the beach.

448
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:10,219
<i>(pirate chuckles)</i>

449
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:13,789
Oh, wonderful lass she is.

450
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,821
So, um...

451
00:26:16,893 --> 00:26:18,356
resilient.

452
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:20,796
<i>(pirates laugh)</i>

453
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:24,167
So appreciative of what she's given.

454
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:28,738
We'll send her your love.

455
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:30,579
(laughs)

456
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:37,613
<i>- Come on, boys.
- (Pirate laughs)</i>

457
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,361
(speaks African dialect)

458
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:49,558
<i>Billy: Gentlemen...</i>

459
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:54,164
I think we all know what
we're up against today,

460
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,765
so let's just get to it.

461
00:26:57,098 --> 00:27:00,095
As we close the distance to the Andromache,

462
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,367
the captain believes
Bryson will attack port

463
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:07,239
and set himself for a
clean broadside volley.

464
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:09,702
He'll loose his guns, pay off downwind,

465
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:10,871
and continue running.

466
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:12,406
Now, ordinarily,

467
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:14,678
we would either match him and return fire

468
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:17,915
or slip into his wake and
make a run at his stern.

469
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:20,618
<i>Unfortunately, we're too
outgunned for the former,</i>

470
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,889
and Bryson is too skilled
a captain for the latter.

471
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:24,457
<i>He'll just keep shooting and delaying</i>

472
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,193
and shooting and delaying until nightfall,

473
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:28,161
at which point he'll just slip away.

474
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:29,329
So...

475
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,895
So, if we can't shoot at her

476
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,429
and we can't get close to her,

477
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:34,860
how the hell do we board her?

478
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:38,230
(murmuring)

479
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:41,269
We go straight at her.

480
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,732
Without the bow chasers, we'll
be sitting ducks for her guns.

481
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:45,434
She'll rake us bow to stern.

482
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:48,203
<i>Logan: Not to mention we'd
be boarding bow to midship.</i>

483
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:49,875
For all you virgins in the room,

484
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,843
that's also known as fucking suicide.

485
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,716
<i>Billy: Of course we'd need
to board alongside her.</i>

486
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:57,978
We just need Captain Bryson to cooperate

487
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,157
and bring the Andromache
about for us to do so.

488
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,023
And how the hell do we get him to do that?

489
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:07,158
Mr. Beauclerc is going to convince him.

490
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,360
(blows)

491
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:27,412
You're a natural, son.

492
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:29,716
When this is all over, I'll
be lucky to still have a job.

493
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:31,083
(laughs)

494
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,079
- What...
- I keep accounts.

495
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:36,717
That's what I'm good at.

496
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:40,147
Do you see this number here?

497
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,045
That's how much I've saved
this crew this last year alone.

498
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:44,813
Can you say of any other man here

499
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:46,421
that they've earned as much?

500
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:49,387
Every man on this crew had a first time.

501
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:50,785
You're overdue.

502
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,656
But I've never even shot a pistol.

503
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:54,586
Well, that's all right.

504
00:28:54,658 --> 00:28:57,190
Half the time they don't even fire.

505
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:04,889
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:11,834
Time has come for us to tell those who aim

507
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:14,171
<i>- to make us slaves.
- (Knock on door)</i>

508
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,675
<i>Woman: Mr. Rackham asked me to tend to you.</i>

509
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:20,507
<i>Lilywhite: Yeah, well, that's what you get.</i>

510
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:27,284
He said I wasn't to take no for an answer.

511
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:36,057
They're saying she may be finished.

512
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,489
She's finally got her due.

513
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:43,267
All I meant is that...

514
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:46,772
that it should please
you after what she did.

515
00:29:46,837 --> 00:29:51,343
You hate her. I hate her.

516
00:29:51,408 --> 00:29:53,143
They all hate her.

517
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:57,181
Look what's good it's done us.

518
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:02,990
No captain on this island's
ever known that kind of power.

519
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:06,527
Power that doesn't care how
many votes you can tally,

520
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,463
who loves you, who hates you,

521
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:12,463
who fears you.

522
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:14,737
Power that just is.

523
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:16,903
Truth is,

524
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:20,271
none of us have any
right to hate her for it.

525
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:25,446
She's strong and we're weak.

526
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,447
That's the reality of things here.

527
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:35,025
And no one down there is strong
enough to change anything.

528
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,890
<i>Not you?</i>

529
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,234
You're not strong enough?

530
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:49,077
I don't know.

531
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,740
But I think it's time I probably found out.

532
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:56,713
(creaking)

533
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:14,289
What if he's wrong?

534
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:16,956
There's a chance Bryson just
keeps running, isn't there?

535
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:21,125
- That's it, steady.
- Right?

536
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,724
<i>Bryson could still gain speed.</i>

537
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:26,027
I mean, there has to be a chance

538
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,027
this fight will never materialize.

539
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,933
Come on.

540
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:32,502
Come on, you bitch.

541
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:34,470
Come on.

542
00:31:42,978 --> 00:31:45,081
There she goes!

543
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:49,782
(crew shouting)

544
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:52,812
Why isn't he attacking?

545
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:56,286
Because he knows he'll
never board us if he does.

546
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:59,090
I will say this for him. He's no coward.

547
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,900
200 yards, you may fire at will.

548
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:10,606
(shouting)

549
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:17,980
I don't think I can do this.

550
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:19,347
Yes, you can.

551
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,217
Listen. Listen to me.

552
00:32:24,282 --> 00:32:26,290
You will make it through this.

553
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:29,092
No one eats it their
first time over the side.

554
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:31,230
I'm telling you, it's never
happened. Not on this crew.

555
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,368
Don't ask me why, it just is.

556
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,201
Men die all the time. It can't be true.

557
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:37,569
No, not first-timers.

558
00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:39,505
Name one.

559
00:32:41,674 --> 00:32:43,208
You're gonna be all right.

560
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,480
Come on.

561
00:32:46,545 --> 00:32:48,113
Damn it.

562
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,623
I hope you know what you're doing.

563
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,318
So do I.

564
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:03,000
Mr. Beauclerc? Range?

565
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,462
Almost there!

566
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:08,271
50 more yards, Captain!

567
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,272
Fire!

568
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:20,038

<i>- Get 'em back!

576

577
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:41,070
Aye. Mr. Beauclerc!

578
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,044
- Two six!
- Heave!

579
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,412
- Two six!
- Heave!

580
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:53,612
Hayes, another volley right away!

581
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,380
Right cannon round!

582
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:58,116
Mr. Burnett, prepare to bear
away and bring us into the wind.

583
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:01,787
Man the braces!

584
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:03,586

before we lose the wind!

589

- Aye, sir!

590
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:45,146
Fire.

No fucking longer!

626
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:13,078
Gentlemen, you all heard
my father this morning,

627
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,111
that the Guthrie trading
operation here in Nassau is dead.

628
00:39:17,246 --> 00:39:19,411
<i>To that, I just
have this to add...</i>

629
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:21,884
fuck him and fuck that.

630
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:27,323
Mr. Frasier, you hold a charter from the
Massachusetts Bay Provincial Authority

631
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:29,629
to ship rare items abroad, is that correct?

632
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:31,896
That's correct, yes.

633
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,334
And, theoretically, that
charter should pass muster

634
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:36,467
at any customshouse in the colonies, yes?

635
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:40,168
Well, I suppose so, but...

636
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:43,369
Gentlemen, by my count,

637
00:39:43,434 --> 00:39:45,274
the Black Hind and the Intrepid

638
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,947
have accumulated prizes
totaling approximately

639
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,285
1,600 pieces of eight since the new year.

640
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,188
That's gross. That's both ships.

641
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:57,358
That barely exceeds your
operating costs over the same time.

642
00:39:57,423 --> 00:39:59,023
If you brought us
here to insult us...

643
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,062
It's not an insult, it's a fact.

644
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:03,892
You command the two least
profitable ships on the island

645
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:05,659
as a function of basic arithmetic.

646
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,232
But they are ships, and large ones at that.

647
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:13,296
At this table, we have a legitimate front.

648
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,838
We have ships and crews
that can ferry heavy cargo.

649
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:19,604
We have relationships with
the merchants and customs men

650
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:21,372
that kept my father's trade moving.

651
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:23,204
Your father said he'll take
no part in any further...

652
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:25,403
They're my relationships now.

653
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:32,008
We're going to recreate
my father's system here...

654
00:40:32,082 --> 00:40:34,680
without my father.

655
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:37,681
A consortium, with all of
you sharing in the profits.

656
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:43,994
- You're mad.
- How so?

657
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,261
My men aren't merchant sailors.

658
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,462
They're hunters.

659
00:40:47,535 --> 00:40:50,237
Yes, but they're bad at it, Geoffrey.

660
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:51,566
What good is that doing anyone?

661
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,375
I put this to them, they'll vote me out

662
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,776
before I stop to take a breath.

663
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,714
I'm amazed they haven't
voted you out already,

664
00:40:56,779 --> 00:40:59,281
given the shit prizes you've been chasing.

665
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:01,984
Your men will earn three times
as much in half the time...

666
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:05,720
- (scoffs)
- Not facing a single sword or pistol in the process.

667
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:07,489
You're telling me that you can't sell that?

668
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:09,455
I can sell that.

669
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:14,425
(sighs)

670
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:17,328
And you're supporting this?

671
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:23,474
I don't know. Am I?

672
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:24,843
None of this matters

673
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:27,179
unless we can get people
to agree to sell through us.

674
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:30,720
We need a respected captain
to stand up and bless it.

675
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:34,514
And we need a strong captain to
ensure that no one dares fuck with us.

676
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:35,985
You're both.

677
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,858
You know that I want nothing more

678
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,964
than to make this place strong and stable.

679
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:46,532
I think you want the same things.

680
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:48,966
Bless this endeavor and we can have them.

681
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:51,936
I'll do that...

682
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:56,178
the moment you lift
the ban on Captain Vane.

683
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,116
- Excuse me?
- Listen to that mob outside.

684
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:02,556
They're tired of your
edicts, your rule by fear.

685
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,629
They believe you to be
a tyrant in a petticoat.

686
00:42:05,694 --> 00:42:09,197
Your action against Captain Vane
is, to them, the most egregious case.

687
00:42:09,262 --> 00:42:10,398
You want me to lift the ban on Charles Vane

688
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:12,368
to appease a handful of
malcontents on the street?

689
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:14,705
Those malcontents will be a
problem to anyone in this room

690
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,705
who stands behind you today.

691
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:19,115
<i>Provocation, even sabotage.</i>

692
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,251
And then you'll ask my men to assume

693
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:23,550
the responsibility of
defending all of you from it.

694
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:26,159
Charles Vane is an animal, as
are the men that remain with him.

695
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:28,095
Because they saw fit to
punish a thieving whore.

696
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,391
I'm not about to say otherwise for
the benefit of Captain Lilywhite

697
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,262
or any of the other idiots
out there listening to him.

698
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:34,231
I'm listening to him.

699
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,071
Your commitment to this place is admirable,

700
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:43,441
but you're young and you're rash.

701
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:46,010
<i>Show everyone your motive
here is for the common good.</i>

702
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:48,251
Show them that you can be trusted

703
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,526
to keep petty animosity
separate from business.

704
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:55,461
Rescind the ban on Captain
Vane and show me that.

705
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:58,260
Do it and I'll back you as
your father's successor here,

706
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,702
the boss behind all trade.

707
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:03,766
<i>Until then, I'm sorry. I can't help you.</i>

708
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,134
I won't do it.

709
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,280
You have until dark to come to your senses.

710
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:12,975
At that point, I will withdraw my men

711
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:16,218
<i>and the business of the street
becomes your business alone.</i>

712
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:20,355
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

713
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:35,995
Ah!

714
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:38,973
<i>- Man: Oh, no! Get down!
- (Explosion)</i>

715
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:40,470
<i>(men yell)</i>

716
00:44:08,102 --> 00:44:10,103
<i>Man: Take this.</i>

717
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:11,767
Checked all the dead and injured.

718
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,843
None of them are Bryson.

719
00:44:13,908 --> 00:44:16,550
He only left three men to
defend the quarterdeck bunker.

720
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:18,581
How does that make sense?

721
00:44:18,654 --> 00:44:21,718
<i>Gates: The vanguard are on their
way to clear the cargo hold.</i>

722
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:24,788
<i>Maybe Bryson is hiding down there.</i>

723
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:26,588
Something's not right.

724
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:29,564
Captain, the rudder's not responding.

725
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:32,225
Someone must've cut the
mechanism below decks.

726
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,329
Call back the vanguard.

727
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:43,304
- (gunfire)
- (All yell)

728
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,149
<i>- (labored breathing)
- (Metal squeaking)</i>

729
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:04,826
Three men dead on their end, Captain.

730
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:08,302
<i>Perhaps it's time we sent them our terms.</i>

731
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:54,403
I do apologize for this.

732
00:45:56,108 --> 00:45:59,877
<i>Mr. Guthrie's orders were explicit.</i>

733
00:45:59,942 --> 00:46:03,781
No matter what, I was to make
sure that you were on this ship.

734
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,885
This was not the deal.

735
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,021
(chuckles)

736
00:46:08,086 --> 00:46:11,651
Assist the Andromache to depart unmolested

737
00:46:11,724 --> 00:46:13,227
<i>and you can remain with the girl</i>

738
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:15,891
<i>and pick up the pieces
and explain yourself.</i>

739
00:46:17,563 --> 00:46:21,362
<i>Mr. Scott, you sided with
his daughter against him.</i>

740
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:23,666
You forgot your duty.

741
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:26,065
You must have known there
would be consequences.

742
00:46:28,373 --> 00:46:32,216
But we men of duty must often
put our feelings aside...

743
00:46:33,385 --> 00:46:35,383
as you're about to witness.

744
00:46:38,788 --> 00:46:40,762
(speaks West African Pidgin English)

745
00:46:48,297 --> 00:46:51,734
Do it.

746
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:53,733
(groans)

747
00:46:57,673 --> 00:47:02,347
- And this one?
- (Speaks West African Pidgin English)

748
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:18,096
<i>(door opens)</i>

749
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,708
<i>(crowd chanting)</i>

750
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:33,817
At the risk of overstepping my bounds,

751
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:36,490
<i>I think you should agree to
Captain Hornigold's terms.</i>

752
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,851
Lift the ban. What
do you care about...

753
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:43,524
They're beating her.

754
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,294
She chose it.

755
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:49,903
(scoffs) "She chose it"?

756
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:53,240
"She chose it."

757
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:55,179
I've been repeating those words to myself

758
00:47:55,244 --> 00:47:58,749
for well over a week now
and I find them wanting.

759
00:47:58,814 --> 00:48:01,854
Now he asks me to back off Charles,

760
00:48:01,919 --> 00:48:05,024
to proclaim to the world that
what happened to Max is acceptable,

761
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:08,158
to apologize to those animals
for having ever said otherwise,

762
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:10,228
and smile while they lord it over me.

763
00:48:10,293 --> 00:48:13,992
To make a dangerous situation
a lot less dangerous.

764
00:48:16,191 --> 00:48:18,325
Then convince me.

765
00:48:20,294 --> 00:48:23,331
Convince me that I should
betray her a second time...

766
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,932
because that's what it
feels like I would be doing.

767
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:33,007
Max chose.

768
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,615
Why? I don't know.

769
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,859
Maybe it was spite, maybe it was strength,

770
00:48:40,924 --> 00:48:43,394
maybe it was who the fuck knows what.

771
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:45,887
To be perfectly honest, I don't care

772
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,894
because the moment I start making choices

773
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,759
based on her decisions,

774
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:52,327
I've given her a hell of a
lot more power over my life

775
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,135
than I am quite comfortable
ceding to a perfect stranger.

776
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,365
Guilt is natural.

777
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:05,908
It also goes away if you let it.

778
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:10,245
<i>Losing your life's work...</i>

779
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,779
<i>that doesn't go away.</i>

780
00:49:14,348 --> 00:49:16,886
- Lilywhite: No fucking longer!
- (Cheering)

781
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,125
Captain?

782
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,788
Charles?

783
00:49:22,861 --> 00:49:27,291
Do I understand correctly
that you've requested a skiff?

784
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,467
I suppose that's none of my business,

785
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:33,636
but you do realize that we
may be able to hunt again soon.

786
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:36,037
What I'm hearing is all
second and thirdhand,

787
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,775
but something is happening in that tavern.

788
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:43,249
Our problem isn't in there.

789
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,018
Never was.

790
00:49:49,228 --> 00:49:51,460
What the hell are you talking about?

791
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:53,629
Chaz?

792
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,935
Where are you going?

793
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:07,502
Where is he?

794
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:09,070
<i>Gates: He's in a reinforced hold</i>

795
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:10,573
<i>directly beneath us here.</i>

796
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:12,508
<i>Forward end of the lower gundeck.</i>

797
00:50:12,573 --> 00:50:16,212
Doors as thick as the
outer hull, as is the roof.

798
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:18,213
Impossible to breach from here.

799
00:50:18,286 --> 00:50:21,179
<i>He's also sitting right in
front of a powder magazine,</i>

800
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,251
<i>so if we try to blow our way through,</i>

801
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:25,755
<i>this whole ship is going down fast.</i>

802
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,322
Unless we can find a way in,

803
00:50:27,387 --> 00:50:29,424
there's no way to get
the guns off the boat.

804
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:32,559
<i>Anybody we send down there is
just gonna get cut to shreds.</i>

805
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:35,662
And we cannot sail.

806
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:37,260
And we cannot sail.

807
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:40,563
It doesn't make sense.

808
00:50:43,268 --> 00:50:45,236
If Bryson wants to force us to withdraw,

809
00:50:45,301 --> 00:50:48,203
what's to stop me from
burning the ship once we leave?

810
00:50:51,342 --> 00:50:53,477
We're missing something.

811
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,716
<i>- (wood creaking)
- (Lamps creaking)</i>

812
00:51:06,793 --> 00:51:08,496
There you are.

813
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:12,570
Been looking all over for you.

814
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:15,234
Thought I'd get a head start
going through Bryson's papers.

815
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:21,445
Jameson.

816
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,115
Beg your pardon?

817
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,379
You said no man ever died
his first time over the side,

818
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:30,254
but you forgot about Tom Jameson,

819
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,293
boatswain's mate, about two years back.

820
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,126
That's right.

821
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:39,665
Also Christian Thoms,
Will Robbins, Jean DuBois,

822
00:51:39,738 --> 00:51:41,734
that Portuguese
guy with the lisp...

823
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,331
what was his name?

824
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:46,571
- That is funny.
- (Chuckles)

825
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,111
Thank you...

826
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:50,605
for doing that.

827
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:54,303
It helped.

828
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:56,438
(pats back)

829
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:06,885
Miranda Barlow?

830

<i>Man: Away from the hatch!</i>

831
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:16,959

00:52:30,688 --> 00:52:32,383

833
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:38,193
Captain Flint.

834
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:51,740
(speaks African dialect)

835
00:52:51,813 --> 00:52:55,814
He says, "I'm secure in the hold below."

836
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:59,720
<i>(man speaking African dialect)</i>

837
00:53:02,256 --> 00:53:07,060
"With 20 of my men. I
can wait, but you cannot."

838
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:09,461
(speaking African dialect)

839
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:16,304
"Before departing,"

840
00:53:16,376 --> 00:53:19,546
I sent a message to the
captain of the Scarborough.

841
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:21,779
I told him where I was headed,

842
00:53:21,852 --> 00:53:24,850
"and I told him where he would find you."

843
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,784
<i>Man: Sail to the east!</i>

844
00:53:31,824 --> 00:53:33,825
Good God.

845
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,794
<i>The Scarborough!</i>
