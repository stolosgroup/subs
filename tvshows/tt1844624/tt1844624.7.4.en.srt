1
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:04,487
  It's 6:30 on election night,

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:05,921
      and, as you can see,

3
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,924
    the turnout looks to be
           historic.

4
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:10,026
The post-work rush
has begun in earnest.

5
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:12,261
       Will the blue wall
     of Michigan, Wisconsin

6
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:13,963
and Pennsylvania stand tonight?

7
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:16,866
   The smart money says yes,
     even though it appears

8
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:18,567
in early exit polling
that turnout

9
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:20,770
   in the more traditionally
      Democratic counties,

10
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:23,773
   such as Wayne and Genesee,
    seems lower than usual.

11
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:26,776
 One thing that's certainly not
  low on either side tonight:

12
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:30,212
            passion.
       Back to you, Bob.

13
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:31,948
         That was good,
  but let's do one more time.

14
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,549
      I forgot to mention
        Saginaw County.

15
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,151
        RJ: Honestly, I wouldn't
                bother. Bob says

16
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:37,887
he doesn't think he's gonna use
    any cutaways or bumpers

17
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:39,422
             during the election
               coverage tonight.
   Well, then what the fuck

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,257
        am I doing here?
   Why didn't anyone tell me?

19
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,725
       Something wrong, Beverly?

20
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:44,393
Eat shit, Serena.

21
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,562
Well, aren't you a nasty woman?

22
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:47,830
Have you voted yet?

23
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:49,065
I have to jump the line

24
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:50,833
and pull the lever for HRC.

25
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:53,836
Bob asked me to sit in on the
coverage desk with him tonight.

26
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:55,905
     What the hell you know
        about politics?

27
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,940
  You were in the damn traffic
  copter until two months ago.

28
00:00:57,942 --> 00:00:59,275
How about you stop being

29
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:00,443
one of those women that needs

30
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:01,677
to drag down successful women

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,512
in order to feel good
about herself?

32
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,017
       It's my turn now.

33
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,685
           Excuse me.

34
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:12,922
             ALLY:
        <i> Madam President.</i>

35
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:15,291
           (chuckles)
And in our lifetime.

36
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:18,928
          (chanting):
     This pussy grabs back.
     This pussy grabs back.

37
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,796
      This pussy grabs...
           Keep it down, ladies.

38
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,199
Down with the patriarchy.

39
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:27,036
      (chanting resumes):
     This pussy grabs back.
     This pussy grabs back.

40
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:30,272
  Look at this mess of humanity.

41
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:32,775
   Don't you think people should
  have to pass some sort of test

42
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:34,377
      to earn the right to vote?

43
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,945
Do you think you'd pass it?

44
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:37,980
                  Of course not.
                That's my point.

45
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:39,482
       I mean, who am I to vote?

46
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,817
         I can see me voting for
        the Emmys or the Globes,

47
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,022
     but I'm not nearly informed
   enough to pick our president.

48
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,656
              IVY:
           <i> Remember,</i>

49
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:49,825
            no funny business or
      protest votes or anything.

50
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,227
Honey, don't worry.

51
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,063
I want to be part of history,
just like you do.

57
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:16,612
            KAI: Out of the way.
         Thank you.

58
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,813
        Hi.
                             Hi.

59
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,148
    This man needs to vote.

60
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,717
            Let's go.
Sure. I need his...

61
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:25,221
Oh, my God.
He needs a doctor.

62
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:27,790
  My name is Gary K. Longstreet.

63
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,392
     This is my polling station,
        and I will cast my vote!

64
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,994
Okay. Okay.

65
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:33,529
       Come on! This man
      has a right to vote!
(gasps)

66
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:41,237

70
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,230
              Yes.

71
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,268
            (grunts)

72
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,273
  Welcome to Trump's America,
         motherfuckers!

BOB (on TV):<i> Just one day since</i>
  <i> election day, and it's still</i>

76
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:31,947
       <i> stunning to watch.</i>

77
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,215
                            Kai?
Hey.

78
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,516
           Hey. Harrison Wilton.

79
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:35,851
                They assigned me
             to be your trainer.

80
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,720
I requested you.
                         Really?

81
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:39,855
Yes.
            Wow. That's awesome.
       Did someone recommend me?

82
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,857
No. No, I-I saw you
out on the gym floor.

83
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,259
You look strong.

84
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,860
                   Oh, cool.

85
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,895
              But, I mean, there
           are bigger guys here,

86
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,931
           if that's the kind of
     workout you're looking for.

87
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,566
No, no, no.
Don't get me wrong.

88
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,635
I mean, you could move
a dead body if you had to.

89
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:54,169
I just meant you look...

90
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,207
     ...strong.

91
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:02,778
                     Okay. Well,
             thank you. (laughs)

92
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,246
         So, uh, I like to start

93
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:05,948
                by asking people
           what their goals are.

94
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,350
    World domination.

95
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:12,788
            (grunts)

96
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,292
             I'm really grateful
               you requested me.

97
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,726
                   Three clients
                dropped me today

98
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,296
        because of post-election
               economic anxiety.

99
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,897
So, what flavor of gay are you?

100
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,899
                    Uh...

101
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,902
              Versatile.

102
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,504
            Are you gay?

103
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:33,142
       See, this is what
       I'm talking about.

104
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,810
            Labels.

105
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,679
"Diversity" starts
with D-I-V,

106
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,947
 which is also the first three
      letters of "divide."

107
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,483
  Gay, bisexual, transgender--

108
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,652
        these are labels
    created by the leftists.

109
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,089
They want to split us apart,
create special interest groups

110
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,692
  that put themselves over the
 greater good of the community.

111
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,495
      A man with no label

112
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,165
       has an allegiance
     only to what is right.

113
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,134
                         Wow.

114
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:01,503
  You're a lot smarter than most
  of the guys that come in here.

115
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,106
Yeah.
                    What kind of
                 work do you do?

116
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:07,109
       Computers. Coding.

117
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,378
      I guess they call us
      app developers now.

118
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,213
I dig it. It lets me
work from home.

119
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:15,351
 Honestly, money's never really
         been my thing.

120
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:18,354
 (grunts) I was kind of a freak
       when I was a kid.

121
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,522
I tested at a
genius level at ten.

122
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,524
I was invited to
join Mensa at 14.

123
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,560
   Right now, I'm mostly just
      focused on politics.

124
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,862
       Changing the world
       and all that shit.

125
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,698
   Trying not to be intimidated.

126
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,067
That's normal.

127
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,069
            (grunts)

128
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:38,173
    Listen... I like pussy.

129
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,709
But if someone
is in my life,

130
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,478
man or woman,

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,315
 and they're a part of my crew,
       one of my people,

132
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:48,717
     I will fight for them.

133
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,387
     I will kill for them.
            (grunts)

134
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,255
(panting)
                       I got it.

135
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:54,990
And if they wake up
in the morning

136
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:56,692
with a hard-on
that won't quit,

137
00:07:56,694 --> 00:08:00,329
I will find a way to make sure
they know how much I love them.

138
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,599
               (chuckles softly)

139
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:05,267
Same time tomorrow?

140
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,336
               (laughing):
                  Yeah.

141
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:10,072
                 Hey, dudes. You
            getting a good pump?

142
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:13,375
       Remember my motto:
      go heavy or go home.

143
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,878
        Did you come up
      with that yourself?

144
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,379
I've heard it before,
but not in any

145
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,881
  official capacity, you know?

146
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:20,849
     When you're done here,
    clean-up in aisle four.

147
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:22,351
         Oh, come on, man. Can't
           someone else do that?

148
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:23,786
                      One of the
               maintenance guys?

149
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,421
No can do, compadre.

150
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,923
     I just canned half of them.
          No more undocumenteds.

151
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,426
     Welcome to the N.W.O.
                 HARRISON: Well,
                   I don't care.

152
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,861
 Get one of the other trainers
           to do it.

153
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:36,265
          Just put on

154
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,435
     some rubber gloves, do what
   I tell you, shut the fuck up.

155
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:40,936
                      Good talk.

156
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,107
What's clean-up
aisle four?

157
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:48,811
         Uh, sometimes guys jerk
          off in the steam room,

158
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:52,448
              and someone has to
             hose down the jizz.

159
00:08:54,718 --> 00:08:56,452
He makes you do that
'cause you're gay?

160
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:59,488
      That's humiliating.

161
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,459
       Story of my life.

162
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,395
                  Tomorrow.

163
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,334
            (sighs)

164
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,711
            (sighs)

165
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,483
        (water spraying)

166
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,326
         (thud nearby)

167
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:41,330
             Hello?

168
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,553
         (door closes)

169
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:06,622
(faucet turns on, water running)

170
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:12,561
        (moaning nearby)

171
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,936
    (water running, moaning)

172
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:27,042
(loud moaning)

173
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,878
(moaning)

174
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,620
I'll clean that up myself.

175
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,061
        (bird squawking)

176
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:53,669
       REPORTER (on TV):
   <i> Protests grow against the</i>

  Hey, girl. What's the latest

180
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,413
     travesty in Trumpland?

181
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,381
            MEADOW:
 Something about the son-in-law

182
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:08,617
              trying to oust the
            fat guy from Jersey.

183
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:11,186
       I mean, I guess it's some
    kind of revenge for his dad.

184
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:13,622
I don't know. The whole thing is
   just like a bad reality show.

185
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:16,458
Yeah. Let's turn it off.

186
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,294
I'd rather get drunk and binge
<i>Million Dollar Listing.</i>

190
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,868
            Meadow?

191
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,671
Hey, what's wrong, hon?

192
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,776
                    I messed up.

195
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,290
HARRISON:
What?

196
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,692
    Oh, my God. The bank is
       foreclosing on us?

197
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,729
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
                         (sighs)

198
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:55,263
    How long have you known
          about this?

199
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,332
That says we need to be
out of here in three days.

200
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,801
   I didn't want to cause you
          any stress.

201
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,903
(loudly): They're going to evict
      us from the house, Meadow.

202
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,505
    When were you gonna tell me,
       when the sheriff was here

203
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:06,675
                to throw us out?

204
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,243
   How the hell did this happen?

205
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:10,112
                You said we were
                on solid ground.

206
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:12,581
       Well, it can't be
    that much of a surprise.

207
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,949
                 Our mortgage is

208
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,117
        $1,500 a month.

209
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,184
  We're not bringing enough in

210
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,753
     on your income alone.

211
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:20,022
      My income? So you're
       blaming it on me?

212
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,523
     No, no, no, you handle
       the money, Meadow.

213
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:22,624
    This is all your fault.

214
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,526
         It's my fault?

215
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,495
         It's my fault
      that I got melanoma

216
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,030
  and had to go on disability?

217
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:29,598
                   It's my fault

218
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,366
   that you guilt-tripped me

219
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:33,101
       into taking a job
        at a craft store

220
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:35,837
       where the manager
      sexually harassed me

221
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,006
 every day until I had to quit?

222
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,475
   That's my fault, Harrison?

223
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:41,777
                         (sighs)

224
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:49,451
         Jesus Christ,
    we're gonna be homeless.

225
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,119
                 Listen, I don't
                need this house,

226
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:53,655
     and I don't need any of the
        things in it, all right?

227
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:57,893
           All I need is you and
         a decent cable package.

228
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:08,136
         (Meadow moans)

229
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:16,111
        No.

230
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,320
I mean, how many times
has that ever worked for you?

231
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:27,889
Five? Six times max?

232
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,459
                          Twice.

233
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,499
Hey, Eeyore, is that your client
        over there on leg press?

234
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:41,837
   He signed up for 12 sessions.
           This is his last one.

235
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,772
            You should have been
     upselling two sessions ago.

236
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,440
            That's anticipation.

237
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:48,043
       Now, you got to actualize
           another sale tonight,

238
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,711
            or you're out a job.

239
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:52,080
Come on, Vinny. This is
a really bad time for me.

240
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,983
            Go heavy or go home.

241
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:00,021
                  (sighs)

242
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,526
                        Kai.

243
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,228
              Hey.

244
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,897
         Oh, you know what? Move
    your left heel a little bit.

245
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,365
              It'll give you the
              correct alignment.

246
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,733
                   There you go.

247
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:13,602
              Better?
Excellent.

248
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,570
You're killing it.
You're killing it!

249
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:19,141
Hey, can I show you
something? Look at this.

250
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:20,642
                This is you when
               we first started.

251
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,878
Can you believe that? I can
already see a ton of changes.

252
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,547
More definition
in your pecs, biceps, triceps.

253
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,616
Look at your abs.

254
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,051
(laughing):
And those chicken legs.

255
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,490
       Why are you talking to me
      like that douchebag Vinny?

256
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,925
          No, I'm not.

257
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:38,493
   I'm just being optimistic.

258
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,495
        Live happiness,
       spread happiness.

259
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,402
            (sighs)

260
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,739
    I'm done, Kai.

261
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:53,175
The bank foreclosed.

262
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:58,580
I lost my house. Every cent
I have is in that house.

263
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:00,982
Building equity--
it's a lie.

264
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,952
Now all my shit is packed
in a U-Haul trailer.

265
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,855
            (sighs)

266
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:09,291
I don't know what to do.

267
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:11,693
I don't know where to go.

268
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:14,596
I'm nothing.

269
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:16,765
            Nowhere.

270
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,735
     That's the first thing
    you have to understand.

271
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,040
Nowhere is a great place to be.

272
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:29,010
    That means the shackles have
      fallen off your shoulders.

273
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,446
                You're free. You
                can be anything,

274
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:35,050
               take any path, do
              whatever you want.

275
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:40,322
You're the only thing
that keeps me going.

276
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,324
You are. You're optimistic
and you're positive

277
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:44,626
and you're transformative
and I'm not.

278
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,032
 Harrison... I'm just a mirror.

279
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,469
                Anything you see
                in me is in you.

280
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:58,940
                       I<i> am</i> you.

281
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:03,011
      And if I say you're great,

282
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:05,080
              then you're great.

283
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,116
           I'm great.

284
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:11,720
            (sighs)

285
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,388
    I'm great.

286
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,223
                (sighs)

287
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,660
      You have to live your life
     the way it was meant to be.

288
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:23,398
           To live is to suffer,

289
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,402
   and to suffer is to find some
      meaning in that suffering.

290
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:33,241
              Do you understand?

291
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,212
Yeah, I think so.

292
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:38,914
             Good.

293
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,616
Clean-up in aisle four.

294
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:47,656
        (water hissing)

295
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,798
  (fingers squeaking on wall)

296
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,734
           He's humiliating you.

297
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:03,371
              You deserve better
                  in this world.

298
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,740
              Yup.

299
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:09,044
             You want to change,
         but you don't know how.

300
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,847
        (hissing stops)

301
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,052
             Yeah.

302
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,487
         What do I do?

303
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:23,425
Take my power in both your hands

304
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:25,460
         and get your life back.

305
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,064
           I can feel your pain.
         I know it cripples you,

306
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,598
    but pain can be a motivator.

307
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,267
       Pain is a call to action.

308
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:36,004
              Pain is essential,
             just like anger is.

309
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:38,907
           Take pain in one hand
         and anger in the other.

310
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,442
         (claps loudly)

311
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:42,243
                       Use them.

312
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:46,915
   Tell him you won't be treated
           like a human cum mop.

313
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,351
                     Better yet,

314
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:51,252
            show him.

315
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:59,227
    (metal clangs on floor)

316
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:02,230
   (gloves smack onto floor)

317
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,008
           (groaning)

318
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,043
           (inhales)

319
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,778
            (groans)

320
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,314
I want you to feel the pain.

321
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:22,717
           (groaning)

322
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:26,187
     You faggot, I'm gonna
       fucking kill you!

323
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,789
                      (groaning)
(panting)

324
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,724
(groans)
              (guttural gasping)

325
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:32,027
               (coughs, wheezes)

326
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,561
             Do it.

327
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:36,164
                 (loud groaning)
           Show him!

328
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,033
     Show him what it means
           to suffer.
(high-pitched gasp)

329
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,568
              (guttural gasping)
(yelling)

330
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,972
         (bones crunch)
    (Harrison pants loudly)

331
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:46,074
          Oh, my God.
          Oh, my God.

332
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:49,244
          Oh. Oh. Oh.

333
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:51,980
(panting)

334
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:54,416
                     You did it.

335
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:57,485
       You've changed your life.

336
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,121
               I'm proud to call
                  you my friend.

337
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:04,559
  (Vinny gasps for air loudly)

338
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,095
           (coughing)

339
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,997
                 (deep wheezing)

340
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,932
        Finish him off.

341
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,902
(Vinny wheezing)

342
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:17,839
                      (wheezing)

343
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:21,176
           (panting)

344
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:24,279
       (groans, exhales)

345
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,949
            (yells)

346
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:30,752
     I'm a murderer. Fuck!

347
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:33,221
I murdered someone!

348
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,856
I'm going to jail forever!

349
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,892
    Do you understand? Shit!

350
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,462
      What am I gonna do?
    What am I gonna do when

351
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:42,931
he doesn't show up
here tomorrow?

352
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,799
       This is his phone.

353
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,402
   I'm sending a text to all
  of his friends and employees

354
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:50,371
 telling them he's gonna be out
   of town for an emergency.

355
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:51,773
         (phone chimes)

356
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,209
         (phone buzzes,
        Harrison gasps)

357
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:58,146
   Oh, my God, I just got it.

358
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:00,949
         (keyboard keys
       clacking rapidly)

359
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:04,085
           Oh, fuck.

360
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,821
Fuck! The security cameras!

361
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:08,656
Everything we did
was recorded!

362
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:11,059
Looks like the last three weeks
    of surveillance footage

363
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:12,961
        just got erased
      by a computer virus.

364
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,629
            Vinny shouldn't have
            been looking at porn

365
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,465
           while he was at work.

366
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,069
What about his family?

367
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:23,771
      He doesn't have any.

368
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:25,940
   No wife, no kids, no pets.

369
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,643
   How do you know all this?

370
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:32,580
            (sighs)

371
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,649
I've been watching you
and the people around you

372
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,152
for a long time.

373
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,092
How did you know that I...?

374
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:46,127
               Stop questioning.

375
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,196
                  The only thing
                 that matters is

376
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:50,665
                 that you took a
             step to be someone.

377
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,200
            (sighs)

378
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:55,603
                You're a part of
                something bigly.

379
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:58,439
     We are gonna wipe out
      everything you know

380
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:01,342
   and build something bigger
           and better

381
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,913
         than anything
   you can possibly imagine.

382
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,851
       Do you believe me?

383
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,458
    Now, put on the gloves.

384
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,494
      We have to take care
          of the body.

385
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:22,230
         (dog barking,
         siren wailing)

386
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,732
(man coughs,
laughs)

387
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:29,671
          Hey. Can I take a hit?

388
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:31,406
        I ran out of my Xannies,

389
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,142
          and I could really use
 something to take the edge off.

390
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:35,877
        Get out of here.

391
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:39,247
                       I'll fuck
                     you for it.

392
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,549
                  I don't have a
              ton of experience,

393
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,852
            but I make up for it
                with enthusiasm.

394
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:47,355
Here, just take it.

395
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:49,123
                         Thanks.

396
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,334
       (door creaks open)

397
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:03,504
KAI:
You're making this more
difficult than it needs to be.

398
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:07,075
Just sever the atlanto-occipital
joint, twist the head

399
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,911
             and pull, and it'll
                  pop right off.

400
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:18,486
       Just when I think
  my life can't get any worse.

401
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,023
       (inhales sharply)

402
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:24,592
          Who's that?

403
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,262
            My boss.

404
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,598
Who's that?

405
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,605
     Someone to believe in.

406
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:48,483
  (vehicle beeps rhythmically)

407
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,790
Christ, what a stink.

408
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,226
How long this body
been here, anyway?

409
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:00,595
I mean,
it's a landfill, Beverly.

410
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:03,531
           Shut the fuck up, RJ.
 I know it's a goddamn landfill.

411
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,635
               I swear, I've had
                   it up to here

412
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,338
    with these end-of-the-stick,
               shit assignments.

413
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,775
   You think Bob would ever send
       Serena to a goddamn dump?

414
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:15,777
          Where the hell is that
            bitch today, anyway?

415
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,178
         Reflexology--

416
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,180
      how the ancient arts
        of the Far East

417
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:21,616
 are fast becoming the hippest
     trends in the Midwest.

418
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:24,152
 Part two in my six-part series
            tonight.

419
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,087
            (moans)
     RJ:<i> I don't know what</i>
   <i> you're complaining about.</i>

420
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:27,455
     <i> This is the real news.</i>

421
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:29,090
All Serena does
is fluff.

422
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:31,092
               Fluff gets you to
               the anchor chair,

423
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:35,263
             not chemical spills
            and headless torsos.

424
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:38,166
RJ:
Damn!

425
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,469
            BEVERLY:
       <i> Police are saying</i>

426
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:44,272
 they believe the victim to be
  a white male in his mid-30s,

427
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:46,808
based on the well-muscled torso
          found here.

428
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,310
 The search for the man's head
    continues at this hour,

429
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:51,779
  but given that both the head
    and hands were removed,

430
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:54,182
      likely in an attempt
   to prevent identification,

431
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,783
  authorities are not hopeful.

432
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:58,119
         Reporting live
  from the Hoyt Area Landfill,

433
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:00,355
     this is Beverly Hope.

434
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,190
      A disturbing story,

435
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,959
and one I know you'll be keeping
        a close eye on.

436
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,661
 And, on a more personal note,
            Beverly,

437
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,296
        I'd like to say
      from all of us here,

438
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:11,399
  it's great to have you back
    in the field this month.

439
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:13,201
   Just wouldn't be Christmas
          without you.

440
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,635
  It's great to be back, Bob.

441
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,104
            (clicks)

442
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:19,407
  It's great to be back, Bob.

  <i> It's great to be back, Bob.</i>

 "It's great to be back, Bob"?

448
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,686
        Where were you?

449

     (eerie music playing)

450
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:22,069

You feel that?

514
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,342

              yet?

516
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:46,514

Yeah, ab-about that.

518
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,018
I'm gonna need you to cut
a minute out of your piece.

That's a report on the ten most
  dangerous parts of Michigan.

    If I cut a minute, there
  will only be time for seven.

Then cut 30 more seconds and
make it five dangerous places.

522
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:01,862
I need more time
for Serena's wine tasting piece.

        That's not news!

524

People don't want news
right now.

525
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,969
They want to be distracted
from the news.

526
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:09,971
     Sucking dick is no way
 to build a career, sweetheart.

527
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:12,039
                      All right,
                  that's enough.

528
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,242
You're already
on very thin ice, Beverly.

529

I could've canned you
when you went batshit

530
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:19,480

bin. I would've canned you

531
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:22,116
already if HR
wasn't worried you'd sue.

532
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,686
You cannot fire me. I'm the only
    black reporter you have.

533
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:28,823
You think you can't be replaced?

534
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:31,559
Cut the shit.
Cut that minute out.

535
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,395
      (door opens, shuts)

536
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:36,397
 You can say whatever you want
         to me, bitch,

537
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,499
       but I am gonna be
   on<i> The Today Show</i> one day.

538
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:41,435
And I don't care how many dicks
I have to suck to get there.

539
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:42,903
'Kay?

540
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:45,406
          (door shuts)

541
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:49,443
         (air hissing)

542
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:51,579
                      Hey there.
            (gasps)

543
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:53,914
       If you really want
     to trash those tires,

544
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,751
  you have to slash 'em closer
        to the sidewall.

545
00:28:56,753 --> 00:29:00,655
Do I look like I'm looking
for fucking advice, asshole?

546
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,490
        (knife slashes)

547
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:06,060
         (air hissing)
 Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

548
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:14,802
        Did it feel good
     to slash those tires?

549
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:18,039
        'Course it did.

550
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,641
    Aren't you more curious
   about why I was doing it?

551
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:23,377
  The specifics don't matter.

552
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:24,979
I know why.

553
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:28,549
      The world is set up
        to humiliate us.

554
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:30,785
     And someone like you,
         a black woman?

555
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:32,453
You have it the worst.

556
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:35,222
On the one side, you have people
saying, "Diversity hire,

557
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:37,358
affirmative action.
She doesn't deserve that."

558
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,659
  And then on the other side,
           they say,

559
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:40,061
       "Well, she's just
       as good as we are.

560
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:42,363
   She just got a raw deal."

561
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,432
     But then they don't do
       shit to square it.

562
00:29:45,568 --> 00:29:47,802
  I'm fine with a rigged game.

563
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:50,404
   Knowing the game is rigged
        isn't worth shit

564
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:52,306
if you're still willing
to sit at the table

565
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,542
and play with those bastards.

566
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:57,311
        Slashing tires?

567
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:59,480
         You should be
      pulling out a knife

568
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:01,749
       and slashing their
        fucking throats.

569
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,052
                           Okay.

570
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,822
Another tough-talking white boy.

571
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:11,492
The world has become tiny,

572
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:14,662
which means the fear in
a small town in Michigan

573
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:18,699
    can infect the country,
    the world in a few days.

574
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:21,402
Now, fear, fear
isn't like a virus.

575
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:26,507
When fear finds more hosts,
it gets stronger, scarier.

576
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:29,376
The tiny fear in one woman
turns into a beast

577
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,178
that swallows the world
by the time

578
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,781
it spreads
across the country.

579
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:40,588
 Great men and women have been
   weaponizing fear forever,

580
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,457
 but what all those men had...

581
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,960
     was a great messenger.

582
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:48,796
Someone with a pulpit
and a microphone.

583
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,732
Someone to give
that fear a name.

584
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:54,468
   Believe me, Beverly Hope.

585
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,404
           If you get
    the world scared enough,

586
00:30:57,406 --> 00:31:00,708
    they will set the world
        on fire for us.

587
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,310
          Who are you?

588
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:05,412
       I'm Kai Anderson.

589
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,148
       I'm 30 years old.

590
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,483
       I was in the army.
    I served a tour in Iraq,

591
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:11,285
    came home and graduated
       in three from Yale

592
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,754
with a double degree in poli sci
     and feminist studies.

593
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:15,489
I have a brown belt in karate,
I have a 135 IQ,

594
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,491
        and I'm running
       for city council.

595
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,594
                   First of all,

596
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:23,130
         there are no open seats
            on the city council.

597
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,566
      Second, you're planning on
            dominating the world

598
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:28,235
       from a city council seat.

599
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:30,171
                  More bullshit.

600
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:32,273
          City council
     is just the beginning.

601
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:34,809
Then it's state senate,
then Congress.

602
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,977
   Followers in the millions,
       tens of millions.

603
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:41,081
   And then, as we have seen,

604
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,517
     anything is possible.

605
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,453
I need you, Beverly.

606
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:48,455
You and me.

607
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:51,091
          Equal power.

608
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,129
    I'm not just tough talk.

609
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:57,031
          Believe me.

610
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,467
            Why me?

611
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:04,038
   Because I've watched you.

612
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,873
        And you have<i> it.</i>

613
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,642
             Rage.

614
00:32:08,644 --> 00:32:11,212
It defines you.

615
00:32:11,214 --> 00:32:13,480
Like no one I've ever seen.

616
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:15,850
 Tell me what that feels like.

617
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,557
      It's not like anger.

618
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,326
      Everyone feels that.

619
00:32:25,328 --> 00:32:27,394
                   It feels like
                   wanting to be

620
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:30,464
    the last person on Earth

621
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:34,301
 because, that way, you got to
watch every other son of a bitch

622
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:36,036
        die before you.

623
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:38,672
       I want to believe

624
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:40,541
    there's someone like you
           out there

625
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,711
        looking to smash
   this shit show to pieces,

626
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,547
          but I can't.

627
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,884
    I don't believe in you,
           or anyone.

628
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,319
        Not even myself.

629
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,337
      This is the address
     to my campaign office.

630
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:15,009
  I'll see you in a few days.

631
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:19,914
Thank you.

632
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,459
             Here?
            Let's go camera left

633
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:34,962
                    so I can get
           the sign in the shot.

634
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:36,730
  People want to see my face,
      not some stupid sign

635
00:33:36,732 --> 00:33:38,799
       that says exactly
      what I'm gonna say.

636
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:40,467
              Okay, that's fine.

637
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:41,735
                   And remember,
             it's just pre-tape,

638
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:43,103
              so if you fuck up,
                     start over.

639
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,238
I'm always letter-perfect,
dickwad.

640
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,473
     You should know that.

641
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:48,709
            (sighs)

642
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:49,944
   Where's the goddamn puppy?

643
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,645
               Box by your foot.

644
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:54,148
        (puppy whining)

645
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,416
    Okay. This thing smells
           like shit.

646
00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:56,917
I'm not holding that turd ball.

647
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,219
  (sighs) They want to see you
      cuddle with the dog

648
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:00,821
         to get people to adopt.

649
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:03,457
         Fuck my life.

650
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,659
         (puppy whines)

651
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:08,662
       Don't piss on me.
             (beep)

652
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,464
         Okay, rolling.

653
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:12,466
          Look alive.

654
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:15,135
          Thanks, Bob.
  I'm here at Collingwood Park

655
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,237
  with a preview of tomorrow's
       Brookfield Heights

656
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,340
Rescue League Adoption Jamboree.

657
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:22,476
There'll be food, music and fun,
     all starting at noon.

658
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,979
Now, everyone is welcome,
and I've been told

659
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,648
   there will be celebrities
  on hand to sign autographs.

660
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,684
 But the real star of the show?
    Our four-legged friends.

661
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:33,620
  They've all had their shots,
they've been spayed or neutered,

662
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:37,091
and they're all ready to go home
      to a loving family.

663
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:41,095
       Oh, it looks like
      we have some clowns

664
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:42,930
 who are desperate for airtime.

665
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:44,465
   Uh, miss, are you excited
         to be part of

666
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:46,200
   tomorrow's entertainment?

667
00:34:46,202 --> 00:34:49,103
          (grunts, then screams)

668
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:50,971
            (grunts)

669
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:53,374
                 (groans, yells)

670
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:55,042
        (grunts, groans)

671
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,414
           (grunting)

672
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:24,905
   These are really... good.

673
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:29,243
    You have a real talent.

674
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:30,744
            Really?

675
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:32,079
                     Yeah.

676
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:35,382
Well, I wanted to be
a painter, but...

677
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:39,787
I was too drawn to the normalcy
of a middle class lifestyle.

678
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,560
                   You're a real
                 artist, Meadow.

679
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,564
      These mask sketches,

680
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,267
            genius.

681
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:55,269
       And we need them.

682
00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:57,004
            (door opens)
BEVERLY:
Kai?

683
00:35:58,274 --> 00:35:59,606
              Yes.

684
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,843
(panting)

685
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:04,678
 Did you do that?

686
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,548
    They won't air the tape,
         but I saw it.

687
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,752
       I saw the violence
         and the anger.

688
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,690
          It was you.

689
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:20,561
         Yes, Beverly.

690
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:22,362
       Without apologies.

691
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:23,864
       Why?

692
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,599
            For you.

693
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:29,937
               I did it for you.

694
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,873
                     So that you
                  would believe.

695
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:37,111
              I will do anything
               for you, Beverly.

696
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,281
       I believe in you.

697
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,054
I believe in you, too, Beverly.

698
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:58,832
        (Beverly sighs)

699
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:06,340
                    Equal power?

700
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:11,578
          Equal power.

701
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:19,486
        (siren blaring)
     Police are questioning
        the inhabitants

702
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,956
  of this homeless encampment
 under the Maple Avenue Bridge

703
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:26,426
 after the horrifying discovery
    of a severed head here.

704
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:29,997
     Medical examiners have
     identified the victim

705
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,866
      as local gym manager
        Vincenzo Ravoli.

706
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:36,503
 Police arrived after receiving
    an anonymous phone tip.

707
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:39,306
    While not yet confirmed,
        sources believe

708
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:42,276
 it was the body of Mr. Ravoli
         that was found

709
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:45,479
   at the Hoyt Area Landfill
           last week.

710
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:47,114
     An innocent man dead.

711
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:51,952
 The sprawl of crime and decay
    devouring our community.

712
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:54,621
  Our local government turning
          a blind eye.

713
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:57,324
     Are our children safe
      to walk the streets?

714
00:37:57,326 --> 00:38:00,561
     How much carnage must
     we, the people, endure

715
00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:03,463
 before we finally say enough?

716
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:06,633
     <i> This is Beverly Hope.</i>
       <i> Bob, back to you.</i>

717
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:17,077
 You have to come with me, Ally.
      This is way too important.

718
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,812
Sweetie, it's the day
before the election.

719
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,547
What difference is
a rally gonna make?

720
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,984
           The man bragged about
         sexual assault on tape,

721
00:38:23,986 --> 00:38:26,019
  and the polls have tightened--
    this isn't like other years.

722
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:29,690
Her lead is outside the margin
of error. Michigan is a lock.

723
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:30,857
              No, it's that kind
        of thinking that's gonna

724
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:32,059
       hand this thing to Trump.

725
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,694
                   W-Why are you
                being like this?

726
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:35,896
                  It's historic.
        The first two presidents

727
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,332
     our son will remember
     are black and female.

728
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:40,234
      Don't you want to be
        a part of that?
Yes,

729
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,936
     I do, but it's just...
she acts as if it's owed to her.

730
00:38:42,938 --> 00:38:44,438
  What does she even believe?

731
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Then I see someone
like Jill Stein,

732
00:38:46,442 --> 00:38:48,375
pushing for green energy,
labeling GMOs,

733
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,944
       against the DAPL.

734
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:52,412
 Don't be one of those people.

735
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,248
     Remember what happened
      with Nader in 2000.

736
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,284
     Honey, I swear to you,
     if I thought Trump had

737
00:38:57,286 --> 00:39:00,921
  a chance in hell of winning,
  I wouldn't even consider it.

738
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:05,292
He's a reality-TV star,

739
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:06,860
     for God's sake, honey.

740
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:08,362
    It's never gonna happen.
          (door opens)

741
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:13,900
       GROUP (chanting):
   Lock her up! Lock her up!

742
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:17,304
  Lock her up! Lock her up...

743
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:24,177
  Lock her up! Lock her up...
      (chanting continues)

744
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:28,949
       Love trumps hate!

745
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:32,319
What about Trump's tax returns?
Huh? What's he afraid we'll see?

746
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:33,987
   They don't want to engage.

747
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,256
    They just want to spread
          negativity.

748
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:38,091
      Hey, Hillary started
         the negativity

749
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:39,960
       when she called us
         "deplorables."

750
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,795
    She wasn't talking about
          all of you.

751
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,998
She was talking about the
bigots-- your side has a few.

752
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,435
   I am so sick of you people
      looking down on us.

753
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:49,836
        It really pisses me off.

754
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:51,571
   No, you're pissed because

755
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,340
     an educated black man
ran the country for eight years,

756
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:55,108
 and a woman's about to run it
        for eight more.

757
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:58,478
      You know, this is why real
   Americans hate the Democrats.

758
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,247
   Because you treat us all like

759
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:03,150
      we're wife-beating,
       redneck Klansmen.

760
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:05,619
That makes it okay to vote
for a man who brags about

761
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,421
      walking up to women
  and grabbing their pussies?

762
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,656
   Well, maybe you could use
    a little pussy grabbing,

763
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,625
     you elitist, PC bitch.

764
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:14,161
   Hey! You do not touch her.

765
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:18,265
               I didn't do shit.
I saw what you did.
Someone call the police.

766
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,000
That pig just sexually assaulted
          this woman.

767
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,302
  Get back here, you asshole.

768
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:26,506
    SECOND GROUP (chanting):
       Love trumps hate!
      Love trumps hate...

769
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,475
        (engine revving)

770
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:32,212
       (tires screeching,
        engine revving)

771
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:36,783
       Love trumps hate!
      Love trumps hate...

772
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:38,785
      (chanting continues)

773
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,187
                         WINTER:
                            Hey.

774
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:42,155
                   Are you okay?

775
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:45,125
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

776
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:48,962
Um, thank you f...
for defending me.

777
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:51,231
           Didn't have a choice.

778
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:55,001
     We can't let pieces of shit
    like him think this is okay.

779
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:57,204
                 Are you hungry?

780
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,639
                     I'm hungry.
               Screw this rally.

781
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:00,841
            Let's get some food.

782
00:41:00,843 --> 00:41:03,410
             Yeah.

783
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:06,012
           Um, okay.

784
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:07,714
        I know a place.

785
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,716
             GROUP:
      Love trumps hate...

786
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,552
    Wow, you own this place?

787
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,821
       You're incredible.

788
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:17,724
           (scoffs):
    My wife would disagree.

789
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,159
   Then why are you with her?

790
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:24,765
           (chuckles)
         You're young.

791
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:26,566
     Endless possibilities.

792
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,336
    So, um, what do you want
     to do with your life?

793
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:31,571
Easy. I'm gonna be
Huma Abedin.

794
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:34,007
Behind the scenes, right
next to a powerful person,

795
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:35,609
pushing them to greatness.

796
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:41,314
   Where's a powerful person
       when you need one?

797
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:47,254
 Oh, God, I hate this feeling.

798
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:50,056
            (sighs):
         I'm so angry.
Good.

799
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:53,360
           Get angry.
    That man assaulted you.

800
00:41:53,362 --> 00:41:55,695
      He's lucky I didn't
         tase his ass.

801
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:58,265
I always carry one with me
now that colleges have become

802
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,634
super rape-happy.
                I always thought
                I was a fighter.

803
00:42:00,636 --> 00:42:02,068
               I mean, I came up

804
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,737
        in the restaurant world.

805
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:07,274
   I'm well-versed in the art
     of misogyny, but I...

806
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:10,944
   I can't believe that when
 it mattered the most, I froze.

807
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:14,381
   I let that guy violate me
     and get away with it.

808
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:16,383
 Don't be so hard on yourself.

809
00:42:16,385 --> 00:42:18,385
     There's a lot of crazy
           right now.

810
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:20,287
I mean, Trump and those
dickfaces feel like they can

811
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,555
get away with anything.

812
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:22,989
This is not normal.

813
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:25,292
        Men always think

814
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,427
they can get away with anything.

815
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:29,229
       Because they have.

816
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:30,664
               Everything's been
                 handed to them.

817
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,299
  And it's still never enough.

818
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,835
     I mean, all I hear are
   white dudes bitching about

819
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:37,437
 unfair entitlements for women
        and minorities,

820
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,139
      and<i> they're</i> the ones
      who've been entitled

821
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,474
  since the beginning of time.

822
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,750
           I can close up, Gary.
                You're the boss.

823
00:42:50,752 --> 00:42:52,185
              You shouldn't have
                   to stay late.

824
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:54,454
Shirley, this is my baby.
Go home to yours.

825
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:57,491
    Spend some quality time,
      and say hi to Frank.

826
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:03,697
         (bell chimes)
        Oh, don't forget
       to vote tomorrow.

827
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:06,166
           (laughs):
    Are you kidding? This is
   the chance of a lifetime.

828
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:09,269
I get to bring the country
back from the cliff

829
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:12,172
  and return it to the promise
        that is America.

830
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,040
(chuckles)
I wouldn't miss it

831
00:43:14,042 --> 00:43:17,177
         for the world.
                          Night.

832
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:21,515
       (doors squeaking)

833
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:23,517
     (lights powering down)

834
00:43:25,787 --> 00:43:29,356
     (easy-listening music
plays quietly in the background)

835
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:31,958
      (lock snaps, echoes)

836
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:46,940
        Can I help you?

837
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:49,309
Ma'am?

838
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:50,677
        What are you doing here?

839
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,013
                   We're closed.
I saw the sign

840
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:54,681
 for this place on your truck.

841
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:58,818
       I need some tape,
 but there are so many choices.

842
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,587
                What do you want
                  to use it for?

843
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:02,188
      To tie somebody up.

844
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:04,891
(grunts, electricity crackling)

845
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:08,261
            (grunts)

846
00:44:10,265 --> 00:44:12,432
       This should work.

847
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,213
            (gasps)

848
00:44:27,215 --> 00:44:29,282
      If you manage to get
      your right arm free,

849
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:31,051
  here's some food and drink.

850
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,886
GARY: What do you want?
Money?

851
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:34,454
Kidnapping's a federal offense.

852
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:36,389
     We don't want anything
           from you.

853
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:38,124
          In 24 hours,

854
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:40,594
we'll call the police
and tell them your location.

855
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,529
By then, the election
will be over.

856
00:44:42,531 --> 00:44:45,465
       The world is about
        to change, Gary.

857
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:47,267
 For the first time in history,

858
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,869
        a woman will be
    your commander in chief.

859
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:52,205
      It'll never happen!
                       Get woke!

860
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:54,774
     People like you don't
     deserve to have a say.

861
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,776
   You don't matter anymore.

862
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,879
    Fuck you! And fuck you!
           Let me go.

863
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:01,715
  Consider yourself silenced,
             bitch.

864
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:03,717
      (muffled screaming)

865
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:08,455
       (door slams shut)

866
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:11,057
 (muffled screaming continues)

867
00:45:12,594 --> 00:45:15,128
         (bird hoots)

868
00:45:36,585 --> 00:45:39,052
       (door creaks shut)

869
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:00,006
            (gasps)

870
00:46:02,444 --> 00:46:03,977
KAI:
Is that blood?

871
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:05,845
(gasps)

872
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:17,157
                What did you do?

873
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,528
I hurt someone.

874
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,596
        How did it feel?

875
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:32,806
   It felt fucking fantastic.

876
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:41,481
      Tell me everything.

877
00:46:41,483 --> 00:46:44,050
             Help!

878
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,553
           Help! Hey!

879
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:49,389
                     KAI: No one
                   can hear you.

880
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:52,325
  Except maybe some crackheads
        and gangbangers.

881
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:55,395
  Although, in the predicament
           you're in,

882
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:57,564
         I don't think
      you'd want them to.

883
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,265
        Get me out of here, man.

884
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:00,567
      Have the polls closed yet?

885
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:03,269
       In about an hour.

886
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:05,572
      Get me out of here.
        I need to vote!

887
00:47:06,608 --> 00:47:09,676
          These fucking bitches!

888
00:47:09,678 --> 00:47:11,277
             They chained me up.

889
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:13,079
            You're gonna have to
           cut through the pole,

890
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:15,115
              and then maybe saw
          through the handcuffs.

891
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:18,284
          I have tools
      at my grocery store.

892
00:47:21,623 --> 00:47:23,189
        I brought this.

893
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:25,492
      That's not gonna cut
      through these cuffs.

894
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,765
         Are you nuts?

895
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:34,834
            (sighs)

896
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:42,909
       For eight years...

897
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:44,978
they've been telling you there's
    something wrong with you

898
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,115
  for being a straight, white,
          working man.

899
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,284
Longer than that, probably.

900
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:54,554
You work hard, you like
American beer and<i> pussy!</i>

901
00:47:54,556 --> 00:47:56,556
                     Fuck, yeah!
 And they laugh at you for it.

902
00:47:56,558 --> 00:47:58,291
They punish you,
humiliate you!
                           Yeah.

903
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,726
They call you impotent.

904
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:02,162
 Samantha Bee, Rachel Maddow--

905
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:03,730
   how those fucking bitches
           mock you!

906
00:48:03,732 --> 00:48:05,865
                    (whimpering)
                           Yeah.

907
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:11,237
Listen.
Here's your chance, Gary.

908
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:13,306
Today is your chance to stick it

909
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:15,175
right in
their fucking eyes.
                         Uh-huh.

910
00:48:15,177 --> 00:48:17,610
To step into
the voters box...
                         Mm-hmm.

911
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:21,447
and pull the lever
for "go fuck yourselves."
                           Yeah.

912
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:24,083
It might be the last chance
you ever get, so I ask you...

913
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:26,653
                    (whimpering)

914
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:28,955
...what is that worth to you?

915
00:48:28,957 --> 00:48:33,393
What would you give
for the chance to do that?

916
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,830
How humiliated are you?

917
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,698
           (weakly):
          Yeah. Yeah.

918
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,000
            (crying)

919
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,303
                        (grunts)

920
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:44,737
           (screams)

921
00:48:47,943 --> 00:48:49,776
        Give me the saw.

922
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:57,116
          (breathing unsteadily)

923
00:48:58,787 --> 00:49:00,153
            (crying)

924
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:03,122
           (grunting)

925
00:49:03,124 --> 00:49:04,524
            (groans)

926
00:49:07,963 --> 00:49:10,864
            (gasps)

927
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,732
            (crying)

928
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:20,240
              (grunting, crying)

929
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:26,279
                       (yelling)

930
00:49:31,253 --> 00:49:32,852
            Are you gonna watch?

931
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:34,988
       If you don't mind.

932
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,028
                      (muffled):
                   One... two...

933
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,764
                          three!

934
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:48,434
          (screaming)

935
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:53,306
    (screaming continues)

935
00:49:54,305 --> 00:50:54,856
