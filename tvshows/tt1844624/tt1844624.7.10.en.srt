1
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:05,695
Trump: If Russia and the United
States got along well

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,986
- and went after ISIS...
- (laughing)

3
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:09,833
I wonder if this is how
black people felt

4
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:11,348
when Obama became president.

5
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:14,222
I know it's super not Vassar
or PC to say this,

6
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:17,007
but I think Hillary is
even more important than Obama.

7
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,642
The fight for civil rights

8
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:19,988
lasted a couple of
hundred years.

9
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:24,014
The fight for female equality
lasted, like... thousands.

10
00:00:24,116 --> 00:00:25,368
WINTER:
I guess you're right.

11
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:27,597
Black men did get the right
to vote before women did.

12
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:29,179
- DOROTHY: Yeah, right?
- HILLARY: Well, that's because

13
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:31,688
- he'd rather have a puppet as president...
- (laughter)

14
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,856
RILEY:
Oh, my God.

15
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,825
- You're the puppet.
- Oh, my God.

16
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:37,027
(laughing)

17
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:39,996
There's no way
people are buying this shit.

18
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:41,898
I'm telling you,
she's gonna flip Texas

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,900
and maybe even Arizona.

20
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,603
It's gonna be the biggest loss
in electoral college history.

21
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:49,005
- TRUMP: ...nuclear warheads...
- KAI: Want to bet?

22
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,741
I'll bet.

23
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,236
If Trump wins, you can fuck
all three of us.

24
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:56,409
- Riley, gross.
- It's never gonna happen.

25
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,573
You guys don't see it.

26
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:59,307
Your precious Obummer
has shielded you

27
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:00,907
from what's really going on
out there.

28
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:02,719
WINTER:
Right. Economic anxiety,

29
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,954
aka racism.

30
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,990
People hate her.

31
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,992
She's weak.

32
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:10,594
Remember what happened
a few weeks ago

33
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,497
at the 9/11 memorial ceremony?

34
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,180
She had to be carried to a car.

35
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,632
Everyone knows
it's early onset Parkinson's.

36
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,014
They hate
the sound of her voice,

37
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:18,947
they hate the fact that
she can't satisfy her husband.

38
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,971
The world isn't this
progressive, happy place

39
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:22,380
you think it is, okay?

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,874
People tolerated the black guy,

41
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:25,400
but nobody wants
a woman president.

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,928
Not even other women.

43
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,175
Who told you that?

44
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:31,014
Your 4chan Pepe
frog-fucking buddies?

45
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:32,116
In between exchanging

46
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:34,055
pictures of dead people
and shit porn?

47
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:36,003
You win if people
turn out to vote.

48
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,989
And nobody is turning out
for that shrill, cuck bitch.

49
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,809
Have you seen Trump's rallies?
The passion?

50
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,262
The passion of
the angry white man.

51
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:46,390
- Boo-fucking-hoo for you.
- That's right!

52
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:49,015
We've been humiliated
and put down for too long.

53
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,263
Trump is one of us!

54
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,801
We will stand out bleeding

55
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,637
in the rain and snow
to vote for him.

56
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:58,485
It is all about shame and
humiliation for you assholes.

57
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:00,249
You know, we should start
some sort of, like,

58
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:03,546
government program to get you
all laid so you'll shut up.

59
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,593
Yeah, you probably wouldn't even
need to get fucked.

60
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:08,171
Just some pretty girl
smiling at you,

61
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,031
telling you
how important you are.

62
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:14,199
You ever notice how all
the alt-righters are young men?

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,975
- And none of them have girlfriends?
- (laughing)

64
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,535
Hey, Winter, uh,
give me some lotion.

65
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,456
I'm gonna give your brother
a handy, so...

66
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:21,798
Kai!

67
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,767
What the fuck, Kai?

68
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:25,835
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

69
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,515
- (sobbing)
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

70
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,905
Are you okay?

71
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,540
- Are you all right?
- (gasps)

72
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:34,711
I am pressing charges!
I am pressing charges!

73
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,016
- You really did it now, Kai.
- (door slams)

74
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,097
After all the shitty things
you've done,

75
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:44,046
you finally crossed the line.

76
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:49,659
HILLARY: But he also went after
a disabled reporter...

WOMAN: It's a statue
of the goddess Anat,

80
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:07,877
the ancient Semitic goddess
of love and war.

81
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,602
There's a tale told
that a man slighted her.

82
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,901
And so she took a sickle
and cut him in two,

83
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:16,332
and scattered his pieces in the
fields to be eaten by the birds.

84
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:17,930
(whistles)

85
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:20,001
You're basically telling me
chicks have been overreacting

86
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,725
since the beginning of time.

87
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,661
- (pen clicks)
- Do you know why you're here?

88
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,798
My sister's friend got mouthy,

89
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
so I got a little too physical
with her,

90
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,230
and they ordered me to take
anger management classes

91
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,805
as part of my probation.

92
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:38,302
You think it's okay
to put your hands on a woman?

93
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:43,013
They're the ones always yapping
about equality.

94
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,811
I was just treating her the way
I would have treated a man

95
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:45,696
talking to me like that.

96
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:46,816
It was a political act.

97
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,886
A blow struck
for women's liberation!

98
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,828
Are you familiar with the work
of Valerie Solanas?

99
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,664
Is that the lead singer
of The Motels?

100
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:05,635
I see boys like you
all the time.

101
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,637
Not quite men.

102
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,906
Angry, lonely, hard up.

103
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:12,976
You want me to understand
that I'm not special.

104
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,744
Too late.

105
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,410
The world beat you to it.

106
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,981
But you are special.

107
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,453
You're different
from the others.

108
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:20,645
You're smarter.

109
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:24,788
And you have a certain
untapped charisma.

110
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:28,825
Have you ever considered
politics?

111
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:31,895
I mean, not until recently.

112
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,002
You think if I had
a purpose like that,

113
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,497
it would make me less angry?

114
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:43,073
I think if you had a purpose,
you could change the world.

115
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:48,404
I'm an old-school, OG feminist.

116
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:53,650
And do you know who my favorite
politician of all time is?

117
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,752
Donald J. Trump.

118
00:04:55,854 --> 00:05:01,524
For thousands of years,
mankind has built civilization

119
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:06,286
with a single intention:
to keep woman contained.

120
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:11,534
Face down, ass up. Compliant.

121
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:16,940
Donald Trump cannot tie his
dick-tripping ties correctly,

122
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,741
but Hillary gets attacked

123
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:23,546
for her goddamn hideous
St. John pantsuits.

124
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:25,108
And with every catcall,

125
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,884
every put-down, every slap

126
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:30,620
and pass-over at work,

127
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:33,890
the anger compounds.

128
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:37,944
As the orgasm inequality builds,
so does the rage.

129
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:44,934
We are sitting on the biggest
bomb the universe has ever seen.

130
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:47,142
Do you know what it is,
Mr. Anderson?

131
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,607
Female rage.

132
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:53,676
The patriarchy has dammed it up
for millennia,

133
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:57,196
and Donald J. Trump
is the first world leader

134
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,028
to start hammering away
at that dam.

135
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,025
With every tweet,

136
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:03,462
with every eye-roll,

137
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:06,133
every pussy grabbed,

138
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:10,493
he is slowly releasing the fury.

139
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,764
It's beautiful.

140
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,933
And do you see how you...

141
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:22,236
smart, charismatic, angry,
woman-hating Kai Anderson...

142
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:24,874
need to take your own hammer
to that dam?

143
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:26,479
How you must be the spear

144
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:32,015
for that movement because
you are so very, very special?

145
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,886
Is that my purpose?

146
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,025
Repeat after me.

147
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,995
I am a turd.

148
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:48,932
A lowly, abject turd.

149
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,099
I'm a turd.

150
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:55,510
A lowly, abject turd.

151
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,165
From this moment on,

152
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,786
you have but one purpose:

153
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,679
to release the feminine rage

154
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,847
and to use all your skills

155
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,686
and passion and vision
to break that dam to pieces.

156
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:11,754
But what will happen to me?

157
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:14,023
You will drown in it,
dearest heart.

158
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:18,546
You and every other man.

159
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:22,498
But you will die knowing
that you have saved us all.

160
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,701
And you'll be famous for it.

161
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:26,677
A legend.

162
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:29,906
Someday, there'll be
a tiny statue of you

163
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:31,908
in someone's office.

164
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,948
Do you see your purpose now,
Kai?

165
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,751
What you have been chosen
and put on this earth to do?

166
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,082
The women of the world
are waiting for you,

167
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:47,624
legs spread, on their backs.

168
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,792
Impregnate them.

169
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:52,762
Help them give birth
to their rage.

- (applause)
- WOMAN: Can you see this?

174
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,154
Can you see what the fuck
is happening?

175
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:09,534
This is an outrage.

176
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:11,554
This is America, people.

177
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,355
I'm at Bennett Park,

178
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,524
where my kid brother just had
his birthday party.

179
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,359
And right there on the pavilion

180
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,595
is this fuckwad,
city-council Nazi.

181
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:20,859
The guy who's always surrounded

182
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,803
by his group of male
militia thugs.

183
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:25,634
This is the guy who tried
to restrict the Internet!

184
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,670
Where are you?

185
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,405
Where are you?!

186
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:32,308
- (cheering)
- WOMAN: No Nazi! No KKK!

187
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,511
No fascist U.S.A.!
No Nazi! No...

188
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:36,779
Listen, everybody.

189
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:40,316
Most of you are here
to listen to common sense.

190
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:42,563
- Yeah!
- And that is absolutely lacking from Washington.

191
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:45,354
- SUPPORTERS: Yeah!
- Especially in our representation,

192
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,623
Senator Herbert Jackson.

193
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:49,592
- (booing)
- I mean, we got to talk about

194
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:51,776
some of this guy's
extreme positions. Anti-life?

195
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:55,698
This man is for third-trimester
abortions, people.

196
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,466
(booing)

197
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:58,879
And some of you might be saying
it's too early

198
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:01,111
to start talking about
an election two years away.

199
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,539
Well, it is never too early

200
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:06,375
to start the work
of saving our great country!

201
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:07,710
- (cheers)
- Yes! Yeah!

202
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:10,446
KAI:
I am the agent of change,

203
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:12,548
and this is the beginning
of our campaign together.

204
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,717
SUPPORTERS:
Yeah!

205
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:17,879
The globalists and the elitists
and the cosmopolitans

206
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,733
are so afraid of the truth
that they don't want

207
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:20,757
anybody else to hear it.

208
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,691
That is un-American.

209
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:24,627
- Yeah!
- We fought wars

210
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:26,287
against the fascists
for our rights,

211
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,664
- and we will fight them now to keep them.
- Yeah!

212
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:31,097
- This is our town!
- Our town!

213
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,242
- Our state!
- Our state!

214
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:36,639
- Our country!
- Our country!

215
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:39,408
(chanting): No fascists! No
hate! No fascists! No hate!

216
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,610
- No fascists! No hate!
- Hey! Hey!

217
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:45,481
No fascists! No hate!
No fascists! No hate!

218
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,827
- No fascists! No hate!
- Fascists go home!

219
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:48,684
GARY:
Who the fuck are these assholes?

220
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:50,686
We're all over social media.

221
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:52,969
- The message is getting out that...
- Wake up, Speedwagon!

222
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:54,901
Now that we're taking aim
at one of the Washington elite,

223
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,765
they're using their levers
of power against us.

224
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,627
I'm telling you,
it's the goddamn Feds.

225
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:00,674
They hate me and they are
agitating the opposition.

226
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:02,908
- You see that? Don't look.
- SPEEDWAGON: The white van?

227
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,733
They're undercover,
recording everything.

228
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,636
But they would never
lift a finger to stop them!

229
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:10,472
(chanting):
Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!

230
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,808
Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!

231
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,677
What are you so afraid of?

232
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,859
Are you afraid that you'll
actually change your mind?

233
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:17,914
You know what's a shame?

234
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,373
It's a shame that
in our constitutional democracy,

235
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:21,895
- we are not able to ha...
- (feedback squeals)

236
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,819
(unamplified):
...to have civil liberties

237
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:25,688
like the First Amendment!

238
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:29,525
It's goddamn piss!

239
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:31,393
- They're throwing piss!
- We should go.

240
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:32,661
We should get out of here.

241
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:35,364
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fascists go home!

242
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:36,677
No, I'm not letting
these asswipes

243
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:37,781
run me out of my own rally.

244
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,639
- (screams) Fuck!
- Kai, Kai, Kai!

245
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:45,541
Mace. It's mace! Use the milk.

246
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:47,443
Kai, Kai, Kai! Come on!

247
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:49,523
- (ambulance sirens approaching)
- (helicopter in the distance)

248
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:51,513
(audio fades)

249
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,656
(ice cream truck music playing)

250
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,989
- (music continues playing)
- (Winter growls in frustration)

251
00:12:11,227 --> 00:12:13,442
- (music continues playing)
- What's the problem here?

252
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,515
- Shut that shit off!
- I was scrubbing the truck down

253
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,339
like you asked,
and the music got stuck 'cause

254
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,686
- this stupid thing's so ancient.
- (music stops) - Damn it!

255
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,444
The Feds are everywhere,
watching us.

256
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:23,790
We are supposed to be getting
rid of evidence,

257
00:12:23,814 --> 00:12:25,854
not broadcasting it out
to the entire fucking world.

258
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,894
Wouldn't it be better to just
get rid of the damn thing?

259
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,102
That's what they're
expecting us to do.

260
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:31,832
They're gonna be looking
for an ice cream truck.

261
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,834
But once we strip it down
and paint the whole thing

262
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:34,941
the color of orange sherbet,

263
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:36,850
that's when we can hide it
in plain sight.

264
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,728
Got it?

265
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,730
Get to work.

266
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,571
You stay inside,
I'll do the outside.

267
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:51,640
WINTER:
Was she in pain?

268
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,575
In the end?

269
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,780
I don't know what
you're talking about.

270
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,415
I know.

271
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:00,816
I know I have no right to ask.

272
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,787
It's just, Kai's been spreading
that bullshit story

273
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,390
about her going off
to cooking school in Paris.

274
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:10,626
And I know my brother.

275
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:13,429
And I know Ivy would have never
left without saying good-bye.

276
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,532
Is that what you think?

277
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:19,701
Yeah, well...

278
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:22,738
maybe you didn't know my wife
as well as you thought you did.

279
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,408
Look, you have every right
to be pissed.

280
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,546
Is anything ever your fault,
Winter?

281
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,749
You seduce my wife.

282
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:38,487
You use her to destroy me
and my family.

283
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:40,823
I'm sorry I let things get
so out of control.

284
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:44,827
But you have to believe me,
I cared about Ivy.

285
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,762
I did.

286
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,764
It was real, whatever
you want to call it.

287
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:51,400
Kai's out of his mind right now.

288
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:53,836
He's been taking so many pills.

289
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,749
And my mind is just going insane
thinking about

290
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,673
what he did to her,

291
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:01,643
and that he made her suffer,
and... and I wasn't there.

292
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:13,722
If something did happen to Ivy,

293
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:16,391
what makes you think it was Kai?

294
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,933
TV REPORTER: Shocking video
out of Michigan today,

295
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,769
after a political rally
erupted into violence,

296
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,605
leaving 12 people injured.

297
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:31,607
Local councilman Kai Anderson,

298
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,676
who was recently catapulted
onto the national stage

299
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:36,645
after an assassination attempt

300
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:40,682
and some unorthodox and
controversial city ordinances

301
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:44,188
that he passed, he clashed today
with counter-protesters

302
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:47,623
after lashing out against
Senator Herbert Jackson,

303
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:50,592
who he plans to unseat during
the midterm elections.

304
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:54,033
Here's what Senator Jackson
had to say earlier today.

305
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:56,832
The only blue hairs I respond to
are the sweet little old ladies

306
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:59,568
of my state, not some
alt-right extremist.

307
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,814
REPORTER:
So you're not taking

308
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,449
Councilman Anderson's challenge
seriously?

309
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,473
Please.

310
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:06,742
If anyone should be taking
Mr. Anderson seriously,

311
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:09,344
it should be
the Department of Justice.

312
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:10,965
You seeing this shit?!

313
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,548
Screw that guy right in the ass!

314
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,810
- Yeah!
- Yes!

315
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,651
We're not the ones
wearing ski masks.

316
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:16,830
We're not the ones throwing

00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,616
Where it's not so obvious.

471
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,550
(door slams heavily, echoes)

472
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:28,569
Guys, what the fuck?

473
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:33,474
Idiots.

474
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,454
(door bangs open)

475
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,523
What is going on?

476
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:55,629
This is not the plan.

477
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:59,667
What are you doing
in my costume?

478
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,307
What is happening?

479
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,375
(stick banging along railing)

480
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:16,550
(banging continues)

481
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:28,395
Divine Ruler.

482
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:32,951
Why?

483
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,703
What did I do?

484
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,572
(sighs)

485
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:47,515
Sweet Gary.

486
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:50,092
It's not what you've done,

487
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:52,125
it's what you're about to do.

488
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:56,361
W-what about the Night
of a Thousand Tates?

489
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:59,360
I'm really looking forward
to that.

490
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:00,903
That's still happening.

491
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:03,455
Just not with you.

492
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:07,037
What I need you for
is more important,

493
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,504
more vital.

494
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:12,473
But...

495
00:25:13,817 --> 00:25:16,354
...I don't want
to leave you, Kai.

496
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,868
In doing this,
you will never leave me.

497
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,312
You will become a part of me.

498
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:30,457
Closer to me than any
of my other children.

499
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:33,460
Yeah.

500
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:08,596
(screaming)

501
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:32,453
(screaming)

502
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,189
The marathon of violence
continues in Brookfield Heights

503
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,838
with the murder of local
grocery store manager

504
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,710
Gary K. Longstreet.

505
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:52,789
Mr. Longstreet's body was
discovered by an employee

506
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:55,926
of Planned Parenthood
in the alley behind me.

507
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:59,830
Here to comment,
Councilman Kai Anderson.

508
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,999
Thank you, Beverly.

509
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:05,936
Gary was one of my earliest
supporters.

510
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,005
He is...

511
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,743
<i>...was</i> a dear friend.

512
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:15,746
I can't imagine
the depths of sorrow

513
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:18,015
you must feel right now.

514
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,785
Incredible sorrow.

515
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:24,087
Gary was a kind, gentle man.

516
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,079
A big teddy bear.

517
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,058
I pray that
Senator Herbert Jackson

518
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,760
and the left-wing terrorists
he supports

519
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:30,927
are brought to justice.

520
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,764
Are you suggesting
a sitting senator

521
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:35,065
is guilty of murder?

522
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,701
He emboldened
the violent fascists

523
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:39,836
known as the Woke Warriors.

524
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,939
These anti-life zealots...

525
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,875
killed my friend

526
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:49,646
because he had the radical
belief that babies are people.

527
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,683
Today, the victim is a pro-life
patriot... well, who's next?

528
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:54,718
Pregnant women recognizing
the sanctity of life

529
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,920
growing inside of them?

530
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:59,623
Any more blood shed
by the Woke Warriors

531
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:02,025
is on Senator
Herbert Jackson's hands.

532
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,030
We will provide updates
on this story as it develops.

533
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:10,767
This is Beverly Hope.
Back to you in the studio.

534
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,703
CAMERAMAN:
And we're clear.

535
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:14,330
What the hell, Beverly?

536
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,084
You can't report on
a politically motivated murder

537
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:17,719
like you're reading
a goddamn weather report.

538
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:18,809
If we don't sell this,

539
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:21,011
our entire movement
could be derailed.

540
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:24,781
Am I clear?

541
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:27,684
Perfectly clear, Divine Ruler.

542
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,994
(mouthing words inaudibly)

543
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:41,832
It's chamomile.
It'll relax you.

544
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:44,000
Why are you being nice to me?

545
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:46,036
I'm worried about you, Beverly.

546
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:47,804
You haven't been the same
since...

547
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:49,106
Since I was forced at gunpoint

548
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,974
to drink fake poisoned Kool-Aid?

549
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,909
Or since I was thrown
in an isolation cell

550
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,045
for a murder I didn't commit?

551
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:02,819
I'm sorry I framed you.

552
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:05,055
It was my only play at the time.

553
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:06,957
But I feel terrible about it.

554
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,659
Looking at you now,
broken like this.

555
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:12,062
This isn't Beverly Hope.

556
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:14,698
You need to escape.

557
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,633
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

558
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:18,001
I'm going to help you.

559
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:20,971
- What is this?
- An Amtrak ticket

560
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:22,706
to Butte, Montana.

561
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:23,940
No one will find you there.

562
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,644
You're testing me.

563
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,045
Please go away.

564
00:29:29,148 --> 00:29:31,047
I can't go back
in that hole again.

565
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,084
No, Beverly.
I swear this is real.

566
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:38,955
I want to make things right.

567
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:41,758
The train leaves tomorrow
at 6:00 a.m.

568
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,095
Leave. Start over.

569
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,766
What about you?

570
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:54,849
I'm gonna stay here and distract
Kai from your disappearance

571
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,039
as long as I can.

572
00:29:57,203 --> 00:29:58,909
Please, Beverly.

573
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:12,889
Tell Divine Ruler
I would never run. Ever.

574
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:17,794
I am his loyal follower
until the end.

575
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:30,644
We need to talk.

576
00:30:30,764 --> 00:30:33,106
Do you hear that?
That low buzz?

577
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,479
I'm sorry, but I-I don't.

578
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,016
Listen, it's here. It's here.
It's definitely here.

579
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:39,727
I'm gonna find it.

580
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,215
Hey, will you listen to me
for a second?

581
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,904
After everything
that's happened,

582
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:45,601
I cannot be paired with Winter.

583
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,788
- It's just, it's not possible.
- Shh!

584
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:50,733
How can you not hear that?
You don't hear that?

585
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:53,504
- How can you not hear that?
- What are you doing?

586
00:30:53,545 --> 00:30:55,667
I told you, it's the buzz.
They planted something.

587
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,650
- Who planted something?
- The Feds... someone's listening.

588
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,320
We have a mole, okay?
A double agent. I know.

589
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,314
It's bugged,
this whole fucking place is.

590
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:06,789
Kai, will you listen to me?
Would you please calm down

591
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,077
- and let me help you?
- You don't even hear it!

592
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:11,026
The buzz!
It's getting louder!

593
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:12,779
I can't think in here.

594
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:14,848
(steady buzzing)

595
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:25,892
(buzzing stops)

596
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:28,128
(exhales sharply)

597
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:33,223
(quietly):
Ah, fuck.

598
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:38,494
It's the little things.
The tiny details.

599
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:39,363
That's what they're looking for,

600
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,581
that's the thing that's
gonna trip me up.

601
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,870
What's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

602
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,919
What's it gonna be,
what's gonna get me?

603
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:48,314
- Always five steps ahead, right, Kai?
- Jesus!

604
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:50,183
Vincent!

605
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,320
Now...

606
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,535
how can I turn that frown
upside down?

607
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:56,301
You seem troubled.

608
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,554
Uh, well, you already said it.
Th-they're after me.

609
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,154
- Who?
- The Feds, everyone!

610
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:03,005
I-I don't know.
I think there's a mole.

611
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,797
There's definitely a bug
somewhere in this house.

612
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:05,970
I just don't know where it is.

613
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:09,253
But this is the only room
where I know I can be safe.

614
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:12,946
This one room, where you are.

615
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,000
I probably shouldn't have
killed you.

616
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:21,542
I've killed so many people now,

617
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:23,911
it's gonna be so hard
to keep all these secrets.

618
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:28,252
Well, if anybody can do it,
Kai, it's you.

619
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:30,417
You are the master at keeping

620
00:32:30,537 --> 00:32:33,126
all of the balls up in the air.

621
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:36,830
Ah! Vincent!

622
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:41,105
Don't listen to him, man.

623
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,811
If you're gonna hallucinate
somebody, it should be me.

624
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,581
Are you the ghost
of Charles Manson?

625
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,875
I'm not a ghost, man.
I'm still alive.

626
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:56,131
Kicking it at Corcoran State
Prison in California.

627
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:58,037
You should come visit sometime.

628
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:05,158
I know why you're here.

629
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,062
You're the only one who could
see things on my level.

630
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:15,802
Well, you're never wrong
when you're right.

631
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:17,224
What would you do,
if you were me?

632
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,901
Identify the Judas.

633
00:33:20,728 --> 00:33:22,578
That's how I fucked up.

634
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:27,013
I trusted too much.

635
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,908
My Judas was Linda.

636
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:36,179
He said we were going out
again tonight.

637
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,770
Last night was too messy,

638
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,490
and he was going to show us
how to do it.

639
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:41,373
I didn't want to go,
but Charlie asked me,

640
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:43,441
and I was afraid to say no.

641
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:45,614
He said,
"As soon as you enter the room,

642
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,100
"as soon as you see the man,

643
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,915
slit his throat right away."

644
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:51,726
He said to leave a sign.

645
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:56,626
"You girls know what I mean.
Something witchy."

646
00:33:57,102 --> 00:34:00,680
MANSON:
It's always the bitches, man.

647
00:34:00,783 --> 00:34:03,049
Can't trust the bitches.

648
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:04,763
I can't trust anyone.

649
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:08,436
Look, as long as there's hate
in your heart,

650
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:10,090
there'll be hate in the world.

651
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:12,242
(knocking at door)

652
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:15,025
- ALLY: Kai? Are you in there?
- Yeah!

653
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:20,967
Look what I found.

654
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:29,943
Bitches.

655
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,046
(knocking)

656
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:35,916
- What do you want me to do?
- Stay here.

657
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:37,784
- (knocking)
- Don't you move!

658
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:50,263
Whoa.

659
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:54,968
Thorough.

660
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,250
Oh, fuck!

661
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,811
Valerie always said the male was
a biological accident,

662
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,732
a walking abortion.

663
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:05,208
Oh, God, if only you'd been
aborted in your mother's belly,

664
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:08,334
how much disappointment would
the rest of us have been spared?

665
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:11,161
You can't talk to me
like that anymore.

666
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:13,789
I could not have been more clear
if I had tattooed it

667
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:15,402
on the inside of your eyelids.

668
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:17,518
It wasn't complicated.
Two steps.

669
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:20,715
"A" to "B."
Unleash female rage.

670
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:23,112
Incite the American woman's
desperate

671
00:35:23,232 --> 00:35:25,874
and patriarchally contained
violent anger.

672
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:27,808
Give her no choice
but to lash out

673
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:29,532
and cut up every man they see.

674
00:35:29,652 --> 00:35:31,916
I did that!
I got maced, for fuck's sake!

675
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:33,514
Look at the chaos out there!

676
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:34,965
You've enraged everyone.

677
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:37,705
And what of the poor females
closest to you?

678
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:39,906
Your sister's defeated,
another one is dead.

679
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:42,696
You even broke unbreakable tiger
Beverly Hope!

680
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,050
It's not my fault
they were weak.

681
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,807
I am the final carrier
for Valerie Solanas' torch.

682
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:53,171
She handed the responsibility
for scum to me, personally,

683
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:56,704
her protégée, and look how you
have failed us both.

684
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,670
MANSON:
My goodness.

685
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,418
I can't wait to see her face
when you tell her the truth.

686
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:10,134
Did you think I was gonna
drown myself in female rage?

687
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:14,578
That I would die a martyr
to some dead bitch's cause?

688
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:16,814
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that!

689
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:18,608
You gave me my purpose, Bebe.

690
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:22,055
You awaken me to the power
of pissing people off.

691
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,652
And hell yes, I want women mad.

692
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:27,484
Popping off, losing their minds,
getting hysterical.

693
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,194
But women can't run things.

694
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:30,975
They're too emotional,
irrational.

695
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,991
I need women's rage
to tear it all down, 'cause then

696
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:34,688
I'm gonna be the last one
standing to lead them.

Amen!
Helter Skelter!

You fucking turd.

699
00:36:39,604 --> 00:36:41,475
A turd who knows the truth:

700
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,129
that women need to be grabbed
by their pussies and led,

701
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:49,472
preferably to the kitchen
to make me a sandwich.

Not very good at her job.

Far out, man.

You cried and cried.

I was afraid it was gonna hurt.

So I grabbed a pair of scissors

I've watched you

The way your eyes open real
wide, like a Disney chipmunk,

Or the little smirk you make

before you went to sleep
each night.

You weren't as quiet
as you thought you were.

I'm your big brother.

739

They say that for a girl that
relationship is more important

740
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:04,891
than the one with her father.

741

You're very important

What do they want from you?

00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,870
What do you want from them?

749
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:35,874
I look at you

One day, this is

They're all going to get

Is that what you want?

755
00:40:50,023 --> 00:40:52,657
You want them all to leave?

756
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:56,795
You want to destroy everything
I've worked so hard to build?

No.

They worship you,
and they should.

759

But I want you to know
that when they're all gone,

760
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:07,539
I'll still be here.

We're all that's left

So why do I feel you
slipping away?

763

Because I am.

764
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:34,666
Because... the only way for me
to be there for you in the end

765
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:36,701
is if I get away from you now.

766
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:42,974
I love you.

767
00:41:43,076 --> 00:41:46,983
But when I look at you now,
all I feel is terror.

768
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:51,583
I'm afraid that
if I'm around it much longer,

769
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:55,720
I won't be able to feel anything
else about you ever again.

770
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:59,758
What if I say no?

771
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:07,932
If I say I need you and that
you leaving would be a betrayal?

What if others
want to leave with you?

773

I'd convince them to stay.

791
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:58,397
and fucking the wives
of other world leaders,

792
00:43:58,517 --> 00:44:00,845
and I'm gonna need
someone beside me

793
00:44:00,947 --> 00:44:02,847
I know I can trust.

794
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:05,683
Thank you, Kai.

795
00:44:05,786 --> 00:44:07,685
Thank you so much.

796
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:10,723
(sobs quietly)

797
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:16,594
I even know where you should go.

798
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,863
What? Where?

799
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:22,867
Butte, Montana.

800
00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:27,872
I even got you a train ticket.

801
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:29,351
(breath trembling)

802
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:31,543
(whispers):
Kai.

803
00:44:31,645 --> 00:44:32,777
Kai.

804
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:33,879
Get her out of here.

805
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,780
(crying):
Kai, please, no!

806
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:36,781
No!

807
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:37,949
Kai!

808
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,018
(Winter sobbing)

809
00:44:41,955 --> 00:44:43,922
(sobbing):
No! Kai!

810
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:52,539
KAI:
Why?

811
00:44:52,642 --> 00:44:54,575
Can you just tell me that?

812
00:44:57,013 --> 00:44:59,513
What did they offer you?

813
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:02,616
Immunity?
Witness protection program?

814
00:45:02,718 --> 00:45:03,951
Tell me it wasn't money.

815
00:45:04,053 --> 00:45:05,853
- Nobody offered me anything, Kai.
- Hmm.

816
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:08,555
I'm not the mole.
I don't even think there is one.

817
00:45:08,658 --> 00:45:11,659
Only the mole would say that.

818
00:45:12,055 --> 00:45:14,222
You're not thinking clearly.

819
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:15,823
You're just trying
to find things

820
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:18,025
to fit in with your delusions.

821
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:20,127
(Manson clicks tongue)

822
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,029
She thinks you're delusional.

823
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:24,298
- I know.
- You know?

824
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:33,558
I loved you, Winter.

825
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:39,981
How can you sit here
and lie to my face like this?

826
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,049
I'm not lying, Kai.

827
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:45,820
Pinky power.

828
00:45:45,922 --> 00:45:47,299
Then you'll know
I'm telling the truth.

829
00:45:47,323 --> 00:45:50,191
I'm not the mole.

830
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:56,897
How do you explain this?

831
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,134
What's that?

832
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:02,770
You know what this is.

833
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:06,240
This is a bug,
and you planted it.

834
00:46:06,342 --> 00:46:08,153
It's the battery to my Fitbit.

835
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:11,178
Then why did I find it
sewn into Kai's cushions?

836
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:13,281
- You found it?
- Yeah.

837
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:16,984
Along with this.

838
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:19,153
<i>Right where you put it.</i>

839
00:46:19,255 --> 00:46:22,256
<i>In the ice cream truck.</i>

840
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:25,826
WINTER:
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

841
00:46:25,928 --> 00:46:27,208
I didn't put that there,
she did.

842
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:29,263
This is payback
for me screwing your wife.

843
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:32,199
No, this is your disloyalty

844
00:46:32,302 --> 00:46:34,235
coming back
to bite you in the ass.

845
00:46:34,337 --> 00:46:38,005
You never believed
in Kai's vision of the world.

846
00:46:38,107 --> 00:46:40,337
You were a Hillary supporter,
for God's sake.

847
00:46:40,457 --> 00:46:44,515
You were just looking for
the opportunity to take us down.

848
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,503
Well, I am glad I exposed you
for what you really are

849
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:50,851
before you could destroy us.

850
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:54,021
Stoking my brother's paranoia
is gonna blow up in your face.

851
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:55,890
I know him, Ally.

852
00:46:55,992 --> 00:46:59,454
You'll be chewed up
and spit out just like me.

853
00:46:59,574 --> 00:47:01,228
Oh.

854
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:03,864
Too bad you won't
be there to see it.

855
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:05,833
Kai.

856
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,836
Kai.

857
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:12,715
Confess.

858
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:14,075
I didn't do anything.

859
00:47:14,177 --> 00:47:16,243
Confess!

860
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:19,180
I can't!

861
00:47:19,282 --> 00:47:22,216
Confess.

862
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:24,285
Please, Kai.

863
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:32,026
Are you willing to do
what needs to be done?

864
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:35,029
WINTER:
You don't need to do this.

865
00:47:35,131 --> 00:47:36,931
Kai.
