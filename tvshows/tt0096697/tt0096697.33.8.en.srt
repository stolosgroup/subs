Congratulations, sir--
it's eight puppies.

6
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,380
Four boys, three girls, and, uh,

7
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,957
one who would prefer
not to be labeled yet.

8
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,052
Excellent,
eight purebred puppies

9
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:54,461
descended from the
first litter

10
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:57,222
of Karl Friedrich Dobermann
himself.

11
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,299
Smithers, you're in charge
of their training.

12
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,635
Teach them all
the classic commands.

13
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:03,303
Sit, stay...

14
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,565

with your "wittle teefers."

Yes, Mr. Burns.

the training dummies

18
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:13,772
So I've ordered a new one.

19
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:15,390
Here he is now.

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,409
Um, I was told
there'd be a taco truck?

Don't worry, their adult teeth
haven't come in yet.

22
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,581
Just look out for
their much sharper baby teeth.

who's already made a matching
suit for the puppy?

99

Well, I've got a Monet and a guy
who can change O's to A's.

Mm, Mr. Burns would never know
the difference.

101

He hates art-he just wants
to keep it out of museums.

102
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,354
But first I told him
you have some questions

103
00:04:57,372 --> 00:05:00,615
about what the puppy's
looking for in a companion.

104

Well, uh, this is
an unusual Dobermann.

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,472
What was that?

163
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,031
Oh, just guy stuff.

164
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:57,124
Smithers was updating me
on his boyfriend.

165
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,126
Boyfriend?
Yeah, no big deal.

166
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,963
I kind of fixed Smithers up
with a dude I know.

167
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:03,482
Now they're going steady.
No big deal.

168
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,800
Wait, wait,
I just have one question.

169
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:07,727
Can I ask you
a thousand questions?

170
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,197
Sorry, Marge, late for work.

171
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:15,218
Tell me everything!

172
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,662
Um, they've been dating
for six weeks or so.

173
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:18,830
You probably
don't even know him.

174
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,223
He's some fashion designer guy.

175
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:21,574
Michael de Graaf.

176
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:22,834
<i>What?</i>

177
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,319
Smithers is dating
Michael de Graaf,

178
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,156
the judge on seasons ten through
15 of <i>America's Got Fabric?</i>

179
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:32,068
He has my favorite catchphrase!

180
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,495
<i>Now, that is avant-gorgeous.</i>

181
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,681
<i>Oh, my God, honey,</i>
<i>you got catchphrased.</i>

182
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,093
And he's even more famous
for his savage zings.

183
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:42,412
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>It's a little</i> Sex and the City.

184
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,857
<i>If there were no sex</i>
<i>and the city was Milwaukee.</i>

185
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:50,195
They dress so bad in Milwaukee.

186
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:51,345
I assume.

187
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,364
Hmm?

188
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,594
I have to meet Michael de Graaf!

189
00:08:57,763 --> 00:09:00,354
Okay, okay. When they come back
from their trip.

190
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,099
Ooh, whisked off
by a billionaire.

191
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:05,544
How romantic. Where did they go?

192
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:08,195
Well, Smithers says they're
too young for Provincetown,

193
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,123
too monogamous for Fire Island

194
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,942
and you know
how Waylon gets in Palm Springs.

195
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,052
No, I don't!

196
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:16,596
I don't know anything!

197
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:22,727
Yeah, it's pretty sweet

198
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,713
to completely alter
the course of people's lives.

199
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,715
If it goes great, I'm a genius.

200
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,808
<i>If it goes south,</i>

201
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,144
<i>I just turn off my phone.</i>

202
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,480
Ah, a beautiful resort,

203
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,907
a turquoise ocean.

204
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:37,801
The only thing missing
is Christine Baranski

205
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,302
singing "Dancing Queen."

206
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:41,654
I thought you might say that.

00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,593
Less than you might think.

211
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,836
Oh, and I got you
something else.
Oh.

212
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,338
I call it the Waylon.

213
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,915
Like you,
it's sophisticated yet playful,

214
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,992
as blue and sparkling

215
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,510
Okay, I've got to go.

216
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:07,997
I'm helping a 13-year-old boy
come out to his parents.

217
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,350

A-And sorry I wasn't available
this weekend.

221
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,439
Or last weekend. I was...

222
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,774
You were gone?

223
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,534
Who cares? I figured it out.

224
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,462
These pieces are designed
to interlock.

225
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,446
But to what purpose?

226
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:33,857
Sir, it is a puzzle.

227
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,191
Not for long, man.

228
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,135
Monty Burns is on the case.

229
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:41,723
The obvious first step is
to sort every piece by weight.

230
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,978
Waylon!

231
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:49,873
Marge? Why are you
in the executive parking lot?

232
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:50,965
Who cares?

233
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,376
Tell me
all about Michael de Graaf!

234
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:56,546
Well, Michael's kind of perfect.

235
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,381
Attentive,
treats me like an equal,

236
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,066
has never trap-doored
an entire Girl Scout troop

237
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:01,551
because they were out
of Thin Mints.

238
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,404
I mean, it's nice to finally be
in love with someone...

239
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:05,163
good.

240
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:06,998
I'm dying to meet him.

241
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,059
What if we threw you two
a party?

242
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:11,744
A party. That's what people do

243
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:13,838
when they finally have
something worth celebrating.

244
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,065
Let's do it!
Yes!

245
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,902
This makes me part
of your couple origin story.

246
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,903
I'm in!

247
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,742
Just what I always wanted
for him,

248
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:27,835
a handsome
billionaire boyfriend.

249
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,187
So happy.

250
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:31,839
Excuse me, Mr. de Graaf,

251
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,417
we love your wicked zingers
on the show.

252
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:35,360
Could you?

253
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:36,361
My pleasure.

254
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:38,438
Wow, it was so kind
of Estelle Getty

255
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,348
to donate her wardrobe for
your production of <i>The Crucible.</i>

256
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:44,928
Hello and welcome
to Grey Gardens.

257
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,854
At least
those ladies had a look.

258
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,707
You have a "don't look."

259
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:51,543
Do you like my top?

260
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,194
Yes, I love the shoulder pads.

261
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:56,122
Is something I would have said
in the '90s but not about that.

262
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,716
Do you like my top?

263
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,968
Yes. He seems very nice.

264
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,221
Is it wrong
to enjoy being envied?

265
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:05,465
Because I am savoring it.

266
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,967
When did you first realize
that Homer was the one,

267
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:09,969
the great love of your life?

268
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,546
Well, after he got me pregnant,

269
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,567
I just knew he was someone
I was gonna have kids with.

270
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,293
Aw. Mwah.

271
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,887
Young lady, I like
your quirky fashion sense.

272
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,148
That zigzag dress hem
is everything.

273
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,134
Thanks, but I don't
really pay attention to fashion.

274
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:28,137
It doesn't seem...
super important.

275
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,564
I'd like to suggest
some alterations. May I?

276
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,659
I mean, it's a waste
of your time, but fine.

277
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:35,736
Wearing the same thing
every day is a choice,

278
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,831
so I can free up my mind
to think about important things,

279
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:40,908
rather than "Am I on trend?"

280
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,927
Ha, whatever that means.

281
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,837
You know who didn't care
about fashion?

282
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,264
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

283
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:48,508
She slapped on a doily
and that was enough.

284
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,677
This obsession with appearance
in our culture...

285
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,845
Did you make me taller?

286
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,347
I feel so confident.

287
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:58,334
I don't even have a job, but
I'm going to ask for a raise.

288
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:02,447
A toast to our hosts.

289
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,023
And to Marge's hair,

290
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:06,433
which is avant-gorgeous.

291
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,860
Oh!

292
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,621
And I want you to be
the first to hear--

293
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:12,015
I've decided to manufacture
my new retail line

294
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:13,533
right here in Springfield,

295
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,853
in the factory that used
to make fidget spinners.

296
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:18,371
Spin-ners!

297
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,024
And if anyone needs a job,
there are applications

298
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:24,710
right next to the best coleslaw
I've ever had.

299
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,304
Ooh-hoo!

300
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:31,050
Mamma, everyone is-a happy.

301
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:34,312
Why are you so against
this-a love? Why?

302
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:35,872
I hate...

303
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,465
because I hate-a myself!

304
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,210
I... I love-a the women.

305
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:43,488
No, Mamma, you are beautiful.

306
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,324
You love-a the women,
and I love-a the you.

307
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:52,738
I had a pillow
of-a Gina Lollobrigida

308
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,223
that I used to, oh...

309
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:59,128
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, Mamma!

310
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,841
Look,
it's Michael's new factory!

311
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,325
So modern.

312
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:05,585
Can we look inside?

313
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:07,737
Yeah, do you know anybody
that works there?

314
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,423
Ha, well, they hired
most of the desperate saps

315
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,832
who've been unemployed forever.

316
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,334
So, yeah,
I'm friends with all of 'em.

317
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,521
This week's trend
is glitter on sunglasses.

318
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,398
So we got right on it.

319
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,275
What happens
to all the toxic stuff?

320
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,661
It gets off-glittered
