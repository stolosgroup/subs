- Hi, marie.

00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:08,207
- Why was a truck
in front of the house

4
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:11,010
With the dancing
little bugs on top?

5
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,078
- We've got termites.
- Oh, my god!

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,747
Oh!

00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,682
Oh, dear!
I told you, dear.

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:20,719
You have to keep up
with your housekeeping.

00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,454
- Marie, why don't you--

10

- Oh, children,

Off the floor

Come on, come on.
Come on.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,793
You're all coming to stay
with grandma.

14
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,595
- No, we have a hotel
that we're gonna stay at

15
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,562
While they
tent the house.

16
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,197
- A hotel?

17
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:42,508
Those places
are even dirtier than here.

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,144
It's the raymond barone
living memorial.

19
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,179
- Yeah.
- So what happens?

20
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:52,051
Every 45 minutes, an actor
dressed as you comes in

21
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,486
And recreates scenes
from your life, huh?

Yeah.

That's the whole show.

Thank you.

I'm not tipping you,
robert.

- No, no. I just can't
believe you're back.

- Don't worry, robert.

38
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,567
It's just
for a couple of days.

39
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,671
- Yeah.
That's what I said.

00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,107
I'm sure you'll
have a marvelous time.

- All right, and by the way,
there's a few rules.

45
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,119
I take my showers
at 6:35 in the a.M.

You will please refrain
from any and all flushing.

Despite what dad thinks,
it is not funny.

- Your kids.

The two boys
and the other one.

54
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,618
I had a whole stack
of quarters.

Now it's a pile!

stacked up on the dresser.

- And I don't like
anyone touching them!

I won't!

And I'll say this,

It's much smaller than
a hotel room would have been.

In a hotel room, you...

You couldn't
get the complete set

You know, debra,
I tidied up raymond's room.

Wouldn't you be
more comfortable there?

Debra, you're reading,

And I'm sure this is
distracting for you.

I'm used to tv.

00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,788
But her coming over
to my house every day with food,

165
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,923
And rewashing
the kids' clothes,

166
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,792
And your father fixing things
until they're broken,

167
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,527
That's not intruding?
- Okay, all right, look.

168
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,996
It's one more day.
- Oh, this is--I love this.

169
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,632
- Now I really love this.
- Just play along.

170
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,733
One more.
That's all.

171
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,137
- [scoffs]
- what?

172
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,138
- [chuckles]

173
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,108
- What?

174
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,210
- You know what?

175
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,946
She thinks reading
is intrusive?

176
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,781
[chuckles]
okay.

177
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,184
- Oh, what the hell
was that?

178
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,685
- What was what?

179
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,255
- That, that
"heh heh...Okay"? What?

180
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,591
- Nothing. No.
I was just thinking.

181
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,294
[laughing]

182
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:56,167
- [scoffs]
termite bastards.

183
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,575
[ball game plays on tv]

184
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,176
- [whispers]

185
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,314
- I wanna watch
"care bears."

186
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:13,151
- Hey, get outta the way!

187
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,053
- Sweetie.

188
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,088
- Sweetie!

189
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,823
- Ally, here's
your corn dog, honey.

190
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,826
- Ally's having
a corn dog now?

191
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,194
- Yeah.

192
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,930
I made enough for everybody.
You want one?

193
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,566
- But it's almost dinner,
and mom's making lasagna.

194
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,935
- Mmm.

195
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,303
- We shouldn't...

196
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:35,307
[stammering]
be having corn dogs now.

197
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,110
Get one for me too.

198
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,717
- Yeah! Corn dog!
- [chuckles]

199
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,321
Hey, bubble wrap.
- Hi.

200
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,290
- How was the rest
of your day, hmm?

201
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,992
- It's better now.
- Yep.

202
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,328
- Hey, I'm back.

203
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,998
Oh, and I got all kinds
of goodies here for you.

204
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,904
What are you doing?

205
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,839
- We're just--
we're having a little snack.

206
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,840
Corn dog.

207
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,842
- Corn...

208
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:14,312
Dog?

209
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,348
I am making dinner.

210
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,850
You should know
not to eat at, uh...

211
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,751
- Those are hot,
aren't they?

212
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,822
- What's the matter
with you people?

213
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,991
I have lasagna
in the oven.

214
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,160
- Oh, my god.
I'm sorry, marie.

215
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,029
Was that for dinner?

216
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,699
I-I took it out
to make the corn dogs.

217
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,937
Do you want a corn dog?

218
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,307
- No.
Thank you, dear.

219
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,348
- I still want mine.

220
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,756
- Hey, what is this?

221
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,226
- Oh, gosh, I guess
that's your dad's remote.

222
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,229
- [gasps]

223
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,334
- Must have accidentally
brought it upstairs with me.

224
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,442
- This was no accident.

225
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,010
- Oh...

226
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,813
- Somebody help me!

227
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,155
- Geoffrey, get up.
- What are you doing?

228
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,290
- I can't be the one
who brings this to him.

229
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,291
He'll kill me, okay?

230
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,358
He likes geoffrey.
Geoffrey--

231
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,929
Just stop that. Stop it.
Go back to sleep.

232
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,864
- Listen, you're going
too far with this.

233
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,165
- This?

234
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,900
This is nothing compared
to what they do--

235
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,470
Look, when they come over
and do stuff,

236
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,471
It's 'cause they don't
know any better.

237
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,039
You do.

238
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,240
You know what that's called
when you know better

239
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,142
And you still do it?
- [sighs]

240
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,143
- Not nice.

241
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,045
- Oh!

242
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,513
- I'm serious!

243
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,782
Listen, we are guests
in this house.

244
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,817
- Oh, my gosh.

245
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,221
Who are you,
admiral von puss?

246
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,923
- No.

247
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,158
- Ray, can't you see?

248
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,459
I'm just trying
to make a point here?

249
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,962
Listen, you could help me.
It could be fun.

250
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,231
Come on, we never
do anything together anymore.

251
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,299
- You are sick.

252
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,834
- If I am sick,

253
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,237
It's because your family
made me that way.

254
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,909
- Well.

255
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,410
[chuckles, scoffs]

256
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,013
We made you that way.

257
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,515
I'm sorry
that's how you feel.

258
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,150
- Oh--puh!
Where are you going?

259
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,519
- I'm going to sleep
elsewhere, okay?

260
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,487
I wouldn't want to
make you sick.

261
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,523
- Good night, admiral.

262
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,402
- Hey, robert...

263
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,407
Robert...

264
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,044
Robert.

265
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,847
[grunts]

266
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,251
- Oh, raymond.

267
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,422
Sorry.
It's just a reflex.

269
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:48,593
- I think I know why
your marriage broke up.

270
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,130
- What are you doing
down here?

271
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,231
- I need a place to sleep.

272
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,166
Deborah...

273
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,501
She's got the kids
in the bed.

274
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,504
- Go sleep on the couch.

275
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,939
- I can't.

276
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,373
Dad's still tearing apart
the living room

277
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,077
Looking for
the remote control.

278
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,378
Come on.
It's just one more night.

279
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,015
Just...
Move over.

280
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,984
- All right,
but no noise.

281
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,352
Got an early shift.

282
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:19,357
- Yeah.

283
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,332
Hey, could you, uh...

284
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:32,337
Put a shirt on?

285
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,909
And some underpants?

286
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,622
- Excuse me.

287
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,992
I believe
this is my bed.

288
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,027
- All right, but come on.

289
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,395
A guy gets in bed
with you,

290
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,999
You put some pants on.

291
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,533
- I will not.

292
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,434
You don't wanna sleep
with me,

293
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:07,672
Go back to your wife.

294
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,977
- I'm not gonna
be able to sleep...

295
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,180
Ever.

296
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:20,018
- So, everybody has to do
what raymond wants, right?

297
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,686
New sheets for raymond.

298
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,421
Brownies for raymond.

299
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,191
Can't sleep naked
around raymond.

300
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,693
You know what you are?

301
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:32,196
Intrusive.

302
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,331
- What?

303
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,300
You're calling me that?

304
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,201
You're calling me that?

305
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,505
You're calling me that?

306
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,407
- Intrusive.

307
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,109
You!

308
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,112
Intrusive!

309
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,285
You know what?
Debra was right.

310
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,954
Think this is intrusive?

311
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,956
[chuckles]
okay.

312
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,191
- Where ya going?

313
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,994
- Upstairs.
Don't get up.

314
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,565
- You are so uptight.

315
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,680
- [chuckles]

316
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,649
- Ah!

317
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,659
Holy crapping crap!

318
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,295
What the hell
happened here?

319
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,463
- Oh, yeah.
I wanted to tell ya.

320
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,698
I tried to fix that.
It was too loose.

321
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,300
- It was never this
frigging loose.

322
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,302
- I'm sorry, dad.

323
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,705
I was just--
just trying to help.

324
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,042
- You wanna help me?
Find my remote.

325
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,243
- I don't understand

326
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,245
Why you would use bleach
on these towels.

327
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,781
- They--they just seemed
a little yellowy.

328
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:34,052
- Yes.
They're yellow towels!

329
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,187
My whole bathroom is yellow.

330
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,222
It's my theme.

331
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,824
- Oh.

332
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,629
- What did you do
with the door?

333
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:48,099
- Why is it always me?

334
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,368
Why don't you ask
your son there: Mr. Fix-it!

335
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,072
- Hey, I'm just
trying to help.

336
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,675
- Ma, where
are all the towels?

337
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,117
Oh, hi.

338
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,721
- You are a little too free
with the body.

339
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,525
- When are they leaving?

340
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,260
- See? Yellow.

341
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,096
- Ma, ma, towel, please?

342
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,798
- No. This doesn't
go with--here.

343
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,172
- Thanks.

344
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,709
- Look what you're
doing to us.

345
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,612
- What? What are we doing?
We're--we're just helping.

346
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,881
- Yeah, I mean,
you seem to have so much to do,

347
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,549
We just wanted
to pitch in.

348
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,351
- Why?
Is this annoying to you?

349
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,187
- Is it bothering you?
- Are we intrusive?

350
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,755
- Because we
don't mean to be.

351
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:49,560
We're just trying to help you
the way you help us.

352
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,833
- Oh.

353
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,270
I see what
they're doing.

354
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,340
Are you trying to repay us

355
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:07,145
For everything
we do for you?

356
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,279
- Well--

357
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,780
- Well, but you see, dear,

358
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,918
When we help you,
we're actually helping.

359
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,761
- What?

360
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,531
- But don't worry.
No, no. I'm not mad.

361
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,765
I can't be mad at you

362
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,635
If you don't know
what you're doing.

363
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,570
- You know what, mom?

364
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,472
Maybe you haven't
spent enough time

365
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,841
Showing them
how to do things.

366
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,409
- Hey, robert--

367
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,611
- No, no. I say when
that tent comes down,

368
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:44,248
Ma's over there showing you
how to do the laundry.

369
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,416
- Why don't
you go complete the outfit

370
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:49,487
And go put on
the toilet seat cover?

371
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,860
- And maybe dad could teach ray
how to fix stuff.

372
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,861
- That's true.

373
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,929
You don't know
a monkey wrench

374
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,866
From a monkey's ass,
do you, son?

375
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:02,967
- No.

376
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,403
- Hey, they're
taking the tent off!

377
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,971
- Oh, we can start
right now.

378
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,239
I'll go get
my cleaning supplies

379
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,241
And we'll
make you a starter kit.

380
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,876
- I'll get some tools,
hammerhead.

381
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,451
- Hey, ray.

382
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,709
- [yelps]

383
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,248
- Raymond.

384
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,316
It was--
it was raymond!

385
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,585
I knew he really didn't
want to sleep with me.

385
00:20:55,305 --> 00:21:55,173
