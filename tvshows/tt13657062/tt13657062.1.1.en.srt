What are you doing here?

5
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,287
Setting up for a romantic
evening with my boyfriend.

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,493
I would've done it at my
place, but rich people

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,495
have such nice lighting.
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,206
I'm the rich person
with the nice lighting

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,730
that owns this apartment.

10
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,625
Wait. You and Beau,
that's tonight?

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,437
Don't look at this.

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,909
What is that giant,
gold monstrosity?

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,579
It's a gift I made for you.

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,310
Oh, I love it.

15
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:50,377
- Did I miss anything?
- [applause]

16

Oh, you gave it
to her without me?

17
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,756
Yeah, and her reaction
was priceless.

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,089
Just a little something
for you and Beau

19
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:02,496
as you begin this beautiful
journey together as partners.

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,270
We thought you could stand on
either side of it and be all...

21
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,471
Thank you.

22
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:13,273
Wow. I can't believe
Beau is going to propose

23
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,507
that we do a channel together.

24
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,983
After years of doing
"iCarly" with Sam

25
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,351
and then hosting Italian QVC

26
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,421
and then my brief
stint in college radio,

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,350
I'm finally going to be
back online where I belong,

28
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,356
with a partner who
I love and trust.

29
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,889
Now, where should
I put my phone,

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,993
so I can secretly record him?

31
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,955
Now that's true love.

32
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,604
I told all the "iCarly" fans
to tune in to my livestream.

33
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:41,141
Beau asking me to do a channel
together, that's good content.

34
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,669
Why waste it?

35
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,073
Couldn't agree more,
which is why after Spencer

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,605
designed this sculpture,

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,980
I outfitted it with a sneaky,
little spot for a camera.

38
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,551
Mm

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,050
Boop.

40
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,751
Freddie, this is why we stayed
friends all these years,

41
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,894
you creepy genius.

42
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,719
I actually did the
whole making it part,

43
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,934
so, you know, who's
the real creepy genius?

44
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,528
This is so exciting.

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,238
I've been wanting to start
up my own channel again,

46
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,632
but I didn't want
to do it by myself.

going to be here any minute,

so much, but get.

49

Hey, everyone. I'm back.
I know it's been a while,

50
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:26,454
but you guys are in for
something really exciting.

51

- Beau.

00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,481

Yeah, it's an and symbol
for Carly and Beau.

55
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,259
Doesn't it make you

56
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,761
just want to stand on
either side of it be all...

57

Sure, kind of.

58

But for now, let's
sit and be all...

59
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,898
Carly, we do a lot
of things together.

60
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:53,067
- I know. It's so great.
- We date.

61
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,706
We share a Spotify account.

62
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:57,382
You came with me
to the podiatrist.

63
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,251
I just get you.

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,380
So I think it's
only natural we...

65
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,845
- Start a channel together.
- Need some time apart.

66
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:09,364
Wait. What? Time apart? Why?

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,820
We gotta get the phone.

68
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,028
You came with me
to the podiatrist.

69
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,305
Well, yeah, but that's just
because your podiatrist is next

70
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,029
to the good dumpling place.

71
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,904
Could've done takeout.

72
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,242
They're not as good
at room temperature.

73

I love you.

75
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,982
I just need a little
space, just for a minute.

76
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:36,122
- Oh, space, yeah.
- I'm fine with space.

77
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,049
I love space. It's really
nice because it teaches you

78
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,917
to appreciate what you had
before you took all the space.

79
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,697
So how long are we talking
here, like, a week?

80

- Maybe a little longer.
- Two?

You're just dumping
me, aren't you?

heart and a broken phone.

Oh, it's just from

What have you done?

I figured since I'm so happy
and in such a good place,

only serve whey here.

Like, whey protein that
you put in a smoothie?

No, like the watery part of milk

00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:45,765
Welcome to the new "iCarly."

475
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,898
Ooh, looks like she's
already got a few viewers.

476
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,874
Probably bots from Brazil.

477
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:54,143
This is still "iCarly,"
but it's grown-up now.

478
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,783
So today I thought I'd
share my skin-care routine.

479
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:59,579
According to the many,
many targeted ads I get,

480
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:03,182
it's never too
early to start using

481
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,285
anti-aging products!

482
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,688
Even for Baby Spencer.

483
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,032
Yeah! That's me!

484
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,699
None of these products
were tested on animals,

485
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,258
just one tiny,
little lucky infant.

486
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:22,367
- Oh, I feel lucky!
- In no way am I worried.

487
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,641
[laughs]

488
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,941
- Here we go.
- Oh.

489
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,714
Oh, I think he needs a lot more.

490
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,982
- Some more?
- No. That's enough already.

491
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,682
[shouts]

492
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,554
I don't think this
is how you do it.

493
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,124
I love this serum.

494
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,163
I actually panic-bought it
when I was at a 7-Eleven,

495
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,117
and the guy there
called me ma'am.

496
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,715
I don't know what
he's so upset about.

497
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,287
I pay people to do this to me.

498
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,426
They say that by the
time you need skin care,

499
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,862
it's already too late,

500
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,441
but you should still spend
all your money on it.

501
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:55,025
And in the end, it's just
an expensive reminder

502
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,237
we're all going to die someday.

503
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,969
That's a little emo for a
comedy show, don't you think?

504
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,238
- Sheet mask.
- What?

505
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,145
- Yup. Here you go.
- Ah! No!

506
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,979
People are weirdly loving this.

507
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,275
I'm totally hating it!

508
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,247
- Enough of that, baby.
- And now we're just going to...

509
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,556
That's cold.

510
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,032
- Roll it all up.
- I don't like that feeling.

511
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,856
- And we're going to absorb...
- Ow.

512
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,531
- All the moisturizer.
- It's cold.

513
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,831
You ready for the lip mask?

514
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,032
Oh, I don't know
what it is, but I am.

515
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,804
- Right here.
- Okay.

516
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:30,403
Okay. You're going to want to
keep your mouth nice and shut.

517
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,966
That sounds good.

518
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,116
This lip mask is actually
made out of laundry detergent.

519
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,310
[sputters and shouts]

520
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,841
Kinda of seems
like we never left.

521
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:40,677
[upbeat music]

522
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,183
A toast to my sister, Carly.

523
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,245
- To Carly.
- To Carly.

524
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:49,094
Also I decided not to
call the Jonas people.

525
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:51,321
Let someone else have
the world record.

526
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,927
It's not why I
made the sculpture,

527
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,929
and it's not why I love it.

528
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,902
- Still not for me.
- Damn it.

529
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,871
I think the sculpture is great.

530
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,044
Do all the pieces still move?

531
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,268
You tell me.

532
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,373
[whirring]

533
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,644
[clattering]

534
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,473
[electricity crackles]

535
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:18,823
I... I love it.

536
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,421
- You do?
- Absolutely.

537
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,063
It's about setting
your own self on fire

538
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,860
and then rebuilding from
the ashes like a phoenix.

539
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,555
If you want to
oversimplify it, sure.

540
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:33,028
You know, you
really had me going

541
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,965
with the whole
world record thing,

542
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,001
but I guess that was
just a part of it.

543
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,466
Performance art.

544
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:41,444
[flames crackling]

545
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,454
It wasn't supposed to
catch on fire, was it?

546
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,450
Never is.
