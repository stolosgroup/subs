<i>There will come a time</i>
<i>when the world is ready for me,</i>

3
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:38,366
<i>when nation will battle nation,</i>
<i>when race will devour race,</i>

4
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:42,370
<i>when brother will kill brother...</i>

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,290
<i>until not a soul is left.</i>

6
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:47,959
<i>Are you ready?</i>

7
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,180
<i>And on that day,</i>
<i>a leader will arise</i>

8
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:02,557
<i>and set all the kingdoms to war</i>

9
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:06,227
<i>and all the races</i>
<i>one against the other...</i>

10
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:09,189
<i>...a day when the dark powers</i>
<i>are coming into alignment</i>

11
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:11,983
<i>and the world is ready to burn.</i>

12
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,488
<i>And all it will take...</i>

13
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:21,743
<i>is one final...</i>

14
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,247
<i>spark.</i>

15
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:36,884
-Any other music?
-I like this one.

16
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:40,221
You always like the sad ones.

17
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:42,932
-That boy.
-Hey!

18
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:44,725
You leave him be.

19
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:49,897
But why trouble yourself with him, hmm?
With any of them?

20
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,066
What are they but frightened animals

21
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,777
in the mud, scratching for more mud,

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,281
fully unworthy
of your devotion and care?

23
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:01,117
I'll prove it to you, just wait.

24
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:02,702
How will you do that?

25
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,997
By letting them be who they are.

26
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:08,917
By making all their dreams
come true.

27
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,294
By whispering to them.

28
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,424
All mankind needs to be
the monster he truly is

29
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:20,136
is being told he can.

30
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:24,266
Will you try to stop me?

31
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:30,439
I have no heart for the living.

32
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,733
For anything.

33
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:35,652
Now open your arms, sister.

34
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,071
I'll give you many souls today.

35
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:19,405
Papa!
Papa! No! No!

36
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:33,753
Papa!

37
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,967
Papa!

38
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:53,941
Papa!

39
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,561
Mama, you shouldn't have.

40
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,856
Stop.
You'll like my cake.

41
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,574
-Ay.
-Ay!

42
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,368
Let Tiago.
This isn't your night.

43
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,622
-Tiago, cut the cake. I'm starving.
-Because you never eat.

44
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,832
He eats all the time.
He's a pig.

45
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,377
-Then why am I so goddamn hungry?
<i>-Muchacho, </i>language.

46
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,715
-Ready?
-Yes.

47
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,634
Yay!
Bravo!

48
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,680
Tiago, show us already.
I'm dying.

49
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,974
-It's just a piece of cheap tin.
-Stop it.

50
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,101
What? You can get them
at Walsh for a nickel, right?

51
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,894
Show us.

52
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,949
I'm so proud of you.

53
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,994
Ma.

54
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,133
It's yours as much as it's mine.

55
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,469
Thank you, Mama.

56
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,264
You don't know how proud I am...

57
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:50,101
this night, for our family.

58
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,982
Hey...the boy in blue.

59
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,612
That it?

60
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,698
Come on.

61
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,159
Detective Santiago Vega.

62
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,832
-I guess, congratulations.
-I guess, thanks for coming.

63
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,084
Hell, you'll be a <i>gringo</i>
before you know it.

64
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,837
Raul, be proud for your brother.

65
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:18,380
I'm not gonna pretend
to be proud of my brother--

66
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,133
You want him in the cannery

67
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,927
or working the fields?

68
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:26,096
Your brother made a life.

69
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:28,390
Respect that.

70
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:32,019
Okay.

71
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,605
Sorry, Tiago.
Okay?

72
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:36,649
-It's been a long day.
-Mm.

73
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,985
Let's have a drink, huh?
Yeah? Huh?

74
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,492
Everyone, I wanna make a toast.

75
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,161
Get a glass.

76
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:55,293
So everyone lift your glass
to--sorry, Mom--

77
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,754
Detective Tiago fucking Vega.

78
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,673
Detective Tiago fucking Vega!

79
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:15,105
You're nervous
about starting work.

80
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:19,317
-You know, I got a good partner.
-Hmm.

81
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:23,780
-It's hard there, hmm?
-I'm used to it.

82
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:25,615
But a Chicano patrolman
is one thing.

83
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:29,703
A detective...no one
very much likes it.

84
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:35,125
Hey.
You earned your badge.

85
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,669
That's not how they see it.

86
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,880
You are the first Chicano detective

87
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,132
in the Los Angeles
Police Department.

88
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:44,468
You wear that badge proudly,

89
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:46,595
and you help the next man up.

90
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:51,434
He helps the next one.
That's what we do, eh?

91
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:56,063
Monday, huh?

92
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,858
Monday morning
those machines start up?

93
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,237
How they look at me.

94
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:07,408
Like they got teeth.

95
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,662
Can't stop progress, I guess.

96
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,914
Raul sure tried.

97
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:15,208
They got an injunction now.

98
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,545
He's going to the city council
tomorrow.

99
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,797
Might as well plow the ocean.

100
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:25,468
Maybe.

101
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:32,684
You know...this night,
your badge...

102
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,438
<i>...tu papá </i>would be proud.

103
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:39,066
I mean it, Tiago.

104
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,860
He sees you tonight.

105
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:47,449
I gotta get my bus.

106
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:10,723
Taxi!

107
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:54,496
-Yeah? Yes?
<i>-Rise and shine.</i>

108
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,331
<i>We got some butchery down the river.</i>

109
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:59,251
<i>I'll be there in 15 minutes,</i>
<i>give or take.</i>

110
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,503
-What, today?
<i>-Yeah, today.</i>

111
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,839
<i>I don't understand it either.</i>

112
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,383
-I don't start until Monday.
<i>-Guess what, slick.</i>

113
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,469
<i>You start in 15 minutes.</i>

114
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:21,523
-Why us?
-Like I know?

115
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,692
But Vanderhoff called me himself.

116
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:25,277
Not the watch commander?

117
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,363
Vanderhoff himself.

118
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,366
-Jesus.
-Fuck, right.

119
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:12,951
-Detective Michener.
-So what gets us up so goddamn early?

120
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:15,537
And on our day off, no less.

121
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,372
Better just see.

122
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:25,631
Let's see him.

123
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:38,602
Steady, partner.
Take a breath.

124
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,316
Well...

125
00:12:44,483 --> 00:12:45,860
I guess I should say,

126
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:48,696
"Welcome to Homicide,
Detective Vega."

127
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:25,775
Chest wounds look like a knife
or an ax maybe.

128
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:31,448
Fucking faces...that's makeup.

129
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:35,869
This some Hollywood
Max Factor bullshit?

130
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:38,789
Sir, there's one thing more.

131
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:01,145
"You take our heart,
we take yours."

132
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:06,484
Well, I guess we know
why they called us.

133
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,903
This is some spic thing.

134
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,635
They took the hearts.

135
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:41,436
Pal, our day off
is officially fucked.

136
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,595
<i>As wild and lawless a town</i>

137
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:18,099
<i>as was ever found in the Old West.</i>
<i>Sergeant...</i>

138
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:22,103
If we join the club, we get a badge.
The Green Hornet gave us a ring.

139
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,399
-Why do you want a badge?
-Dad, everyone wants a badge.

140
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:30,528
I don't understand all the snow. How can
there be a blizzard every episode?

141
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,613
-Morning, Maria.
-Sir.

142
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,700
There's a blizzard
because it's the Yukon.

143
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,912
-Are we having <i>huevos rancheros?</i>
<i>-Sí</i>, Tom.

144
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:41,247
<i>Muchas gracias, </i>Señora Vega.

145
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:42,874
What do you know about blizzards?

146
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,794
-You've never even seen snow.
-Neither have you.

147
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,213
Can we go see snow in the Yukon?

148
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,173
We should go to the Yukon!

149
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,262
-Ma'am.
-Did you bring the laundry?

150
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,889
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,393
-What is that noise?
-Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.

152
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,478
-We're going there.
-We are not.

153
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,647
-Yes, we are.
-Boys, please.

154
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,278
Peter, you're going to be late.
You know how traffic is on Fridays.

155
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,865
-Wait till they open the new road.
-Then I'll just fly.

156
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:16,909
You have to drive really fast on it.

157
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,037
It's going to have three lanes
and bridges and tunnels.

158
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:22,623
Behave yourselves, boys, hmm?
Don't play the wireless too loud.

159
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,252
-Radio.
-Radio.

160
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,129
Have a good day, my dear.

161
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,716
-Be smart in school, Trevor. I love you.
-Love you too.

162
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:34,969
And you, young Tom,
we'll find the Yukon on the map

163
00:16:35,136 --> 00:16:38,222
and then we'll look at it together.
Hmm? How 'bout that?

164
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:39,974
-I love you.
-Bye, Dad.

165
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,644
Maria, a word.

166
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,446
Mrs. Craft needs
to rest today, yeah.

167
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:59,661
And, um...

168
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:02,706
she should not perhaps
take any alcohol.

169
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,460
You might let me know.

170
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,796
Yes, sir.

171
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,761
How are your children?

172
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:17,763
Good, sir.

173
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,265
Any sicknesses, you come to me, hmm?

174
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:22,392
Thank you, sir.

175
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:42,246
<i>While the children slept,</i>

176
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:44,457
<i>we played bridge.</i>

177
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:48,794
While the children slept,
we played "bwidge."

178
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,047
<i>As we played bridge,</i>

179
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:52,757
<i>the children slept.</i>

180
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:56,844
As we played bridge,
the children slept.

181
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,938
Try bluing on that.

182
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:11,025
It won't work, but you'll feel
a real sense of accomplishment.

183
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:13,570
Then throw the fucking thing away.

184
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,991
Hey, Pancho, got any more
of that hair oil?

185
00:18:18,158 --> 00:18:21,745
Got a date with this señorita
down Belvedere way,

186
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:25,499
wanna look me all<i> pachuco.</i>

187
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:30,671
Hey, Pancho, you hear me?

188
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:33,966
-That's Detective Pancho.
-Fuck you, Michener.

189
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:35,717
-No, fuck you, Riley.
-Hey, leave it.

190
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:37,636
You crack wise
one more fucking time,

191
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:42,808
my tongue might just slip about
that little girl of yours in Sonoratown.

192
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:45,144
Go on, one more time.

193
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:50,316
It was a fucking joke, Lewis.

194
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:53,611
Jesus, you two.

195
00:18:57,448 --> 00:19:00,159
-You don't need to do that.
-Fuck, I don't.

196
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:03,913
I can speak for myself.

197
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,790
Then do so.

198
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,796
Come in.

199
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:18,386
Maid called in
a missing persons this morning:

200
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:21,222
two adults and two juveniles.

201
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:26,394
We brought her by the morgue,
and she identified your bodies.

202
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:29,022
James Haslet and family.

203
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,399
From Beverly Hills.

204
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:35,487
633 North Canon Drive.

205
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,073
-Fuck.
-No kidding.

206
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,868
So we got four rich white victims
in the fucking L.A. River.

207
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:45,664
This gets out, we're looking
at a damn race war.

208
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,919
You don't know how much I wish
those bodies were Mexican.

209
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:53,130
No offense.

210
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,673
None taken.

211
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,759
But we don't know it was
Mexicans that killed them.

212
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,345
I saw the pictures, Detective.

213
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:01,388
I know what Spanish writing
looks like.

214
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,140
Maybe it's <i>pachucos.</i>

215
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:05,935
What do a bunch of JDs
want with Beverly Hills?

216
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:09,271
We'll check the house, sir.
Thanks.

217
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:24,287
Breathe in.
Breathe out.

218
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:26,956
Nice and deep.

219
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,709
Ah, that's it.
That's it. Okay, yeah.

220
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,086
One more time for me.
Deep breath now, Frank.

221
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:34,297
You see how it is with him,

222
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,007
how he suffers?

223
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:40,387
Oh, I've seen this before, Mrs. Brenson.
This is no cause for panic, you see.

224
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:42,847
I don't want a shot.

225
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:45,225
You're not going to get a shot,
young man.

226
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:49,146
But if you're a very good boy,
let me talk to your mother here,

227
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,606
my nurse outside will give you
a lollipop

228
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,109
and maybe even
a <i>Lone Ranger </i>book to color in.

229
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:56,069
Hmm?
How does that sound?

230
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:58,447
-May I?
-Yeah.

231
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:00,616
Yeah, of course.

232
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:03,076
I'll be right out.

233
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:06,205
And what do you say
to Dr. Craft?

234
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:07,748
Thank you, sir.

235
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,631
He's a good boy, Mrs. Brenson.

236
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:21,929
Most often asthma is brought on by
simple allergies we can treat.

237
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:23,639
It breaks my heart.

238
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:28,853
And my husband,
he does not understand Frank.

239
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,064
He has no-no patience, you see.

240
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:44,661
Uh, you know...

241
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:49,290
anxiety is often a trigger
for respiratory distress.

242
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:53,503
Is Frank subject
to any special tensions?

243
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,965
Where are you from?

244
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,510
Essen.

245
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:03,930
I am Berlin.
I was Berlin.

246
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:08,268
Now I'm Boyle Heights with the Jews.

247
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:13,065
It is hard for us there--
for me and Frank.

248
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,401
It is difficult
in this place for us.

249
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:22,658
My husband, he is American.

250
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:25,411
He's like all Americans here.

251
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:28,372
What is that?

252
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:32,543
He listens to the wrestling
on the radio. He drinks his beer.

253
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,089
He is curious about nothing.
He knows nothing.

254
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,842
My husband says
I have to be American.

255
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,056
My husband...

256
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:55,316
Does he hurt you?

257
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,114
Does he hurt the boy?

258
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:07,287
Ah, you poor girl.

259
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,252
You are a kind man.

260
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:17,339
If only we had met in Essen.

261
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:33,105
We'll-we'll, um...

262
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:35,399
We'll, uh, meet again in a week.

263
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:39,194
Anyway, I, um...

264
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:42,740
I wanna start a series
of, uh, allergy tests on Frank.

265
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:47,161
So...uh, next Friday, <i>ja?</i>

266
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,330
<i>Ja, </i>good.

267
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:52,333
Thank you, Dr. Craft.

268
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,835
I think I've soiled
your handkerchief.

269
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,004
Oh, keep it, please.

270
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:05,930
A gift...from Essen to Berlin.

271
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:09,642
<i>Ja, </i>good.

272
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,521
Next Friday, then.

273
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:32,352
Do you want me to bring you
something for lunch, Doctor?

274
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,521
Uh, no, I'm going out.

275
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,064
Thank you, Laura.

276
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,384
You will be ejected!

277
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,260
You will be ejected.
I will have order.

278
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:07,554
Sergeant at arms,
eject those people.

279
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:09,431
No more pictures!
Get them out!

280
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:11,809
You can't bar the press, Charlton.
It's a public hearing.

281
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:14,645
I can do whatever the hell I want.
Eject them!

282
00:26:14,812 --> 00:26:18,441
We will have no more outbursts
or intemperate language.

283
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:21,360
The transportation committee
has voted in favor

284
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:24,030
of construction of
the Arroyo Seco motorway.

285
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:26,782
The city council has approved
the recommendation.

286
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:31,120
The municipal court
has overturned the injunction.

287
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:36,292
So construction will continue
Monday morning as planned.

288
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:37,961
If any member of the public
would like

289
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,046
to speak in opposition
to the council's actions,

290
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:44,926
they may do so in modest
and economical terms.

291
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:47,220
I am Raul Vega.

292
00:26:47,387 --> 00:26:51,099
And I speak on behalf of the Belvedere
Heights Community Action Group,

293
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:53,435
the Congress of
Industrial Organizations,

294
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:55,729
and the Cannery Workers Union,
Local 417--

295
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:59,024
I know who you are, Mr. Vega.
Keep your remarks short.

296
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:02,194
Short as one question,
Mr. Townsend.

297
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:05,906
Where are we supposed to go?

298
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:08,033
Where are you supposed to go?

299
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,745
When your new motorway destroys
our homes...

300
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:17,042
our community, our church,
and our livelihood...

301
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:18,794
...where are we supposed to go?

302
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:22,464
Where you came from is not
a bad answer.

303
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:25,426
I was born in
Los Angeles County Hospital,

304
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:28,220
Mr. Townsend,
as I believe were you.

305
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,181
Don't you dare bandy words with me.

306
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:32,391
You would build a motorway
that cuts through the heart

307
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:35,061
of Belvedere Heights...

308
00:27:35,227 --> 00:27:36,979
through the house
where my mother lives,

309
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:39,065
through her kitchen,

310
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:42,527
through the shops and the cannery
that are our jobs,

311
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:47,115
all so that you could drive
to Pasadena with no stop signs.

312
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,159
What, sir, would you say if I was to put
a motorway through your kitchen?

313
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:53,746
I would say, "You can't stand in the way
of progress."

314
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,458
When progress becomes barbarity,

315
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,127
it ceases to be
in the public interest.

316
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:03,590
We are the public, sir,
no matter the color of our skin.

317
00:28:03,757 --> 00:28:06,593
-We will not be moved.
-Then you will be pushed.

318
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,720
Then the blood will be
on your hands.

319
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,639
Don't threaten me
with your goddamn--

320
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,474
This our home!

321
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:16,978
We will fight for it,
as good Americans have always done.

322
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,981
And yeah, <i>hermanos.</i>

323
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,275
Show them our will!

324
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:40,503
Officers, clear the chamber!
Eject them!

325
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:45,800
We will have no Bolshevik
agitation here!

326
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,802
Eject them!

327
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,352
And that's how
you conduct a meeting.

328
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,354
-You showed 'em, sir.
-Damn right.

329
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:01,691
You can't be weak with these Latins.
Their culture's all about machismo.

330
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:03,901
You show them the whip,
they back down.

331
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:08,364
As if a bunch of
taco stands and donkeys

332
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:10,533
can stand in the way of
the city of Los Angeles.

333
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,660
Exactly right, sir.

334
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:17,374
But a little less of that.

335
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,293
"Taco stands" and "donkeys."

336
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,630
You don't need that language
to get what you want.

337
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,382
You're going to win,
so you don't give

338
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:30,429
those bastards in the press
any easy ammunition.

339
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:33,348
You did magnificently today.

340
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,767
You were a strong man.

341
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:38,979
-Mussolini.
-Mussolini.

342
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:41,023
Hitler, even.

343
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:46,487
Now there's a fellow who understands
the judicious exercise of power.

344
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,030
That's right.

345
00:29:48,197 --> 00:29:50,699
Now you just have to stay
the course and keep quiet.

346
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:54,078
You held the public hearing
as your civic duty required.

347
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:57,540
You've won. We'll get this first
motorway under construction

348
00:29:57,706 --> 00:30:01,627
and then start working
on another one.

349
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:05,923
Keep your transportation committee front
and center, keep you in the papers.

350
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,051
-Another motorway?
-Maybe through Bunker Hill.

351
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:10,595
That's the colored's--

352
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:13,598
No, sir, what that is,
is too much valuable real estate

353
00:30:13,765 --> 00:30:15,767
filled with junkies and jig-whores.

354
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,685
Not when there's a motorway
to be built.

355
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,229
Motorway going where?

356
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:22,232
Does it matter?

357
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,778
Also, sir, I've scheduled
a meeting for this afternoon,

358
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:28,530
something rather special.

359
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:32,367
-What would I do without you?
-What indeed, sir.

360
00:30:39,749 --> 00:30:42,085
-Can I ask you something?
-Shoot.

361
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,672
Why'd you take me as your partner?

362
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:51,470
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

363
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:59,269
'Cause no one else wanted you.

364
00:31:01,397 --> 00:31:03,399
Now can I ask you a question?

365
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:07,862
How come you never wear a hat?

366
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:11,824
I want everybody to know
I'm Chicano.

367
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,664
Lewis...

368
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:22,960
...I know what it was,
the painting on the faces.

369
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:25,922
It's Day of the Dead makeup,
honoring Santa Muerte.

370
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:29,258
Which is what the fuck, exactly?

371
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:32,428
Folk religion
from the peasants in Mexico.

372
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:34,514
Santa Muerte's the angel
of holy death.

373
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:37,642
She's the one who brings
dead people to heaven.

374
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,894
Oh, she's the one who does that.

375
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:44,149
They built this
whole religion around her,

376
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,026
her and the other holy angels
and devils.

377
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:48,987
-So it's Mexicans for sure.
-We don't know that.

378
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:52,699
Well, true, there wasn't an actual
mariachi band at the crime scene.

379
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:57,079
Let me talk to my mother about it.
She knows all about Santa Muerte.

380
00:31:57,245 --> 00:32:00,958
-Why's that?
-She thinks she's a witch.

381
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:03,752
Oh, shut the fuck up.

382
00:32:06,588 --> 00:32:08,882
It's a strange ol' world.

383
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:42,291
Hello, fellow Americans.

384
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:46,588
Hello, fellow Angelinos.

385
00:32:46,754 --> 00:32:50,049
We are the German American Bund.

386
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:54,637
I promise not to ruin your lunch hour.
I'm on mine too.

387
00:32:56,222 --> 00:32:58,725
My name is Peter Craft.

388
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:02,562
And I live not too far from here.

389
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:06,399
I have two boys.

390
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:08,735
Tom and Trevor, they are called,

391
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:12,239
and I will do anything
to keep them safe.

392
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:17,494
So if there's a fight down the street,
I keep my boys out of it.

393
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:20,456
Why should their noses get bloodied
in someone else's fight?

394
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:23,292
Hmm?
What is it to do with us?

395
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,754
This country has a duty

396
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,381
to keep its children safe too.

397
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,760
And yet I hear so much talk

398
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,055
about America going down the street

399
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:39,225
and getting involved
in someone else's fight.

400
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,769
Surely, Europe is Europe

401
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,856
and America is America.

402
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:49,527
Why should we throw
our children into the quarrels

403
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,029
of nations so many miles distant

404
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,033
and so very alien to us?

405
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:59,287
What has it to do with America?

406
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,122
Look around you, my friends.

407
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,585
The sun is shining, you drink
a milk carton or a soda pop,

408
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,129
you eat a frankfurter...

409
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,423
which you can thank my people
for inventing, by the way.

410
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,218
<i>Ja.</i>
Ah, with mustard.

411
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,720
Oh, and sauerkraut over there.
Even--ah, I see you.

412
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:20,684
So let's enjoy our life here

413
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,311
and leave the Old World to itself.

414
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,233
I say America first.

415
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,153
America always.

416
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:34,323
Peace above all.

417
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,326
Come on, let's go.

418
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,813
One motorcycle, that's it?

419
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,192
We keep things discreet
here in Beverly Hills.

420
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:31,965
So they're true believers,
I take it.

421
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,775
<i>It is our sacred duty</i>

422
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,612
<i>to spread the good word</i>
<i>far and wide.</i>

423
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:58,033
<i>All across this land,</i>
<i>I see unhappiness and strife</i>

424
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,162
<i>and thousands of aching hearts</i>
<i>crying out</i>

425
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:04,915
<i>for the embrace of</i>
<i>their loving Father.</i>

426
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,668
<i>This, brothers and sisters,</i>
<i>is why I've--</i>

427
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,129
These fucking cultists now.

428
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,386
I'll take upstairs.

429
00:36:18,888 --> 00:36:20,390
Look for blood.

430
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:22,433
Don't forget the drains.

431
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,290
No bloodletting upstairs.

432
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:28,167
Or here, no forced entry.

433
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,169
Haslet was an elder in the church

434
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:34,132
or whatever lunatic thing
they call the big pooh-bahs there.

435
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:38,886
He was building
the Arroyo Seco, his company.

436
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:42,223
"You take our heart,
we take yours."

437
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:18,761
Councilman Townsend...
I am Richard Goss

438
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:21,430
of the building-architecture firm
Goss and Ossenberg.

439
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:25,351
-How do you do?
-Mr. Goss.

440
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,228
Thanks for meeting here.

441
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:30,397
Our dear Alex thought
discretion was advisable.

442
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,318
And why's that?

443
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:39,907
A gift from the Fuehrer.

444
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:43,202
My firm is doing some work
on the Reich Chancellery,

445
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:47,915
making everything
more...monumental.

446
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:51,210
We've also done much work
on the autobahn,

447
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:54,797
the motorways of Germany,
this is, for many years now.

448
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:59,928
Oh, I get it. You wanna start building
motorways here.

449
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:01,971
Only we can't hire foreign companies

450
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:03,890
'cause of national security
concerns.

451
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:08,478
This is of no matter.
Really, sir, what we want is

452
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:11,147
to make you
the mayor of Los Angeles.

453
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:15,944
You are a man we believe
with whom we can work.

454
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:21,491
I'm one member of the city council.

455
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:23,368
That's all.
Mayor is a long way off--

456
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:26,330
Not that far, especially if we keep

457
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,415
the transportation committee
in the public eye,

458
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:30,459
get you on the radio more.

459
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:32,669
Allow us to help.

460
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,048
And in return?

461
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:39,718
More motorways for us to build,
some government contracts

462
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:46,976
skirting perhaps some of the military's
more onerous regulations.

463
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:50,855
What we want is
a sympathetic ear, no more.

464
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,235
-For which you'll pay.
-Indecently.

465
00:39:56,402 --> 00:40:00,531
You see, we believe this place
is the future of America.

466
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,993
What is New York
but a filthy remnant

467
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,248
of Old World beliefs
filled with rat peddlers?

468
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:10,208
But Los Angeles...

469
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:14,754
this is a place where
a man can live under the sun

470
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:17,090
and spread his arms...

471
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:18,883
where there's breathing room.

472
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:24,598
The Fuehrer looks here and dreams.

473
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:29,978
Do you know what I did yesterday

474
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:32,773
under specific orders from Berlin?

475
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:34,900
I measured streets,

476
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:39,363
selecting that one which is most
appropriate for a victory parade,

477
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,740
wide enough for our panzer tanks.

478
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:45,244
It's Wilshire Boulevard, by the way.

479
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:47,830
-You got big plans.
-They're more than plans.

480
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:52,293
This is happening, sir,
as we speak, all over the city.

481
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:55,421
We have agents
in the aircraft factories,

482
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:57,757
in the ports, in the film studios.

483
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:01,302
You sure you should be telling me this?
What if I go to the FBI?

484
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:12,438
You see my driver there?

485
00:41:14,357 --> 00:41:16,818
He's Gestapo.
Do you know what that is?

486
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:21,030
If he doesn't see this conversation end
with a handshake,

487
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:26,119
I've instructed him to take his gun
and shoot you through the head.

488
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:31,082
And we'll have to find another
candidate for mayor, alas.

489
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,878
I won't betray my country.

490
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:38,048
Of course you will.

491
00:41:44,012 --> 00:41:45,555
Now I must be going.

492
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:48,767
It has truly been my pleasure,
Mr. Townsend.

493
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:52,479
Or shall I say, Your Honor?

494
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,484
The pleasure was mine, sir.

495
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:02,990
Heil Hitler.

496
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:06,889
-What the fuck--
-Mateo, stop! Leave him alone.

497
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:08,724
-What are you--
-Get the fuck out!

498
00:43:08,891 --> 00:43:10,392
Stop it!
Don't!

499
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,144
Stop it!

500
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:15,564
She's in high school, you pervert,
shithead! I'll never see you again!

501
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,858
Mateo,
he wasn't doing anything.

502
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:20,027
-You're not my father!
-Hey!

503
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:23,280
Josefina, no more.
Inside now!

504
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:25,491
Fucking bastard was feeling her up.

505
00:43:32,373 --> 00:43:35,459
No more!
No more words like that.

506
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,795
You were raised for better
than fighting in the street.

507
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:41,340
Yeah, like sweeping up
for three dollars a week?

508
00:43:41,507 --> 00:43:43,051
You'll do more.

509
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:47,972
Like the cannery or-or maybe
cleaning out toilets? Huh?

510
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:51,726
This is it.
There is no more.

511
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:53,436
If I thought that,

512
00:43:53,603 --> 00:43:56,064
we'd still be living in the barrio.

513
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:58,608
You'll make your way up, <i>mijo.</i>

514
00:43:58,775 --> 00:44:00,485
This is America.

515
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:04,614
You keep dreaming your dreams, Mama,

516
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:08,201
and maybe Santa Muerte will
make them come true one day.

517
00:44:08,368 --> 00:44:10,662
But for the rest of us...

518
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:13,915
...who wants a spic?

519
00:44:33,352 --> 00:44:36,063
Look at you, all grown up.

520
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:40,067
Mama, you got a minute?

521
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:46,657
Walk with me.

522
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:53,998
So you heard anything
from Santa Muerte lately?

523
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:59,087
You don't believe.
Why are you asking?

524
00:44:59,253 --> 00:45:00,964
Someone in the <i>bruja</i>
community, I mean,

525
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,757
something I should know about,

526
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:05,093
maybe some of violence,
some kind of curse.

527
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,512
Santa Muerte doesn't curse.

528
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,389
She's a holy angel.

529
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:12,851
She guide us peacefully to heaven.

530
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:15,061
She didn't guide my father
so peacefully.

531
00:45:15,228 --> 00:45:17,814
You were too young.
You don't remember.

532
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,692
He died burning in agony, Mom.
What don't I remember?

533
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:23,236
What did you want, Santiago?

534
00:45:24,696 --> 00:45:28,241
There's been some trouble, very bad,

535
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:30,494
and it looks like Mexicans.

536
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,329
I just want you to keep
your eyes open and let me know

537
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,915
if there's any special
Santa Muerte rituals going on,

538
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:37,209
black masses, anything with the <i>brujas</i>.

539
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:39,169
From this religion
you don't believe in.

540
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,130
-That's right.
-From this holy angel

541
00:45:41,296 --> 00:45:43,090
who touched your shoulder
and marked you?

542
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:45,884
-Please.
-When are you going to believe the truth

543
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:47,511
that is written on your own skin?

544
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,597
Not tonight.

545
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,342
So you'll help me out?

546
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,053
Listen for anything to do
with Santa Muerte?

547
00:46:30,972 --> 00:46:32,766
I'll do what I can.

548
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:36,478
But you have to think
about something.

549
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:39,189
This angel that
you don't believe in,

550
00:46:39,356 --> 00:46:41,942
you might need her one day.

551
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:43,777
What do you do then?

552
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:55,789
Come on.

553
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:58,626
You dance with your mother now.

554
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,629
These old men can't keep up.

555
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,685
And so he grabbed him
by the neck--huh--

556
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:40,688
dragged him out like fucking Tarzan.

557
00:48:40,855 --> 00:48:43,233
-Little Mateo?
-I swear.

558
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:46,194
He was like Johnny Weissmuller, huh?

559
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:48,238
Screaming, "You pervert" this,

560
00:48:48,404 --> 00:48:49,781
"You fuckhead" that,

561
00:48:49,948 --> 00:48:52,200
"You don't touch the tit
of my sainted sister."

562
00:48:52,367 --> 00:48:56,037
Hey, Mateo, you bust
that pervert good, huh?

563
00:48:56,204 --> 00:48:57,581
Oh, you're so funny.

564
00:48:57,747 --> 00:49:00,125
He was feeling her up with every fat
mama in town watching.

565
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:03,128
Oh, come on, like you never
felt up a girl in high school.

566
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:07,049
She's our sister.
She's not just some girl.

567
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:09,593
Jesus.
Mama burned my ass, though.

568
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:24,066
You working Monday?

569
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:27,069
Monday?
No.

570
00:49:27,236 --> 00:49:29,446
The Angels are playing.
I can get you tickets.

571
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:31,282
Maybe you take Josefina,
buy her something nice.

572
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:32,825
Stop it, Tiago.

573
00:49:32,992 --> 00:49:34,869
-He shouldn't be there.
-You shouldn't be there.

574
00:49:35,035 --> 00:49:37,330
-It's my job.
-It's your job to tear down our house?

575
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:39,999
-They're not tearing down our house.
-Not yet.

576
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,919
Look, Monday morning,
those bulldozers start up.

577
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:46,214
This is it, Raul.
I'm sorry, but this is it.

578
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,678
You know where they are...

579
00:49:51,844 --> 00:49:53,554
those machines?

580
00:49:54,722 --> 00:49:57,183
At the empty lot
across from the laundry,

581
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,726
where we used to play Tom Mix.

582
00:49:58,893 --> 00:50:01,855
They're calling in men from precincts
all over the goddamn city.

583
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:04,524
-We'll be ready.
-Keep Mateo out of it.

584
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:07,610
-I can make up my own mind.
-Shut the fuck up!

585
00:50:07,777 --> 00:50:09,988
If we let them push us out here,
where does it end?

586
00:50:10,155 --> 00:50:12,240
-When we're back in Mexico?
-That's done.

587
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:14,117
No one's talking about
deporting anyone, Raul.

588
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:16,369
-But this is how it starts!
-Come on.

589
00:50:18,163 --> 00:50:21,375
You know what? You're so goddamned
concerned, Tiago,

590
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,960
maybe you oughta go
to the Angels game

591
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:26,255
instead of fucking your people
one more time.

592
00:50:28,173 --> 00:50:31,969
You go against the cops,
they'll shoot you down like animals.

593
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:34,096
That's what you are to them.

594
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:37,308
And what are you?

595
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:44,315
Where's your heart, Tiago?

596
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:11,134
Fay Thomas is pitching Monday.
You oughta think about it.

597
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,880
What a pleasant surprise.
What the fuck are you doing here?

598
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:31,925
I'm not coming tomorrow.

599
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:36,221
-Say again?
-I'm not coming.

600
00:52:38,515 --> 00:52:40,475
It's our precinct.

601
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:44,020
You heard the captain.
We all gotta be there.

602
00:52:44,187 --> 00:52:45,731
I can't.

603
00:52:50,485 --> 00:52:53,363
So let me establish this
to my understanding.

604
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:57,785
It's your second day on the job,
and you're not gonna be there?

605
00:52:57,951 --> 00:53:00,370
Playing a quick nine at the Wilshire
Country Club, are you?

606
00:53:00,537 --> 00:53:04,083
-I don't expect you to understand.
-We got four bodies in the morgue,

607
00:53:04,249 --> 00:53:06,794
we got a fucking race riot
all scheduled for tomorrow,

608
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:08,546
and you're taking the day off?

609
00:53:10,756 --> 00:53:13,050
Listen, pal, in this life,

610
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:16,095
you're a cowboy or you're an Indian.

611
00:53:16,262 --> 00:53:18,723
You better fucking choose.

612
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:53,425
Holy angel, mother of death,
hear my plea.

613
00:53:53,592 --> 00:53:56,636
Holy angel, mother of death,
hear my...

614
00:53:56,803 --> 00:54:00,557
Holy angel, mother of death,
hear my plea.

615
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:03,560
Holy angel, mother of death,
hear my plea.

616
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:06,521
Mother of death, hear my plea.

617
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:11,777
Holy angel, mother of death,
hear my plea.

618
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,575
Holy angel, mother of death,
hear my plea.

619
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:53,862
Old coyote, why do you wake me?

620
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:58,533
I need your help.

621
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,910
There is evil walking now.

622
00:55:01,077 --> 00:55:03,496
I can feel it.

623
00:55:03,663 --> 00:55:06,499
If you're dying, I will come to you.

624
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:11,004
But if your leg is in a trap,
you must chew it off yourself.

625
00:55:11,171 --> 00:55:17,219
I will see you in your final moment...
old coyote.

626
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:19,805
Please help me.

627
00:55:19,972 --> 00:55:21,473
Please, please help me.

628
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,017
Help me, please.
Help.

629
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:31,692
There is a prophecy.

630
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,945
A time will come

631
00:55:35,112 --> 00:55:38,282
when nation will battle nation,

632
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:42,203
when race will devour race,

633
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:46,791
when brother will kill brother...

634
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:49,961
...until not a soul is left.

635
00:55:51,712 --> 00:55:53,965
And is that time now?

636
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:57,051
-Who can say?
-You can.

637
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:11,232
But there are
so many corpses to gather.

638
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:16,154
Everywhere I look...

639
00:56:17,364 --> 00:56:19,574
And every step I take...

640
00:56:22,577 --> 00:56:26,289
I wade through that agony.

641
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:33,338
I have no heart to care for man.

642
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:36,675
No.
Please, no.

643
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:39,720
The time you speak of is now,
and it's here, right here.

644
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:41,263
We have to do something!

645
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,224
Don't ask me, coyote.

646
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:46,101
You slept too long!

647
00:56:46,268 --> 00:56:47,728
Enough.

648
00:56:47,895 --> 00:56:51,690
There is a great battle coming,
and it's here!

649
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,318
And we need you here,
and we need you now!

650
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:56,195
Will you sleep

651
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:58,656
as your bitch of a sister conquers--

652
00:57:23,014 --> 00:57:25,934
-Mama?
-Will you be there tomorrow?

653
00:57:27,018 --> 00:57:28,728
When that construction starts.

654
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,607
-No, I-I decided--
-You have to.

655
00:57:32,774 --> 00:57:36,194
-Santa Muerte spoke to me.
-Jesus.

656
00:57:36,361 --> 00:57:38,071
She chose you!

657
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,451
You'll lie to yourself
but not to me.

658
00:57:42,617 --> 00:57:45,203
This is who you are.

659
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:48,123
Tomorrow, you have to stop it,

660
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,083
whatever it takes.

661
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:53,796
Or?

662
00:57:55,672 --> 00:58:00,594
It all ends in blood or in fire.

663
00:58:02,638 --> 00:58:05,432
You saw her.
You know it happened.

664
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,060
Santa Muerte chose you.

665
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:17,320
You couldn't save your father.
Maybe you can save yourself.

666
00:59:33,648 --> 00:59:36,567
Well, good morning, sunshine.

667
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:39,112
Couldn't get a tee time at Wilshire?

668
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:42,991
-I'm sorry about all that.
-Forget it, partner.

669
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:44,867
I'm glad you're here.

670
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:51,875
You will disperse.
This is an illegal action.

671
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,463
We will have no disobedience.

672
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,299
If you do not disperse,

673
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:01,593
you will be arrested.

674
01:00:04,721 --> 01:00:07,265
You will disperse.

675
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:48,808
You know how many times I've
fired my weapon in the job?

676
01:00:50,643 --> 01:00:52,437
Never.

677
01:01:16,378 --> 01:01:19,423
Whatever you're about to do, don't.

678
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,967
I used to play on this street.

679
01:01:22,134 --> 01:01:24,219
You don't anymore.

680
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:45,866
What's this now?

681
01:01:57,587 --> 01:02:03,801
You all know me. I grew up there.
That's-that's my house.

682
01:02:03,968 --> 01:02:05,636
You know that.

683
01:02:07,555 --> 01:02:09,599
So listen to me.

684
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,394
You need to go home now.

685
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:18,942
No matter what you think,
no matter what you hope,

686
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:21,236
you can't stop this!

687
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,938
<i>Por favor.</i>

688
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,194
<i>Por favor.</i>

689
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,711
Shame!

690
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:55,268
Stay down!
Stay down now!

691
01:05:06,154 --> 01:05:07,781
No.

692
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:27,176
Raul!

693
01:05:30,346 --> 01:05:32,598
Raul!

694
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:34,600
Raul!

695
01:05:41,065 --> 01:05:42,775
Raul, no!

695
01:05:43,305 --> 01:06:43,494
