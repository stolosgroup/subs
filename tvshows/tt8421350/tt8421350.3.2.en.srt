1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:03,003
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:03,829
Jace: If I don't
get back what's mine,

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,048
I'm gonna kill him.

4
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,007
Let him go!
Drop your weapon!

5
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:10,488
Ben: Zeke following the Calling,
saving Cal,

6
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,316
that's how
he beat the Death Date.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,840
No one's come out of that lake.
They have to be in there.They're not.

8
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,407
Michaela: In our Calling,
there was a woman.

9
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,192
She seemed like she was
really in danger.

10
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,410
Olive:
Angelina Meyer...

11
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,282
Parents own homes
in Costa Rica.

12
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:22,935
It's been months,
and no word.

13
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,329
I told the police we'd bring
Angelina to report her parents.

14
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,244
I just want to get out of here.
With you.

15
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,594
Saanvi: She took my work.
She took everything.

16
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,161
Sarah: My mom worked
for the government.

17
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:33,076
What happened to her
is somehow related

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,164
to Flight 828.

19
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,687
My God.

20
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,080
Ben:
That tailfin in Cuba

21
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,603
is the tailfin from 828.

22
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:40,431
There's no other way
it would've done this to my hand

23
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:41,693
or put us into
that Calling.

24
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:42,694
Boss. We got company.

25
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,000
We've got a good lead
on them!

26
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,610
Not enough!
Stop the truck!

27
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,917
They want the tailfin -- they'll
shoot us out of the sky for it.

28
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,179
Get this to my wife.

29
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:51,181
You're gonna want to do
something to help me.

30
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:53,053
Do not.
I'll handle it.

31
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,315
Still no nightmares?

32
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,925
I'm not having
the nightmares, but...

33
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:58,362
all of a sudden, I just feel
like I did before.

34
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,668
When they were here.

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

36
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,220
Hi.

37
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:33,702
I thought you could use
a bit of caffeine.

38
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:36,835
Thank you.

39
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,750
So, how are you doing?

40
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:40,404
I'm fine.

41
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:42,319
It's been less than
24 hours.

42
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,234
You don't have to be fine.

43
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,149
But you are safe.

44
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,499
And if there's anything
you need...

45
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,721
This must be Eden?

46
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,940
Yeah, it is.

47
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:57,334
She's zonked.

48
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:59,945
She's perfect.

49
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,035
I like you already.

50
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,039
I'm sure you don't really want
to be around people right now.

51
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,955
But whenever you're ready,

52
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,132
we're here for you.

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,832
Hey, have you, uh,
seen my glasses?

54
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:21,010
I found exactly where we were
when they took Vance.

55
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,533
Huh.

56
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,448
And judging by the size
of this road, it's the only way

57
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,407
they could have gotten
the tailfin in or out, so --

58
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,625
Ben.

59
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,627
Didn't Vance tell you
to stay out of it?

60
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,194
He must have a plan,

61
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,717
and someone to help him
with it.

62
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,198
Well, we still don't know
if the Major was working alone,

63
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:37,287
so Vance can't trust anyone
in the government.

64
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:41,117
And he's adamant
no one can know he's alive.

65
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,033
I have to go back in
with Emmett.

66
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,643
Ben, you'll be caught.

67
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:48,211
Probably before
you even take off.

68
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:51,171
No, Vance showed us
how to get in and out
of US airspace undetected.

69
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:53,695
No one even knows
I was gone.

70
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,351
Woman: Good morning.

71
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,135
We're here to see
Ben Stone.

72
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,051
Uh, y-- just a...

73
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,400
Ben?
Huh?

74
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,837
We'll only need
a few minutes of his time.

75
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:10,407
Of course.
Please, come in.

76
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,368
Ben Stone?

77
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,934
Director Zimmer
from the Pentagon.

78
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:19,068
This is Assistant Secretary
Greene, DoD,

79
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,635
and Agent Powell, NSA.

80
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:21,810
We've met.

81
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,595
My colleagues and I
would like a word.

82
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,556
Bowers:
How the hell am I supposed
to get boots on the ground

83
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,035
when you won't approve
my overtime?

84
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,474
That's not what I was told
last month.

85
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:36,085
I got five officers
wanting to do graveyard,

86
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:38,000
and I don't have the budget.

87
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,350
Then put up the money.

88
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,265
Welcome back, Detective.

89
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,702
Thank you...

90
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,835
Lieutenant?
Mm-hmm.

91
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,358
Congrats!

92
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,404
You know, every time
I go away for a minute,

93
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,362
I come back
and you've been promoted.

94
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:53,755
Ah. Yeah.

95
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:58,238
Except this time, you're the one
who's married, so...

96
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,372
Looks like you got plenty
to keep you occupied.

97
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,721
Look, I don't want to add
to your workload.

98
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,462
There is a cold case
I want to talk to you about.

99
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,116
This woman came in here
looking for you and said --

100
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,770
I'm sorry. Wait a sec.

101
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:09,945
What is it?

102
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:11,686
This just came in
a couple hours ago.

103
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,558
Why would a fish and game warden
be calling you?

104
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,430
I gave my card to the guy
who patrols the lake

105
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,388
where Cal and the meth dealers
fell through the ice.

106
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:19,955
I told him to contact me

107
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,263
if there was ever
any unusual activity.

108
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:24,829
Detective Stone.

109
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,222
My office, please.

110
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,093
Mm...

111
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,313
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

112
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,836
Thank you.Mm.

113
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:37,320
Zimmer: A cargo plane with
no registered flight plan landed

114
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,279
at a nearby decommissioned
airport yesterday.

115
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,584
That's interesting.

116
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,412
I'm just not sure
what it has to do with me.

117
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,806
We know you were on that plane,
Mr. Stone.

118
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:47,635
What we don't know is
who you're working for
or what they're up to.

119
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,898
Maybe you convinced someone
in the NSA to help?

120
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,595
It wouldn't be
the first time.

121
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,902
You somehow convinced
my old boss Robert Vance

122
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,773
to work with you,
and you got him killed.

123
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,080
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt.

124
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,777
Are you all planning
to stay for lunch?

125
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,953
No, we --Because this is either
a situation

126
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,738
where we're going
to need lawyers...

127
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:04,869
And warrants.

128
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:06,523
...or you're rolling up
your sleeves

129
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,005
and helping me
with the calzone.

130
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,833
So, which is it?

131
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,794
Thank you
for your time.

132
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,845
The truth
shall set you free.

133
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,286
So much for going out
undetected. Now what?

134
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,550
You cannot be expected
to single-handedly defy
the federal government.

135
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:35,639
I know, but it's my fault
Vance is being held in Cuba.

136
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,989
I have to get him out.

137
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:43,212
At least...

138
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,345
At least I have to try.

139
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:51,002
I know you do.

140
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:54,049
When I got suspended, I kind of
thought that was it for me.

141
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:56,486
It was.

142
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,532
The CCRB recommended
termination.

143
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:02,013
But someone intervened
on your behalf.

144
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,885
You?

145
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,148
And let me tell you,
it wasn't easy.

146
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:09,064
But I believe in you as a cop,
so I put my ass on the line.

147
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,848
You screw it up, I'm out.

148
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,807
Captain, I would never want
you to lose your job
on my account --

149
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,852
Oh, I have no intention
of losing my job.

150
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,506
So you're gonna have to
make a choice.

151
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,073
You're either gonna
follow the rules --

152
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:20,380
no more sneaking around,
no more anonymous tips --

153
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:24,166
or quit right now.

154
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,690
Your rules. Got it.

155
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:29,998
Now, why do you
have on your coat?

156
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,174
Are you going somewhere?

157
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,393
I got a tip.

158
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,568
Uh, not -- not anonymous.

159
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,613
Um, the park ranger
up by the lake

160
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,180
where the meth heads
disappeared,

161
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:39,877
they have a suspicious video
that they want me to go --

162
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,618
This is the case
that led to your suspension,

163
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,011
and you want
to open it back up?

164
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:44,534
Well, the bodies were
never recovered,

165
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:45,927
so technically,
it is still op--

166
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,581
I'm asking permission
to take

167
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:49,365
Lieutenant Vasquez up there
to check it out.

168
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,194
Vasquez isn't your partner.
Mikami is.

169
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,717
Also, it isn't 1973 --

170
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,589
no one has to drive anywhere
to see footage.

171
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:57,634
Have Park Services
email it.
Got it.

172
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:59,244
And if something is there,

173
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:02,509
you and Mikami can go
check it out.

174
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:06,991
Nice to have you back,
Detective.

175
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:12,649
Hello? My appointment
was 30 minutes ago!

176
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,654
Sorry. I know --
I know you've been waiting.

177
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,570
Um, you ready?

178
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:21,484
You can go ahead of me.

179
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,443
Thank you.

180
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,316
Thank you.
You okay?

181
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,057
Totally.
I'm just -- I'm swamped.

182
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:33,104
Can you get that for me?
Buzzer's right there.

183
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,410
Thank you so much.

184
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,024
You're back!
Hi!

185
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,462
Never leave me
ever again!

186
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,681
There she is!
Hi!

187
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,118
How are you, D?!Oh, so much better.

188
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,686
Man, it was so boring
without you here.

189
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,775
They stuck me
with Wycoff.
Ooh!

190
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,516
Yeah, I learned
I never need to be around

191
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,518
a miniature train enthusiast
ever again.

192
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,606
Mm.

193
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,042
So, what are we
working on?

194
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,480
Hunting down an arms dealer?
Locating a bank robber?

195
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:01,829
Something cool like that?Yes, yes.

196
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,570
We're waiting
for a file to load.

197
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,310
Ohh, and suddenly,
I miss Wycoff.

198
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:07,095
I got a lead on some activity
near the lake

199
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,966
where Cal and the meth heads
went in.

200
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,881
That's crazy
they never found the bodies.

201
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,796
You think they snuck away
that night?

202
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,930
That's one possibility.Well, what's the other?

203
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,373
Oh, my God.

204
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:30,031
Ben, you need to call me back
right away when you get this.

205
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:33,338
The three guys
who kidnapped Cal...

206
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,688
They're alive again.

207
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:48,179
Mick's headed up there now.

208
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,354
Why them?

209
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:50,878
Why do they
get to come back

210
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,575
after everything
they've done to us, to Cal?

211
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,186
I don't know.
The universe doesn't seem
to have a moral barometer.

212
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,190
I mean, Griffin came back, and
he was a cold-blooded killer.

213
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:02,280
Okay, okay, okay.

214
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,544
Let's put ourselves
in their shoes.

215
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,763
They come out
of that lake, alive.

216
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,070
Last thing they'd remember
is kidnapping Cal

217
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,855
and falling into the ice
with him.

218
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,511
What if they want revenge?

219
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,208
They might think
he's dead.

220
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,558
That's good.

221
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,995
Let's keep it that way.

222
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:21,996
84 days.

223
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,388
They returned
after 84 days,

224
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,782
which means they only have
84 days until they die.

225
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:27,567
Okay, so, for 84 days,

226
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,046
we just keep Cal
far, far away from them.

227
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,745
Yeah.
Question is, where?

228
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,660
Well, not here.
Yeah. Agreed.

229
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,400
We need to take him somewhere
no one would ever

230
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:38,186
connect back to us.

231
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,580
My stepdad's place.

232
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,103
It's off the beaten path.

233
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:44,409
It'd be difficult to connect it
back to our family.

234
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,107
Grace, it...

235
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,543
Yeah.

236
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,718
Tarik owns it, though.

237
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:52,156
You haven't talked to him
in years.

238
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,594
He's not gonna turn away
his own sister.

239
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,031
I mean, we could all go.

240
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,164
What is it?

241
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:02,732
Vance.

242
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,995
I've got to help him,
Grace.

243
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,742
How long would you need?

244
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,091
A-A day or two.

245
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,006
Talk to Emmett, hopefully
get a plan in motion,

246
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,356
get to you
by the weekend.

247
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,622
Okay.

248
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,145
Tell the kids.

249
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,799
I'll pack.

250
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,808
Okay, so, the lake is
over there.

251
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,071
In the video,
they were walking southwest.

252
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:39,334
I mean,
this seems right.

253
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,857
Yeah,
till the trail splits.

254
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,033
Which way now?

255
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,168
Hey, what's that?

256
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,041
It's wet.

257
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,478
I think we're on
the right track.

258
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:54,697
Woman: Hello?!

259
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,830
If you can hear me,
please help!

260
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,659
There.
Help! Help!

261
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,530
It's -- It's okay.
We're NYPD.

262
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,705
My husband!

263
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:03,924
I got a pulse.
There's a head wound.

264
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,099
Call an ambulance.

265
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,796
Can you tell me
what happened?

266
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,885
These three men,
they came out of nowhere and --

267
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,800
and one --
one of them just --

268
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,846
just kept hitting him
over the head with a rock,

269
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,325
and they just kept
hitting him.

270
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,718
You're doing great, okay?
You're doing great.

271
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,155
They, um...
They -- They took our RV,

272
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:22,986
and then one of them kept
screaming, "What month is it?"

273
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,336
You have to catch them!

274
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,818
I don't think
I ever met him.

275
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,603
Oh, you did.
You just don't remember.

276
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,301
He's mom's step-brother,
right?

277
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:35,869
Yep.
And why don't they
get along?

278
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,653
You know that adults
don't always

279
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,350
say and do
the right thing.

280
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,048
Feelings get hurt,

281
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,833
especially
when it comes to family.

282
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,444
But he's your mom's
little brother,

283
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:49,012
and she loves him.

284
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,535
A lot.

285
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,119
Are you okay?

286
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,686
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

287
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,297
Sometimes I see things.
Please don't tell anyone.

288
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:16,692
No, no. It's okay.

289
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,389
My Aunt Mick, she...

290
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,697
told me a little bit about
what happened to you.

291
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,787
And how your parents
reacted to, um...

292
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:29,618
well, we say "Callings."

293
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:34,057
They thought
my visions were a sign

294
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:37,278
that I was gonna bring about
the End of Days.

295
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,543
It won't stop.

296
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,892
It keeps coming back.

297
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:46,548
That just means
you haven't solved it yet.

298
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,898
What did you see?

299
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,553
Someone...

300
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,903
is stalking me.

301
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:59,256
It has wings and no face.

302
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,912
Just before
it reached me, it...

303
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,132
it transformed into
millions of colors

304
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:08,091
and then just shattered
like glass.

305
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,833
Sometimes the Callings
only show you something

306
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,096
that youwould know.

307
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,101
Do any of these details
mean anything to you?

308
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,888
Wait, there was
a-a stained glass window

309
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,933
at my old school
in Syosset.

310
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,370
A-An archangel?

311
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:28,111
Well, maybe the Callings
want you to go back

312
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:31,811
to your old school.

313
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,770
Oh! Hold on.
Let me help. Let me help.

314
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,641
Thank you.Did you get a hold of him?

315
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:37,991
No, voicemail's full.

316
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:40,080
I'll try again later.

317
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,125
It'll be good to get back
into those woods.

318
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,823
Cal's gonna love it
there.

319
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,346
This one's Olive's?No, it's mine.

320
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,306
I'm ready to come
the minute I'm done.

321
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,569
Girls, where are your suitcases?
We need to go.

322
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,834
Mom, Dad,
we're not going.

323
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,096
E-Excuse me?

324
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,011
Olive, there are
dangerous men out there.

325
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,577
Angelina had a Calling.

326
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,145
And we just figured out
what it might mean.

327
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,755
I don't want
to cause a problem.

328
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,845
No, no, no.
You're not.

329
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,065
She's had the same one
over and over,

330
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,851
and she's finally able
to follow it.

331
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,418
We can't let her
ignore a Calling.

332
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:18,727
If Angelina stays,
I could help her.

333
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,903
You really don't think
I can do this, do you?

334
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,862
No, that's --
No, Olive,
it's not that.

335
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,124
We're worried.

336
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,909
I'm supposed to do this
with her, Mom.

337
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,346
I'm supposed to help her.

338
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,870
I know it.

339
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:34,656
I know it, too.

340
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:37,050
Our family split up
like this before,

341
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,095
seven years ago
in an airport in Jamaica.

342
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,358
And it ended up
saving Cal's life.

343
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,795
And this is gonna
keep him safe, too.

344
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:52,892
Well, then,
I guess this is goodbye.

345
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,937
Come here.

346
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,330
For now.

347
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,554
There you go.

348
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,295
Bring all your patients
in here?

349
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,558
Uh, just the ones who die
and came back to life.

350
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,519
This is unbelievable.
What?

351
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,390
Something wrong with me?No, not a single thing.

352
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:16,176
I see no trace of the frostbite
or the gangrenous tissue

353
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,221
that was consuming you
3 1/2 months ago.

354
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:22,225
So...so surviving the Death Date
gave me a do-over?

355
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,097
Not just on my life,
but on my health?

356
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,186
There's more. I see no trace
of the ischemic blood marker

357
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:29,276
that all returnees have,
that you had.

358
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,017
So I'm guessing that --
Yeah.

359
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,628
No more Callings.
I'm a Muggle again.

360
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,543
Oh.

361
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,066
You sure you're okay?

362
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,547
Yeah, I'm just...busy.

363
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,550
Hey, man.
Hey.

364
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,508
Check your phone.
Mick's been trying to call you.

365
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,293
My battery died.
I've been looking for
apartments all morning.

366
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:49,252
Is everything okay?

367
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:51,124
The meth heads
are back.

368
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,953
From out of the lake?

369
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,259
Alright, I will try
and reach Mick.

370
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,873
Saanvi, the meth heads aren't
the only problem.

371
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,440
Some agents from the DoD
and the NSA

372
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,747
happened to be
in my neighborhood this morning.

373
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,009
Do they know about Vance?

374
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,315
I didn't say a word,

375
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,795
but Vance's old deputy
seemed suspicious.

376
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,233
Do you think they know anything
about the tailfin?

377
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:16,018
Could you imagine how the world
would react if that got out?

378
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,585
The scrutiny
we would be under again.

379
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:20,718
No, what really scares me
is the Major finding out.

380
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,807
Mm. Yeah.

381
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,636
Especially...
if she saw this.

382
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,465
What happened?!
I don't know.

383
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,685
When I touched the tailfin,
Saanvi, it blew me back

384
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,818
like an electrical shock,
and then this happened.

385
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:36,386
I got to take a sample
and clean it.
No, no, later.

386
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,127
Right now, I really need you
to contact Emmett.

387
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:40,303
Hand first, please.

388
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,394
Jared: We got a hit
on the RV plates.

389
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,135
They were spotted southbound
on the highway out by --

390
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,876
Love it when things line up
like that.

391
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,660
We are going northbound.

392
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:50,966
Thanks, Jay.

393
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,707
Actually,
that's Lieutenant Jay.

394
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,754
Yes, sir. Over and out.

395
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,238
No! Unh-unh.
Do not look at me like that.

396
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:04,153
I'm just enjoying things
being back to normal.

397
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:05,720
I didn't say anything.

398
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,505
I was just appreciating some
casual banter between two people

399
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,725
who used to be engaged
to be married.

400
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:12,640
There.

401
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,424
That might be them.

402
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,735
Gotcha.

403
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,678
Look out!

404
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,863
You okay?

405
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:04,083
Yeah. I'm fine.
Are you?

406
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,997
No. Damn it!

407
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,963
Come on, Jace.
This is insane.

408
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:18,227
Yeah.
Yeah, it is insane.

409
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,577
We fell through the ice
and made it out alive.

410
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:23,232
It was winter
when we went in the lake

411
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,408
and spring
when we came out.

412
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,888
We should be dead now.

413
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,237
I think we weredead,

414
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,109
and we came back to life
or something.

415
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,023
Like 828.

416
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,590
Like that damn cop
and the kid.

417
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:36,202
Look, w-why don't we
just stop running?

418
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,378
And give up?

419
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:39,640
What happened to you?

420
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,555
The same thing
that happened to you!

421
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,426
I mean, this is a miracle,
and you know it!

422
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,733
A-And I don't think that we
should be beating people up

423
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,778
and -- and fire-bombing
the cops!

424
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:50,564
I don't give a rat's ass
about any of those people.

425
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,306
You used to be the guy
that took care of everyone.

426
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,090
Y-You remember when
you spent all the money

427
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,439
from your --
your after-school job

428
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,659
to pay for the high-tops
for me and Kory?

429
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,357
We had the best kicks
on the block.

430
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,275
I hadn't thought about that job
in years.

431
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,496
Hey, m-maybe that's why
we came back.

432
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,194
T-To do things
differently.

433
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,850
Maybe you're right.

434
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:21,682
Hey, Kory, pull over, man.
I'm gonna drive.

435
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,082
What the hell?

436
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,693
We're supposed to have
no contact for three weeks.

437
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,782
Yeah, well, and Vance was
supposed to come home with us.

438
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,219
Now, look, I've put together
everything I can remember.

439
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,960
If we fly back into here,
I think --

440
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,831
Cuba?
You're not serious.

441
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,703
About saving Vance's life?
Dead serious.

442
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,792
Stone,
you're a math professor.

443
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,794
I spent my life
in military intelligence,

444
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,491
and I can assure you we ain't
getting him out on our own,

445
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:49,797
no matter how many maps
you draw up.

446
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,364
Well, I'm not gonna
just give up on him.

447
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,801
Yeah, you are.
'Cause we don't have
the resources.

448
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,716
And Vance doesn't want
to involve the government.

449
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,891
It's a direct order.

450
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,545
Yeah, they're already
sniffing around.

451
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,808
I had a house call
this morning.

452
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,376
And, no, of course,
I didn't say anything.

453
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,509
There's got to be
another way.

454
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,772
If there is,
he'll figure it out.

455
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,905
You need to stand down.

456
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,649
So, how does this work?

457
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,520
How do I take this ring
to Vance's wife

458
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:19,218
and tell her that
he's not coming home

459
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,394
and that I'm standing down?

460
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,401
I don't know.

461
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,055
I'm just glad he asked you
to do it and not me.

462
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,276
Yeah.

463
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:42,371
There. That's it.

464
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,373
Th-Those wings...

465
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,288
Th-Those are
peacock feathers.

466
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,682
We're definitely
supposed to be here.

467
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:53,339
This is what's been
following me.

468
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:56,255
Last time, it was
holding up its hand --

469
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,605
the one that's holding
the scales.

470
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:02,348
Do...scales mean anything
to you?

471
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,784
Not really.

472
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:07,570
I mean, Archangel Michael uses
them to weigh your soul

473
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:10,878
on Judgment Day
to see if you're worthy.

474
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:14,185
Okay, so, the figure
in your calling, right,

475
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,406
it doesn't have a face.

476
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,321
Neither does the Archangel.

477
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,715
Yeah, I was here
when that happened.

478
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,586
My class made
time capsules,

479
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,241
and when we were choosing where
we each wanted to bury them,

480
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,460
some kids were
messing around,

481
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,375
and a rock sailed
right into the window.

482
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:33,204
You buried a time capsule
right around here?

483
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,728
I know exactly
where mine would be,

484
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:36,599
but there's not much
in that box.

485
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:39,733
Okay, the Callings --
they led us here, right?

486
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,430
And the figure
was faceless,

487
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,519
so that means it wanted you
to remember that day.

488
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:47,697
I-I think the Calling
is leading us to the box.

489
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,876
Right here.

490
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:31,785
Hi.

491
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:38,052
What, uh...

492
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:40,446
10 years, you just...

493
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,405
show up on my doorstep.

494
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,886
I know. I'm sorry.

495
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,975
Don't even bother
to call first.

496
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,672
No, I --
Y-You didn't pick up.

497
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:51,587
But you knew
I'd be here 'cause,

498
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:53,763
"Where else he gonna be?"

499
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,681
Tarik --
Let me guess.

500
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,857
You need something.

501
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:07,821
Yeah. I do.

502
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:09,039
I need help.

503
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,519
I needed help once.

504
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:14,001
Called on the one person
who I thought would help.

505
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:15,219
She said no.

506
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,700
There was more to it
than that.

507
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,400
Ben was working
all the time.

508
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:24,011
I was really overwhelmed.
The twins were so little --

509
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,229
Sure. Sure.

510
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:29,103
You had your family
to worry about.

511
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:31,366
You are my family, Tarik.

512
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,064
You're my only brother.

513
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:36,197
So you figured
I'd be the one person

514
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,547
to always be there for you,

515
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,115
no matter what, right?

516
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,119
Right.

517
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:48,905
Wrong.

518
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,445
Yeah, held up pretty well,
considering.

519
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,229
Let's see what's inside,
though.

520
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:21,764
This is from our first trip
to Costa Rica.

521
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:29,424
Oh, my God. King Kone.

522
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:34,473
They used to take me there
on special occasions.

523
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,778
Your parents?

524
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:38,912
They were almost
normal then.

525
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:41,523
I had no idea
what they'd do to me one day,

526
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:44,787
how they'd...

527
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:49,792
You know, I keep trying to find
the right thing to say,

528
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:54,318
to tell you
how sorry I am for...

529
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:56,973
all that you've been through.

530
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:01,325
But the only thing
I can think of is,

531
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:02,631
"That sucks."

532
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:06,983
It does.

533
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:09,551
It does suck.

534
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,292
It's hard to believe
I was ever happy,

535
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:16,558
but this -- this picture
is proof  I was.

536
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:24,566
Maybe the Calling wanted you
to have that photo.

537
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,004
To remind you what it was like
to be happy.

538
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:31,617
It's gonna take more than
a picture of a slushie.

539
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,662
What about tasting one?

540
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,229
I just want to get rid
of these visions.

541
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:38,624
If a slushie will help,
I'll have 12 of them.

542
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:43,367
-Boy: Yeah! Nice!
-Boy #2: Aw, man!

543
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:47,589
Do the boys know that he's been
in hiding this whole time?

544
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,071
Only thing
that's kept me sane

545
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,986
is knowing that one day
I'll be able to tell them

546
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,728
that he's finally
coming home.

547
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,165
I suspect
that day is not today.

548
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,081
Estelle, we were ambushed
by the Cuban military.

549
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,257
He's not coming home
anytime soon.

550
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,215
I am so sorry.
No.

551
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,609
No, he told me that after this
he'd be done.

552
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:10,046
Estelle, I hate that
you and your family
are going through this,

553
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,788
especially since I was the one
that dragged him to Cuba.

554
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,051
You're the one who dragged him
into all of this!

555
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,619
It's your fault that the world
has to think that he's dead,

556
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:20,056
and, yes,
thisis your fault!

557
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,407
So if you're looking
for absolution,

558
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,148
get him back.

559
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:26,672
Do you hear me?

560
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,587
Fix this.

561
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,937
I don't care what it takes.

562
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:36,595
Uh, he asked me
to give you this.

563
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,864
I swore that I'd never
marry a man

564
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:47,997
whose life was
shrouded in secrets.

565
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:51,871
Look what he put inside.

566
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:57,790
"You shall know the truth."

567
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:01,924
"And the truth shall
set you free."

568
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:03,839
The truth shall
set you free?

569
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:07,800
Would anyone else know
that he used that quote?

570
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:11,281
Only the people who loved him
enough to visit his grave.

571
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,544
It's right on his tombstone.

572
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,336
Do you really think the Calling
wanted us to get slushies?

573
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:25,078
Mm, I have no idea.

574
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:28,429
But, uh, I'm so glad
that we did.

575
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,389
Can I have a napkin?

576
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,784
You know, this might be
the most fun

577
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:40,789
I've ever had following
a Calling, so thank you.

578
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:44,227
No, thank you.
I needed this.

579
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:46,795
Oh! And here comes
the brain freeze.

580
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:55,674
Great, and -- and can I pay
for the room with cash?

581
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,588
Sure. Yeah --

582
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:58,764
Hello?

583
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,287
Hello? You there?

584
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,683
Cal: Oh,
there's Uncle Tarik.

585
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,249
Well,
that's a good sign.

586
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,774
It is?
Yeah.

587
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,689
When he was little
and he wanted to talk,

588
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,429
he would sulk within view.

589
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,743
You any good at horse?

590
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:30,796
What are we doing here?

591
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,188
You jogged my memory
earlier,

592
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,451
when you mentioned
how it used to be.

593
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:36,192
Back when I worked here.

594
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,717
I'll bet Ron and Julie never
bothered to change the combo

595
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,631
to the safe in the back.

596
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:43,591
W-- Hey, Jace!

597
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,462
L-Let's just go.
Alright?

598
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:47,377
Wouldn't it be better if --
if everyone thought

599
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,423
that we were still
at the bottom of that lake?

600
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:51,730
You saw the looks
on those cops' faces.

601
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,035
They know we're back.

602
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,342
Well, then,
l-let's just disappear.

603
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,430
I-I-I don't know.

604
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:58,998
Go to Canada or whatever.For sure.

605
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,783
But first, we got
scores to settle.

606
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,480
Now, let's go.

607
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:08,224
We're gonna do a smash-and-grab
and peal out in an RV?

608
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,661
We might have to improvise.

609
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:21,150
Jared: State troopers got a tip
about three guys

610
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,239
getting out of an RV.
One had a knife.

611
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,285
They're at a fast-food joint
called King Kone.

612
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:27,026
Driving on
a damaged radiator,

613
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,636
but we're going
as fast as we can.

614
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,899
Scratch that. Nowwe're going
as fast as we can --

615
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:33,162
slightly faster
than we can.

616
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,865
Is that, like, "R"?

617
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:43,346
It's "S," actually.

618
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,920
You gotta nail that shot.

619
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,704
I'm a little rusty.

620
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:55,794
Alright, remember it
like this.

621
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,274
B-E-E-F.

622
00:29:58,318 --> 00:29:59,275
Balance --

623
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,278
Eyes, elbows,
follow-through.

624
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,932
I know.

625
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,499
Sounds like you got
a good coach.

626
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,894
Yeah.
My mom's the best.

627
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,685
She never beat me
at horse.

628
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,513
Not once.

629
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,865
She only let me win.

630
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,955
Every damn time.

631
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:30,393
She said every time
you did something well,

632
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:34,876
she'd be even prouder
than if she did it herself.

633
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,882
She said you made her
a good mother.

634
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,884
Go to her.

635
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,365
Go to her.

636
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,201
Go to her.

637
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:57,681
Ohh!What the hell was that?

638
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:58,987
You heard that, too?

639
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,380
Go to her!

640
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,643
It's the damn kid
that died in the lake.

641
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:04,906
What the hell's "go to her"
supposed to mean?

642
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:09,302
It's the cop.
She's close.

643
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:11,043
Go to her!

644
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,393
That kid's trying
to mind-control us
to turn ourselves in.

645
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,394
We gotta go.

646
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:16,309
Pete. Pete!
We gotta go, man.

647
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,876
What are you doing?
We gotta go!

648
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,966
Get in the RV!

649
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,925
This girl.

650
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,622
I-I think I'm supposed
to go to her.

651
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,363
What are you talking about, man?
We gotta go.

652
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:28,930
The cops are coming!
Come on!

653
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,367
We gotta go!
The cops are coming!

654
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:32,716
Pete!

655
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,122
Michaela:
Put your hands up!

656
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,950
Hey!Put your hands up!

657
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,343
Hands behind your back.

658
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:51,561
Easy.

659
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,607
Where are the others?

660
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,522
Where are they?!

661
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:19,850
"The truth shall set you free."

662
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,505
About time
you figured it out.

663
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:25,247
Been following you
all day.

664
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,728
Estelle said only people who
love her husband would come here

665
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:29,773
and remember his epitaph.

666
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:32,341
I'm here a lot.

667
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:36,128
It was sorrow at first.
Losing my friend. My mentor.

668
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:40,001
Then guilt that I wasn't there
to protect him.

669
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,438
Then it became
something else.

670
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,614
What?

671
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:45,833
A nagging feeling that

672
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:49,097
Robert Vance isn't buried
in this grave.

673
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,670
You were right.

674
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,019
He's alive.

675
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,979
Oh, my God.

676
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,284
Tell him
I want to talk --

677
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,330
I can't. He's being held
by the Cuban military.

678
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:06,114
What?!
How did he get himself --

679
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:09,378
Well, I'm more concerned with
how he's gonna get out.

680
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:12,642
I've gone around and around,
and I can't figure it out.

681
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,080
What if the government
could do some kind of...

682
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:18,344
I don't know.

683
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,999
Some kind of
prisoner exchange.

684
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,826
The prisoner in question
faked his own death,

685
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,351
operated off the grid
for a year and a half,

686
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:27,788
apparently in
an embargoed country.

687
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,659
Our government will
classify him as a spy.

688
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:33,185
They're not gonna be interested
in a prisoner exchange.

689
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,577
What if you go back and tell
your people

690
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:37,493
that Vance isn't
the biggest news in Cuba?

691
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:40,627
That there's
something bigger.

692
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,108
Much bigger. About 828.It would take something
like that

693
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:45,153
for me to move the mountains
I need to move.

694
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:47,068
Okay, but I need you
to keep it under wraps.

695
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,461
Vance's life
is in the balance.

696
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:51,681
And, in a way,
so is every passenger's.

697
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,641
I promise I'll do everything
in my power to keep it secret.

698
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:57,035
But everyone on the planet
is fascinated with 828,

699
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,647
so it may not be
in my power.

700
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,823
So, what is it?
A piece of intel?

701
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,738
A piece of 828.

702
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,703
As I said, you have the right
to remain silent,

703
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:15,227
but do you want to tell us
what you were doing here?

704
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,968
Yeah, or where your lunatic
brother went?

705
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,623
Nothing?
Alright, in you go.

706
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,149
Wait! That's my photo.

707
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,673
Actually, it's NYPD's.

708
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,373
I'm gonna leave my card
with the owner,

709
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,767
tell him
we're taking off.
Okay.

710
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,595
Olive:
Aunt Mick?

711
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,075
What are you guys
doing here?

712
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,424
Didn't your dad tell you?
They're back.

713
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,731
Yeah, but Angelina had
a Calling.

714
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:45,692
What was it?Archangel Michael,
holding scales.

715
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:47,476
We dug up this box
that she buried,

716
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,087
like, a really long
time ago.

717
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,523
W-What are you
doing here?

718
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:51,785
Oh, we lost something
from the box.

719
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,526
We're just trying
to retrace our steps.

720
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,093
What was it?

721
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,052
Th-This.

722
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,446
No. Wait. Wait!

723
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:01,447
Please!

724
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,319
T-That photo belongs to me.

725
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:07,583
No, it's mine.
I dropped it.

726
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,890
H-How could you have
a picture of me?

727
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,413
This is a picture of me.
I...

728
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:13,894
Right there.
I was 10 years old.

729
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,939
In the background.

730
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:20,292
That's my brother Jace
w-working at the counter.

731
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:24,122
And that boy staring at the girl
with the slushie?

732
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,255
Staring at you?

733
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:30,171
That -- That's me.

734
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:33,174
So, this is weird.
What's the move?

735
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,092
We're gonna go by the books.
Olive, you need to go home.

736
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,660
There's still two of these guys
at large, okay?

737
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:43,967
No, I'm -- I'm sorry.
Uh, you can't take that.

738
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,317
This is all I have.

739
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,709
I know, but it's --
it's evidence. I'm sorry.

740
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:49,190
Aunt Mick, this is a part
of a Calling, okay?

741
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,627
You just saw what happened,
alright?

742
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:53,803
We -- We have to keep it.
Dad is gonna want to see this.

743
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:55,457
And there might be
more clues.

744
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,198
I can't. I'm sorry.
It has to go in the report.

745
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:59,157
I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry.

746
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,858
Get home safe.

747
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,527
Sample taken from subject's hand

748
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,792
shows nothing more than trace
amounts of aluminum oxide,

749
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:29,012
consistent with an injury
from a piece of metal.

750
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,927
Unremarkable.

751
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:39,371
Zeke: It's me.

752
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,329
It was so nice of you
to stick around.

753
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:44,071
Happy to help out
anytime.

754
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:47,074
Uh, but I'm still here 'cause
I wanted to talk to you.

755
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,945
Sure. What's up?

756
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:51,209
I just get the feeling
that you're pushing yourself

757
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:54,647
for some reason.

758
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,911
There's just a lot
of people to help.

759
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,697
Are you doing all this --

760
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:04,309
putting everything
into overdrive --

761
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,528
to be sure you survive
the Death Date?

762
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,400
I have to tell you,
my take on it

763
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:10,140
is that as long as you follow
Callings, then --

764
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:15,189
Look, I haven't had any Callings
since I medicated myself!

765
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,713
So, if solving the Callings

766
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,020
is the only way
to survive the Death Date,

767
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:22,327
what do I do?

768
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:27,245
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

769
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,768
Helping people.

770
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:32,075
Making the world better
one patient at a time.

771
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,600
You can't let it
eat at you.

772
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:39,169
How did you know?
Know what?

773
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:42,695
That, uh,
it was eating at me.

774
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,395
In all these months,
zero people have noticed,

775
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,703
and you have been here
five minutes, and...

776
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:55,751
How are you seeing
what no one else is?

777
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,275
I don't know.

778
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:06,066
That was a very thorough report
you submitted.

779
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:09,504
Nice work, Stone. Trying to do
the right thing.

780
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:12,115
Well, it paid off.
Pete Baylor's back in custody,

781
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,335
and I'm getting the help
of every law enforcement agency

782
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:16,772
in the country
to hunt down the other two.

783
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,208
In the meantime,

784
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:20,689
you think you can get this
back to its original owner?

785
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,604
Forensics is done with it,
and Mikami mentioned

786
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:26,565
it had sentimental value.

787
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:29,350
Thank you, Captain.
Mm.

788
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:33,223
Anything else
you want to share?

789
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:35,965
I saw that video.

790
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,054
Where do you think they were
for three months?

791
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,404
In that lake?

792
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:42,755
The -- The truth is,
Captain,

793
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,974
I-I...

794
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,020
I don't know.

795
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:49,414
I have my theories,
but I know that you --

796
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,154
Prefer facts.

797
00:38:51,198 --> 00:38:52,678
Yeah.

798
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:55,376
Stone, let's keep a lid
on that video.

799
00:38:57,683 --> 00:39:03,210
Good work, Detective.

800
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,349
Reporter:
Project Manager Fields says
if he gets the go-ahead...

801
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:16,136
...begin construction
by the end of the year...

802
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:17,877
...a big boost
for the local economy.

803
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,055
Thank you, Powell.

804
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,804
Oh!

805
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,374
Good evening, folks. Our top
story to tell you about now --

806
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,897
Leaked photos from a driver

807
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,725
who was working
inside Guantanamo

808
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:42,510
shows what appears to be
airplane debris

809
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,556
bearing the Montego Air logo.

810
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,688
This could be
the biggest bombshell yet

811
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:50,213
in the Montego 828
investigation...

812
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:51,563
Ready?Shh. Shh. Shh.

813
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:53,913
...is leading
to new speculation

814
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:56,002
about the plane and passengers

815
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:59,266
who landed in New York
a year and a half ago.

816
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:02,400
If the plane is in pieces
in the Caribbean,

817
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,097
are there two planes?

818
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,230
And what does that mean about
the people on the plane?

819
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,058
Who, or some would saywhat,

820
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:12,671
are the 191 passengers
who landed?

821
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:15,630
I'm Logan Crawford, reporting
from the newsroom in New York.

822
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:18,067
Now back to you.

823
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,209
It's the press.

824
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,124
We can't go.

825
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,083
They'll follow us
all the way to Tarik's.

826
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,782
I'll tell your mom
we can't make it.

827
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,919
Woman: Ben Stone?
Vicky Smith, local news.

828
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,617
Two minutes of your time,
please!

829
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,446
Come on.

829
