1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,050
Previously on "Manifest"...

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,320
I'm assuming you didn't hear that.

3
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,725
Told you I almost died.
Congestive heart failure...

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,230
I needed a transplant.

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:12,466
She was my donor.

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,904
I saw Evie. She's okay.

7
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:18,407
It warms our hearts each time
you walk in the door.

8
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:19,941
My mom worked for the government.

9
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:21,343
They think what happened to her

10
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:23,680
is somehow related to Flight 828.

11
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:24,685
I'm sorry!

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,321
I killed her. What do we do?

13
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:29,324
The three guys who kidnapped Cal...

14
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,393
they're alive again.

15
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:37,659
For 84 days, we just keep
Cal far, far away from them.

16
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:38,795
Question is, where?

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,731
- Let me guess. You need something.
- I need help.

18
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,033
There, that's it.

19
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:44,835
Th-Those are peacock feathers.

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,337
Go to her.

21
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,173
T-That photo belongs to me.

22
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,676
This is a picture of me.

23
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:51,779
Boy staring at the girl
with the slushie?

24
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,509
That's me.

25
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,945
You were right. He's alive.

26
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:56,913
Our government will
classify him as a spy.

27
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:58,603
Vance isn't the biggest news in Cuba.

28
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:01,442
- So, what is it?
- A piece of 828.

29
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:06,189
How did you find out
about the Montego Air

30
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:07,524
Flight 828 tailfin?

31
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:10,527
A boy drew me a picture.

32
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:11,962
This boy sneak you into Cuba, too?

33
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:15,832
No, that was my NSA training.

34
00:01:15,836 --> 00:01:17,701
Where were you before that?

35
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:18,902
New York mostly.

36
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:21,030
You went undetected for 18 months

37
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:22,666
in the busiest city in the world?

38
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,238
I ordered in a lot.

39
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,078
Do you think this is a joke, Mr. Vance?

40
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,577
Forget the PR nightmare.

41
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:32,781
The return of a dead division
head would wreak on the NSA.

42
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:35,188
The Attorney General is
contemplating charging you

43
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:36,591
with faking your own death.

44
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,360
Technically not a crime.

45
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,562
Done yet?

46
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,223
Wife's expecting me for supper.

47
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:43,460
Let me explain to you what is a crime.

48
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:45,028
Fraud.

49
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:49,065
Violating embargoes set forth
by the United States government.

50
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,802
Treason.

51
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:52,272
You may think you're going home tonight,

52
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:54,976
but I'm questioning whether
you ever get to go home.

53
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:59,376
Kathryn Fitz is the Major?

54
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,111
And her vanishing could
mean that she's coming

55
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:02,412
after 828ers again.

56
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,382
Her daughter showed up to
the precinct looking for you.

57
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:06,983
That can't be a coincidence.

58
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:10,520
I'll contact the Department of Defense.

59
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:13,558
Are there any other passengers
that know anything?

60
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,093
Yeah.

61
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:18,562
Saanvi.

62
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,430
The Major posed as her therapist.

63
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,098
They met together for months.

64
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,402
We got to give Saanvi a heads up

65
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:24,768
if the Major's planning something.

66
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,603
Yeah, I'll go on my way to campus.

67
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,138
Saanvi should hear this in person.

68
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,540
No, I'll go.

69
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:31,910
I want to talk to her anyways.
I'll keep you guys posted.

70
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:33,148
Thanks.

71
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:38,949
You know you don't have to be
a hero and take everything on.

72
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,350
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,981
It means you're really
focused on everyone else

74
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,586
and you never take care of yourself.

75
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,389
Will you show Saanvi your hand?

76
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:49,125
Yeah, I have, but the hand is
the least of my worries, Mick.

77
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,161
- Mm.
- My family is in hiding.

78
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:53,096
The Meth Heads are still out there.

79
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,998
Listen, I've got to go
to campus with Olive.

80
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,334
TJ sent some artifacts from Egypt.

81
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,869
Maybe we'll find a mythological
clue that can help.

82
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:01,504
Yeah, I think that's a long shot, Ben.

83
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,373
Well, right now I need any shot.

84
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:05,909
Eden's not even gonna remember
who I am in three months.

85
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,544
Ben, I think you need to be laying lo...

86
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:09,312
Listen, I can't just sit still!

87
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,789
We are doing everything we can.

88
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:21,157
If the Meth Heads are like us,

89
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:23,761
who knows what they're
capable of seeing, doing?

90
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:26,124
I will find them, okay?

91
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,629
Whatever it takes.

92
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,112
_

93
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:47,322
_

94
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:47,444
- Eagan Tehrani.
- _

95
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:49,879
I got a busy day, Eagan.

96
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:51,714
Why'd you fall off my board?

97
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:03,727
Pete, you could've run and you didn't.

98
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:05,595
So come on. Talk to me.

99
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,899
Give me a name, an address, anything.

100
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:12,037
Okay, look.

101
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,307
Forget the fact that I'm a cop.

102
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,142
You came out of that lake for a reason.

103
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:20,643
This is your chance at redemption.

104
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:23,348
You and I, we were supposed
to find each other again.

105
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,618
Do you believe in fate?

106
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:36,593
The girl. From the King Kone.

107
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:37,760
What about her?

108
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:39,996
It's fate.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,869
S-She knew where I
was, h-how to find me.

110
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,538
She just stared at me.

111
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,175
Yeah, she was scared.

112
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:52,909
No.

113
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:54,779
She wasn't afraid of me.

114
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,251
S-She was brave.

115
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,716
Okay, Pete, I'm gonna need you to focus.

116
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,020
I need your help finding Jace and Kory.

117
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:07,524
- Where are they?
- Take me back to my cell.

118
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:20,003
Hey, you make any headway with Pete?

119
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,605
Oh, here we go again.

120
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,807
A new Calling?

121
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:27,076
Actually, an old one.

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,913
It's Evie's heart.

123
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,848
Green and blue and turquoise.

124
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:34,450
The feathers were so long. It felt real.

125
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:35,618
Maybe it was a Calling.

126
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:37,253
Angelina had a Calling.

127
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:41,962
It led us to a stained-glass
angel holding scales.

128
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,222
It also had peacock feathers.

129
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,827
That has to be connected.

130
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:48,593
This whole thing just
hurts my head sometimes.

131
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:49,598
Yeah, I know.

132
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,167
I miss you guys.

133
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,503
Give Mom a big hug for me.

134
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,004
Bye.

135
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,084
Eagan?

136
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:09,686
I'm Ben Stone.

137
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,954
- I was on Flight 828...
- Ben Stone, huh?

138
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,489
So you saw it, too.

139
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:15,358
So you know about the Callings?

140
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,093
Don't we all by now?

141
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:18,927
"Callings"... it's kind of
a creepy way to explain

142
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:20,797
what's happening to us,
don't you think, Professor?

143
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,601
How'd you know my job?

144
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:25,068
I was a courier in my past life,

145
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:26,672
made a lot of deliveries to campus.

146
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:27,677
Ever do that?

147
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:29,339
Think about how your
life used to be before?

148
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:30,406
All the time.

149
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,809
How was your life when you got back?

150
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:33,842
My job, my rent-stabilized apartment,

151
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:35,745
my girlfriend... all gone.

152
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,013
Sorry to hear that.

153
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:39,315
Yeah, losing my apartment hurt the most.

154
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,117
Now I just play chess for
cash, follow the Callings

155
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:45,053
whenever they come
poking, live off the grid.

156
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:46,823
Explains why I couldn't
get in touch with you.

157
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:48,524
Don't take it personally.

158
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:52,130
I just didn't feel like bonding
over bizarro visions in my head.

159
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:57,399
Speaking of, the kid we saw,
he looked passed out.

160
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,433
He could be in danger.

161
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,637
What kid?

162
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:03,174
All I saw was a bunch of art
stuff crashing to the ground.

163
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,410
Eagan, could we talk privately?

164
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:09,914
I think this kid's life
could be at stake.

165
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,018
Checkmate.

166
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,152
Checkmate.

167
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:18,121
And checkmate.

168
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:21,423
Let's go.

169
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,534
Glen? Beverly?

170
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,168
Hello?

171
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:48,217
Hey, Beverly, are you okay?

172
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:51,087
Hey, it's me... Michaela.

173
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:52,755
Where's Glen?

174
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:58,561
Glen?

175
00:08:58,565 --> 00:08:59,896
Glen?!

176
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
_

177
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:18,019
Thanks, Doctor.

178
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,857
Next customer?

179
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:26,392
Hey, Jared.

180
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:27,927
Are you feeling okay?

181
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:29,595
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

182
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,930
Actually, I came here to talk to you.

183
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,800
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

184
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,835
Uh...

185
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,571
I think you know Major Kathryn Fitz.

186
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:41,107
Apparently she's gone missing.

187
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,842
Ben and Mick filled me in
on your history with her,

188
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:45,711
so I figured you'd want to
hear the news in person.

189
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:48,014
Um, uh, missing?

190
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:50,113
Yeah, I was hoping
you can, I don't know,

191
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:52,051
give me some information
about your sessions with her.

192
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:53,786
I know it's hard to talk about this.

193
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,388
We just want to keep you safe.

194
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:57,490
She ever share any personal
information with you?

195
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:58,525
Mnh-mnh.

196
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,898
Anything about her friends,
family, children?

197
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:06,899
I didn't know she had any kids.

198
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:08,267
Yeah, a daughter.

199
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,605
That's actually who
came looking for her.

200
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,577
It's Mick.

201
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,346
I gotta handle this.

202
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,613
Look, feel free to call me if
you remember anything, okay?

203
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:23,282
Okay.

204
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:39,637
_

205
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,720
I don't understand why
the Calling would give us

206
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,941
some of the same information,
but not all of it.

207
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,409
Maybe we're supposed to put our clues

208
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,011
together to solve the puzzle.

209
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,280
Chocolate and peanut butter.

210
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:55,977
Yeah, but this one happened so fast.

211
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:57,782
There's no way to remember everything.

212
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,953
I remember everything, all day long.

213
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:04,123
How do you think I know
1,327 opening chess moves?

214
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,327
You have a photographic memory.

215
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,563
Tell me what you do remember.

216
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,331
Uh...

217
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,834
painting of a boat on the sea.

218
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:15,935
A rumbling.

219
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,137
Radiator, a gold frog.

220
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:19,406
It's a toad.

221
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:26,746
Bronze unicorn.

222
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,581
Light shimmering through a window.

223
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:30,450
An urn.

224
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:33,221
Cowboy statue.

225
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,326
Marble monkey.

226
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:39,792
What are you doing?

227
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:41,360
Re-creating the calling.

228
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:45,569
Gum wrapper unicorn,
bottle cap urn, paperclip...

229
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:47,532
- Monkey.
- ... monkey.

230
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:52,905
Keep going. I'll be back.

231
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,907
Hey, what's up?

232
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,843
The Calling took me to Beverly's house.

233
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,211
Glen's dead.

234
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,580
Massive heart attack,
ME said... this morning.

235
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,483
Oh. Mick, I'm so sorry.

236
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,385
I don't understand why
the universe would do this.

237
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:09,688
Yeah. I've been asking
myself the same question.

238
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:12,691
Michaela? Mick?

239
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,263
Hey, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

240
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:18,631
Zeke, what...

241
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:20,430
I was at the clinic when
I got your message.

242
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:23,435
Figured you'd want him here.

243
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,106
Hey.

244
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,708
Hey.

245
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,478
I'm so sorry for your loss.

246
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:33,779
Jared.

247
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:38,788
You look so grown and
handsome in a suit.

248
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:43,956
Evie won't believe it when she sees you.

249
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,690
I'm really sorry that
I didn't call you first.

250
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:47,293
It just... When I saw Glen's
body, everything happened...

251
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:50,062
Hey, hey, hey, there's
nothing to apologize for.

252
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,198
I'm here to help.

253
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:55,234
I saw my mom struggle
with my grandad's dementia.

254
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:57,171
Let me know what I
can do and I'll do it.

255
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:01,640
Just you being here is enough.

256
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:04,577
Amid renewed interest in the
passengers of Flight 828,

257
00:13:04,581 --> 00:13:06,946
many wonder what happened
to the returnees.

258
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,945
Today we have an exclusive interview...

259
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:14,653
Disappointed they didn't ask you?

260
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,786
Hardly.

261
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,222
Can't wait for the media to find
something new to fixate on

262
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:21,359
so I can have my family back.

263
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,829
Hey, boyo. Did you have
fun exploring the woods?

264
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,098
Yeah, I saw a peacock.

265
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:28,063
Like a lawn ornament?

266
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,498
That's flamingo, kiddo.

267
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:31,202
- I know what a peacock looks like.
- Do you?

268
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:33,572
'Cause I've lived here my whole
life... never seen a peacock.

269
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:36,911
You know what, sweetie? Why
don't you go get washed up?

270
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:42,147
You want to cut him some slack?

271
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,849
This transition hasn't
been easy for him.

272
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:45,518
He's 12, Grace.

273
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:47,686
White lies at his age
aren't cute anymore.

274
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,522
My son is not a liar.

275
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:52,255
And I'd appreciate it if you didn't
talk about my family like that.

276
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,491
Your family?

277
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,227
That's the second time you said that.

278
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:57,296
What does that make me, Grace?

279
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,162
Never mind, I already know.

280
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,599
Oh, come on, Tarik, that's not fair.

281
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:04,370
No, what's not fair is you
leaving me alone with Dad.

282
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:06,236
Do you know what it's like to watch

283
00:14:06,241 --> 00:14:08,573
someone you love get sick and die?

284
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,777
'Cause while you were doing
whatever you were doing for 11 years,

285
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:13,512
I was here!

286
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,912
Every day, I'd carry
that man to the bathroom

287
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,282
and watch him cough up blood,

288
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,916
then give him a TV tray, then
head down to the restaurant

289
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,787
to try to save it from drowning in debt.

290
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,455
It was hell, but I did it
because that's what family does.

291
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,925
We look out for each other.

292
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:34,934
Is this where your boyfriend works?

293
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:37,001
When he's not studying in Cairo.

294
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:39,738
Anyone special back home?

295
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:42,141
Promise not to laugh.

296
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,544
I'm almost 30 years old,

297
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,409
at least according to
my birth certificate,

298
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:49,514
and I've never even kissed anyone.

299
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,787
Which is probably why
I'm weirdly obsessed

300
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,127
with this guy in jail I don't even know.

301
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:58,588
Everyone's destined to meet
their soul mate, and who knows?

302
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,258
- Stranger things...
- Shh, shh, shh!

303
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:03,494
High-pitched sound waves can
disrupt the restoration process.

304
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:04,960
Obviously.

305
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,397
Come on, this is what TJ was talking...

306
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,932
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

307
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,735
Back up, okay?

308
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:12,004
Sorry.

309
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:15,207
I'm Olive, and this is Angelina.

310
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,900
And these are priceless.

311
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:21,505
Okay, well, my father said
that we could come in here

312
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,842
and check out some of
the Egyptian artifacts.

313
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:27,179
Of course. Nepotism and inexperience.

314
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,048
What could go wrong?

315
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:31,786
Sit. Don't touch.

316
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:37,690
We've alphabetized, done anagrams.

317
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:39,827
None of this makes sense together.

318
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:43,265
The urn.

319
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,368
It had numbers reflected on it... 601.

320
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:50,937
What... What if it wasn't a design,

321
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:55,147
but a designation, like "room 601"?

322
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,417
I didn't see any numbers.

323
00:15:57,422 --> 00:16:01,623
But part of my Calling was
obscured by this blinding light.

324
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,592
That's why you didn't see the kid.

325
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:06,484
The light was... shimmering,

326
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:08,955
like it was reflecting off of water.

327
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,390
This was a building, so
more likely the reflection

328
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,659
of water off another building.

329
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:16,397
There are hundreds of
waterside buildings.

330
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,999
The objects.

331
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:23,302
A-Alone, they're just
an assortment of items,

332
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:26,038
but together, they make up a collection,

333
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,373
- like a museum.
- Museum.

334
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,143
I made drops to... to all the museums

335
00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:31,813
back when I was a courier.

336
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:33,382
Museums by the water.

337
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:36,588
Uh, Museum of Jewish
Heritage. The Whitney.

338
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:39,520
How the hell are we supposed to know

339
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:40,989
what's hanging inside all these places?

340
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:44,661
The art. None of it was
hung up or displayed.

341
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,361
It was being stored.

342
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:50,698
I think I know where to go.

343
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,305
We've been at this for days.
What more do you want from me?

344
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,642
The truth, Mr. Vance.

345
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:00,677
You and I are done.

346
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:05,713
I've given 33 years of
my life to this country...

347
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:07,950
five tours, two wars,
no questions asked.

348
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:10,190
You assigned me to find
out the truth about 828.

349
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,721
I got shot at, shot down,
still never wavered.

350
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:16,194
So you wanna lock me
up, say it to my face.

351
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,331
Are you buying all of this?

352
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:22,566
I believe him.

353
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,234
It's your call, Director.

354
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:32,773
So, what is this place?

355
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:34,442
Fancy name for self-storage.

356
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:37,379
It's where the not exactly 1%
hide their stuff from the IRS

357
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:39,318
and their ex-wives.

358
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:44,521
How do you suppose we get in?

359
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,492
Now, that I don't know.

360
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,293
Come on.

361
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,700
The teenager from the Calling...

362
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:59,403
Think he was homeless?
Snuck in to avoid the cold?

363
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,474
You're not suggesting we crawl in there?

364
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,746
This kid's in danger. He needs our help.

365
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:11,513
Just so you know, the
average weight of a city rat

366
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:12,748
is one pound.

367
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:14,251
Duly noted.

368
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:29,533
You and Michaela
are such a sweet couple.

369
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:32,536
You better marry her.

370
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,172
Where is that girl, anyway?

371
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:37,007
Which girl?

372
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,109
Oh.

373
00:18:39,113 --> 00:18:40,744
There you go, Beverly.

374
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:44,548
That is such a beautiful diamond.

375
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:46,982
Actually, it's a white sapphire.

376
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,886
Jared has good taste.

377
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,588
Not awkward.

378
00:18:51,592 --> 00:18:53,023
Alright, I'm gonna get going.

379
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:55,459
I have a few things to
wrap up at the precinct.

380
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:57,994
- Thank you.
- Of course.

381
00:18:57,998 --> 00:18:59,364
Zeke.

382
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:05,469
- Thank you, young man.
- Mm-hmm.

383
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:08,841
Beverly, this is Zeke.
T-This is actually my husband.

384
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:17,581
Heartbeats again?

385
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,684
Yeah, I-I don't... I don't understand.

386
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:22,486
They're getting stronger right now.

387
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:33,966
I think they're coming from the...

388
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:40,005
The DVDs?

389
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:45,108
_

390
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,844
You are so funny.

391
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:50,981
How do you like mine, Miss Michaela?

392
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:51,985
I love it.

393
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,688
What do you think of mine, Miss Evie?

394
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,085
Very nice.

395
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:57,087
I have an idea. Let's switch.

396
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,023
- Oh, this is sweet. Yeah.
- Switch. Alright.

397
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,427
You're lucky we're best friends.

398
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:05,529
Best friends forever.

399
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,464
Oh, look at the two of you.

400
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:09,499
- Tag!
- Ah!

401
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:11,568
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Get back here!

402
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:14,871
Hey, hey! Hey!

403
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,039
Safe!

404
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,541
Evie!

405
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:26,182
This is gonna take forever.

406
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:29,281
You can't time-lapse restoration, okay?

407
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:30,386
It's not Instagram.

408
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,988
Defensive much?

409
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:34,024
You have two sets of free hands here.

410
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:35,192
We're not doing anything.

411
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,459
Took me 4 years, 10
courses, and a thesis

412
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,728
on Medieval Egyptian
artisans to be let in here.

413
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:43,433
Technically, yeah, I'm
still in high school,

414
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:47,342
but I could write a
dissertation on AlZuras.

415
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,939
You know about Al-Zuras?

416
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,408
15th century European merchant,

417
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:53,777
known for his lithographs.

418
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:55,144
16th century.

419
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,849
Surprised I know about
more than just Instagram?

420
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:01,852
- I stand corrected.
- So, let's start over.

421
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:03,119
I'm Olive.

422
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:05,789
This is Angelina, and
we'd really love to help.

423
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:07,955
Some ground rules.

424
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,757
One... gloves at all times.

425
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:10,960
Two... no cellphones.

426
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,499
Three... don't expect
credit when I publish.

427
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,869
Okay.

428
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,907
Olive.

429
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:28,178
Isn't this a...

430
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:30,714
Peacock feather.

431
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,483
Did you ever figure out if that
peacock you saw was real?

432
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,118
Kind of a sore subject right now.

433
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:37,819
- What do you mean?
- Mom and Tarik got in a huge fight.

434
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,288
Over a peacock?

435
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:42,859
At first, but then they just
started screaming at each other.

436
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:44,995
Like us when you flushed
Yurtle down the toilet.

437
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,730
I thought I was freeing him.

438
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:48,331
Well, it was that bad.

439
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:52,535
Well, no matter the fight,
we always worked it out.

440
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,138
We're going on a treasure hunt.

441
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:57,772
A very important treasure hunt.

442
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:00,266
"X" marks the spot, a circle with a dot.

443
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:03,737
Spiders crawling up your back.

444
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:05,214
Hey, Ol.

445
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:07,217
I miss you.

446
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:09,219
I miss you, too, bud.

447
00:22:17,932 --> 00:22:20,363
601.

448
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,831
601.

449
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:23,635
- Where's 601?
- There!

450
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:26,703
Damn it.

451
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:28,805
Hello?

452
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,373
Someone in there?

453
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:32,242
You got a credit card, ID?

454
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:33,343
Yeah.

455
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:39,950
Multi-talented.

456
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:41,918
Where is he? Where's the kid?

457
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:43,586
Must've got something wrong.

458
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,655
I'm never wrong about Callings.

459
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,657
Well, the Callings are
never wrong either.

460
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,865
What if the reflections threw us off?

461
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:59,369
I saw 601, but the
upsidedown image is...

462
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,638
- 109.
- Look at you, Professor.

463
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:05,842
The rumblings!

464
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:07,544
I think this time it's for real.

465
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:09,781
We got to find that kid, now!

466
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,017
- Where did you get this?
- Right under there.

467
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:16,555
Callings don't get
more specific than that.

468
00:23:25,732 --> 00:23:27,564
Oh, there you are.

469
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:31,774
Michaela, you are watching
this because I'm gone.

470
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,477
I hope it was painless.

471
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:36,637
I've made arrangements
for Beverly to go live

472
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:39,408
in an assisted-living facility.

473
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:43,279
As for you, Michaela, getting you back

474
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:47,488
was like getting part of Evie back, too.

475
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:50,020
It was priceless.

476
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:52,088
As a small token, we would...

477
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:54,092
like you to have the house.

478
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,495
We love you, Michaela.

479
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,062
Godspeed.

480
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,032
Sorry, did he just give you a house?

481
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:06,104
He just gave us a house.

482
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:13,299
109.

483
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:19,568
What's that smell?

484
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:21,037
It's gas. Cover your mouth.

485
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:24,440
Pipe must've burst.

486
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:28,549
Yeah, I'd say this is turning
into a 911 situation.

487
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:29,686
No service.

488
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,950
Over here!

489
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:39,622
Oh, God, the gas leak. He's out.

490
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:41,390
Shallow breath. He's alive.

491
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,474
Come on, we gotta move him
before the room collapses.

492
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:46,760
- Leave me alone.
- Alright, my name's Ben.

493
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:48,163
- What's yours?
- Caleb.

494
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:50,099
Caleb...

495
00:24:50,103 --> 00:24:52,735
... we got to haul ass or
we're gonna die in here.

496
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,576
Can you handle the kid on your own?

497
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,212
- W-Why?
- Gas valves are in the basement.

498
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:04,714
You take him, I'll shut them off.

499
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:06,215
Are you crazy? You could die.

500
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:08,284
You said it yourself, the
Calling sent us here together.

501
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:09,808
For all we know, there's other people.

502
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:13,089
Alright, go. Go!

503
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:16,258
Come on!

504
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:19,128
Spoke to the facility coordinator.

505
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:20,896
They'll pick up Beverly tonight.

506
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,929
They think it's best to
move her right away.

507
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,932
There's no way I can accept this house.

508
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:27,268
It just... It doesn't feel right.

509
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:29,572
Then we sell it.

510
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:32,508
Give the money to charity...
MADD, Alzheimer's research.

511
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:34,074
You don't have to decide right now.

512
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,410
No, right now, I have to move

513
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:37,911
Beverly out of the only home
she's known for 40 years.

514
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,682
Why are my... my pictures in this bag?

515
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,820
Who put my things in here?

516
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:47,089
Beverly, um...

517
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,560
I-I put them in there.

518
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:52,662
You're moving today, okay?

519
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:55,665
I-I-I don't want to go anywhere.
Glen will be home soon.

520
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:57,466
Glen's not coming home, Beverly.

521
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,232
I don't like it when
you fib, young lady.

522
00:25:59,237 --> 00:26:01,269
- You stop your lying.
- She's not lying, Beverly.

523
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:03,637
I-I'm not talking to you.

524
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:06,341
Who are you, anyway?!

525
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:08,675
Evie! Glen!

526
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,210
- No, hey...
- Evie!

527
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,380
- Beverly, Beverly, hey...
- Glen!

528
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:13,113
They're not... Beverly,
no, they're not...

529
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:14,815
they're not coming home, okay?

530
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,716
Where are they? Where are they?!

531
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:18,485
- No, right now...
- When are they coming home?!

532
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:21,021
No! No! No, no!

533
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:23,031
No, you... you're trying to hurt me!

534
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:26,102
You... You stop it. You stop it!

535
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:28,673
You stop it!

536
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:32,547
Beverly.

537
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,570
I know how you're feeling.

538
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:39,039
You're confused. Your heart is racing.

539
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:40,708
It's scary.

540
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:42,309
When I feel like that,

541
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:45,813
I like to smell the flowers
and blow out the candles.

542
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:47,282
Smell the flowers...

543
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,351
... blow out the candles.

544
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:53,520
That's it.

545
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:55,921
Smell the flowers, blow out the candles.

546
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:57,390
That's great. Yeah, that's it.

547
00:26:57,395 --> 00:26:58,525
There you go.

548
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:01,028
Smell the flowers.

549
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:02,229
That's it, keep going.

550
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,298
Keep it up.

551
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:07,735
You know what else helps me?

552
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,904
Finding something that gives me comfort.

553
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:12,273
Do you have anything like that?

554
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,057
This help?

555
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:32,126
Oh.

556
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:40,601
How did... How did you do that?

557
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:43,003
Don't know. Just had a feeling.

558
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:47,113
My Evie made this for me.

559
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:49,846
She was brave.

560
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:53,926
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah.

561
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:56,850
Um, I'll be right back.

562
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:59,052
This looks just like Archangel Michael.

563
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:01,521
Couple of centuries and
a few thousand miles off.

564
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:04,959
This is Ma'at, Egyptian goddess
of justice and the afterlife.

565
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:07,461
She'd place the deceased's
heart on a scale of justice

566
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,597
and the feather of truth on the other.

567
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:11,329
If the heart was lighter
than the feather,

568
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:13,466
then they passed on to the
blissful Field of Reeds.

569
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,336
A metaphorical weighing of souls.

570
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,004
Yeah, exactly.

571
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:20,207
But... But this depiction, it's unusual.

572
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:22,974
In every representation
I've come across,

573
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:26,379
Ma'at takes a heart and weighs
it against an ostrich feather.

574
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:29,884
But this is too colorful
to be an ostrich.

575
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:31,952
- It's almost like...
- A peacock.

576
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:35,189
What is this missing section?

577
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:38,626
Wonder if anyone's
written about this before.

578
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,228
I'm gonna go check the database.

579
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:43,364
Don't touch anything.

580
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:48,302
So, the scales, afterlife...

581
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:51,170
you think it's all about the Death Date?

582
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:54,806
I think it's a sign that
when you come back,

583
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,376
you're being judged.

584
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:58,445
Like getting a second chance.

585
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,549
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

586
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:04,485
Sorry.

587
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:06,287
Hi. Hey.

588
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,388
Hey.

589
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,123
Are you with Angelina?

590
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,525
The pivot.

591
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,694
Fires inside and that one good for two.

592
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:18,766
Goin' on a treasure hunt,

593
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,468
a very important treasure hunt,

594
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:25,477
"X" marks the spot, circle with a dot.

595
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:28,942
Spiders crawling up your back...

596
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:31,578
Can't believe you remember
that stupid rhyme.

597
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:32,947
Actually, I didn't

598
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:37,151
till I overheard Cal
and Olive reciting it.

599
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:40,020
Brought me back.

600
00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:41,055
You taught it to them?

601
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,090
Just like your dad taught it to us.

602
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,297
I really loved him.

603
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:53,667
He was always there for
me when I needed him.

604
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:55,903
And I should've been there for...

605
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,608
I should've been there for
both of you when you needed me.

606
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:08,517
I wasn't just busy.

607
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:14,090
Um, Cal had leukemia.

608
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:17,725
He had just turned 6.

609
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,825
He was... He was so sick.

610
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,161
And just so little.

611
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:24,231
God.

612
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:26,800
I-I-Is... Is he better?

613
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:29,739
Yeah, he's been in remission
for over a year now.

614
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:34,708
I'm glad he's okay.

615
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:36,212
Me too.

616
00:30:39,082 --> 00:30:42,149
I wish...

617
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,854
I'd been there for you.

618
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:48,389
But at least we have each other now.

619
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:56,363
How did you know?

620
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:57,698
Know what?

621
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,603
That I needed to see Pete.

622
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:05,670
Long story short, I, uh, had a Calling

623
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:07,037
that took me on a journey that I thought

624
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,541
had nothing to do with you,

625
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:12,281
and in fact, it had everything
to do with you.

626
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,152
Hey.

627
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,890
You're safe, okay? We're...
We're right here watching.

628
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,830
You have a visitor.

629
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:50,516
I keep looking at this
picture thinking it's...

630
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:53,620
some wild coincidence,

631
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:56,623
but I-I think it's more.

632
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:58,327
I think it's a sign.

633
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:03,204
Michaela saved me.

634
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:06,810
I-I think I'm supposed to save you.

635
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:12,439
I-I heard this...

636
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:15,943
voice in my head.

637
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,880
It said, "Go to her".

638
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,250
I-I think I'm supposed
to be with you, too.

639
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:29,323
Eagan!

640
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,757
Where are you?!

641
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,698
Eagan!

642
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,075
Come on.

643
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:58,370
Alright.

644
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:00,406
Close call. Nice work, Professor.

645
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:04,042
You're alive. W-When the
room collapsed, I thought...

646
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,328
That gas got so intense I had
to turn around and head out.

647
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:09,882
That's my cue. Nice working with you.

648
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,650
Ooh. Wait, that's it?

649
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:13,250
Kid's alive. We're in one piece.

650
00:33:13,255 --> 00:33:14,786
Calling stopped. Win-win-win.

651
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,790
And I, for one, don't have to explain
all this to New York's finest.

652
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,057
Hey, hey, you okay?

653
00:33:22,062 --> 00:33:24,961
My head hurts. I wanna go home.

654
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,332
Alright, we'll get you
checked out first,

655
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,467
and then I'll drive you home.

656
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,369
- Thanks.
- Okay.

657
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,574
Where's the other guy?

658
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,370
He's...

659
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:42,581
Hey.

660
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,284
You found something?

661
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,219
Please.

662
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:50,856
Is she alive?

663
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,458
That I don't know.

664
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,762
But what I found is, um...

665
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,899
It's complicated.

666
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:01,700
Honestly, I'm not sure
you'll want to hear this.

667
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:04,639
I'm her daughter. It's
not a choice for me.

668
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,776
Sarah, your mother is a
high-level government operative

669
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,345
tasked with studying Flight 828.

670
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:15,716
She often engaged in...

671
00:34:17,753 --> 00:34:20,352
... extra-legal activities.

672
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,321
English, please.

673
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:24,890
Torture, abduction.

674
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:27,895
It could have something to
do with her disappearance.

675
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:33,599
So, where is she now?

676
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,303
I wish I knew.

677
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:41,407
Whatever she did, she's still my mom.

678
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:43,242
Help me find her.

679
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,979
Please.

680
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:54,787
In light of your actions,

681
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,423
we've decided not to pursue charges.

682
00:34:57,427 --> 00:35:00,025
Effective immediately,
you are hereby reinstated.

683
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:01,760
Welcome back to the NSA, sir.

684
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:03,362
Save it. I'm not coming back.

685
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:06,098
- Excuse me?
- You must be out your damn minds.

686
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:08,000
Want to talk about treason?

687
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:10,002
Every move I made working for the NSA

688
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:11,868
was shadowed by your
operative, Kathryn Fitz.

689
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:14,973
She tried to kill me, almost did.

690
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:17,378
I'm not about to get
in her crosshairs again.

691
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,549
Major Fitz was found dead
in New Orleans months ago.

692
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:26,018
Her covert op was shut down.

693
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:29,688
You come back, 828 is yours.

694
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,357
Just tell me what you need.

695
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:33,094
I don't need anything.

696
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,731
It's you who needs me.

697
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:41,100
But like I said, I'm out.

698
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:44,403
Bob, I know you said nothing
would change your mind...

699
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:46,672
but what if I show you
something I know will?

700
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:58,584
- Hey, Mom.
- Caleb!

701
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,290
I'm sorry I ran away. It was stupid.

702
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,894
And I didn't know if you'd
want me to come back home.

703
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:13,000
I will always love you, no matter what.

704
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:18,431
This is Ben.

705
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:20,467
He saved my life.

706
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,141
Thank you.

707
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:25,244
I'm glad he's safe. Take care, Caleb.

708
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:34,586
The Lord has blessed me twice over.

709
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,823
Look who's here. It's safe.

710
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:40,161
It's just a man dropping
off your brother.

711
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:44,396
What's up?

712
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,341
Everything okay with Angelina?

713
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,042
Yeah, I'm just concerned about Beverly.

714
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,644
You have nothing to worry about.

715
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:01,246
We've logged Beverly's preferred
meals into our system,

716
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,048
so she's set for dinner tonight.

717
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:04,482
She's going to feel
right at home with us.

718
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:06,551
Okay, when can we visit her?

719
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:07,586
First thing tomorrow.

720
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,123
Okay.

721
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:14,793
Oh, don't be scared, baby.

722
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:17,329
I'll be home for supper.

723
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:21,666
- Okay.
- Here, you be a brave girl now.

724
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,270
Thank you.

725
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:27,606
Wait. Where are you taking my suitcase?

726
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,775
Oh, come outside, dear. I'll show you.

727
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:32,945
No, Glen and Evie will be
home for supper soon.

728
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:35,214
I-I can't leave. I can't go anywhere.

729
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:36,915
Where are you taking me?

730
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:39,084
Stop, stop, stop!

731
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,987
This is Beverly's home.
This is all she's ever known.

732
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,723
Zeke and I will take care of her.

733
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:46,825
Mick, Beverly needs 24/7 care.

734
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,558
Okay, great, so we'll move in here.

735
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:50,394
We'll... We'll hire someone to help us.

736
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,731
We'll get an aid. We'll
learn to do this ourselves.

737
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,300
You sure you can live here?

738
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:59,071
Yeah, this is what Evie would
want. This is what I want.

739
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:00,506
And what the Calling wants.

740
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,410
But you've already paid
for the first month.

741
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,514
Consider it a donation.

742
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:12,818
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

743
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,788
So, what are we having for supper?

744
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:18,223
Whatever you ask for, I will make.

745
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:21,360
Zeke will make. I'm not that good.

746
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:23,328
He's much better than me.

747
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:26,899
Sorry I'm late. Can't find
my campus ID, my work bag.

748
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:29,501
It's all good. Just one
of those days, huh?

749
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:30,569
Could be worse.

750
00:38:30,573 --> 00:38:32,971
Another passenger and I helped a kid.

751
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:37,176
This guy, Eagan...

752
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,278
he's better at the Callings than us.

753
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:43,248
And I don't trust him, which...

754
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:46,452
scares the hell out of me.

755
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:49,821
Anyway, are these the
fragments TJ sent over?

756
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:53,792
Yeah, most of them, but, uh,
I don't know what they mean.

757
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:57,563
You've been here all day.
Give yourself a break.

758
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,498
But this...

759
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,266
this is important.

760
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,436
You know, I thought the papyrus
was gonna give me a clue

761
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,902
about the Death Date,

762
00:39:05,907 --> 00:39:09,474
but without this missing piece, it's...

763
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:18,450
Uh, why do I need a gold frog?

764
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,452
Toad, and it's worth 2 G alone.

765
00:39:20,456 --> 00:39:23,489
An urn? Somebody's ashes in here?

766
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:24,590
Check out the bronze.

767
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:27,826
It's gotta be Greek,
Roman, or something.

768
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,065
Stuff's hot. I can smell the smoke.

769
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:33,999
$500 for everything.

770
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:36,235
You're a thief. Takes one to know one.

771
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,903
I need some ID.

772
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:54,056
Hey, Ben Stone, you left
some trash in the urn.

773
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,637
Peek-a-boo!

774
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:16,010
Peek-a-boo!

775
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:18,810
Peek-a-boo!

776
00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:43,769
Eden, let's make a video for Olive.

777
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:53,045
We're going on a treasure hunt,

778
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,049
a very important treasure hunt.

779
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:59,355
"X" marks the spot, circle with a dot.

780
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:04,990
We're going on a treasure hunt,

781
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:07,125
a very important treasure hunt.

782
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:11,535
"X" marks the spot, a circle with a dot.

783
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,839
Spiders crawling up your back,

784
00:41:14,844 --> 00:41:17,143
blood gushing down.

785
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:20,447
We're going on a treasure hunt,

786
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:23,785
a very important treasure hunt.

787
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,995
"X" marks the spot, a circle with a dot.

788
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:32,784
Spiders crawling up your back,

789
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:35,723
blood gushing down.

790
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:39,191
Glad to see they kept you around.

791
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,026
I'm glad to see you in the flesh.

792
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:46,098
I know you thought we went
all-in on 828 two years ago.

793
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,770
Well, that was then.

794
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,706
This is now.
