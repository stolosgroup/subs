2
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,797
Yes, I'd like to quickly
confirm a colonoscopy

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,591
for Harry Goldenblatt
for Friday at 10.

4
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,135
Sorry, I, I, I feel
like I shouted that.

5
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,346
- Here you go. Two nonfat lattes.
- Yes, thank you.

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,225
I know, but if we want to submit
to Sundance, we gotta get moving.

7
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,102
Two nonfat lattes, please.
Thank you.

8
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,145
- Mommy?
- Yes, baby.

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,357
<i>Speaking French...</i>

10
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,317
Uh, Gabby just ordered
a croissant in French.

11
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,447
I need to let her have it,
right? One croissant, please.

12
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:17,326
- I got you a coffee!
- I got you a coffee!

13
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,496
Hi!

14
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,376
- Freshly brewed.
- Oh.

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,976
Look, I know we only have
a minute, but Charlotte has

16
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,009
a quick update
on the field trip.

17
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,804
Good news on
the Botanic Gardens.

18
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,723
I was able to book
the botany team

19
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,349
that was profiled in
"New York Magazine."

20
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,767
- I love that.
- Wow!

21
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,472
- That is so cool.
- Or I could call my friend

22
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:47,273
who runs this state-of-the-art
animal shelter on City Island.

23
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,370
After the tour, the kids
play with the animals.

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,009
- Okay, um...
- That'll be fun!

25
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:54,739
I'm an animal lover, too,

26
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,700
but I did just spend three weeks
chasing down these botanists,

27
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,369
and they're very
hard to reach.

28
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,453
- One of whom is deaf, incidentally.
- Of course, I get it.

29
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,291
It was just
a backup idea.

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,834
I hadn't heard from
you on this all week,

31
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,383
so I thought you
dropped the ball.

32
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,212
Oh...

33
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,673
Charlotte's never
dropped a ball in her life.

34
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,117
Check your spam, Deirdre.
The whole chain is there.

35
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,927
I think we should just
lock down the botanists

36
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,263
and save the animal
shelter for another date.

37
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,557
Questions?
No questions.

38
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,767
I'm late.
Have a great day.

39
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,187
How do you do that?

40
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,689
I just pretend I'm talking
to my documentary crew.

41
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,746
Um, you're the only one
I'd hire back, by the way.

42
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,148
You're also the only one invited
to Herbert's birthday dinner,

43
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:36,697
- so, please, keep it on the QT.
- On the 19th?

44
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,741
Harry and I
are so excited,

45
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,458
and we can't wait
to invite you over soon

46
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,369
to hang out with our
little group of friends.

47
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,581
How about Thursday? I just had
something fall off my calendar.

48
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,959
Thursday as in the day after
the day after tomorrow?

49
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,630
Wow, that's short notice.
What was I thinking?

50
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:52,254
- You know what?
- What?

51
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,881
Thursday's fine.
Let's do it.

52
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,549
- How-how does 7 sound?
- That's perfect.

53
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,092
- Okay!
- Okay, I'll see you Thursday.

54
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,594
Okay!

55
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,054
- Oh, and, Charlotte?
- Uh-huh?

56
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,349
- Nothing fancy. It's just us.
- Sure.

57
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,935
Hi... Yes.

58
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,604
Um, I just quickly
need to cancel

59
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,608
a colonoscopy appointment for
Harry Goldenblatt at 10 AM Friday.

60
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,738
- Morning.
- Morning.

61
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,701
Whoa, Mom,
you reek of weed.

62
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,621
- After all the shit you give me.
- No, I don't.

63
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,581
I just haven't
showered yet.

64
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,334
Miranda, c'mon,
we're all grown-ups.

65
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,627
We know pot
when we smell it.

66
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,212
Yeah, you don't
have to hide it.

67
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,548
Especially
now that it's legal.

68
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,551
Carrie took Charlotte and me
to a comedy concert last night,

69
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,678
and there were a lot
of alternative types

70
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,555
getting high all
around us. That's all.

71
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,933
Alternative types?
Alternative to what?

72
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,979
I'm not caffeinated enough
for this conversation.

73
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,112
Hey, hey! Look
who it is! Caroline.

74
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,197
Good morning,
Mr. Kouimelis.

75
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,033
Long time, no see.
Welcome back.

76
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,452
- Dark, no sugar, right?
- Exactly.

77
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,126
- How've you been?
- A-okay.

78
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,961
- How you been?
- I'm good.

79
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,088
You got married. You left
the neighborhood, right?

80
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,340
Huh.
You like married life?

81
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,052
Well... um...

82
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,806
he died... recently.

83
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,849
Oh no.

84
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,059
Poor Caroline.

85
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,521
He had a heart attack,
unexpected.

86
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,523
The coffee is free.

87
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,315
And here...

88
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,823
- Take a roll.
- Aw... thank you.

89
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,451
I thought
he would be there.

90
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,079
I mean, I knew he couldn't be,
but when I walked in the door,

91
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,956
I was thinking
about something else,

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,502
and just...
for a second, I forgot.

93
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,755
- I'm selling our apartment.
- Really?

94
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,299
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

95
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,058
Because what do they say?
You should never make

96
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:26,468
a major decision
when you're...

97
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,346
HALT.
Hungry, angry...

98
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,806
Lonely or tired.

99
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,474
Right. HALT.

100
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,434
Nope, nope, nope.
I am all action.

101
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,978
I gave the Peloton
to one of the doormen,

102
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,107
I contacted a realtor, so...

103
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,741
whew!
Next topic.

104
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:44,028
- Okay, well...
- Okay.

105
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,655
I am planning
a last-minute dinner party

106
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,741
for LTW and her husband,

107
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,660
and I really want
you both to be there...

108
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,416
but only if you're feeling up
to seeing people, Carrie.

109
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,082
I see people all day long.
I live in a city.

110
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,835
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry. I'm just kidding.

111
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,796
- I'm kidding. Of course, I'll be there.
- Thank you.

112
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,382
- Miranda?
- Well, I will be there,

113
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,800
unless it's tomorrow night

114
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,678
because I'm having dinner
with my law professor.

115
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,139
Wow, that's, that's quite
a... quite the turnaround,

116
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,807
I know, right?

117
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,350
I killed it
in class today,

118
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,352
arguing a point
about motherhood

119
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,812
and inequality
in the workplace,

120
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,315
and she wants to talk
about it more over dinner.

121
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,983
Well, that must have
been some argument

122
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,677
if you got a dinner
date out of it.

123
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:26,487
Hm, I'm gonna order
another one of th...

124
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,946
Should we just get a bottle?

125
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,948
No, no bottle.

126
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,872
- We're, we're fine like this.
- Okay.

127
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,346
Seema. That's
such a pretty name.

128
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,807
- It means "boundary" in Hindi.
- Oh.

129
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,267
Which is hilarious
because I have none.

130
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,853
I need to know more about
this wallpaper. It's stunning.

131
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,023
- Oh.
- Such rich, interesting colors.

132
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:07,111
Yes, well, my, um, my husband
wasn't a great fan of beige.

133
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,487
It's gorgeous.
It's all gotta go.

134
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,160
People need to be able to
picture themselves living here,

135
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,745
and it's hard to do that
with your interesting

136
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,164
brutalist coffee table
screaming, "I'm not you."

137
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,389
- It's gotta go.
- Well, do we really...

138
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:24,253
We really have to do,
like all of it?

139
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,713
Don't we just need to find
a buyer with vision?

140
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,007
Buyers aren't that
complex, Mrs. Preston.

141
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,635
- They're like dogs with money.
- Oh.

142
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,430
- Walk with me.
- Oh, what else would I do?

143
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,851
Lovely.
It's all gotta go.

144
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,728
I know you've suffered
a loss, Mrs. Preston.

145
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,406
Carrie.

146
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,531
Carrie. And I can do
this at whatever pace

147
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:46,608
you're comfortable.
Fast, slow, tomorrow,

148
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,652
yesterday... - How's
the day before yesterday?

149
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,114
And you
won't have to lift a finger.

150
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,617
My movers are brilliant.
They're in and out like ninjas.

151
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,787
They move Picassos, so
your things are gonna be fine.

152
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,122
Uh, no offense
to your things.

153
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,126
And what's in here?

154
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,380
Okay... this closet...

155
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,674
Seema, wait a second.

156
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,177
I have something
important to say.

157
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,138
No one touches the shoes.

158
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,310
I totally get it.
I've named all my purses.

159
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,188
- Meet Lorraine.
- Oh, how do you do?

160
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,804
This spa bathroom?
Insane.

161
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,693
This may be the first
apartment I sell

162
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,070
with just a photo
of the bathroom.

163
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,358
Oh, wow.

164
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,751
You know what could pull
this whole area into focus?

165
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,838
A Peloton.

166
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,413
- What?
- Oh, it's, um... it's a long story.

167
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,124
I don't know,
maybe for another time.

168
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,835
I'm actually supposed to be
in Midtown in 20 minutes.

169
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,794
Let's go.

170
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,671
I've got enough to talk
to the stagers about.

171
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,967
I'll drop you off.
My driver's right downstairs.

172
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,136
Ooh!

173
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
Okay...

174
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,060
- Do you smoke?
- Well, not when anyone can see me.

175
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,438
- You?
- Used to.

176
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,149
- Another life.
- Mm-hm.

177
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,862
- Got a cigarette?
- Are you sure?

178
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,323
- I've quit 14 times.
- Just one.

179
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,408
It's been a rough
couple weeks.

180
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,035
Here.

181
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,162
Thank you.

182
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,835
47th between
5th and 6th, Rocco.

183
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,977
- The podcast socials suck.
- Don't mince words, Chloe.

184
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,813
I won't.
Suck, stink, shit the bed.

185
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,065
You all need to post like
your life depends on it.

186
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,401
Che's the only one
consistently pushing.

187
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,845
Yeah, 'cause my life
depends on it.

188
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,406
- And you, Carrie.
- Me?

189
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,949
You didn't have a
lot of followers to begin with,

190
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,867
but you haven't
posted in three weeks.

191
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,577
Three weeks.

192
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,746
This is death
on social media.

193
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,249
Your Instagram is
pretty much a corpse.

194
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,461
Chloe, that's enough, Chloe.
She gets it.

195
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:16,258
Oh, fuck me, fuck!
I'm so, so sorry.

196
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,260
Chloe, like, read the room.

197
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,928
We don't need
to make it a thing.

198
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,054
I mean, you're being
so insensitive, dude.

199
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,433
- It's fine.
- Jackie, don't make this about us.

200
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,393
It was fun
while it lasted.

201
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,979
Carrie, girl...
I'm sorry for your loss.

202
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,063
Get your socials up.

203
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,317
See you Friday.

204
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,278
You know what?

205
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,656
What is happening?

206
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,366
What kind of person ghosts
somebody they're gonna see

207
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,118
again the next day?
I mean, who does that?

208
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,414
Why don't you wash your bath
towels more than once a year?

209
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,708
Fucking kindergartener.

210
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,793
I wash my
bath towels, all right!

211
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,337
Dude, you are so insensitive,
and not just to me.

212
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,422
What you just
said to Carrie...

213
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,465
- Young love.
- Not so young.

214
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,634
Not so love.

215
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,931
Oh, man. If that was me
Chloe was goin' off on,

216
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,808
I would've totally
played the death card

217
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,759
just to shut her down.

218
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:11,438
Oh, I'm saving it for when she
tells me I have to go back on Twitter.

219
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,901
Don't I have a
colonoscopy the next day?

220
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,110
Not anymore, you don't.

221
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,071
This dinner is
too important.

222
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,822
Right now,
Lisa and I are mom friends,

223
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,033
but I want us
to be real friends.

224
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,659
And they are
an impressive couple.

225
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,455
- We are gonna have to bring it.
- Okay.

226
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,291
I invited Carrie
for fashion,

227
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,793
Miranda for politics,

228
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,379
Stanford and Anthony...
gay,

229
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,465
the Shapiros,
the Downeys.

230
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,384
- Bringin' out the big guns.
- Mm-hm.

231
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,594
And I've got room
for one more couple.

232
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,180
- How about the Tates?
- Hmm.

233
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,264
They're sweet, but...

234
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,477
they're just
kind of vanilla.

235
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:52,791
Oh no.

236
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,064
What?

237
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:58,643
Everyone I've invited...
is vanilla.

238
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:02,447
The Wexleys can't be the only
Black couple at the dinner.

239
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,533
They're gonna think we
don't have any Black friends.

240
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,035
Why don't you just ask
the Jenkins in 4C?

241
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,873
The Jenkins! Yes, yes,
I love the Jenkins, yes!

242
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:16,002
- We just had that great brunch.
- Two years ago.

243
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,839
But we lost
a year to COVID.

244
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,043
I'm gonna text
her right now.

245
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,721
- Oh, Charlotte, hi.
- Hello, Shelly.

246
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,474
- What a beautiful sweater.
- Thank you.

247
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,642
I just wanted to check in,

248
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,477
and make sure that
you had received

249
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,729
the texts I sent earlier.

250
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,065
I did...
All four of them.

251
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,151
Oh, I thought
I sent two.

252
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,194
You know, I've gotta
get my phone checked.

253
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,193
It just goes
rogue sometimes.

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,575
So will you be able
to join us for dinner?

255
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,743
Oh, well,
as I said in my text,

256
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,122
- we would love to join...
- Great! Terrific!

257
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,332
But we already have
a dinner Thursday.

258
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,210
Oh, right, but you know
what I was thinking?

259
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,797
Maybe you and David could pop
in before your dinner for drinks.

260
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,424
You know, just pop in, say hi.

261
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,508
We'll do it another time.

262
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,594
Oh, but we always say

263
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,053
we'll do it another time.

264
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,764
Let's just...
get her done.

265
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,601
I'll tell you what,
you text me

266
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,936
when you know that you
definitely can't come,

267
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,563
and in the meantime,

268
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,192
that is just the most
lovely sweater.

269
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,611
- Where'd you get it?
- J.Crew.

270
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,654
Well, it is just gorgeous.

271
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,157
Have a great rest of your day.

272
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,124
Are you still
in touch with that artist you dated?

273
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,752
Who do you mean? The performance
artist with the big, juicy ass?

274
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,297
- God no, I forgot about him.
- I didn't. Like two canned hams.

275
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,530
No, I'm talking
about that painter.

276
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,592
Oh, you mean
the hot Black guy.

277
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:51,146
Anthony, he is more than
just his race. He is a person...

278
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,991
and, yes, that is who
I was referring to.

279
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:55,852
I was thinking of inviting him
to the Wexley dinner party.

280
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,898
LTW has a collection
of African-American artists.

281
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,483
Outta luck, princess.

282
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,859
Stanford lit my old address
book on fire one night.

283
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,071
You want me to ask Juan,
one of my delivery guys?

284
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,615
He's Colombian,
but ethnically ambiguous.

285
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,868
- Goodbye, Anthony.
- Goodbye!

286
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,122
- Deirdre... Hi!
- Oh, hi!

287
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,749
- I was just gonna text you.
- Oh!

288
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,585
By any chance,
are you and Geoff

289
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,170
free for dinner
tomorrow night?

290
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,021
Who's Geoff?

291
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:27,530
- Your husband?
- Oh, . It's pronounced "Joff."

292
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:31,221
- Oh.
- So last minute, but yes.

293
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,015
Lovely. I'll call
Geoff to make sure.

294
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,851
Charlotte, oh my god,
I'm so sorry.

295
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,478
We can't come
tomorrow night.

296
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,105
My mother-in-law invited
us to the symphony,

297
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,652
and Herbert didn't
tell me till this morning

298
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,400
because as he said,
he didn't wanna hear me

299
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,735
bitch about it all week,
and he's not wrong.

300
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,947
Of course, I get it. Mother-in-law drama.

301
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,782
Our dinner will happen
when it happens.

302
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,367
No rush at all.

303
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,910
Thank you for understanding.

304
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,037
- We'll talk later.
- Okay!

305
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,041
Okay, Geoff and I are
definitely in for tomorrow night.

306
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,878
Harry has a colonoscopy
on Friday morning,

307
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,755
and I completely forgot.

308
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,341
See? I'm not crazy.

309
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,260
You do drop balls
every now and then.

310
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,931
You got me.
Apologies to, to Geoff.

311
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,732
Uh, sir, I'm not tryin'
to be unreasonable,

312
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,819
but that guy who just left with
the doggy bag came in after us.

313
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,572
- Am I right about that?
- Yeah, I think so.

314
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,241
With the straw hat?
Um, it's Nya Wallace.

315
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,243
7:30, party of two.
Would you check again?

316
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,079
I'm sorry, again. We have no record
of your reservation in the system.

317
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:44,044
But, uh, I do have a record
of the reservation right here.

318
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,754
Mm-hm, yeah, you've shown
me that already three times,

319
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,592
but see, it's
not in my system.

320
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,469
Okay, well, then let's
just ignore the evidence,

321
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,596
and say I don't have a
reservation. I mean, it's possible.

322
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,806
I've made mistakes
in my life...

323
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,725
uh, most recently comin'
into this restaurant.

324
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,312
What are we gon'
do about it, though?

325
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,981
You know, there are a couple
of cute places pretty near here.

326
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,941
Miranda, I'm 37
minutes into this trial.

327
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,291
- I am not leaving without a win.
- Got it. Yeah.

328
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:10,594
One second.

329
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,115
Found you. You did
make a 7:30 reservation...

330
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,870
- Thank you.
- At our San Francisco location.

331
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,622
Should I call 'em
and tell 'em

332
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,082
we're gonna be
a little bit late?

333
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,292
- I'll get to you.
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.

334
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,044
Sateesh, party of two.

335
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,172
I am so sorry.
That was totally not me.

336
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,300
No, that is so,
usually, exactly me.

337
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,930
I'm just so hopped up on
all these, um, fertility drugs.

338
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,973
Yeah, it's messin'
with my everything.

339
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:42,602
Oh, okay. Yeah, I know
how hard that can be.

340
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,460
Wait, you've been
through this?

341
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:45,563
Water for you ladies.

342
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,315
Thanks.
You have kids?

343
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,984
No and yes.
No to IVF.

344
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,113
Yes, I have a 17-year-old
son named Brady.

345
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,701
I have a, a good friend who
went through hell with IVF.

346
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,598
That's how I know.

347
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,328
Yeah, well, this is
my second trip to hell.

348
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,372
My, uh, first
one didn't take...

349
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,042
which, uh...

350
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,962
is privileged information
between professor and student,

351
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,714
and, as a reminder, I do
have the power to fail you.

352
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,758
Oh, not, not
unethical at all.

353
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,012
Um...

354
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,848
and so, this is the part you
tell me where it'll all be worth it.

355
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,683
Counselor, I think you're
leading the witness.

356
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,852
Miranda Hobbes,
are you about to tell me

357
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,601
that motherhood
isn't worth it?

358
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:29,065
Um... it depends
on the day.

359
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,068
Like today, when my son
called me a bitch

360
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,027
because I sent
his girlfriend home,

361
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,864
and forced him
to do his homework.

362
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,408
- 100% not worth it.
- No. No, it's not worth it.

363
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,201
No.

364
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,829
Haven't heard that side
of the argument.

365
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,705
Menu for you.

366
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,707
- But if having a baby is...
- And you.

367
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,376
Is really what you want...
Thank you.

368
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,212
It will be way more
than 100% worth it.

369
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,257
Great, but I don't need
a hard sell, right?

370
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,551
I'm gettin' that from
society, from my friends,

371
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,887
my family, uh,
my house cleaner.

372
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,348
- You need a new house cleaner.
- Yeah.

373
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,977
Okay, here's the thing.

374
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,230
I don't know why I'm tellin' you
this, probably the hormones but, um...

375
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,860
when my last round of IVF
didn't go through...

376
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,736
um...

377
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,532
I felt a huge
wave of relief.

378
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,413
And listen, my husband
and I, we love our life.

379
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,917
I mean, nobody's life
is perfect, but, my life...

380
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,419
is really
fuckin' close, right?

381
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,503
But then, I...

382
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,759
I'm also afraid that if
I don't have a child,

383
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,136
I'm gonna
regret it one day.

384
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,265
You know,
the thing about regret

385
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,435
is that having a child
doesn't take it away.

386
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,519
Thank you.

387
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,817
There are always gonna be
these roads not taken, right?

388
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,737
I mean, I...

389
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,031
There was a woman
in my class at Harvard.

390
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,952
Not a Rhodes Scholar. She
never married. She never had kids.

391
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,120
She's a federal judge now.

392
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,916
- Who goes home to an empty house.
- God!

393
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,794
There are so many nights

394
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,463
when I would love
to be a judge,

395
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,132
and go home
to an empty house.

396
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,134
Hmm.

397
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,138
And then, I see my
son and I'm glad.

398
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,853
And then, I see his dirty
underwear on my kitchen floor...

399
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,271
- No.
- And I'm mad.

400
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,023
Yeah, I could see that.

401
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,362
- So you can't have it all?
- No...

402
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,239
You can.

403
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,523
It's just really fuckin' hard.

404
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,696
Is that your
closing argument?

405
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,750
Your honor...

406
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,545
if this round
of IVF works...

407
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:00,508
you're gonna love
motherhood every second.

408
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,177
Why don't we
get another round of drinks?

409
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:05,179
- Why don't we?
- Yeah.

410
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,683
Mmm, I'm not very open
to this open house.

411
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,020
"Mad Max" meets
"Dances With Wolves."

412
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,522
- I think I used to date the guy who lives here.
- Really?

413
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,858
Well, generally speaking,
I feel like back in the '90s,

414
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,943
we all dated the 50-year-old
guy who lives here.

415
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,863
I'm still dating them.

416
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,115
By the way,
feel free to introduce me

417
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,988
to any available men that
you know with a good heart.

418
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:28,703
Even if they're
fixer-uppers. I can flip 'em.

419
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,372
Oh, I bet you can.

420
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,335
So, the motorcycle
inside is for what?

421
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,377
Those quick trips
to the bathroom?

422
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,713
See, this is why you
don't leave your furniture

423
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,131
in your place
for the open house.

424
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,216
- All right.
- Okay.

425
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,220
I'm gonna say goodbye
to the realtor. Poor thing.

426
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,228
- Great place, huh?
- Oh! Oh god.

427
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,272
I'm considering
making an offer.

428
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,733
Recently divorced,
and I'm movin' back downtown!

429
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,195
You look like
a downtown lady.

430
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,822
- You wanna check out the bedroom?
- Ooh, oh...

431
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,660
- Let's go. We have to eat.
- Oh, we have to eat.

432
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:13,331
Ooh, I was about
to flee on the motorcycle.

433
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,583
- Who was that?
- My worst nightmare.

434
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,377
You think that guy was
your worst nightmare?

435
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,171
- Check out this honey bun.
- Mm!

436
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,882
Profile says
he's looking for fun.

437
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,301
He should be looking for a shirt.

438
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,847
Wait, please.
There's so many more gems.

439
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,474
How many dating apps
are you on?

440
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,934
How much time have you got?

441
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,228
I started back in the day
with OkCupid...

442
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,771
- Uh-huh.
- Which was not okay. It was like

443
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,107
are you fucking
with me, Cupid?

444
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,068
Then, I moved to Tinder...

445
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,112
where I met the guy
who cried after sex.

446
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,614
Oh, so he was too Tinder.

447
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:51,452
I just want someone to create
a dating site that's called,

448
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,788
"Here's the man you've
been searching for, Seema."

449
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,957
And you're never married?
Not divorced?

450
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,792
No, happily not divorced.

451
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:02,214
Well, I think it's great that you're
still putting yourself out there.

452
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,298
Yes. Well, I am.

453
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,843
Ooh, do you wanna split
the cacio e pepe?

454
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,345
- Mm-hm.
- Mm.

455
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,852
Lisa and Herbert run in
an eclectic, diverse crowd.

456
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,729
- Hmm.
- But... right now,

457
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,689
everyone is talking
about Black literature.

458
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,482
You read the article
I sent you, right?

459
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,987
- Yep.
- So name a few modern Black authors

460
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,032
that every person is reading.

461
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:33,161
- Sadie Smith.
- Zadie with a Z.

462
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,164
Can't I just say I love
Michelle Obama's book?

463
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,499
I feel like you are not
taking this seriously.

464
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,334
Charlotte, I've been
talkin' my whole life.

465
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,546
Think I can handle
a little dinner chit-chat.

466
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,551
- Do I need it?
- No.

467
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,179
Harry!

468
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,852
We lucked out when LTW
canceled the other night,

469
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,855
but that was
our wake-up call.

470
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,442
It is unacceptable that we do not
have a more diverse friendship circle,

471
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,527
so, tonight,
bring your "A" game.

472
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,489
- Oh god, you're sweating already.
- Can't imagine why.

473
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,077
- Hi!
- Come on in!

474
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,745
 I know you
said not to bring any gifts,

475
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,914
but we had to bring
Herbert a little something.

476
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,540
- Aww.
- It's chocolate.

477
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,583
It's really good with
port, if he drinks.

478
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,711
Oh, he drinks. He has to.
He's married to this.

479
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,671
Oh.

480
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,799
Uh, I have to go
apologize to the chef

481
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,468
for something my mother-in-law
just said about the appetizers.

482
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,552
You all go mingle.

483
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,849
- Wow!
- Yes,

484
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,917
Looks like we're
the eclectic and diverse.

485
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:44,427
Harry, Charlotte.

486
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:47,068
- Hey! Happy birthday, big guy.
- Happy birthday!

487
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,277
Please, come join us.

488
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,198
Oh, look.
It's Gwen, Leo's mom.

489
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,242
Hi, Gwen!

490
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,287
Hi! I haven't seen you since
Leo transferred to Dalton.

491
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,581
I'm not Gwen.

492
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,625
But I know who
you're talking about.

493
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,878
This is Lisa's
friend, Shawna.

494
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,132
Anybody read the new
Zadie Smith book?

495
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,444
<i>Hey, you
know that part in "The Wizard of Oz"</i>

496
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,573
where the movie goes
from sepia to color?

497
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,742
- Yeah.
- I'm experiencing that in reverse.

498
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,785
What do you mean?

499
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,186
My apartment is

500
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,539
totally beige, everywhere.

501
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,001
There's no sign of me.

502
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,460
Sometimes, I look
around this house

503
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,875
and there's...
no sign of me either.

504
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,090
God, it's surreal.

505
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,374
It's like we never lived here.

506
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,554
Our life is just... gone.

507
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,723
I'm so sorry
for you, Carrie.

508
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,475
I know... everyone is.

509
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,479
Maybe that's why I'm drawn
to Seema, my realtor, you know?

510
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,107
When I'm with her,
I can just, um...

511
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,569
you know, pretend like none of
the terrible stuff has happened.

512
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,404
Well, she didn't know Big.

513
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,989
Exactly.

514
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,658
It's lunch and some laughs,
which is kinda nice.

515
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,620
- Should I be threatened?
- Nah, it's probably

516
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,663
more real estate than real.

517
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,085
Oh, hell no.

518
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,170
What?

519
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,048
The Peloton is back.

520
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,133
Okay, I gotta get Big and go.

521
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,885
You don't belong here anymore.

522
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,954
Ah.

523
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,458
Thank you, everybody.

524
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,001
And what is it
you do, Charlotte?

525
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,045
Oh, um, I-I'm
a full-time mom,

526
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:15,216
and I'm active on the Events
Committee at our daughter's school,

527
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,093
and that is how
Lisa and I met.

528
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,490
Lisa and Charlotte are the Thelma
and Louise of that parent group,

529
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:23,391
except without the crime spree
and the double suicide.

530
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,852
Charlotte is
just being modest.

531
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,480
She's not just a stellar mom,
and killing it at school,

532
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,148
she's also on the board
at The Met.

533
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,025
Oh!

534
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,569
So, you know art?

535
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,114
Yes, yes.
It's my passion.

536
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,300
I used to run an art
gallery a long time ago.

537
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:43,468
My favorite Art
is Art Smith...

538
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,872
our financial adviser.

539
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,292
He told me that
my daughter-in-law there

540
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,961
spent more money
on these paintings

541
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,422
than my husband,
God rest his soul,

542
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,341
and I spent on
our first house.

543
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,759
All due respect, Mother,

544
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,886
real estate isn't as
costly in the Carolinas.

545
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,514
I don't know
about Carolina real estate,

546
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:07,018
but, in terms of art, I can't
think of a better investment

547
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,770
- than what Lisa has selected here.
- Really?

548
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:14,233
The Gordon Parks
photographs are amazing,

549
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,402
and the one by
Carrie Mae Weems.

550
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,612
The collection includes
Deborah Roberts,

551
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,906
and, oh, Barkley Hendricks,

552
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,326
and the early work
by Derrick Adams,

553
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,954
which is like owning early
sheet music by Beethoven.

554
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,331
- Oh.
- And then, my personal favorite

555
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,293
is the Mickalene Thomas
in there.

556
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,713
She did the very first portrait
of First Lady Michelle Obama.

557
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,508
I loved her book!

558
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,303
So, I don't think that
you and Mr. Art Smith

559
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,305
have anything
to worry about.

560
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,473
With the keen eye of Lisa,

561
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,436
the family is
in very good hands.

562
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:51,604
Yes, we are.

563
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,482
How about some
birthday cake, and, uh,

564
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,575
- my favorite port in the den?
- Yeah.

565
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,287
- Yeah?
- Shall we?

566
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,865
Oh, thank you,
thank you, Thelma!

567
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,317
Unless you
wanna be Louise.

568
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:05,993
Oh, no, I am
definitely Thelma.

569
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,479
Just till I can figure out
where you really want to be.

570
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,409
Ah.

571
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,397
- You're smoking?
- Stanford's in Japan?

572
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,275
♪ Go, daddy, go ♪

573
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,734
That's Ashley,

574
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:23,821
the 17-year-old Long Island
TikTok star he manages.

575
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,573
She's huge in Asia.

576
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,284
She asked him to go
on tour with her.

577
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:34,081
I do not get her,
but then, I'm old, gay...

578
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,834
- and not Japanese.
- Well, fine, good, sayonara,

579
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,086
but why the dramatic note?

580
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,214
"By the time you read this,
I'll be in Tokyo."

581
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,217
I mean, wh-wh-who is he?
The lost Brontë sister?

582
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,927
He said he couldn't
bring himself to tell you

583
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,221
he was leaving
face-to-face after Big died.

584
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,056
Right, and a, a note
is so much more

585
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,808
- compassionate.
- Oh, you know Stanny.

586
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,769
He hates to disappoint
people... in person.

587
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:59,940
Still, you know, if it...
If something good

588
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,790
is happening in one
of my friends' lives,

589
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,422
and I'm, I'm assuming
he considers this good...

590
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:06,780
I'd wanna know about it.

591
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,658
You know, no, no matter
what is going on in mine.

592
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,120
Good news or bad,
I'd wanna know.

593
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,455
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

594
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,457
I got a letter, too.

595
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,252
- He wants a divorce.
- Oh.

596
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:25,049
I don't get it.
We were so happy.

597
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,218
We had a great time
at your dinner.

598
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,637
- We loved everyone.
- Oh, and everyone loved you.

599
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,425
Thank you so much for
having my back with Eunice.

600
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:33,306
You're like the
mother-in-law whisperer.

601
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,435
Such a good friend.

602
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,436
Well, I hope so.

603
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,399
I have
a confession to make.

604
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,817
I was really panicked

605
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,445
having you and Herbert
over for dinner

606
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,073
because I realized you would
be the only Black couple there.

607
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,244
Hmm... that's really crazy

608
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,621
because I was worried that
you and Harry would be nervous

609
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,623
being the only white people
at my dinner party.

610
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,043
- Did we seem nervous?
- He sweat through his suit.

611
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,004
That's on me.

612
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,048
I pushed him so hard.

613
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,414
I just... I want to do
everything right.

614
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:10,678
- Good luck.
- Seriously,

615
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:12,453
I was so desperate
this week...

616
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,682
I invited Deirdre.

617
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,433
Okay, now you're doin'
the wrong thing.

618
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,601
How'd you get out of that?

619
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,354
I pretended
to drop a ball.

620
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,189
- Took one for the team.
- Mm-hm.

621
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,482
Aww.

622
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,528
Hello? Safe to come in?

623
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,322
Is the open house closed?

624
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:34,118
- Come on in. Coast is clear.
- I got us some sushi.

625
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:39,290
So tell me, uh, how did it go
at the "Beige-a-palooza"?

626
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,710
A lot of interest. One
definite, two potential offers.

627
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,044
I might show it
again next week

628
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,797
just to drive the
interest up even more.

629
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,134
All right, so, um, so your
magical moving worked, I guess.

630
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,803
Always does. Oh,
there was a little mishap.

631
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,640
I was moving a photo into
a drawer and the glass broke.

632
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,602
- Which photo?
- The one on your bedside table.

633
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,521
I must've hit it
on the corner,

634
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,523
and it just shattered.

635
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,984
- Why were you even touching it?
- Well, it was a personal item,

636
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,694
and you were supposed
to tuck it away.

637
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:11,423
- It is a personal item.
- No, I understand.

638
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:12,237
But it's only that...

639
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:14,697
You said they move Picassos,
that nothing would get broken.

640
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:17,411
And, unfortunately, this
was my bad, not theirs,

641
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,288
but it can be fixed.

642
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,957
Only the glass is broken,
the photo's intact,

643
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,835
so I'll just
replace the glass.

644
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,172
You can't just
replace the glass.

645
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,424
That picture was
on his side of the bed.

646
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,968
He touched that
glass all the time.

647
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,639
You... the, the glass
is not replaceable.

648
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,100
Well... I'm sorry.

649
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,059
Well, you don't
seem very sorry.

650
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,481
You're sitting there,
you know, pretty casually.

651
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,775
You know, "Oh, it just...
We'll just replace the glass.

652
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,943
You know, it's not...
No big deal. No worries."

653
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:52,321
No worries? He was
the, the love of my life.

654
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,823
Actually... I'm not
like that at all. I...

655
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,785
Well, that's, that's
how it seems to me.

656
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,624
He's gone, it's broken,
and no one can fix it.

657
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,171
I am very sorry, I am.

658
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,965
I assure you,
I had no intention

659
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:14,385
of being insensitive
to your situation.

660
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,806
Sometimes...

661
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,018
people aren't aware of how
insensitive they may seem...

662
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,367
and, I guess, today that
could apply to me.

663
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,402
Or to you... at the
restaurant the other day.

664
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,239
Me?
How was I insensitive?

665
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,827
When we were talking about me
dating, you said something like...

666
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,662
Well, no, it wasn't
"something like."

667
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,582
I... remember exactly
what it was. You said...

668
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,836
"Well, it's great you're still
putting yourself out there.

669
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,675
"Well, it's great you're still
putting yourself out there.

670
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,963
"Good for you, Seema,
trying to find yourself a man

671
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:59,805
to marry after all
those years of no luck."

672
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,390
No, no, that's not
the way I meant it.

673
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,851
You know, I'm sure,
but that's how I heard it.

674
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,232
If I'm being really honest...

675
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,859
maybe you have
a point, Carrie.

676
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,027
Maybe there's
a little part of me

677
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,864
that doesn't feel
sorry for you...

678
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,199
'cause at least you found
the love of your life

679
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,276
and you had him for many
wonderful years, and in my eyes,

680
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:26,415
that is something worth still
putting yourself out there for.

681
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:31,089
I agree.

682
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,557
Would you like some yellowtail?

683
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,726
Is it from the place
on Madison?

684
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,068
And just like that...

685
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,320
we began our real friendship.
