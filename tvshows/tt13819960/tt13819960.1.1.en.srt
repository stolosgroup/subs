1
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,464
(upbeat music playing)

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,551
(indistinct chatter)

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,594
- Jeremy, party of five!
- That's us!

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,473
Ooh, oh.
Ah! Excuse me.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,393
Whew.
(chuckles)

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,853
Remember when we
had to legally

7
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,771
stand six feet apart
from one another?

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,356
Yeah,
I miss it.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,816
- Excuse us.
- Oh, excuse us.

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,651
Sorry.

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,569
Carrie?

12
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,696
Is that
Bitsy von Muffling?

13
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,407
- Carrie. Excuse me.
- Yep, that's Bitsy.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,659
I can't believe it.
I cannot believe it.

15
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,120
Oh, it's been forever.

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,997
Do we hug
or bump elbows?

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,915
Sign language,
smoke signals.

18
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,750
Where are we these days?

19
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,253
And, and where's
the fourth musketeer?

20
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,504
Where's Samantha?

21
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,340
Oh, um, she's
no longer with us.

22
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,384
No, no, no, no.
She didn't die.

23
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,262
Charlotte:
Oh no! No, no.
I'm so sorry, no.

24
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,847
I just meant
she's not with us.

25
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,768
- She's in London.
- Oh, thank god.

26
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,770
After the horror show
we've been through,

27
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,438
I just assume
anyone I haven't seen

28
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,272
in a while
has passed on,

29
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,107
or... gave up
and moved to Palm Beach.

30
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,320
- No, she moved
to the U.K. for work.
- Smart.

31
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,115
Sexy sirens in their 60s
are still viable over there.

32
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,869
- Well, enjoy.
- Friend: Bitsy, are you coming?

33
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,581
Group:
Bye!

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,292
Remember when we
couldn't air kiss
hello or goodbye?

35
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,002
Yes, I miss it.

36
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,003
Carrie, party of three!

37
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,882
- Yay! Yes, that's us. Yay.
- Nice! Here we go.

38
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,343
♪ ♪

39
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,683
I stepped on a used condom
in Brady's room this morning.

40
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,185
- Eww--
- Wait!

41
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,145
I was barefoot at the time.
Okay now.

42
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,274
- Eww.
- Ooh, does anyone wanna
split the croque madame?

43
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,610
I will.
Did you hear
what I said?

44
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,821
Mm- hm.
Are we getting
fries with that?

45
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,240
I stepped on my son's
semen before coffee.

46
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,115
We are definitely
getting fries with that.

47
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,786
- Hmm.
- This is totally
on Steve and me.

48
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,163
We started letting
Luisa spend the night
because we like her,

49
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,041
and now Brady's bedroom
floor is a minefield.

50
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:07,252
Well, it's good
he's using protection.

51
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,838
Now that is seeing
the condom as half full.

52
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,922
When do you start school?

53
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,926
What?
I changed the subject.
Life's too short.

54
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,929
I'm starting with
spring semester next week.

55
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,849
- Wow.
- Oh, really? Next week?

56
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,268
Are you gonna,
you know--

57
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,104
Go crazy?
Too late, already happened.

58
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,272
No, color your hair.

59
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,026
Now where is that darn
waitperson with the check?

60
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,987
- We haven't even ordered yet.
- Oh, I know, but I want out now.

61
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,905
I just think
the gray ages you.

62
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,700
No, you think
the gray ages you

63
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,201
because if we're friends,
and I am this age,

64
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,037
you can't be whatever age
you're pretending to be.

65
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,206
I am not pretending
to be any age.

66
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,458
- I am 55.
- What? You want a medal?

67
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,044
Yes. Yes, I do.
Can I get a medal?

68
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,339
Yes, you can,
and when I turn
55 in 10 years,

69
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,258
I would like
a medal as well.

70
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,304
- Thank you.
- And... why are you
just going after me?

71
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,805
Carrie dyes
her hair, too.

72
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,224
Yeah, but hers is obvious.
You're trying to pass.

73
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,018
Yeah, but obvious
in a good way, right?

74
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,020
'Cause this kind of "obvious,"
it don't come cheap.

75
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,063
You look great gray,
but I miss the red.

76
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,233
And I just thought
it might be fun,

77
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,693
you know, for
the start of school.

78
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,862
Yeah, for all your
playdates and things.

79
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,781
Charlotte, I'm getting
a Master's in Human Rights

80
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,700
to pair with my law degree,

81
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,412
so, hopefully,
I can become an advocate
for women who need one.

82
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,374
I don't have to be
a spicy redhead to do that.

83
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,377
I mean, we can't
just stay who we were.

84
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,128
- Right?
- Absolutely.

85
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,464
And there are more
important issues

86
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,299
in the world than
trying to look young.

87
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,679
Ruth Bader Ginsburg
dyed her hair.

88
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,931
Mic drop.

89
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,227
Wow, I've gotta get him.

90
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,314
Do you see his hat?
Looks like a light fixture.

91
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,443
- For my Instagram.
- (camera clicks)

92
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,402
How's all that goin'?

93
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,655
Uh, you know,
when I first
started doing it,

94
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,865
it was really just for me,
you know, just for fun,

95
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,785
posting strangers who
have interesting style,

96
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,537
but now... that
I'm on that podcast,

97
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,956
it's kind of
growing into a thing.

98
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,123
Wow. Instagram, podcast.

99
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,793
I guess you're passing
as younger, too.

100
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,795
Still haven't listened
to it, have you?

101
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,297
Carrie,
I love you to death,

102
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,966
but I draw the line
at podcasts.

103
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,595
I just ran into LTW
in the ladies' room.

104
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,764
Great! I don't know
what that means.

105
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,849
Lisa Todd Wexley.

106
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,977
Everyone at school
calls her LTW.

107
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,188
Now, is LTW a person,

108
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,816
- or a sorority you
hope to pledge.
- I know, I know.

109
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,777
I sound so silly,
but she's just so cool.

110
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,447
She is a documentarian,
and a humanitarian.

111
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,284
And her husband, Herbert,
is an investment banker
who might run for mayor.

112
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,663
And she's on
the International "Vogue"
Best- Dressed List.

113
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,373
Wow, I think I need a nap.

114
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,582
We are on the parent
school board together,

115
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,669
so, this year, we've
been getting to know
each other better

116
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,546
'cause she signed
her son, Henry, up

117
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,383
to study with the same
piano teacher that
Lily studies with.

118
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,010
- Oh, which reminds me--
- To breathe?

119
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,929
You haven't RSVP'd yet
for Lily's piano recital.

120
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,016
Oh, I know.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I can't go.

121
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,933
Big and I are driving
out east on Wednesday.

122
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,060
Can't you drive out Friday?

123
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,854
'Cause Lily has
been practicing

124
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,522
for this night
every day for a year.

125
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,817
Sweetie, I know,
but Big already
took time off.

126
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,403
But you could
go to the Hamptons
with Big any time.

127
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,948
And this concert
is at the Manhattan
School of Music.

128
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,659
It's a very big deal.

129
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,910
The Manhattan School
of Music, Carrie.

130
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,289
The Manhattan
School of Music.

131
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,290
I'm sorry, where is
the concert again?

132
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,502
All right, I'll talk
to him. I will.

133
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,421
- Oh, hi!
- I don't wanna interrupt.

134
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,173
- Oh, you're not interrupting!
- Hi.

135
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,967
These are my
very best friends,
Miranda and Carrie.

136
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,218
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Lisa.

137
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,386
Charlotte has told me
so much about you both.

138
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,347
Well, we just got
the crash course
on you, too.

139
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,474
- Oh no.
- (all laughing)

140
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,061
- That's a great bracelet.
- It's interesting, right?

141
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,063
It's this 20- year- old out
of Jackson, Mississippi,
I came across online.

142
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,314
- She's amazing.
- Oh, that's great.

143
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,067
Oh my god.
Who ordered
the French fries?

144
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,236
I'd have to know you
a lot longer before
I confessed that.

145
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,571
- Can I have one?
- Sure, they're cold.

146
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,407
- But they're still
greasy, right?
- (group laughing)

147
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,992
- So bad, they're good.
- Ooh, yikes, I'm gonna be late.

148
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,787
I have to go
do a podcast.

149
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,207
- They're like jury duty now.
- Yeah, I should go, too.

150
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,958
Um, it was
really, really
nice to meet you.

151
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,254
- Any friend of French fries
is a friend of mine.
- Hope to see you again.

152
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,298
- Yeah, same here.

- What did you get at Oscar?

154
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,636

- Oh, it's for the girls.

155

- Ta- da!
- (gasps) It's gorg.

156

I just wanted them to have
something so special

157
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,477
for Lily's big night.

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,311
Henry is gonna
bomb this recital.

159
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,771
- Oh, no, he won't.
- It's my fault.

160
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,773
I started him too late.

161
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,607
I have to force
him to practice.

162
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,734
I literally have
to pry his fingers

163
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,278
off the PlayStation,
and put them on the keyboard.

164
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,155
Well, you know what?
He's a beginner.

165
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,117
- People will understand.
- People might, but my
mother- in- law won't.

166
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,119
She's a world- renowned
concert pianist,

167
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,955
and an even more
accomplished
pain in my ass.

168
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,165
Oh, my friends are waiting.
I'll call you later.

169
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,792
- Bye.
- Bye! I'll talk to you soon.

can't make the recital.

172
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,799
Her piano teacher
rents that venue.

173
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,634
It's the Park Avenue
equivalent of

174
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,510
"every kid
gets a trophy."

175
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,347
Still, I should go.

You know,
it is kinda like

Samantha.

180
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,736
We never even
talk about her.

181
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,531
Well, what is
there to say?

182
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,827
I told her that
because of, you know,

183
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,661
what the book
business is now,

184
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,539
it just didn't make
sense for me to...

185
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,541
keep her on
as a publicist.
She said, "Fine,"

186
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,919
- and then fired me as a friend.
- She didn't fire you.

187
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,796
Okay, she stopped
returning my calls.

188
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,506
You know Samantha.

189
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,592
- Her pride got damaged.
- Which was why I kept

190
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,179
leaving her voicemails,
asking her to please
call me back,

191
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,471
so we could talk
about this and fix it.

192
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,768
Look, I understand
that she was upset,

193
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,896
but I thought
I was more to her
than an ATM.

194
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,231
You are.

195
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,569
- She was embarrassed.
- So embarrassed she took a job
and moved to London?

196
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,029
Wait, have you
spoken to her?

197
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,908
No, neither
has Charlotte.

198
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,619
I mean,
we texted and called,
but we never heard back.

199
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:20,208
- Do you think, maybe, if you--
- I did. Multiple texts.

200
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,376
- And nothing.
- Okay.

00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,364
Yeah, I'm jealous.

308
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,242
I'm jealous of your
Peloton instructor.

309
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,160
Well, you should be.

310
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,204
You know she's
from Barcelona?

311
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,289
- She motivates me.
- (Carrie chuckles)

312
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,833
And she's giving me
a special shout- out

313
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,168
on my thousandth ride.

Uh, sorry,
he just told me.

339
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,680
- Someone's quick
with the pronouns.
- Uh, it's fine.

340
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,848
I am the professor.

341
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,477
- Wa-- Y- You're the professor?
- Yeah.

342
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,688
- You're Nya Wallace?
- (chuckles) Yes.

343
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,356
Why do you seem
so surprised?

344
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,692
Well, your braids.

345
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,402
A law professor can't
have hair like mine?

346
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,530
- Why is that?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't, I didn't mean

347
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,240
because of the braids.
I was, I was--

348
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,118
I, I was just thrown
because the braids

349
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,787
are, are so different than
the hair in your photo

350
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,372
on the Columbia website.

351
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,873
My comment had
nothing whatsoever

352
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,708
to do with it being
a Black hairstyle.

353
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,543
I, I knew that
you were Black

354
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,211
when I signed up
for this class.

355
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:44,920
Uh, that was
important to me.

356
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,842
You signed up for this class
because I'm Black?

357
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,302
Well, not just
because you're Black.

358
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,221
I picked this class
because...

359
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,264
you're such a force
in academia

360
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,892
on top of everything you do
as a community activist.

361
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,394
God, I sound like
such a brown- nose.

362
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,479
I mean, um...

363
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,232
please just forget

364
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,818
that I ever said
anything about your hair.

365
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,738
Hair has...
nothing whatsoever

366
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,781
to do with, uh,
appropriateness,

367
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,492
or intelligence,
or gravitas, obviously.

368
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,577
I mean, do I look like
someone who attaches

369
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,245
any significance to hair?

370
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:22,499
I, I let mine go gray,
and I don't care if it
makes me look old.

371
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,419
Not that I'm ageist.
Do I sound ageist?

372
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,337
You really want me
to answer that question?

373
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,799
I am so sorry for
taking everyone's time.

374
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,717
This is not
at all who I am.

375
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,302
I will just be quiet now.

376
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,928
Okay, uh...

377
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,766
- Hi, hi, hello, everyone.
- (all greet professor)

378
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,684
Welcome to
Policies and Principles
of Humanitarian Law.

379
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,061
I am Professor
Nya Wallace,

380
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,938
and before we
delve into this

381
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,647
complicated
and important work,

382
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,108
I just want to clear up

383
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,944
that on the Columbia
University website,

384
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,114
- I am rockin' a short
Halle Berry, right?
- (all chuckling)

385
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,577
This is "X, Y, and Me,"
the podcast that talks about

386
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,288
gender roles, sexual roles,
and... cinnamon rolls.

387
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,917
- (laughing)
- All the roles I care
passionately about.

388
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,794
Representing
the cisgender
women is...

389
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,586
Carrie Bradshaw.

390
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,797
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, Ms. Cis.

391
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,008
And representing
the cishet men is...

392
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,093
the dude himself,
Jackie Nee.

393
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,430
What up, sista- brotha?
(laughs)

394
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,681
That's right because
I'm both and neither.

395
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,310
I am Che Diaz, your host.

396
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,312
And queer, nonbinary,
Mexican, Irish diva

397
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,690
representing everyone
else outside these
two boring genders.

398
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,317
Soundboard:
Woke moment!

399
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,693
- (laughing)
- And yes, I know
that no one person

400
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,654
can represent all the genders,

401
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,947
and sexual orientations,

402
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,450
or an entire race,
and I, I fully acknowledge

403
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,286
that we are complicated,
diverse beings

404
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,204
here on this wondrous planet

405
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,415
all just striving to be
our very best self.

406
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,168
- Many of us just
tryin' to get laid.
- (all laughing)

407
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:48,919
Or at least that's what
we talk about on my show,

408
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,088
so let's figure
some shit out.

409
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,631
- Who's got what?
- I'll go.

410
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,715
- Carrie: Oh, okay.
- Hi, Carrie.

411
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,967
- Hello.
- I have a question

412
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,176
for you about women.

413
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,719
What is it, Jackie?

414
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,014
Why don't you see women
jerkin' it on the subway?

415
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,559
I'm hoping that's
a multiple choice question.

416
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,687
Yeah, good one, Jackie.
I was worried you were gonna
ask something sophomoric,

417
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,896
like, "What can I,
as a straight cis male,

418
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,190
"personally do to eradicate
the harmful patriarchal system

419
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,861
of the gender binary,
and compulsory heterosexuality?"

420
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,780
No, but for serious, I see
dudes masturbating everywhere.

421
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,241
I saw a guy jerkin' off
on the J train today.

422
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,033
I guess that's what
the "J" stands for.

423
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,203
And the "A" train
stands for anal.

424
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,705
- Oh, that must be
why I don't ride it.
- (Jackie laughs)

425
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,332
Soundboard:
Woke moment!

426
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,042
Sexual expression
of any kind should

427
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:29,751
always be discussed
and consented to

428
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,879
by all parties
involved.

429
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,589
Unless it's just you
and your sex toys.

430
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,424
Then, go ahead!

431
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,050
- (Jackie laughs)
- Surprise yourself.

432
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,761
Che:
All right, let's, uh,
move off the prototypes,

433
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,222
and into the personal.
Jackie--

434
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,641
- Yeah.
- Have you ever masturbated
out in pub--

435
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,393
Nah, you know what?
Let's just speed this along.

436
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,396
Is there any public place
where you haven't masturbated?

437
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,525
- Uh... nah.
- (all laughing)

438
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,818
I like to masturbate
at Yankee Stadium.

439
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,737
Well, my version
of masturbation.

440
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,196
I, uh, I wear a Yankees cap,

441
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,825
and I just, uh, I sit
there sippin' a beer,

442
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,076
and...

443
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,703
I really get off
on watching

444
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,705
the bros try
to figure out
what I am.

445
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,207
And it's not just the dudes.
It's also the ladies.

446
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,627
- I'm an equal
opportunity confuser.
- (Jackie chuckles)

447
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,211
- What about you, Carrie?
- Oh, me? What? What? What?

448
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,715
Oh. What about,
What about me?
Oh, oh, oh--

449
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,885
Oh, are you ask--
You're asking me about,
about masturbation?

450
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,804
Yes, I'm, I'm asking
you about masturbation.

451
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,139
Particularly you.
Do you masturbate?

452
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:27,726
Uh, I would like
to buy a vowel, please.

453
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,938
(giggling)

454
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,607
Sorry, I don't--
I don't know
what that means.

455
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,817
Um, okay, yes, sorry.

456
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,903
Let's see. Ooh, yes.
I'm here, okay.

457
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,281
Yes, go. I'm here. Yes.

458
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,116
Um... have you
ever masturbated
in a public place?

459
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,995
Uh, well, uh, not
since Barneys closed.

460
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,872
- Che: Hmm.
- Uh, what's Barneys?

461
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,459
Okay, now that's offensive.

462
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,168
(street noise)

463
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,674
What are we thinkin'
time frame- wise about
our next IVF round?

464
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,259
I don't know, Andre.

465
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,511
Uh, my body still feels off
from that last round,

466
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,806
and why're we talkin' about this
as I'm gettin' on mass transit?

467
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,683
Uh, Samuel was just kinda

468
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,018
pushing me about
whether I'm going out
on the tour or not.

469
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,395
- Now you're pushing me?
- Andre: Am I?

470
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,691
Um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
My bad. I just--

471
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,858
Andre:
I didn't wanna
keep him hangin'.

472
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,986
They've been
so good to me.

473
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,362
No, I get that, um...

474
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,827
Uh... I guess what
I'm saying is, um...

475
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,869
I'm feeling--

476
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,330
(whimsical music playing)

477
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,624
Can't talk right now.

478
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,875
Andre:
No, no. Uh, go ahead, Ny.

479
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,378
- You're feelin' what?
- I can't talk right now,
Andre Rashad.

480
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,256
I have a student
lookin' right at me.
(chuckles)

481
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,132
Shit, she's comin' over here.

482
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:44,678
Okay, I gotta go.
Uh, I'll be home soon.

483
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,055
I'll set dinner.
Nothin' but love.

484
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,265
Okay, bye.

485
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,892
I just wanted
to introduce myself

486
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,894
in a non- manic,
non- crazy lady way.

487
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,063
- Oh. (chuckles)
- I'm Miranda Hobbes,

488
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,898
and that, I don't even
know what to call it,

489
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,358
- performance I gave
about your hair--
- It's fine.

490
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,862
- We don't have to do that again.
- Miranda: Oh, I hear ya.

491
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,447
I, I just wanted you
to know that I am,

492
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,991
actually, a serious person,

493
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,744
and that being in your class
means a lot to me.

494
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,370
- I, I quit--
- (loud guitar riff playing)

495
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,664
I, uh--

496
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,499
(talking louder)
I left corporate law,

497
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,710
recently, after
almost 30 years

498
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,129
because I couldn't be part
of the problem anymore.

499
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,214
I was at home
watching CNN

500
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,675
when the Muslim ban
was initiated,

501
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,844
and I saw all
those attorneys

502
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,221
out at the airport
offering assistance,

503
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:28,889
and I just--
The next thing I knew,

504
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,350
I was in a cab
goin' to JFK

505
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,270
to do something,
anything because,
you know...

506
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,816
my wearing a pink pussy hat
just wasn't cutting it.

507
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,278
- I'm sorry, I didn't
catch a lot of that.
- Probably just as well.

508
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,323
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

509
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,832
Hey, Carrie.
You got a minute?

510
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,752
Oh, sure...
That was a funny
show today.

511
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,171
- I like the gloves.
- Oh, thanks.

512
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,257
Yeah, they're really
mostly for elevator
buttons and handrails.

513
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,010
It's just a little
something I started
during the pandemic.

514
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,011
- Seems to be hangin' in there.
- (Che chuckles)

515
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,055
So, about today's show,

516
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:10,764
you need to dialogue
with us more.

517
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,100
(elevator dings)

518
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,769
Oh, um, no, go ahead.
I'll, I'll ride down with you.

519
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,686
Okay.

520
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,155
Oh, just a few quick puffs.
I'm so wired after a show.

521
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,449
- You want a hit?
- No, I'm, I'm good, thank you.

522
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,956
Yeah, so...

523
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,125
you can't just
sit there giggling.
You know what I mean?

524
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,086
(chuckles)
Well, um,

525
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,129
I'm really stronger
when people call in

526
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,382
with relationship
questions.

527
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,300
You know, today turned
kind of raunchy.

528
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,552
Well, that's where
it goes sometimes,

529
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,763
and you need to go
with it, or the trolls
will label you

530
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,142
"the uptight cisgender
female married lady."

531
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,310
- And that's not who you are.
- It's not?

532
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,104
I know you got more.

533
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,480
C'mon, I mean, you had
a column about sexuality

534
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,442
in a mainstream newspaper
in the fuckin' 1990s.

535
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,154
You're the OG.
You... are badass.

536
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,197
Well, you know, that
was writing at a desk.

537
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,784
I'm not a stand- up
like you two.

538
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,329
I'm, I'm not comfortable
with the more graphic content,

539
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,498
you know, it's just--
It's not me.

540
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,250
Hmm, you might wanna
step out of that box.

541
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,753
Surprise yourself.
Just a suggestion.

542
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,173
Well, in, in my defense,
I did do that anal joke

543
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,341
- about not riding the A train.
- That was good!

544
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,927
- See? Don't hold yourself back.
- (softly) Okay.

545
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,388
You were--
You were so funny
at your job interview.

546
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,599
Yeah, but that was like
our first date, you know?

547
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,767
I gave you all
my good stuff.

548
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,603
Look, I really want
this to work out
for all of us,

549
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,188
so I say this
with love...

550
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,356
ya better step
your pussy up.

551
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,985
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, so what're you gonna do?

552
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,780
I'm gonna...
step my pussy up?

553
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,033
- Hmm, was that a question?
- No.

554
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,951
- Oh.
- I'm gonna step
my pussy up.

555
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,787
Yes!
(laughs)

556
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,458

557

♪ ♪

558
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,614
Do you masturbate?

559
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,870
I feel like that's
a trick question.

560
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,957
- Do you?
- Uh, Senator, I'm gonna
wait for my counsel

561
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,624
before I respond to that.

562
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,836
Is this for your new book?

563
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,463
For the podcast.

564
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,592
I have to step my pussy up.

565
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,135
Well, I don't know what
we're talkin' about,

566
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,470
but I like the sound of it.

567
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:57,472
Well...

568
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,267
do you?

569
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,062
- Do you?
- Yes.

570
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,230
Well, next time
give me a heads up.

571
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,815
I'd like to attend
that event.

572
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,276
You have my LinkedIn
address, right?

573
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:14,489
(clears throat)

574
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:17,575
Masturbate for me.

575
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,120
I wanna see you.

576
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,707
- Okay, what are you doing?
- I'm surprising myself.

577
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,626
Well, you're surprising
the hell outta me, too.

578
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,590
Are you gonna join me?

579
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,051
Mm- mm, I just wanna watch.

580
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,470
With or without my glasses?

581
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,391
Ahem...

582
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,477
What're you doing?

583
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,230
Getting some lube.
I'm not 30.

584
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,648
(chuckles)

585
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,859
I thought you
were reaching
for your emergency

586
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,652
nitroglycerin pill.

587
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,571
(sighs) You want me
to masturbate or not?

588
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,498
(breathing deeply)

589
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,502
- Come here.
- Mm- mm.

590
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,797
Just do what you usually do.
Pretend I'm not here.

591
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,389
(exhaling)

592
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,683

00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,019
- Oh, Carrie!
- (chuckles)

594
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,481
Oh my, Carrie!

595
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,648
I must have you!

596
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,571
- That's some "Bridgerton"
shit there.
- (Carrie chuckles)

597
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,825
- Look at you.
- (Carrie chuckles)

599
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,801
(sighs happily)

600
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,428
Hello, lovers.

601
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,819
Oh... the weekly cigar,

602
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,113
and Allegra
on the same night?

603
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,907
I'm all in, baby.

604
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,450
Do you notice
anything special?

605
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,747
Nope.
(chuckles)

606
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,376
I see the wedding shoes.
How could I not?

607
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,294
Those blue shoes are
the whole ball game.

608
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,005
Carrie:
Hey, I was thinking,
if I get home early enough,

609
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,298
maybe we can drive
out east tonight.

610
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,050
Would you be
up for that?

611
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,511
Depends how spent
I am after Allegra.

612
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,221
All right, well...

613
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,514
just text me
and let me know

614
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,058
and I won't go out
for a drink after.

615
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,729
Okay...
I'll see you later.

616
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,231
Hm?

617
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,276
What?

618
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:57,735
I'm just looking at you.

619
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,327
All right, tell that whore
Allegra I said bye.

620
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,163
(laughs)

621
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,331
(door closes)

622
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,005
Please put this dress on.
I want us all in florals.

623
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:17,881
I wanna wear
what I wanna wear.

624
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,341
What is the problem?
It isn't even poofy.

625
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,595
Rose, we're
gonna be late!

626
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,889
- And it's Lily's big night.
- Leave me out of this.

627
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,390
What's the holdup?
What's happenin'?

628
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,101
What's happening
is that Rose won't
wear her dress.

629
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,103
I picked something
else to wear!

630
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,980
Can't she just wear
what she wants to wear?

631
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,482
No, Harry, no.

632
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,484
I bought this
Oscar de la Renta

633
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,737
- special for tonight.
- Okay, okay.

634
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,450
- How about if I wear it?
- (Rose chuckles)

635
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,370
Rose, baby...

636
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:50,788
can you just
wear the dress?

637
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,791
Charlotte: Please?

638
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,835
Please. For me?

639
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,759
(indistinct chatter)

640
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,138
- Hey, you. I like your outfit.
- It's really cute, right?

641
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,350
Hi, hi, hi!
Sorry we're
a little late!

642
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,101
What the hell is
with that getup?

643
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,853
She looks like
a little Edie Beale.

644
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,396
Anthony, not now.

645
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,482
Not in front of
the Manhattan School
of Music, okay?

646
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,360
Hey, I have
everybody's tickets!

647
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,361
(all greeting)

648
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,280
Steve- o,
long time, no see.

649
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,949
- What's new?
- Hey, I got hearing aids.

650
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,326
- I'm an old timer now.
- No, you're not.

651
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,578
You only have
60% hearing loss
in one ear,

652
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,829
and 40%
in the other.

653
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,331
- Yeah, 'cause I'm old.
- Ugh!

654
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:37,710
- Honey, I think we should get
Lily backstage, don't you?
- Yes, I agree.

655
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,255
Lily!
Here, tickets.

656
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,382
- Brady, here are your tickets.
- Thanks, Mom.

657
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,384
- Good luck!
Are you nervous?
- Not really.

658
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:48,513
- I've played this piece
like a billion times.
- Oh my god, I wanna be you.

659
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,266
- Go!
- I'll see you all inside!

660
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,309
- Have a good show!
- Oh, Anthony, I gave
Stanford's ticket to Carrie.

661
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,396
- Okay.
- I got it.

662
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,731
- So, where's your better half?
- He's late.

663
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,234
- He couldn't decide
what to wear.
- Of course.

664
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,404
Well, there he is!
Hey, good lookin'!

665
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,906
- Whatcha got cookin'?
- You left?!

666
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,576
- You just left?!
- Oh, we're not
in the same place.

667
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,452
I told you
I wasn't waiting.

668
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,329
What kind
of person
just leaves?

669
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,915
- Steve, would you ever
just leave Miranda?
- Oh, boy.

670
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,542
What?
What he say?

671
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,253
You were picking
out a suit for
an hour and a half.

672
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,504
Periwinkle or tan?
Periwinkle or tan?

673
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,756
It didn't
friggin' matter!

674
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,968
I'm goin' in.
Carrie has your ticket.

675
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,053
- I do.
- Did I kiss you hello yet?

676
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,223
Mm- mm.
What was all that?

677
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,603
- Us on a good night.
- Oh, Lord.

678
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,564
Everyone was looking at me
like I was the white lady

679
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,232
who couldn't stop
saying the word "Black."

680
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,192
It's a miracle nobody
pulled out their phone,

681
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,944
or I would be
a meme now.

682
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,196
What do you
think was goin'
on with you?

683
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,781
I think I was
just so worried

684
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,034
about saying the wrong
thing in this climate

685
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,994
that I said all
the wrong things.

686
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,288
I'm sure you didn't say
all the wrong things.

687
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,999
You're right.
I'll probably blurt out
some new ones tomorrow.

688
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,961
God, is this even moving?
I really have to go.

689
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,131
Well, there's no line
for the men's room,
as usual.

690
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,800
Fuck it. I'm 55,
and I have to pee.

691
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,677
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
the show is about to begin.

692
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,804
Please find your
way to your seats.

693
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,599
It's funny, you
couldn't stop talking,

694
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,185
and my boss told me if
I wanna keep my podcast job,

695
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,728
which I do, I'm gonna
have to start talking,

696
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:22,607
and a lot more
graphically about sex.

697
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,858
Miranda:
That's not who you are.

698
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:27,403
Well, we can't stay
who we were, right?

699
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,074
Oh, yeah, no, you're
in the right place.

700
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,950
Sorry, I'm just standing
guard for my friend.

701
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,369
She'll be done
any second now.

702
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,663
- (toilet flushes)
- See?

703
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,666
- Just--
- Hey.

704
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,004
- Hello, again.
- Oh yeah.

705
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,965
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

706
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,009
- Hey, where's Stanny?
- He's in the balcony.

707
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,844
He'll meet ya
in the lobby to go
for a drink after.

708
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,848
Hope you like your Cosmos
with a side of drama.

709
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,059
Charlotte gave
his seat to Rose.

710
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,853
- Well, what's he doing
in the balcony?
- Actin' out.

711
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,816
Accused me of scrollin'
hot boys at a friggin'
kids' piano recital.

712
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,193
- Well, what're you doin'?
- Scrollin' hot boys...

713
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,736
for my sourdough
business.

714
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,904
Hotfellas Bread
is not gonna find

715
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,615
its own hot fellas
to deliver the bread.

716
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,074
So true.

717
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,911
- Well, what about him?
- Unavail.

718
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,746
- Carrie: Well, he's hot.
- Unavail.

719
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:23,876
Not hot, not hot, not hot.

720
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,045
- Well, he looks like
he could kill you.
- Hot.

721
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,755
Who wants wine?
Carrie?

722
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,718
Oh, sure.
I love some
good purse wine.

723
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,929
- Audience Member: Hi, Charlotte.
- Hi, how are you?

724
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,723
(gasps)
Miranda.

725
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:41,060
What?
I had a rough
first day of school,

726
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,354
and I'm lookin' at two
hours of tween Mozart.

727
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,399
Let it go.

728
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,068
- Charlotte... Hi!
- Hi!

729
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,820
I wanted you to meet
my mother- in- law,
Eunice Wexley.

730
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:54,073
- Oh, it is so nice to meet you.
- Hello.

731
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:58,161
- Uh, Lisa, where am I seated?
- I have you seated here

732
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,246
with Herbert Jr.
and Gabrielle in this row

733
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,040
right in front of
Herbert and myself.

734
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,333
This far back?

735
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,044
Yes... God.

736
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,589
(gasps)
Miranda brought wine.

737
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,424
She had a rough
first day of school.

738
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,593
My hero.
May I have some?

739
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,052
Here, give that
to Black Charlotte.

740
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,017
- You sure you good?
- I got this.

741
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,144
All right,
you got this.

742
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,192
(applause)

743
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,535
(bench scraping)

744
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,960
(scraping continues)

745
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,712
All right, uh,
he don't got this.

746
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,797
(softly) No.

747
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,092
(playing "Minuet in G Major"
by Bach)

748
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,178
(plays wrong notes)

749
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,518
(plays wrong notes)

750
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,937
(wine pouring)

751
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,356
I think my soul
just left my body.

752
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,280
- Pass.
- Lisa: Don't you
want to know what it is?

753
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,282
Is it alcoholic
in nature?

754
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,910
Then pass.

755
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,370
Thank you.

756
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,877
(playing wrong notes)

757
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,881
Welcome to Peloton.
I'm Allegra Planche,

758
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,341
and thank you for joining me

759
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,969
for this 45- minute power ride.

760
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,554
- Let's go!
- Yes!

761
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,014
(playing skillfully)

762
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,440
- Tell your son to stop.
- What?

763
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,277
They're making out.

764
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,865
It's your turn.
I can't always
be the bad guy.

765
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,576
- Mom, we will not
be sex- shamed.
