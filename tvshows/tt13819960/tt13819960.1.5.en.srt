1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,885
Now, be kind.
I've had this place forever.

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,222
Buyers love a classic
old brownstone,

3
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,433
and I can light
a few Diptyques

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,851
to cover that classic
old brownstone smell.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,354
Seema, this is
just me showing you

6
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,898
where I've been staying,
since you asked.

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,777
-It's not about a sale.
-Seema: Everything is
about a sale.

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,530
-Carrie: Ooh.
-What the hell are you doing?

9
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,115
Oh, it's just my lower back.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,702
Sometimes, I need a little
help getting up the stairs.

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,870
A little help?

12
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,164
You're using
an umbrella as a cane.

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:45,170
The internet says
I have "old lady back."

14
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:50,175
The internet is for perverts.
What does your orthopedist say?

15
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,260
Ohh...

16
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,930
-you know I don't
have one of those.
-Well, now you do.

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,474
Let me call
my cousin's office,

18
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,391
and get you
an appointment
later today.

19
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,934
Oh, no, no, please
don't go to any trouble

20
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,188
over my completely
common senior condition.

21
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,066
Nonsense. You're not old,
and Vik doesn't have anything

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,944
he can't move to get you in.

23
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,113
-Charming.
-Thank you.

24
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,823
I can have a crew here
to take care of that tomorrow.

25
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,577
-Oh.
-Seema: Hi, my darling,
it's Seema.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,121
Does Vikash have any time
in the next couple of hours

27
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,791
to see my friend
about her sore back?

28
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,042
No, it's not an emergency,

29
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,795
but she does need
to be seen immediately,

30
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,005
preferably before 3:00.
I have a showing.

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,965
Seema, there is
no urgency to this

32
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,133
'cause, 'cause I,
actually, I,

33
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:37,263
I bought these very fancy
patches that I saw on TV.

34
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,848
They heat up when
you stick them on.

35
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,183
They're like magic,
back magic.

36
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:45,563
Thank you so much, Jessie.
We'll see you soon. Bye.

37
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,399
I should hire you to be
in charge of my entire life.

38
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,818
I know you're joking
but, honestly,

39
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,569
you could use some help.

40
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,071
Chop-chop, grandma.
Vik will see you in an hour.

41
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,203
See, it's magic.

42
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,371
(Seema snorts)

43
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,084
Oh, ow, oh wow.

44
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,672
Okay, I'm here.
How we doin'?

45
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,131
What on earth
took you so long?

46
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,801
The technician
took her X-rays like
half an hour ago.

47
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,761
Um... I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

48
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,306
Hiya, Carrie.
I'm Vikash.

49
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,517
I'm sure Seema gave you
my entire resume,

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,018
and dating history
in the car on the way,

51
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:28,314
so I won't bother you
with a formal introduction.

52
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,149
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Dr. Patel.

53
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,361
So, my colleague, Dr. Wilson,
and I looked at your films--

54
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,404
It's arthritis, right?

55
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,238
I have old lady disease
in my back.

56
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,031
That's what
the internet told me.

57
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,033
I am sorry if
my medical degree

58
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,910
contradicts
Google's algorithm,

59
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,078
but I think...

60
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,375
Well, I'm not a doctor,
but, uh, that's not my back.

61
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,543
Wait for it.

62
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,505
It's your hip.

63
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,424
You have an undiagnosed
congenital birth defect.

64
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,885
-I do?
-Dr. Patel: But it's something
I can fix surgically,

65
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,053
and get you back
on your feet in no time.

66
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,890
I'm not an old lady!

67
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:06,060
I have a congenital
hip defect.

68
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,937
But you are having
hip surgery,

69
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,356
so it's, it's
kind of an old thing.

70
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,858
Yeah, hip as
an adjective is young,

71
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,860
but hip as a noun
is kinda old.

72
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,320
If we're being honest,
using hip as an adjective

73
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,698
is knock-knock-knockin'
on the nursin' home door, too.

74
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,910
-I am no longer
paying for lunch.
-Come on.

75
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,579
We are thrilled that you
found an archaeologist

76
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,122
to saw your old
carcass open,

77
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,541
and try to put those
sanded-down fossils

78
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,667
-inside you back together
-Anthony!

79
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,253
What?! She laughed.

80
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,631
And this is my first solo
lunch with you ladies.

81
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,256
I've really gotta bring it.

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,342
This calls for champagne.

83
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,930
-Miranda, it, it
isn't even 12:30.
-We're celebrating.

84
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,391
Anthony is here,
and Carrie is not old.

85
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:45,850
Carrie:
No, I'm not,

86
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,185
and Dr. Patel said

87
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,146
he couldn't believe
I was still up and walking,

88
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,732
and after these last
two months, neither can I.

89
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,318
So, I have started
an Excel spreadsheet,

90
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,153
so that we can all
take turns helping out

91
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,947
with Carrie's recovery
post-surgery.

92
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,782
You guys, this is
so nice, truly,

93
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,617
and if it's too much,
you know, I can,

94
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,910
I can always
hire a nurse.

95
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,287
I just... I just
don't wanna be alone.

96
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,414
-You won't be alone.
-We're here for you.

97
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,332
I'm not changin'
any bedpans.

98
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:14,087
I would rather die
than show you my pee.

99
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,381
Okay... They say

100
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,966
that Carrie
will be on crutches

101
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,967
for two to three weeks,

102
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,012
and then,
six to eight weeks PT,

103
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,305
and then, full recovery
in a few months.

104
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,059
-But no strenuous exercise.
-Not a problem.

105
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,269
-And no heels.
-Problem.

106
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,062
Do you even
own a flat shoe?

107
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:37,652
Yes, I bought a pair
of Toms in 2007.

108
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:42,281
But that was...
just because it made me
feel like a good person.

109
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,825
Miranda: Aw.

110
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,827
So, we're all set
for the entire class

111
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,621
to go to MoMA PS1
to see the James Turrell?

112
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,164
Yes, we are.
I collected all

113
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,749
the permission slips
and fees,

114
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,460
and I think Ainsley took care
of the charter bus.

115
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,838
I did, even got us a discount.

116
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,840
Great!
Does anyone have anything else

117
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,216
before we break for this week?

118
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,052
-Veronica.
-Uh, n-nothing official.

119
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,596
Just wanted to say
how funny Rock was
in the school play.

120
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,975
Oh my goodness.
Yes, Rock, yes!

121
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:09,726
Oh, Rock was
a total rock star--

122
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,187
Wait, Wait,
who's Rock?

123
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,897
Did-did I somehow
miss a new kid?

124
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,899
No, Rock your--

125
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,529
Charlotte:
Did everyone just freeze?

126
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,573
Okay, ladies,
we're done here, right?
Talk soon.

127
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,616
Charlotte, I'm gonna
call you right now.

128
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,791
-Okay.
-(phone ringing)

129
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,168
-Hello?
-Lisa (on phone): It's me.

130
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,711
I, I assumed you knew.

131
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,379
Wait, what is happening?
Knew what?

132
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,214
Rose told everyone
at school to call her Rock.

133
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:45,887
Well, is it Rock as in
like a jokey nickname,

134
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,390
or is it Rock as in,
"I don't wanna be
Rose anymore"?

135
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,810
Sorry, sweetie...
I don't know the context.

136
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,104
(chopping loudly)

137
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,065
Are, are you hammering
or something?

138
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,109
No, no, I'm just making snacks.

139
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,197
-Bam! I'm beating you, Dad.
-Oh no! Dude!

140
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,990
You lose, come on!

141
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:11,329
-Oh!
-Harry, can we please take
a moment from exploding frogs?

142
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,248
I'm confused.
I need information.

143
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,711
Rose, did you change
your name at school to Rock?

144
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,963
-Yeah.
-You changed your name?

145
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,090
And you didn't
want to tell us

146
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,634
before you told
everyone at school?

147
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,134
I did let you know.

148
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,969
I put up a TikTok.

149
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,472
Well, you put up
about 10 TikToks today,

150
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,766
so... I guess I'm behind.

151
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,101

- ♪ R-o-c-k, Rock ♪
-(both singing along)

156
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,156
♪ R-o-c-k, Rock ♪

157
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,491
R-o-c-k, Rock.
We get it.

158
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,079
I'm sorry, what,
wh-what's happenin'?

159
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,289
Are, are you a rapper now?

160
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,084
-Is, is Rock
your rapper name?
-Dad.

161
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,294
Rapper name?
Don't ever say that again.

162
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,629
Charlotte:
Let's stay focused.

163
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:06,008
Did you do this
because your friend Ellen
changed her name to Eli?

164
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,011
No, it's because
I feel like Rock.

165
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,764
And Eli now
goes by Scout.

166
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,184
Well, good for Scout,
so let me get this straight.

167
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,146
Everyone at school is
now calling you Rock?

168
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,188
Even your teachers?

169
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,815
Yeah, they're cool with it.

170
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,400
Oh, well, as long
as they're cool with it.

171
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,488
-Hey!
-Oh, hey!

172
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,032
-You still up?
-Yeah, just need
to get some water.

173
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,536
Wow, you get a lotta
packages from Amazon.

174
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,957
Yes, I do... too many...
and not all for me.

175
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,461
Uh, tube socks and Astroglide.
(gasps) Strawberry flavor.

176
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,341
Sorry, meant to intercept that.

177
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,135
Miranda:
Next time, please do.

178
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,890
You know, I love how cool
you are about all that stuff.

179
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,601
I mean, if my mom ever
opened my lube in her house,

180
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,352
she would've choked me
to death with a rosary.

181
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,901
Ooh, what book did you order?

182
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,030
Oh, I, uh, I didn't order this.
Must be a mistake.

183
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,992
Yeah, it's, it's a mistake.
That's not for me.

184
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,577
Luisa:
See, that's why I never
order things online.

185
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,579
You never know who has
access to your information.

186
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,583
Well, I'm, uh, I'm definitely
gonna check my account

187
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,210
because I did not order this.

188
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,217
-Receptionist: Name?
-Oh, Carrie Bradshaw
for Dr. Patel.

189
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,845
I, I filled out
all the forms online

190
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,223
during an extremely
productive panic attack.

191
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,267
Excellent.
Well, then, Miss Bradshaw,
take this buzzer,

192
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,478
and when it lights up,
we'll take you back.

193
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,981
-Really? Am I at Applebee's?
-You wish.

194
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:44,982
Lucky for you,
our knives are sharper.

195
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,069
-(chuckles) Okay, thank you.
-You're welcome.

196
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:48,486
Ouch.

197
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,491
Ugh.

198
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,579
This is very unsettling.

199
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,248
Well, it is a hospital.

200
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,750
No, I meant
my stocks and socks.

201
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,419
From here down I look
like a Vermont art teacher.

202
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,505
(laughs)

203
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,090
Will I be able
to trade this in

204
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,508
for a free margarita
at the end?

205
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,927
Oh.

206
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,846
Speaking of that,

207
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,684
Charlotte sent me a book
about quitting drinking.

208
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,977
-She did?
-Yeah.

209
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,728
I was unboxing
my teenage son's

210
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,480
artificially
flavored lubricant

211
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:25,648
and sweat socks,

212
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,567
and I found a package
with a book in it

213
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,860
called "Quit Like a Woman:

214
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,862
How to Make
the Radical Choice
Not to Drink,"

215
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,489
and many more
bullshit words.

216
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,116
Quit like a woman?
What does that even mean?
What?

217
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,994
Curtsy to a bottle of vodka
as it makes double your salary

218
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,497
-for doing the exact same job?
-Exactly!

219
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,167
And she didn't even
have the balls to tell me
she sent it.

220
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,794
She just Amazoned me.

221
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:47,837
Amazoned me?
Did you just make that up?

222
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,631
I think so.

223
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,467
Sh-She could've at least
included a little gift card.

224
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,930
"Dear Miranda,
I think you're an alcoholic.
Love, Charlotte."

225
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,142
-And you're sure she sent it?
-Who else?

226
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,687
Did you see the face
she made when I wanted
to order champagne at lunch?

227
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,692
And at Che's concert,
she was like, "Miranda,
that's three cocktails."

228
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,902
It was a comedy concert,
for God's sake!

229
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:16,657
-So, you don't think you
need to quit like a woman?
-What?!

230
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,952
No!
What I need to do
is send her a book,

231
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,579
"How to Get the Stick Outta
Your Ass Like a Woman."

232
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,503
-(Carrie sighs)
-Okay, well... I need caffeine.

233
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,590
You gonna drink
your coffee like a woman?

234
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,342
Yeah, want one?

235
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,719
No, I'm on strict
no food or water

236
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,431
-by mouth before
your procedure orders.
-All right.

237
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,186
How about a little
post-surgical recovery treat?

238
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,937
(gasps)
Oh, yes, please.

239
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,023
A, a diet peach Snapple
and a PayDay?

240
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:54,278
-Wow, you are kind of
a handful lately.
-Sorry.

241
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,448
(light music playing)

242
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,582
Charlotte:
So, I'll be taking
her home tomorrow.

243
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:09,627
Charlotte: Great.
And I have her on Thursday.

244
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,588
You were a tomboy when
you were younger, right?

245
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:16,759
Um, I think that if Luisa
were here, she would say

246
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,888
we're not supposed to use
that word but, yeah, still am.

247
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,599
-Let me ask you something.
-Hm?

248
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,435
Did you ever wish that
you weren't a girl?

249
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,896
Sure... Every time
I have a mammogram.

250
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,440
Why?

251
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,235
I'm just, just going
through somethin' with Rose.

252
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,988
Oh, hey.

253
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,117
How long was I asleep?

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,743
Uh, 10 minutes?

255
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,744
Hmm.

256
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,039
I think I have to pee.

257
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,584
Wait... No.

258
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,837
No, yeah.

259
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,589
Yeah, I definitely
have to pee.

260
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,592
Well, uh, I'll,
I'll call the nurse.

261
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,177
Oh no, I don't
think I can wait.

262
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,848
I am, I am really feeling that
entire bucket of ice chips

263
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,515
I just wolfed down.

264
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,935
-Um.
-Yeah, I can't wait.

265
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,313
Okay, um, well,
is there a, a,
like a bedpan?

266
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,150
How dare you.

267
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,610
-(Charlotte laughing)
-Just, just lift me up.

268
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,196
I've done it with the nurses.
I can do it with you two.

269
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,660
-Does this hurt?
-No, I feel nothing.

270
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,413
You know that whole
pain pill addiction thing?

271
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,416
-Yeah.
-I totally get it.

272
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,129
Oh, dang.
When did you
get so strong?

273
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,380
Well, I read in
"Parenting Magazine"

274
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,424
that you should
be strong enough

275
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,884
to lift your
heaviest child

276
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,635
in case of emergency.

277
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,138
-What?
-I've been doing burpees.

278
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,264
(scoffs)

279
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,974
(phone ringing)

280
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,810
Oh... um...

281
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,398
Hello.

282
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,819
No, um, Carrie is, um,
indisposed at the moment.
This is...

283
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,071
Rambo.

284
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,658
-Why'd she call herself Rambo?
-I have no idea.

285
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,786
-Can we please
just get me down?
-Mm-hm, mm-hm.

286
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,330
-Okay...
-Okay.

287
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,789
Miranda:
Oh, that's so lovely.

288
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,876
-Oh, okay.
-Miranda: She'll be thrilled.

289
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,294
Uh, no, you should
come right up.

290
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,339
Um, uh, we're in 1406.

291
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,758
Ooh, wee! Ahh.

292
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:25,429
Well, this is a very
special episode of "Friends,"

293
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,681
"The One Where They
Lower Her to the Toilet."

294
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,684
Miranda:
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

295
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,188
-Oh good, more people.
-Miranda: It was your boss.

296
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,482
-Do I have a boss?
-Che.

297
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,692
She's on her way up
with dinner for you.

298
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,654
-How nice is that?
-No, no more people.

299
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,574
And it's not she, it's they.
They are on their way up.

300
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,076
Right, I knew that.
I, I wasn't thinking.

301
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,871
No, you weren't because
I'm in a hospital gown
on a toilet,

302
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,042
and I don't need company,
so please make that
Che visit not happen.

303
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,586
No, go, so I can go.

304
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,215
-Okay.
-Should I go, too?

305
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,550
No, sadly, you have to stay

306
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,511
-to help me back up.
-Sure.

307
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,389
(urinating)

308
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:12,226
Hmm... think it
was a false alarm.

309
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,479
Oh no, Carrie... you're peeing.

310
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,022
I am?

311
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,400
Yes! See?

312
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,486
-Am I done?
-No, not yet.

313
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,322
(urinating continues)

314
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,907
-I'll let you know.
-(softly): Okay.

315
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,411
And so, the doctor walks
into my hospital room

316
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,622
and he announces,
"Cheryl has diverticulitis,"

317
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,498
and my dad,
who'd fallen asleep

318
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,084
in the empty bed
next to mine,

319
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,878
bolts... upright,
out of a dead sleep,

320
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,214
and shouts,
like he's talkin'
to a complete idiot,

321
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,009
"Yeah, we already know
Cheryl likes girls."

322
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,218
Your father thought--

323
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,886
My father thought
the gastroenterologist

324
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,263
had diagnosed me as a dyke.

325
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,639
(both laughing)

326
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,392
It was hilarious.

327
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,894
And thank God the doc
thought it was funny because

328
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,439
I was basically
in and out of here seeing him
for like two years straight,

329
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,567
and that could've gotten,
uh, real awkward.

330
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,612
So... are y--
Are you okay now?
I mean--

331
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,114
-Yeah, I figured out
how to manage it, yeah.
-Mm-hm.

332
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,782
And even though it's
about watching what I eat,

333
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,619
it's also about
watching what I feel...

334
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,786
what I say, what I do.

335
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:15,831
-(Che sighs)
-What do you mean?

336
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,419
Cheryl used to hold
everything in...

337
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,463
all that unhappiness,
and, and shame

338
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,466
just twisted up in there,

339
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,176
just, yeah, making her
physically and emotionally
constipated,

340
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,972
just lying to herself
and everyone else,
just feeling so trapped.

341
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:38,687
(sighs)
But now, now I just--
I let it all out.

342
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,106
I tell the whole truth
on myself on stage, off.

343
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,984
I feel it.
I, I do it. I be it.

344
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,361
So much healthier.

345
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,446
I mean, I-I'm not saying
I got all of me figured out,

346
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,239
but I haven't
shit my pants
in three years.

347
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,741
I'm sorry,
I know we're eating.

348
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,534
Well, I can't
top that win...

349
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,911
(laughs)

350
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,246
but, um...

351
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,748
I was feeling trapped, too,

352
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,751
-at, at my law firm.
-Mm-hm.

353
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,961
So, I finally just quit.

354
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,257
It felt like...

355
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,053
like life's too short,

356
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,097
-you know?
-Oh yeah.

357
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,267
Good for you.

358
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,770
Good for you.

359
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,734
Oh, that's really spicy.

360
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,528
Do you think I'd
bring anything mild?

361
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,405
-No, oh my god.
-(Che laughs)

362
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,031
-Oh no.
-Oh.

363
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,908
♪ ♪

364
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,456
Okay... you get
the wheelchair, Nick.

365
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,375
-I'll get the precious cargo.
-Nick: Alright.

366
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,379
Okay, be right back, Carrie.

367
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,464
And then, I'll put ya
in your wheelchair,

368
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,342
and take ya upstairs
to eat your din-din.

369
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,389
As much as I die
for his Baby Jane Hudson,

370
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,099
this is all
very unnecessary.

371
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,393
I've could've just
taken an ambulette home.

372
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,936
No, it's important
for him to help.

373
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,187
He needs to know that
he's still included.

374
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:07,359
It's also important
that I don't tumble
out the chair

375
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,819
and kiss all 10 steps.

376
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,779
I'm gonna talk to him
and make sure it's safe.

377
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,865
Please do.

378
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,284
Anthony, Carrie is worried
you're gonna drop her.

379
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,745
I'm not liftin' her.
I'll pop my hernia net.

380
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,372
That's what
Prince Boner here is for.

381
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,458
-Are you ready?
-Ready for what?

382
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,709
For me.

383
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:25,919
Oh.

384
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:31,300
Oh, boop-boop.

385
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,219
-Anthony:
This thing's high as a kite.
-Ah, feel like I'm flying.

386
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,263
-Are you okay, Carrie?
-Never better.

387
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,976
In fact, I take it back.
This was totally necessary.

388
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,061
Okay.

389
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,229
Oh, no, no, no, no, Jack.

390
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,941
You cannot say
boundaries and girlfriends

391
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,110
in the same sentence.

392
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,613
My girlfriends are
always there for me,

393
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:57,493
no... matter... what.

394
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,620
They are there for me.
In fact, you know what?

395
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,622
I remember this time

396
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,999
that my friend, Samantha Jones,

397
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:09,129
even pulled my diaphragm
out with her bare hand

398
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,422
because it got stuck.

399
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,800
-(laughing)
-Boundaries, Carrie.

400
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,136
And I'm saying
it was really stuck,

401
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,430
like she was up
in there for like

402
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,099
-a minute.
-Oh, a whole minute! Yes!

403
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,770
-I'm sweating.
-Schvitzing like a pig.
Yas, queen!

404
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,980
Uh, well, this podcast

405
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,983
just became everything
I ever wanted it to be,

406
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,319
so I just wanna thank everyone
for making this episode

407
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,695
of "X, Y, and Me" possible,

408
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,367
especially the doctor
who prescribed whatever
painkillers Carrie's on.

409
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,035
-Peace, everybody.
-Leave meeting.

410
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:44,957
So, back to bed,
or a little walk around?

411
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,211
-Uhh... bed, please.
-Charlotte: Okay. (laughs)

412
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:56,218
I feel I am, finally...
getting the hang

413
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,720
of this podcasting thing, huh?

414
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,347
Yeah!

415
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,432
-Ooh!
-Ooh, ah, ah!

416
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,725
-Did ya hear me?
-I did, I did.

417
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,020
You sounded
extremely comfortable.

418
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,314
Did, did you hear
what you said?

419
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,024
Well, what did I say?

420
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:13,986
You told the diaphragm story,

421
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,071
and you mentioned
Samantha by name.

422
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,367
-I did?
-Uh-huh.

423
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,161
Well... there are a lot
of Samanthas out there.

424
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,039
Well, you used
her last name, too.

425
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,292
-Oops.
-Do you think she'll
be okay with that?

426
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,209
Carrie:
Uh...

427
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,712
I think I'm allowed
to tell the story.

428
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:36,592
It's... my vagina...
my story.

429
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,886
Besides, this podcast
isn't even on her radar.

430
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,930
She's off in... London.

431
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,851
Yeah, but...
I read the "Daily Mail."

432
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:49,855
Oh, what--
What, you think
she would be upset?

433
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,734
I just think, maybe,
you should let her know.
That's all.

434
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,111
And, that way,
if someone else tells her,

435
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,905
she's not gonna be surprised.

436
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,078
I think what Robin is
trying to say is that

437
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,998
a child at this age
is still developing,

438
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,584
and exploring
who they are.

439
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,920
-Do I have that right, Robin?
-Yes.

440
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,006
-More or less.
-And we, we get all that.

441
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,092
We're just--
We're a little taken aback

442
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,761
that this particular child

443
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,431
was allowed
to adopt a new name

444
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,516
without the parents
being informed.

445
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,728
I honestly had no idea
that you didn't know.

446
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,605
-Did you, Robin?
-I did not, Laura.

447
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,273
Rock never gave
us any clue that

448
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,858
their parents were resistant
to their changing identity.

449
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,779
Their?
D-Did you just say their?

450
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,698
We are not resistant, Robin.

451
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,035
And according to my reading,
Laura, there is a wide range

452
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,578
in this type of exploration,

453
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,080
so we are just
trying to figure out

454
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,249
how seriously we
should take this.

455
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,126
This is a very supportive
environment for all children.

456
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,966
Cisgender, gender fluid,
nonbinary, trans.

457
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,177
Exactly.
This is a journey that
we are all on together.

458
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,136
We're here for you,
and we can recommend

459
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,598
a therapist,
support group,
peer counseling,

460
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,311
-whatever would help.
-Wait. Therapy? Counseling?

461
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,438
What happened to the part
about a child this age

462
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,815
is still growing
and exploring?

463
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,275
That's still true...

464
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,778
but Rock is very clear,

465
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,657
and in matters such as this,
we take our cues
from the children.

466
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,159
We're talkin' about
a 12-year-old here.

467
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,620
Rose would eat
ice cream for every meal
if it was up to her.

468
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,330
Rock.

469
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,587
So, we just have
to accept this now?

470
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,256
This is done.
They made the call.

471
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,842
I don't even
know if I buy it.

472
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,552
Rose is a showoff,
a big ham.

473
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,972
Could just be
for attention...
or to bug us.

474
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,932
She practically
gave us the finger
at her 3D ultrasound.

talk about your kid to you...

477
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,403
it's the most humbling
experience I've ever had
as a father.

478
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,240

and some aged tequila,

Oh, come on in.

a little opioid nap now.

-We gotta keep it down.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

494
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,387
Got it, so probably
not a great idea to ask

495
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,765
-if she wants
to do a shot then.
-Probably not.

You know, when I was
in seventh grade,

667

all my friends
got a perm.

and then, I'll be back in

699
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,526
and we'll start with a deep
lower body massage.

doesn't cover Travis.
