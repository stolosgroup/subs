1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:09,551
I am so excited about
your date with the teacher!

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:14,472
- That is one great head of hair.
- Well, okay, yes, it is a great

3
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,558
head of hair,
but it is not a date.

4
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,685
It is a do-over
between two people

5
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,395
who got sick
on one another.

6
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,063
Let's take
the romance out of it.

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,983
I think you just did.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,611
- I should've gotten
the baguette thing.
- I should've ordered the soup.

9
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,783
So... I have a favor to ask,

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,953
and it involves manual labor,

11
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,413
and you two coming to Brooklyn.

12
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,415
Well... how can we say no?

13
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,751
- Oh!
- Oh, no, no. I'm asking.

14
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,503
- How can we say no?
- You can't.

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,213
We need a huge
turnout on Saturday

16
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,590
to finish painting
the women's shelter

17
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,674
I've been working
on with Nya,

18
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,427
and it would be so great
if you guys would come help.

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,262
I'm there.
And I'll bring the kids.

20
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,014
I'm a really good painter.

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,974
- Carrie?
- Oh, well...

22
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,643
when I was on stage crew
in high school,

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,270
they asked me,
"Please stop painting,"

24
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,230
so I will happily
write a check.

25
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,233
You can't be the white lady
who just writes a check.

26
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,985
If I can paint,
you can paint.

27
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,279
- You gotta change it up.
Speaking of change...

28
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,406
- Gotcha.
- remember how I was
still getting my period

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,286
very regularly for years
after you guys had stopped
getting yours?

30
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,873
It has been so long
since we'd heard
from smug Charlotte.

31
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,958
I was afraid
she'd retired.

32
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,461
- Well... I think I'm done.
- Mentioning it?

33
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,630
No, done done.

34
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,881
I haven't gotten
my period in four months,

35
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,967
so I think
I'm finally in menopause.

36
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,762
Welcome to the club.
Prepare to be sweaty.

37
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,388
Actually, it's funny.

38
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,183
I haven't gotten
any hot flashes,

39
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,477
or breast tenderness,
or brain fog,

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,979
or any of those awful
symptoms you guys had.

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,483
I'm not being smug.

42
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,781
- Hello?
It's Lisette,
your downstairs neighbor.

43
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,782
Oh.

44
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,869
What, like there's
a Lisette from upstairs?

45
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,870
-  Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,497
I'm sorry for
the home invasion,

47
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,665
but just real quick,

48
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,834
um, I'm a jewelry designer,

49
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,752
and I wanted
to give you this.

50
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,672
I love a home invasion
with what I'm assuming

51
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,006
- is free jewelry.
- Yes.

52
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,009
Oh, it's pretty.

53
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,011
I would be so stoked
if you wore this out,

54
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,847
or, maybe, put it
on your Insta?

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,225
When Scarlett Johansson
wore me, sales spiked, so.

56
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,310
God, I just made
myself sick saying that.

57
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,397
I'm sorry.
It's what I have to do,
or it's back to modeling, so.

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,276
Please lower
your expectations
on those sales spikes.

59
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,279
- You know,
I'm just a lowly writer.
- No, hardly.

60
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,697
I'm obsessed
with your podcast.

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,865
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,869
- I guessed a size five.
- If you say so.

63
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,121
Oh, that's pretty.
What is that?

64
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,873
Oh... this is
my wedding ring.

65
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,375
Oh, I didn't know
you were married.

66
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,626
I mean,
I've never seen him.

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,086
Is it, like,
long-distance
or something?

68
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,798
Well, yes, very.

69
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,341
I dated a guy
in Santa Fe once,

70
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,845
and we could not
make it work at all.

71
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,097
Well, is that it's,
it's not long-distance.
He died.

72
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,727
I just... haven't
taken it off yet.

73
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,562
Oh... I'm--

74
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,566
Again.
Practice your Torah
portion again.

75
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,236
- It's only two weeks away.
- But I don't wanna
have a Bat Mitzvah.

76
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,739
That's why you're
having a "They Mitzvah."

77
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,907
So, come on, again.
From the top.

78
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,285
- Saved by the bell.

79
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,996
Hey, Anthony,
I only have a minute.

80
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,372
I only have
a minute, too.

81
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,040
Someone called in sick,

82
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,083
so I'm the hot fella today,

83
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:29,792
and if anyone has
a problem with it,

84
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,752
I'll see them in court.

85
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,129
I'm not done with you!

86
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,964
Is it okay
if I bring someone
I just started seeing

87
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,758
- to dinner Friday?
Of course.

88
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,301
Is he...
appropriate for children?

89
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,596
I think so.
I can't find his dick
anywhere online.

90
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,348
- Okay.
Relax.

91
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,808
He's sexy, smart,
always reading.

92
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,935
I think he's read everything
that's ever been published.

93
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,146
No!
- What the hell?

94
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,982
I have no idea.
I, I, I gotta go.

95
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,152
Go...
That bread is
friggin' heavy.

96
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,695
I'm not paying
these guys enough.

97
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,906
Oh no, no way, no!
- Okay, bye.

98
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,783
- Lily, what on earth?!
No, no, no!

99
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,451
I just got my period,
and my tracking app

100
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,828
says that I'm gonna
get it again on the 21st.

101
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,956
Lindsay's pool party
in the Hamptons!

102
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,248
- Okay.
-  Shit!

103
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,125
Okay,
let's just calm down.

104
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,461
Stop cursing.

105
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,589
I know you said
you'd rather die
than use a tampon.

106
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,633
Yes,
I would rather die
than use a tampon.

107
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,634
Well, these are
your choices.

108
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,553
You could either...
learn to use a tampon,

109
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,389
which I'm happy
to help you do,

110
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,433
- or skip the pool party.
- No!

111
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,143
Gah!
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

112
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,106
- Rock, get back in here!
Dammit!

113
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,983
- Oy.

114
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,659
- You look especially
pretty tonight.
- Oh, thank you.

115
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,245
And you look especially
whatever acceptable,

116
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:51,332
non-polarizing
gender-positive compliment

117
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,834
- you feel comfortable with.

118
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,129
You are a lot of fun...

119
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,048
- even with your
clothes on. Wild.

120
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,676
- Sorry to interrupt.
- She's makin' me do this.
I'm so embarrassed.

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,428
Okay, we're, like,
your biggest fans,

122
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,846
and we know you're
eating right now,

123
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,015
but... but could
we get a quick
selfie with you?

124
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,892
- Aw.
- Yeah? Sure. Sure.
No problem.

125
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,687
- I can take it if you want.
- Wait, are you famous, too?

126
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,731
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just... the girlfriend.

127
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,900
- Thanks.
Thank you.

128
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,820
- Oh, okay.
- Here we go!

129
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,157
Cute.
Okay, here we go.

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,825
Nice.

131
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,120
- Again?
- O-Okay.

132
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,248
You really helped me
through some dark times.

133
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,836
- Ah, there you go.
- Perfect.

134
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,630
Oh, and you hooked up
with a friend of ours,
Melvin.

135
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,050
- Melvin DeGayo? In Buffalo.
- Mmm.

136
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,551
And you slept with another
friend of ours, Aubrey,

137
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:47,263
- in the Twin Cities.
She's Australian.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

138
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,516
Okay, well, thank you.

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,101
- Thank you. Have a good night.
- Thank you!

140
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,394
- Thank you so much.
Yeah.

141
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,854
- Bye.
Take care. Oh, careful.

142
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,402
So, where were we?

143
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,405
- We were having fun.
- Ah, yes... that.

144
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,575
Yay, us.

145
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,875
I can't remember the last
time I waited in line. You?

146
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,003
- To get my vaccine.
- Oh, honey, I wish
you knew me then.

147
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:19,962
I got mine before
the President.

148
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,924
Well, listen,
while we're waiting,

149
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,884
can you take a picture
of the ring my neighbor

150
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,677
designed for me
to post on Instagram?

151
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,931
Sure, then you can
take a picture of me
waiting in line.

152
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,767
We'll send it to Ripley's
Believe It or Not!

153
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,854
I'm just doing this
to save her from a life
of high-fashion modeling.

154
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,234
Should I not be wearing
my wedding ring anymore?

155
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,402
I really have no idea.
See? No priors.

156
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,033
You know, technically...
I am no longer married,

157
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,577
and I am going
on that non-date
tomorrow.

158
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,623
You know, is it a--
Is it appropriate?

159
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,626
I guess what's appropriate
is however you feel about it.

160
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,921
I have never had
to bribe a doorman
to get into a hot club...

161
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,841
until tonight.

162
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,801
Why are we putting
ourselves through this?

163
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,261
Let's just,
let's just leave.

164
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,721
No, I really want
to go dancing tonight.

165
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,557
- It's my birthday.
- What?!

166
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,060
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm not a birthday person.

167
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,688
I don't want all the fuss.
I just wanna go dancing tonight.

168
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,815
You are not
bribing a doorman
on your birthday.

169
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,484
Let me handle this.

170
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,445
Excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

171
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

172
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,495
We've all seen that
scene in a movie

173
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,206
where someone tries
to talk their way
into the cool club.

174
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,500
I've seen it,
you've seen it.

175
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,002
We don't need
to do that scene.

176
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,753
We're both grown-ups,

177
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,172
but it's
my friend's birthday,

178
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,509
and all she wants
is to go dancing,

179
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,511
so could you please

180
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,597
just let us in for
a little while to dance?

181
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,599
We won't stay long.

182
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,349
We're at capacity.

183
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,395
So, I guess we're
doin' that scene.

184
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:03,774
That's really offensive.

185
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,943
Let's go.

186
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,448
- Was I just canceled
by a doorman?
- Mm-hm.

187
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,912
- Did you make a wish?
- Yes.

188
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,747
It had to do with the doorman
and erectile dysfunction.

189
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,628
Fifty-four.

190
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,215
I really thought 53 would
be the year I meet my guy.

191
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:31,844
I told myself,
"I'm 53. That's not 54,
which is so close to 55."

192
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,887
- Careful.
- But...

193
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,724
I guess, instead of meeting
my guy this last year...

194
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,643
I met an amazing new friend.

195
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,480
So... here's to 53.
Best year ever.

196
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,524
To 54...
and your new guy.

197
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,277
I'll take that.

198
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,239
Mm...

199
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,073
but whatever happens,
I think I'm good.

200
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,243
If I were to look
at my life

201
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,912
like it were an apartment
I were trying to sell,

202
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,372
it'd be pretty damn lux.

203
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,582
Okay, yes. I don't have
everything on the wish list.

204
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,626
No wood-burning fireplace
in the bedroom,

205
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,045
but I have
a killer floor plan,

206
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,049
lots of closet space...
and a breathtaking view.

207
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,969
Your fireplace is out there.

208
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054
I just know it.

209
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,807
That's your birthday gift to me.

210
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,933
Hey, are you doing
anything on Saturday?

211
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,186
A client offered me tickets
to a matinee in the Public.

212
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,022
I can't.
I'm painting a house
in Greenpoint for charity,

213
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,108
and it's an all-day affair
'cause it's so far,

214
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,610
the subway has to go through
three time zones to get there.

215
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,155
I will drive you.
We're too young
for matinees anyway.

216
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,117
Why would you
ever do that?

217
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,119
Because if you get
lost on the subway,

218
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,745
who else will I not get
into hot clubs with?

219
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,002
Kids!
Uncle Anthony will be here
any minute with his new guy!

220
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,463
Ah!
Honey, you scared me.
What's up?

221
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,756
- Mom.
- Uh-huh?

222
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,675
- I'm ready.
- For dinner? Great!

223
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,303
- Go ahead. Pour the water.
- No, I mean...

224
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,805
I'm ready to learn how
to put in a tampon.

225
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,975
- Really? Now?
- Yes, now.

226
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,560
Let's do it
before I change my mind.

227
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,439
Okay, yes, yes.
Let's do this.

228
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,691
- Oh my god, they're here.

229
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,276
Okay, uh, give me one second,

230
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,319
and I will meet you
in the bathroom.

231
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,778
- We're coming!

232
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,156
Welcome, welcome!

233
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,825
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

234
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,952
Justin, this is Charlotte.
Charlotte, Justin.

235
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,038
Yes, come in, come in.

236
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:27,043
I just have to run,
and take care of one thing
really quickly.

237
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,921
Honey, could you
please make these
gentlemen some drinks?

238
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:31,922
I just have to deal
with something.

239
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,550
Oh, oh, and

240
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:37,470
take the challah
out of the oven, please,
in 10 minutes.

241
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,305
- Listen for the timer.
- You got it.

242
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,019
- Oh, is this a Jewish dinner?
- Mm-hm.

243
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,854
You know, the Holocaust
is a hoax, right?

244
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,439
Get out!

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,074

Okay, it's really very simple.

If you can feel it at all,
it's in wrong.

And the trick
is getting the right angle.

250
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,899
You want it to go

251
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,235
not straight up, like this.

00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,653
What?!

253
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,120
No fair.

254
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,415
I was gonna be
the one to get here
embarrassingly early.

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,252
You know,
one of my superpowers
as a teacher

256
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,838
is this uncanny ability
to read facial cues.

257
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,091
Are you about
to tell me your dog
ate your homework?

258
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,427
Do kids still do
homework on paper?

259
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,431
No...
No, they do not.

260
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,976
We're not gonna have
dinner tonight, are we?

261
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,731
But I came here because
I didn't want to text you.

262
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,358
I feel so bad.

263
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,902
I appreciate that.

264
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,655
See, I went to take
off my wedding ring
before I came here,

265
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,450
and I'm sorry
for the rushed intimacy,

266
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,953
but it's the only way
to let you know that
this is not about you.

267
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:26,704
That's very kind.

268
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,123
Instead of putting
mine away...

269
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,917
I put John's on.

270
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,837
That's my husband's
name, John.

271
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,423
And this is
his wedding ring.

272
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,011
- I remarried myself
with a Band-Aid.
- I see.

273
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,848
Hey, you know, maybe
this dating thing with us
is a Band-Aid, too.

274
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,974
You know, for both of us.

275
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,144
We're tryin'
to cover up somethin'
that still hurts.

276
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,648
I still have Anne's
last voicemail on here.

277
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,485
I play it all the time.

278
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,863
-  Oh...
- No, it's okay.

279
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,327
Well, Carrie,
that's strike two.

280
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,912
One more
and we're out.

281
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,179
Hey...
The best rejection ever.

282
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,689
You can do this, Lily.
You're almost there,

283
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:40,027
and you are gonna feel
so good once it's done!

284
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,862
Some people
like to put it in

285
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,573
with one leg
up on the toilet,
like this.

286
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,120
Remember, there's really only
one hole that it can go into.

287
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,081
Do you want me to just...
show you on me?

288
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,582
Ew, gross, no.

289
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,252
Do not let a tampon
scare you.

290
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,462
You scare the tampon.
So that being said,
I'm gonna give

291
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,173
a little bit of
a rundown on tampons,
basically how-to...

292
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:05,302
Just relax all
your muscles.

293
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,639
Picture butter melting...

294
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,391
and breathe.

295
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,478
You can do this...
or not.

296
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,188
The choice is yours.

297
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,731
Just stick it in!

298
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,983
Jam it up there, Lily!
Just do it!

299
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,069
Guys,
what's taking so long?

300
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,531
- Everybody's hungry.
- Honey, we have to take a break.

301
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,367
- It's just too rude
for our guests.
- It's in!

302
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:29,743
It is?!

303
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,253
I'm sorry I forgot
to check the challah.

304
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,380
I'm sorry that
took so long.

305
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,258
I'm sorry
I brought Justin.

306
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,017
Surprise.

307
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,604
It's your new favorite person
with your favorite cookies.

308
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,606
Oh my god.
Did we have a plan?

309
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,193
- Did-did I space?
- No! No, no, no.

310
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,280
I was studying at the library,
and was cravin' me some Che,

311
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,574
so I hopped
on the train, and...

312
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,117
Hello, you.

313
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,411
Mmm...

314
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,579
Mwah.

315
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,458
- Hm, hi... Okay.

316
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,210
This is awkward.

317
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,880
- Um...
- Oh my god. Someone's here.
You're not alone.

318
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,175
Of course, you're not alone.
Is someone here?

319
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,259
Yes, someone's here.

320
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,803
- Me... Yeah, I'm here.

321
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,848
I'm in the middle of writing
and I kind of wish

322
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,808
- you would've texted or called.
- It's not a problem.

323
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,352
- I'm gonna go.
- W-Wait, Miranda.

324
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,147
No, no, no.
It-it's fine.
I-I'm gone.

325
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,733
- And this never happened!
- What the fuck?

326
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,320
Miranda, stop!

327
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,988
Sorry, sorry.
Have your night.

328
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,158
I, I, I shouldn't have come.
So fucking stupid.

329
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,244
Who am I? Meg Ryan! Fuck!

330
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,539
Can you please stop?

331
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,084
- Why are you running
away from me?
- Why do you think?

332
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,378
Because I saw myself
and heard myself,

333
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,214
and now, I wanna get as far
away from here as possible.

334
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,800
- W-What is happening right now?

335
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,843
I have no idea.
I really don't.

336
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,470
I mean, I don't know
why I did this.

337
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,431
If-if you were a guy that
I had just started seeing,

338
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,058
I would never show up
at your doorstep

339
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,186
- with cookies unannounced.
- Okay, this isn't going to work.

340
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,522
What do you, what do mean
this isn't gonna work?!

341
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,481
No, no, no, no!
This has to work--

342
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,609
Please, please, just let me
finish my thought.

343
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,029
This isn't gonna work...
if you lock us into those

344
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,031
fucking limiting
relationship tropes.

345
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,701
You know, guys do this,
and, and girlfriends do that.

346
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,454
Th-This isn't cosplay.
I'm not a guy.

347
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,207
You're not my girlfriend,
and we're not dating.

348
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,668
We're not?
What are we doing?!

349
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,673
Okay, we are getting
to know each other.

350
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,926
- You and me.
- In my defense,

351
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,885
you keep saying I should
throw out the script,

352
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,388
and that's what
I thought I was doing.

353
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,889
I was tryin'
to be spontaneous,

354
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,933
- and, you know,
ditch the script...
- Oh.

355
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,852
- and do improv instead.
- Oh god,

356
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,813
please do not call
our relationship improv.

357
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,566
I suck at improv.

358
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,902
I'm just kidding.
This is me and you.

359
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,281
Or you and me
if you want top billing.

360
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,367
Well, for this drama
on the stairs,
I think I deserve it.

361
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,536
- Hm.
- Okay.

362
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,748
Hey, to answer
your indirect question.

363
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,625
You are the only person
I'm sleeping with right now.

364
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,335
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

365
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:27,045
Come here.

366
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,971
- Please come upstairs.
- No, I'm gonna go...

367
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,849
because that is not
what Meg Ryan would do.

368
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,226
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

369
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,563
What about my cookies?

370
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,024
I am going to eat them
on the ride home.

371
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,824
Okay,
what's happened
to my life?

372
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,202
Now I'm waiting
in a line to paint.

373
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,286
Go. Go, go, go.
You don't have to stay.

374
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,955
No, it's for a good cause,
and I heard about this

375
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,999
Lebanese restaurant
in the area for lunch.

376
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,000
So how long do we have
to pretend to paint?

377
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,128
Seema, I am not
pretending to paint.

378
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,964
I am here to wor--
Look at me.
I'm wearin' overalls.

379
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,009
I see that.
You can just
write a check.

380
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,179
Oh, I, I am,
but I was told in no
uncertain terms by Miranda

381
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,640
I cannot be that
white woman that
just writes a check.

382
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,643
It is so hard
to be white now.

383
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,812
Hey, Luisa.
Carrie Bradshaw,
plus one.

384
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,979
Hi, Carrie.
Here you are.

385
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,189
Great.
This list, we're on.

386
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,819
Hey, you made it!
And you brought Seema!
Awesome!

387
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,613
Seema, I'll get you
one of the T-shirts
to paint in.

388
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,948
Okay, everyone's
working in pairs,

389
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,325
so you guys can start
in the bathrooms.

390
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,327
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'm gonna be over there.

391
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,995
Brown lady smoking
writing a big, fat check.

392
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,999
- Thank you!
My god, Steve came.

393
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,002
We were gonna do this
as a family event,

394
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,506
- and we're still a family, so.
- Well, that's very impressive.

395
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,174
Well, yeah, so is Steve.

396
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,552
- Hey, hey, Carrie!

397
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,762
- You're wearin' overalls.
- Yeah, you betcha.

398
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:03,517
I'm here to paint
until someone says
to me, "Please, stop."

399
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,854
- What's up, Farmer Joe?
- Ahh, come here, you big lug.

400
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,689
Okay.

401
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,440
So, um, everybody's
workin' in pairs.

402
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,194
I call Carrie.
I mean, look at her.
She means business.

403
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,197
Okay, so it's
me and you, Brady.

404
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,868
- No, I'm workin' with Luisa.
- Oh, naturally.

405
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,286
All right,
I'll find a partner.

406
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,205
Oh, hi. Hi, everyone.
Oh, thank you for coming.

407
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,041
- Nya, this is Carrie.
- Oh, Carrie, hi.

408
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,543
Oh, I wish you were
meeting me on a day

409
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,377
where my head
wasn't exploding.

410
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,379
I just found out
the venue that was

411
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,340
donating lunch for everyone
thought it was next week.

412
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,342
Oh... sorry.
- Ooh, that's bad.

413
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,802
Well, we can-- Whoa.
What the fuck is that?

414
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,472
Oh, wow.
Is it prom night?

415
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,433
Hi, hi, hi!
We made it!

416
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,060
- Aw, yep, there's
our prom queen.

417
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,064
- Oh my gosh. Is this Nya?!
- Uh, this is Nya.

418
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,066
- Hi, I'm Charlotte.
- Hi, Charlotte.

419
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,485
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,571
These are my kids,
Rock and Lily.

421
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,742
And that is my friend,
Lisa Todd Wexley,
and her children.

422
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,535
Oh, you're cute. Hi!

423
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,120
- What's with the camera?
- Huh?

424
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,246
This is not
an Instagram
opportunity.

425
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,917
Full disclosure,
I ordered
a 10-passenger van,

426
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,585
- and this is what showed up.
- Oh.

427
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,086
Talk about tone deaf.

428
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,088
- But, Professor Wallace--
- Oh.

429
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,715
I am so moved
by everything
that you're doing,

430
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,966
and if you
would permit me,

431
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,093
I thought I'd
take some photos.

432
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,387
They're great
for fundraising,
and your website.

433
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:22,888
- That would be so helpful.
- Okay.

434
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,182
How bad do you feel?

435
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,892
- So bad.
- Mm-hm.

436
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,144
Oh, and my husband,
Herbert, is in there
finishing up a call,

437
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:30,646
but he does
the heavy lifting,

438
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,564
so if you need
anything...

439
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,566
- let me know.
- Well, if you could figure out

440
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,943
how to get me
lunch for a hundred.

441
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,402
My caterer's a no-show.

442
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,322
Uh, yeah, let, let me
see what I can do.

443
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,741
- Really?
- Yeah.

444
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,786
- Okay.
- Hi, Tony?

445
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,579
Gabby, can you go
a little faster?

446
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,456
We're only here
for a day, sweetheart.

447
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, there you go.
Good job.

448
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,338
Good job.
That's nice.
That's nice.

449
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,174
Damn, that's some Grade A
fatherin' over there.

450
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,469
- This is so satisfying.
- I know, right?

451
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,555
Oh, yeah.

452
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,974
It's the stuff of life,
isn't it?

453
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,977
The stuff of their life.
Give you that.

454
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,021
Seriously, no pangs when you
see somethin' like that?

455
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:19,403
- That could be us.
- Andre... they came in a limo.

456
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,780
They probably have,
like, three nannies.

457
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,282
I'm guessing they're
not still renting.

458
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,827
Way to bring
down a vibe, Ny.

459
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,544
Until three years ago,

460
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,838
that man wouldn't
notice if someone left

461
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,549
a crying baby
in his guitar case.

462
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,092
I guess that...

463
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,428
switch was just flicked
by the Norman Rockwell

464
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,013
painting scene
over there.

465
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,055
I think it's more like
he's programmed.

466
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,057
I mean, we keep having
these great conversations

467
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,851
where he accepts our life,

468
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,519
and then, he sees
a minivan commercial,

469
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,855
and he, he falls back into
what he's supposed to want.

470
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,189
Yeah, we're
all programmed.

471
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,233
I'm a grown woman,
and I'm still programmed

472
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,901
to be a girlfriend.
I can't stop checking

473
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,195
my phone every five minutes
to see if they still like me.

474
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,032
Yeah, well, then I guess
I'm programmed to say,

475
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,118
"Don't worry
'cause I'm sure they're
gonna text you."

476
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,049
Excuse me.

477
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,217
What is all this
tables, and trucks,
and crap everywhere?

478
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,513
And why are you asking me?

479
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,933
You are sitting here
smoking a cigarette
doing nothing.

480
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,272
- You look like a boss.
- Well, you got that right.

481
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,901
So, boss...

482
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,903
what is all this mess
doing on my street?

483
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,947
Are you Mr. Bay Shore Drive?

484
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,865
You're funny.

485
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,618
You know what
isn't funny...

486
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,912
is all of these things
in the way of my club.

487
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,207
I noticed that.
Is it any good?

488
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,834
It's the hottest club
in Brooklyn.

489
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,586
Says you.

490
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,880
♪ ♪

491
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,261
How long did you
know about it?

492
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,264
I think she asked me
to help last week.

493
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,351
No, I mean, you--
about, you know,
her and...

494
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,438
this... Che.

495
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,234
You know, she, uh,
I guess, is they...

496
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,278
work at your podcast, right?
So...

497
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,406
did you introduce them?

498
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,661
Shit.

499
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,039
- Steve, this is just... so.
Uh, no, no. I--

500
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,459
I'm, I'm sorry.
I-- No need to get
uncomfortable.

501
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,838
I'm just trying to get
some information here.

502
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,800
You know, this...
whole thing all
came up on me

503
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,342
pretty damn fast, and...

504
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,346
can you help me out here?

505
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:58,812
- I really had absolutely
nothing to do with it.
- Okay...

506
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,021
but...

507
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,191
did you know that Miranda
wanted to be with women?

508
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,945
Is, is there somethin'
she ever said to you?

509
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,574
No... no.
She, she never said that.

510
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:17,330
And really...
all I know is what
she said to me.

511
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,958
And what's that?

512
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,379
That it's not about
being with women.
It's...

513
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,592
It's about
being with Che.

514
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,472
- So... that's all I can say.
- Okay.

515
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,021
But, how long ago
did this thing start?

516
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,899
I mean, you gotta know.

517
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,692
- Ahh... Shit!
- Ooh, shit!

518
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,861
I'm sorry.
That's on me.
I--

519
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,322
-  Fuck.
- No, no, no, no.
It's not your fault.

520
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,198
It's not. It's--
I just-- You know what?

521
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,618
I should probably
wash it off.

522
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,660
I'll be super fast.

523
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,455
Oh, so sorry.
Be right back.

524
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:03,501
Yikes.

525
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,133
-  No! Shit.

526
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,929
No... no! God! Steve!

527
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,139
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Big's wedding ring!

528
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,058
His wedding ring just
went down the drain.

529
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,101
Oh my god,
can you help me?!

530
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,063
My god. The-- My--
I had a Band-Aid on it,
and it, it slipped off.

531
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,233
Oh my god, is it gone?
Is his ring gone?!

532
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,194
- Nah, it's, probably,
in the P-Trap.
- So, it's not gone?

533
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,111
I, I, I don't know
how plumbing works.

534
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,404
It's most likely in the trap.

535
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,533
I'll go find somethin',
open it up and see.

536
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,743
Okay, can you hurry?

537
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,120
Oh shit!

538
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,378
Mom, you're being too
careful and OCD about it.

539
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,463
- Just paint.
- Mom, help.
I'm freaking out.

540
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,093
My tampon string?
It's gone.

541
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,928
Oh, I'm sure it's not gone.

542
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,430
You're just having
some trouble finding it.

543
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,309
It's... gone.

544
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,895
- Let's go. Let's go!

545
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,689
The porta-potties
are right over here.

546
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,274
Porta-potties?
Gross!

547
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,484
Well, I'm sorry.
All the real bathrooms
are being painted.

548
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,944
Hey, Charlotte...
Lunch is ready.

549
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,613
Amazing!

550
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,907
- Great work!
- Mom, it is an emergency!

551
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,119
Ugh, well,
I can't be rude, Lily.

552
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,710
Oh, please, please, please.

553
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,308
- Oh my god! Thank you.
- Sure.

554
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,810
Ah... thank you.

555
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,062
Thank you, thank you.

556
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,439
Any luck with the string?

557
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,274
No, it's gone!
I'm not kidding!

558
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,986
It's not gone.
It-it's just hiding.

559
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,612
Usually, it's
in your tushy crack.

560
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,491
- Did you look there?
Oh my god! Gross! No!

561
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,243
There's no air
in here, Mom.

562
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,580
Mom?!
Mom, I can't breathe!

563
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,999
Honey, just calm down.

564
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,793
I-I'm gonna go get
you some water, okay?

565
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,338
Okay, go! Hurry, Mom!

566
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,965
Oh, and not cold!
Room temp!

567
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,842
Thank you.
Thanks so much.

568
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,510
Mm. Mm, mm, mm.

569
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,637
Yummy!

570
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,598
Hey!
What's happening
with you?

571
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,849
I saw you running
in and out

572
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,100
of the bathrooms
all wired.

573
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,018
Do you have
a coke problem now?

574
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,853
No, I am in hell.

575
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,772
I have to help Lily
with her tampon.

576
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,191
She just started wearing them,
and it's a nightmare.

577
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,152
- Now, she wants water.
- Man, you're a good mother.

578
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,070
My mom never helped me
with all that stuff.

579
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,197
My sister taught me.

580
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,907
My friend Mindy
showed me at summer camp.

581
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,034
- No one in my house
used tampons.
- Really?

582
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,954
- Oh my god. It's her.

583
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,331
It's like having
a newborn again,

584
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,793
but with a cell phone
and her period.

585
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,544
- Bye.
- Bye.

586
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,254
See, I couldn't
handle that.

587
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,381
There's no way.

588
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,424
- Oh...

589
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:57,634
Oh, it's Che!

590
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,013
Are you gonna answer it?

591
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,058
No... I mean,
I want to, but I'm not.

592
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,976
I've been too
available lately.

593
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,770
Oh, so you're doin'
The Rules now?

594
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,813
You're gonna tell them you
can't go out tomorrow night

595
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,316
- 'cause you're
washing your hair.
- Stop it.

596
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,443
- I'm just pulling back a little.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

597
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,654
Why didn't they
leave a voicemail?

598
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,449
- I know, I have a problem.
- Paint on your face.

599
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,578
Hey.

600
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,831
Hey.

601
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,417
What was all that before?

602
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,591
Are we 100% sure we
don't wanna try again?

603
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,845
Oh my god, Andre.
Have you met us?

604
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,513
Our entire
15-year relationship

605
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,765
has been about
me and you...

606
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,686
my work, your music.
That was our total focus.

607
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,606
I-- Well...
am I not allowed to pivot?

608
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,318
A child is not a pivot.

609
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,988
That's not fair to me.

610
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,613
Okay, well, this
isn't fair to me.

611
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,199
You keep opening this up.

612
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,494
I'm not 100%.

613
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,209
Andre, don't make this
miracle of us finding
each other not enough.

614
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,299
What?

615
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:22,635
Just say it.

616
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,854
I just feel...
that I want one.

617
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,318
And I don't know
if I should be
workin' so hard

618
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,445
to talk myself
out of that.

619
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,247
I can't find it!

620
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,416
- Oh, I got it! I found it!
- Great.

621
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,087
- I'll see you back inside.
No, don't go!
I need help pulling it out.

622
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,216
It always feels like
I'm pulling out
all of my insides!

623
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,302
Lily... I love you madly,

624
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,180
but I draw the line
at pulling out
your tampon string.

625
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,391
Pull your own string!

626
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,771
- Wait, Mom!
- Enough is enough!

627
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,397
No, really, Mom!
Stop! Come back!

628
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,315
- I have to tell you something!
- Everyone has their limit,

629
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,901
- and this is mine!
- Mom!

630
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,031
Oh dear.
Oh dear.
Charlotte!

631
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,534
- Oh, Charlotte!
Come here super quick.
- Hey.

632
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,701
I am ready to throttle her.

633
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,037
Just when I am finally
done with my periods,

634
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,705
I thought I would
not have to deal
with this shit anymore.

635
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,458
Well, you may not be
as done as you think.

636
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,378
- What, what are you doing?
- I'm just gonna...
wrap this around your waist.

637
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,712
I think you got
a flash period.

638
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,173
I did?!
Wh-What the hell is that?

639
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,550
It, it, it
happened to me once

640
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,926
months after
I thought I was done.

641
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,386
I was arguing
a case in court,

642
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,220
and the opposing counsel

643
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,889
literally signaled me
to look at my ass.

644
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,392
How have you never
mentioned this?

645
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,851
Repressed it
as soon as it happened.

646
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,563
Hey.

647
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,400
- Got you some lemonade.
- Oh.

648
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,986
Thank you.

649
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,490
- How's that heart rate?

650
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,034
It's better, thank you.

651
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:11,786
Sorry, I just--

652
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,583
Oh... I panicked.

653
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:18,751
I get it.

654
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,841
This ain't never comin' off.

655
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,387
I don't care what Miranda does,
or with who.

656
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,266
'Til death do us part.

657
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,684
Steve.

658
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,022
What about you?

659
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:43,401
You are such
a wonderful,
wonderful person.

660
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,448
Don't you maybe
want to find someone?

661
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,075
At some point.

662
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,790
