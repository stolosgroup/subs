Can you hear them?

Eh, not that much.

00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,376
You're lucky.

Steve, the phone!

13
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,346
Who's callin'
on the landline?

14
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,352
Hello... yeah.

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,315
- It's Carrie.
- Hello?

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,112
(sobs)

17
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,868
Oh...

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,337
What do I do now?

19
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,716
I guess...

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,635
They take him away,

21
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,346
- and--
- No, I meant me.

22
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,352
- What do I do now?
- Oh honey, oh honey.

23
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,360
(somber music playing)

24
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,114

25
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,877
(heartbeat thumping)

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,587
(gasps)

27
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,386
You okay?

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,637
Oh.

29
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,306
It's my back.

30
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,644
Sometimes
Big has to rub it.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,650
Here?

32
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,320
Thanks.
That's enough.

33
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,657
You sure?

34
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,926
(typing on keyboard)

35
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,066
(serene music plays)

36
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,319
When you've come to the end
of the road together...

37
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,322
and it's time to say goodbye...

38
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,158
we can be there for you.

39
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,246
When you feel
overwhelmed and lost,

40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,248
and don't know
which way to turn...

41
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:27,832
- Hey.
- ...we can be
there for you.

42
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,209
- Get any sleep?
- Mm- hmm.

43
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,546
We can help turn these
difficult decisions...

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,131
into meaningful memories.

45
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,635
You don't have to walk
this road alone.

46
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,471
- What is that?
- It's a funeral home
sizzle reel.

47
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,183
Okay.

48
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:50,438
Well, um, I'm gonna
make us some coffee,

49
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,899
and then, we'll figure out
what we need to do here.

50
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,652
No, you need to go home
and get some sleep
before school.

51
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,946
Charlotte can come over
and help me figure this out.

52
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,281
I'm not gonna go to school
and leave you alone here.

53
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,076
- Where do you keep your coffee?
- Carrie: I won't be alone.

54
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,619
Charlotte
will be here,

55
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,289
and you have to go to school,
especially after that first day.

56
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,166
Well, we can talk
about that over coffee.

57
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:12,293
- Where's your coffee?
- It's in the freezer.

58
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,505
Okay...
I'm gonna make us some.

59
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,007
Some what?

60
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,471
Coffee.

61
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,597
Mmm.

62
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,020
(door closes)

63
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,323
- We got so lucky.
- So, so, so lucky.

64
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,618
And I'm sorry
about last night.

65
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,955
- Let's not pick
at each other anymore.
- We won't.

66
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,541
It's stupid and petty
and not important.

67
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,375
Y- You're all that's
important to me--

68
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,627
And you're what's
important to me.

69
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,256
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,261
All right.
Let me get some coffee.

71
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,183
Are you wearing
that cologne I hate?

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,477
Sorry. I heard myself. I did.

73
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,023
(quietly) I mean...

74
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,277
And this is the Hampton space.

75
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,531
Elegant, serene,
understated.

76
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,576
It is the largest of
our five event spaces.

77
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,203
How many participants
will you be expecting,
Mrs. Preston?

78
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:37,211
Oh, um...
I, I hadn't even
considered that yet.

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,257
It's, it's fine.
This just happened,
and...

80
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,468
we just haven't
had time to collect
our thoughts.

81
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:48,222
You're our first stop,
and it's, it's new to us.

82
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,725
Understood.
Have a seat.

83
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,352
Uh, Jane Hayes,
our primary mortician,

84
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,021
will be in
to continue on.

85
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,272
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

86
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,875
- What?
- He would hate it here.

87
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,252
We can look
at the other rooms.

88
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,463
No, the whole place.
It's just...

89
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,674
It's just--
It's all wrong.

90
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,845
This place is about
old people and death.

91
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,519
The Hampton space...

92
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:41,984
- Gotta love the irony.
- Carrie, I'm so, so sorry.

93
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,153
If I hadn't forced you
to go to the concert

94
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,280
then you would've gone
to the Hamptons with Big,

95
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,407
and he would be
alive right now.

96
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,326
(sniffles) I just--

97
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,162
I feel like you
think it's all my fault.

98
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,833
What?
I don't think that.

99
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,794
Well, I do.
I'm so sorry.

100
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,130
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

101
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,299
Charlotte, he had
a heart attack.

102
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,342
I know, I know,
but if you hadn't

103
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,137
been at the concert,
you would've been with him,

104
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,763
and you would've,
you would've done something,

105
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,723
and then he would be alive now.

106
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,562
(crying continues)

107
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,983
- I'm Jane Hayes.
- Oh.

108
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,862
I am so sorry for
your loss Mrs. Preston.

109
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,614
I- I'm not Mrs. Preston.
She's Mrs. Preston.

110
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,284
I- I'm just her friend.

111
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,202
My apologies.
I'm sorry for your loss.

112
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,329
Thank you very much
for your time,

113
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,915
but I don't think this
is gonna work out here.

114
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,625
- Charlotte, let's go.
- Jane: I'm very sorry.

115
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,253
I walked in,
and she was
just so bereft.

116
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,506
- (crying loudly)
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

117
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,466
Charlotte, up.

118
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,719
Would you rather
another mortician
of ours handle this?

119
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,638
No, thank you.
Charlotte, please get
it together and get up.

120
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,973
(sniffs) Yes.

121
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,894
Please!

122
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,647
Don't leave because
of a thoughtless
mistake I made.

123
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,399
Jane, it's not you...
It's me.

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,615
Shit.

125
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,203
This is terrible.
I feel awful.

126
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,204
I should be putting
you in an Uber.

127
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,207
No, it's fine.
Go home and lie down.

128
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,708
No, but just for an hour.
There's so much to do.

129
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,587
- Are you sure you're
okay by yourself?
- I think I'd prefer it.

130
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,092
Call Miranda.
Oh wait! No, no.
I can do that.

131
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,427
I'm doing it now!

132
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:33,471
Love you.

This is Professor
Nya Wallace.

144
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,657
She teaches law here.

145
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,200
- You can let her through.
- Not without an ID I can't.

146
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,953
I, I can
vouch for her.

Uh, here.
I- I'm Miranda Hobbes.

I'm in her class.

Yeah, well,
you ain't her.

150
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,793
Miranda, it's okay.
It's in here somewhere.

151

Just one more place.
If not, I'll step out.

- I, I don't understand

00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,340
why you're
questioning
her identity.

154
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm not questioning
her identity.

155
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,386
I'm waitin' for her
to show me her ID.

156
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,929
Well, it's interesting

157
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,932
because you barely glanced
at mine when I went through.

158
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,892
- Could I have your name?
- No.

- Here it is, here it is.
- Thank you.

160
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,397
Come on through,
Professor Wallace.

161
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,571
- Hi. I just had
to say something.
- Did you?

162
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,490
- Excuse me?
- Did you have
to say something?

163
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:21,329
Oh... one of the important
takeaways I got from

164
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,998
how to be an anti- racist
is if you see something

165
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,834
you have to speak on it.
You have to call it out.

166
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,171
Well, that's very noble
of you, even if a tad bit
white savior complex,

167
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,674
but the reality is you
just inflamed a situation
that was perfectly fine.

168
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,345
He needed to see my ID.
It was somewhere in my bag.

169
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,889
This isn't
"To Kill a Mockingbird."

170
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,599
I don't need
a good- hearted lawyer
to defend me.

171
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,394
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate it,

172
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,438
but it's not necessary
to apologize.

173
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,857
We're all just here
learning, right?

174
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,692
Speakin' of which,
what is happenin'
with all these books?

175
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,028
It's all available online.
A Kindle weighs nothing.

176

I, I know, but I just,

177

actually, like to turn
the pages when I'm reading.

Why does everyone
wear black?

181
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,296
Well, it's a tradition,

182
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,550
and it just shows
that we're not happy
and feeling colorful.

183
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,845
Yeah, I'm not feeling

Death...
it's a part of life.

188
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,945
It's the saddest part,
but...

189
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,656
it's, it's also
a really important part...

190
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,410
because...
(exhales)

191
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,416
it gives us
a chance to remember...

how much
our loved ones
mean to us.

193

don't worry about me.
I totally understand.

I could barely
keep it together

- I was the exact same way

when I lost
my dad last year.

208

I could see my rings
literally shaking on my hands

while I was trying
to be so strong for them.

210
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,430

- It's so hard.

00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,681
Oh, honey.

Oh, okay.

the bike, Steve.

Still.
It doesn't seem smart.

He, he had
a heart condition.

218

He got the okay
from his cardiologist.

219
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,122
Exercise is good
for the heart.

place gets a little rowdy,

316
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,380
you know how these
discreet funerals can be,

317
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,339
I got you.

318
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,092
I used to be a bouncer
at a dyke bike club,

319
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,261
so that's some
world- class bouncin'.

320
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,015
- Thanks for the laugh.
- Mm, technically, only a smile.

321
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,141
I'm a stand- up.
I notice these things.

322
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,727
Thank you.

323
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,445
Stanford:
Oh, excuse me, um,
you're in my seat.

324
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,488
It's assigned
seating in front.

325
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,532
Oh.

326
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,035
I see.

327
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,247
Yeah, that, that's me,
uh, right next to Carrie.

328
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,333
- I beg your pardon.
- Here, you can
have my seat.

329
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,167
- I'll find a place
in the back.
- Oh.

330
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,546
No, no, it's fine.
Thanks so much.

331
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,715
I see plenty of chairs
with names on them.

332
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,467
- I'm sure you're there.
- I'm sure I am.

333
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:39,136
Hm.

334
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,225
What?
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,102
I need to be at the side
of my best friend

336
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,562
during her husband's funeral,

337
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,106
and I need my husband
at my side on the other side.

338
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:55,277
Hi.
Can I have a glass
of Chablis, please?

339
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,071
Oh, we're serving
after the service.

340
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,490
Oh, that's okay.
I'm family.

341
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,952
My husband sent over all
the liquor from his bar.

342
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,915
You know what?

343
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,249
Looking around,
I'm not sure

344
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,418
we have enough wine
for everyone,

345
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,753
so, maybe, save that,

346
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,881
and I will have
a neat bourbon.

347
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,507
Super quick.

348
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,056
I'm speaking,
and it's about
to start,

349
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,308
so if you could,
super quick. Thank you.

350
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,353
Thank you.

351
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,319
(quiet chatter)

352
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,115
Oh, Miranda's
speaking.

353
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,118
I would've liked to
have said a few words.

354
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,038
It's a funeral,
not "The Moth."

355
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,318
How lucky...

356
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,572
How lucky
we all are...

357
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,574
to have known
this amazing man,

358
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,828
John James Preston.

359
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,498
How lovely...

360
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,207
to have shared dinners...

361
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,836
drinks, deals...

362
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,213
and, for some of us, cigars

363
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,259
with this one- of- a- kind.

364
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,347
How long...

365
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,808
it seems that we
have known him...

366
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,269
How very long.

367
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:57,274
And yet, not near long enough.

368
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:00,402
How large...

369
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,947
he was...

370
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,490
in all of our lives.

371
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,703
He will leave a big...

372
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,496
hole.

373
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,459
And how sad...

374
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,254
how very, very sad.

375
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,260
But for today,
let us remember...

376
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,264
how lucky.

377
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,279
(softly)
That was beautiful.

378
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,655
Carrie wrote it.

379
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,618
Good afternoon.

380
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,746
I've been asked to say
a few words about, um...

381
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,082
my baby brother.

382
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,422
When I spoke with John
just last week...

383
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,842
he told me that he
had never been happier
in his whole life.

384
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,722
And, well,
I'd say that's...

385
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,348
the way to go out.

386
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,268
So, Carrie...

387
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,521
I thank you...

388
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,273
for giving him that.

Ooh, Charlotte, can
you walk Gloria out,

407
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,049
and just make sure
she gets in a cab?

408
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,550
- Of course.
- Oh, that's not necessary.

409
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,678
Well, I know it's not,
but I'll feel better.

410
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,223
- I'll call you soon, okay?
- Well, when you're up to it.

411
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,142
There's a slew
of papers that we've
gotta get through.

412
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,853
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

413
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,650
Carrie,
I know, I know.

414
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,860
I lost my Bobby
a year and a half ago,

415
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,862
so I know.

416
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,656
People said they knew
how I was feeling.

417
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,159
(chuckles)
They didn't know,
but I know.

418
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,661
It's still so fresh.

419
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,622
It's wonderful that
you get to see
family and friends,

420
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,667
and, and make something
beautiful like this.

421
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,710
I lost Bobby so early
in the COVID,

422
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,587
you couldn't
see anyone.

423
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,465
No one even knew how
to Zoom Shiva yet.

424
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,133
- Yeah.
- And if anyone
would've loved

425
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,428
a big send- off
like this,

426
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,265
it would've been
my husband...

427
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,391
Mr. Broadway.

428
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,560
- Oh, oh, do you know
Kevin Silberton?
- No.

429
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,104
- Bobby's pianist.
- No, oh.

430
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,773
- His orchestrator.
- H- How is that relevant

431
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,775
- today and here?
- Kevin: Sorry for your loss.

432
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,278
Thank you.

433
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,570
He doesn't know...

434
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,074
I know.

435
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,161
- Carrie.
- Susan Sharon.

436
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,914
I didn't know
you were here.

437
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,374
Oh, it's so nice
of you to come.

438
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,251
Carrie...
look at me.

439
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:30,463
I forgive you.
It's over.
In the past.

440
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,923
When I read the obit
in the "Times,"

441
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,967
I said to myself,
"Susan Sharon,

442
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,511
life is too short
to hold a grudge."

443
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,139
Do you--
You remember Miranda?

444
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,682
Sure.
All of that's water

445
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,142
under the bridge,
I guess.

446
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,226
So, I said to myself,

447
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,228
"Susan Sharon,
let it go.

448
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,273
"Just fuckin'
let it go,

449
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:51,151
"and go to Carrie,
and make things
right with her

450
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,945
- whether she wants to or not."
- No--

451
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,740
I mean,
I know you have a lot
on your plate right now,

452
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,492
and I'm not expecting
an apology or a mea culpa,

453
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,328
so just consider this your
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

454
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:07,042
I love you.
I'm back. The end.

455
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,502
And we can work
this all out when
you have the bandwidth.

456
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,588
It was nice
to see you again.

457
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,423
Yes.

458
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,427
(piano music plays)

459
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,890
What happened
between you two?

460
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,601
I have no idea.
I was hoping you knew.

461
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,895
- I mean... Hey.
- Hey.

462
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,773
- How you holdin' up, huh?
- Oh, I'm fine, fine.

463
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,441
Do you need anything?

464
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,031
That Carrie.
She's totally amazing.

465
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,868
Runnin' around,
she's producin' this
whole thing, you know...

466
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:46,414
If it were you in that box,
I would be a total mess.

467
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,377
- She's not even cryin'.
- Yeah...

468
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,753
but is that a good thing?

469
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,547
It must be cool
being like a real,
for- real comedian.

470
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,135
- (Che chuckles)
- My buddy Sean makes

What do you think
you're doing?

475
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,480
Down there.
I'm talking to you.

476
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,732
- What do you think
you're doing?
- Che: Well, uh,

477
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm pickin' up the pipe

478
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,068
that my man here
threw to the ground.

479
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,695
He is not your man.

480
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,865
He is my son,
and he is not a man.
He is a minor.

481
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,242
I could have
you arrested.

482
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,576
Okay, so I was
just standing here

483
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,995
minding my own business,
not corrupting a minor,

484
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,747
when he came over
and asked me for a hit.

485
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,250
- He's 17!
- Stop, you're
embarrassing me.

486
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,668
No, you have
embarrassed yourself.

487
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,212
Who the fuck
are you anyway?

488
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,422
Why are you even here?

489
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,507
What're you?
Some kind of a, a

490
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,551
funeral pot pusher?

491
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,762
No, I'm not,
but that is a great idea
for an untapped market.

492
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,141
- You think this is funny?
- Well, not yet, but...

493
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,852
gimme an hour or two,
and I'll work it into
a solid tight ten.

494
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,645
Mom, Mom.

495
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,648
I don't know
who you are...

496
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:54,774
or where you
came from,

497
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,653
but, trust me,
you don't wanna
mess with me.

498
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:01,781
And if you don't back
the fuck up from us
right fuckin' now,

499
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,950
I'm gonna rip your
goddamn head off.

500
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,244
Okay, just chill, all right?

501
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,956
- Slow your roll.
- I have no intention
of slowing my anything.

502
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,543
This is my son that
you are getting high
on God- knows- what.

503
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,795
Mom!
It was just weed.

504
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,714
I, I felt sad.
I needed a hit.

505
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,844
- Oh, you felt sad.
- Yes!

506
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,639
Maybe I should kill myself,
so you can try crack.

507
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,350
- Oh my god.
- You're going home with
your father right now.

508
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,812
And no Luisa for a week.

Oh, okay, now you
sound really crazy.

I said, um...

512
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,449
Where's Dad?

513
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,659
I'm gonna go find him.

514
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,918
Oh, Miranda, I want
you to meet someone.

515
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,086
This is my
podcast boss,

516
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,506
Che Diaz.
Che...

517
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,176
this is my ride- or- die,
Miranda.

518
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,845
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

519
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,390
Oh, sorry. I have to--
Anyway, excuse me.

520
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,393
Um...

521
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,564
- All I can say is--
- If you actually think

522
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,067
there are words that
are gonna make this
less uncomfortable...

523
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,361
go for it.

524
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,030
Okay...
I was, maybe,
a little too--

525
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,532
No, don't.
You were fine.

526
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,575
That, that was totally
on me out there.

527
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,702
I didn't think
his age was
even a factor,

528
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,539
probably 'cause
I've been smokin' weed
since I was 13.

529
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,541
Why didn't you
tell me who you were?

530
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,001
I just assumed that
the correct behavior
when you're...

531
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,586
being accused of doing
inappropriate things

532
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,796
with a boy is to
just walk away.

533
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,882
But, um...

534
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,176
honestly, it was
very cool how you
protected him out there.

535
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,594
- (Miranda chuckles)
- Yeah.

536
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,180
Well, thank you.

537
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,557
I guess I'm kinda
like a mama bear

538
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,726
- when it comes to my kid.
- Mama bear?

539
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,520
- Honey, try papa bear.
- (both laughing)

540
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,481

silverback papa bear like,

Let's start again.

544
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,576
I'm Che Diaz.

545
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,953
- I'm Miranda Hobbes.
- Hi.

546
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,497
Um, Che as
in Che Guevara?

547
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,834
Ah, (clears throat).
Che as in the first
three letters of Cheryl.

548
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,585
Yeah, I dropped
the "r- y- l."

549
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,087
I mean, do I seem
like a Cheryl?

550
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,423
- No.
- Yeah.

551
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,382
And you don't seem
like a Miranda.

552
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,259
- Oh?
- Yeah.

553
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,636
What do I seem like?

554
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,889
- A Rambo.
- (laughs)

555
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,766

I guess this is what
happens when you request
"No flowers, please."

560
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,637
What part of "no flowers"

do orchid people
not understand?

562

I can take that lox

in the morning.

625
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,708
Stanford?

626
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,878
- Where?
- He just like...

627
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,338
ran by in- into the bedroom.

628
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,218
Come out, Stanny.

629
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,679
Sorry, I went back
for my martini.

630
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,723
I, I told you,
I'm not a good hider.

631
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,311
Big's ashes came,
and she was upset.

632
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,899
Okay... well...

633
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,069
Here are your magazines.
Have a good night.

634
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,073
Wait, Charlotte.

635
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,702
I was very upset
when his ashes arrived,

636
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,912
so I called Stanford.

637
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,956
Please don't make
this about you.

638
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm trying really
hard not to...

639
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,462
but it is
pretty obvious

640
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,673
that you're mad at me
because I made you
go to the recital.

641
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,968
There's no other
possible reason

642
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,429
that you would call
Stanford over me.

643
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,764
- Well--
- Just let it go.

644
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,933
Okay, the truth is,
I didn't call you

645
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,976
because you get
so emotional.

646
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,896
It's because I cried
at the funeral home.

647
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,483
- 'Cause you're crying now.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just--

648
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,279
- You seem so mad.
- I am mad.

649
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,490
Mad at myself,
not you.

650
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,159
I should've gone
to the Hamptons

651
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,745
with Big
on Wednesday night.

652
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,958
(yells)
Like I wanted to!

653
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,171
- Everything all right out here?
- Yeah, sorry, Phil.

654
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,172
Okay.

655
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:49,183
Go inside.

656
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:04,365
Oh!

657
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,997
Great... now
I'm that neighbor.

658
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,584
You can't blame yourself,
Carrie. You can't.

659
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,046
You didn't know
Big was gonna have
a heart attack that night.

660
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,506
And neither did you.

661
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,924
So, what's with
the white designer hoodie

662
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,176
on the old coot neighbor?

663
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,559
And that is why
I would call Stanford
instead of you.

664
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,272
(rain falling)

665
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,256
- You okay?
- I'm never gonna fall asleep.

666
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,259
Can you give me
another pill?

667
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,726
Not for another five hours.

668
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,271
