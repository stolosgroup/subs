Actual tear stains
on the page.

13
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,167
I went through two boxes
of tissues, goddamn you.

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,462
I'm sorry about that,
but I am relieved.

15
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,799
Your message was so cryptic,
I was afraid you hated it.

16
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,928
I loved it!
I had to tell you in person,
so you could see this.

17
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,847
- I wanna fast-track it
for the Christmas season.

18
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,225
Oh my gosh.
Oh, that's great.

19
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,560
- I just have one note.
- Okay.

20
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:47,816
This whole thing is...
so raw and honest,

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,276
and, let's face it, brutal.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,903
I mean, you spend
your whole career

23
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,197
writing about
your quest for love,

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,574
and then,
you finally find it...

25
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,701
and then he dies.

26
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,788
It's pretty dark.
It's a real departure
for you as a writer.

27
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,163
Well...

28
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:07,877
that's what happened...
He departed.

29
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,840
But, you're known for
writing "Sex and the City."

30
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,424
I'm afraid if we
publish this as is,

31
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,343
your readers are gonna pitch
themselves out the window

32
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,261
clutching their tubs
of Häagen-Dazs.

33
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:20,390
Oh, well, that is
certainly not what I want.

34
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,891
No.

35
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,894
I would love, and I think
this is very doable,

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,814
if you could give
the reader some
element of hope.

37
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:32,193
- Hm.
Just a suggestion
of a brighter future.

38
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,904
I mean, for example...
I imagine, at some point,

39
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,907
you're gonna start
dating again, right?

40
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,410
Um, I--

41
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,538
I, I mean, I'm not even
thinking about that yet.

42
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,081
I hear you...

43
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,334
but... if there's
a tiny part of you

44
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,422
that's open to the idea
of even just one date...

45
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,717
it would be great
if it could happen
in the next few weeks.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,345
I would love to hit that
stocking stuffer deadline.

47
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,557
Uh, you want me
to go on a date?

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,434
Ooh, just to be clear,
I am just talking about

49
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,395
a toe dip into
the dating pool.
One guy.

50
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,897
It doesn't have
to be a whole chapter.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,608
It could just be
an epilogue.

52
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,110
A single page,
half a page.

53
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,780
Just... lookin' for
that glimmer of hope.

54
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,365
Okay.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,744
I'm here, I'm here.

56
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,786
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late,

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,996
but I have good news.

58
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,623
Carrie agreed to be
an auction item

59
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,083
at the school benefit.

60
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,753
- Sorry, it took so long.
- No, that's great.

61
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,296
I'm sorry if I was
being pushy about it.

62
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,465
The benefit committee's
just all over me to get

63
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,966
more flashy auction items.

64
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,344
Oh, and remember,
for this match,

65
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,303
the redhead is
deadly at the net.

66
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,931
Right, and the other one
has that killer serve.

67
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:43,973
I could barely
return it last time.

68
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,183
Let's go! Come on!

69
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,859

with the squash...
opposite end.

91
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,296
Steve, can you hear me?

92
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,009
Just find me, okay?!

93
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,680
Hi, um, what are
the green ones called?

94
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,891
Miranda Hobbes, you are
failing heirloom tomatoes.

95
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,186
- Oh my god! Hi!
Hi! Ha, ha.

96
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,772
Okay, I never wanted
you two to meet,
but here we are,

97
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,899
so, Miranda Hobbes,
this is my husband,

98
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,401
- Andre Rashad.
Hey.

99
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,403
- Andre, this is Miranda.
- Hey, nice to meet the woman

100
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,530
- that beat up Chucky
in the subway.
- Oh.

101
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,157
Yeah, I hear things.

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,075
It's my greatest
accomplishment.

103
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,327
I, I am still having
nightmares, though.

104
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,247
Hey, should I run over
to the cheese woman?

105
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,124
- I want to stay ahead of
a dangerous cheese shortage.
- Oh.

106
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,334
He's not tryin'
to impress you.

107
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,836
He really
is this cute.

108
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,130
Be right back.

109
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh my god.
That kiss.

110
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,972
If you two were a TV show,
I would be streaming you.

111
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,683
Oh, well, it
would be a drama

112
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,769
'cause I got
my period this morning.

113
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,855
Oh shit.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear.

114
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,274
Yeah, we're still,
you know, off the IVF,

115
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,360
but trying, and I was
almost two weeks late.

116
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,905
- Mm.
- I shouldn't have told him.

117
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,323
I mean, the man is good
at a lot of things,

118
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,618
but cautious optimism
is not one of them.

119
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,662
I am dreading
telling him, Miranda.

120
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,790
I am so done
with all of this.

121
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,792
Hey...

122
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,667
This place is bullshit.

123
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,128
Why do they keep movin'
everything around?

124
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,757
Oh, Steve, Steve,
this is, uh, Nya,
my professor.

125
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,384
Hey.
- I have been dying to meet you.

126
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,596
You are the only person
I know who intimidates her.

127
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,974
- I think we intimidate
each other, actually.

128
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,185
Ah, my wallet! Shit!

129
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,896
You know, y-you got me
so freakin' distracted

130
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,689
when you're yellin' at me
about the squash guy,

131
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,984
I left my, I left my wallet
over where the pickle guy

132
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,737
who used to be over
in that corner.

133
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,822
I, I gotta,
I gotta go get it.

134
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,158
Um, really nice to meet you,
Professor, all right?

135
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:49,450
- Oh, sorry.
- No worries.

136
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,497
So, that's my Steve.

137
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,208
- Here comes my guy,
so would you--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,293
- Got the last of the Bloomsday.
Ooh.

139
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,920
- There we go.
- See?

140
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,761
Hi.

141
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,391
Oh, Amanda?

142
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,686
Mm, Carrie. Shit.

143
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,313
- Sorry to drop in,
um, unannounced.
- No, no, no. I love it.

144
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,983
You just caught me
with a milk mustache.
I mean, what am I? Five?

145
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,860
This is my fourth
cappuccino today.

146
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,361
I think...
I've lost track.

147
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,571
Come sit with me
while I vibrate.

148
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,822
Oh, do you want one?
They're free.

149
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,074
Oh, no. I'm, I'm good.
Thank you. Thank you.

150
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,702
So... what's up?

151
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:38,708
Well, um, I, I got
the book cover proposals
that you sent over,

152
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,710
and now, I'm worried.

153
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,544
Oh my god.

154
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,379
I thought the covers
were stunning,

155
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:49,844
especially number two
and... number five.

156
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:54,056
So spare and arresting.
Just takes my breath away.

157
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,642
But, maybe,
the book is too heavy.

158
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,727
You know, I mean,
even you said that

159
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,979
my readers don't want
all that sadness from me.

160
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,607
Maybe, I just--

161
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,693
Maybe, I just needed
to write the book for myself.

162
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,405
I respectfully disagree.

163
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:13,326
In fact, when I pitched
the idea of the epilogue

164
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,745
to Oprah's Book Club people,

165
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,916
they got very excited,
and said they were
definitely interested.

166
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,377
- Oprah? Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

167
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,756
- So, I guess
I'm goin' on a date.

168
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,091
I've been waiting
for you to be ready.

169
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,761
We had this whole
wave of divorces
at school this year,

170
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:36,474
and I know three
adorable dads who'll be
fighting over you.

171
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,725
Well, I'm not
exactly ready.

172
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,477
It was mandated
by my editor...

173
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:41,270
and Oprah.

174
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,272
- Really?
- Seriously?

175
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,275
Well, when Oprah
mandates a man date,

176
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,402
- what're you gonna do?
- Date a man.

177
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,198
-  Yeah.
- And I thought about it,
and I figured...

178
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,786
- if I can lighten my hair,
I can lighten my book, right?
Yes.

179
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,247
Oh, and they're all
gonna be at the benefit,

180
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,915
so you can meet them there.

181
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,458
No one anyone knows.

182
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,293
You know,
I'd rather, I'd rather

183
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,461
go the anonymous route,

184
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,921
since this is,
basically, a stunt,

185
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,966
you know, to give my, my
readers a glimmer of hope.

186
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,301
Is there an app
that knocks you out

187
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,928
while they post
your photos,

188
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,762
fill out those questionnaires,

189
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,056
and, oh my god,
I'm gonna be sick.

190
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,475
It's already done.
I listed you on
three different sites.

191
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,477
I narrowed it down to one.
I don't want to waste your time.

192
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,272
- When?
- Valentine's Day
on my lunch break.

193
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,982
Nobody buys real estate
in the winter,

194
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,858
so I decided to list you.

195
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,319
You staged me,
like an apartment?

196
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,154
You're doing very well.

197
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,948
There's a lot of buzz.

198
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,909
- Am I?
- Yeah... check it out.

199
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,495
- Let me see, let me see.
- Yeah, let's see!

200
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,289
Oh my.

201
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,332
- I'll date the dog.

202
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,960
Well, he's
objectively handsome.

203
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,211
To who?

204
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,922
Why is he chewing
his glasses?

205
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,175
In my experience,
glasses chewers
are good in bed.

206
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,094
Doesn't he look
like he would be?

207
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,346
All right,
no sex for me,
indefinitely.

208
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,349
All I need out
of this is pleasant
enough conversation,

209
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,518
so I can be
a stocking stuffer.

210
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,981
So, no sex for you...
ever?

211
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,526
Well, honestly,
the thought of never
having it again

212
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:14,780
feels really strange,
but the thought of...

213
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,533
having sex with anyone

214
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,617
other than Big
just makes me...

215
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,414
- sick to my stomach.
- Yeah, makes sense.

216
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,167
But maybe I've had
my share of all that.

217
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,210
You know, when I look
back at my dating life,

218
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,587
it was such
a roller coaster,

219
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,549
and I'm talking one of
those old, wooden ones

220
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,218
where it's more
life-threatening than fun.

221
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,972
Oh, I would kill
to get back on
the roller coaster.

222
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,475
I've been riding
the monorail for too long.

223
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,561
I was hoping things
were better with Steve,

224
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,979
'cause you hadn't
said anything.

225
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,565
No.

226
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,818
As I've always said,
"No news is no news."

227
00:10:54,487 --> 00:11:00,534
Speaking of,
what's the lifespan
of an unanswered text?

228
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,204
Three days,
three weeks,
three months?

229
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,748
Three months?
Try three hours.

230
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,669
- Che, huh?
- Yeah.

231
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,468
They never ask about me
at the podcast, do they?

232
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,098
You know,
Che's been back and forth
to L.A. a few times,

233
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,892
and you...
listen to the podcast.

234
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,479
- They ride all the rides.
-  So...

235
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,068
guess I'll have
to file that away
as a crazy one-off,

236
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,321
and resign myself
to having a dead sex life.

237
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,659
I can't believe
that I had the most

238
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,618
transcendent sex
of my life...

239
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,914
and it'll never
happen again.

240
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,291
Well...

241
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,461
I know how you feel.

242
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,630
But Big is,
actually, dead.

243
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,468
Maybe your sex life
with Steve is...

244
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,472
- just in a deep coma?
- Mm.

245
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,475
Hey, honey.
- Hey!

246
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,978
You havin' a little
midnight toast?

247
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,980
- I felt like a nosh.
- Oh.

248
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,815
So, I ran into Herbert Wexley
on the subway today.

249
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,152
Since when does
Herbert Wexley
ride the subway?

250
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,486
My guess is
he thinks it'll
boost his street cred

251
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,281
- if he ever runs for mayor.
- Oh!

252
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,160
Anyway, we bonded
over our wives' mutual
tennis addiction.

253
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,538
Oh, that reminds me.
We're actually playing
again tomorrow morning.

254
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:32,209
- You know...
I'm not half bad at tennis.
- Oh?

255
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,171
- Herbert said he
played in high school.
- Uh-huh.

256
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,841
How come you never
ask the boys to join
for some mixed doubles?

257
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,928
- Never occurred to me.
- Is it occurring to you now?

258
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:47,224
Harry... would you like
to play some doubles with us?

259
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,684
I would love that.

260
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,606
Uh, Cubana House
has a table at 6:30.

261
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,734
- Are we feeling Cuban tonight?
- Sí.

262
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,528
- Why is this guy on my tail?
Car play activated.

263
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,698
"So sorry
you're not pregnant,

264
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,285
and I hope it went well
when you told AR."

265
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,453
Shit!
Wait-- Just, Nya.

266
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,121
- Just stop. Just drive.
- "...you two seem like a really

267
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,831
- "strong, happy couple.
- It's too late.

268
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,541
- It's too late. I heard it.
- "Heart emoji.

269
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,668
- Heart emoji. Miranda."
- Sorry.

270
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,879
I was gonna tell you
I got my period.

271
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,673
And you, you told one of your
students before you told me?

272
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,926
- Well, not exactly. It was--
- Red light, red light!

273
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,221
- Oh! My god!

274
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,766
- Sorry, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

275
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,520
You want to tell me why
I'm learnin' this news

276
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,563
from Stephen Hawking
instead of my own wife?

277
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,066
Excuse me?
Yes, hello.

278
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,734
You might wanna watch
where you're going!

279
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,195
- I'm really sorry.
- It's a red light!

280
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,489
I mean, open your eyes!
It's a crosswalk!

281
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,116
- Sir, she said she was sorry.
- I have a toddler!

282
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,826
Okay, sir, you need
to check yourself.

283
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,494
You need to check yourself!

284
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,121
Is he seriously comin' for me?

285
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,417
I have a toddler!

286
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,423
He has a toddler.

287
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,268
Look, I'm, I'm
really, really sorry.

288
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,228
"Sorry that I learned
about it from a robot,"

289
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:14,979
or, "Sorry this
isn't happenin'?"

290
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,648

It's yours! Sorry.

309
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,670
Damn you!

310
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,547
Woo!

311
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,885
Woo! Oh, honey, are you okay?

312
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,638
I'm okay, I'm okay.

313
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,141
Just an old Jewish guy
tryin' to play sports.

314
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,893
That was thrilling!

315
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,021
I'm so relieved.
It can be dicey to play
with other couples

316
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:39,897
'cause you never know
how it's gonna go,

317
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,483
but I think we were
really well matched.

318
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,026
Why are you
so quiet, Harry?

319
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,237
Well, don't you
have somethin' you
want to say to me?

320
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,032
- Like what?
- Maybe, "I'm sorry."

321
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,077
- Sorry for what?
- Ya knocked me over, babe.

322
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,246
- By accident.
- Yeah, but you never
even said "sorry."

323
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,665
It hurt my feelings.

324
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,875
Are you serious
right now?

325
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,087
- It's common courtesy.
- We were playing tennis.

326
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,588
And there's no rule
against the word
"sorry" in tennis.

327
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:08,592
I went for the ball,
which you had literally
just mansplained me to do.

328
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,970
- Wait, what now?
- You heard me.

329
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,139
You can be a bit
of a mansplainer,

330
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,099
but I had let it go
on the court

331
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,725
because you're my partner,
and you have to let

332
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,186
the annoying stuff go
if you wanna win.

333
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,606
And we did win,
but I got knocked down
in the process,

334
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,401
- and I'm just asking
for a simple apology.
- That's insane!

335
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,570
- I'm not apologizing!
- What's the big deal?
It's two words!

336
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,155
You're making
it a big deal

337
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,740
by bringing it up
in the first place!

338
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,575
I could argue that you're
making it an even bigger deal

339
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,371
by refusing to apologize.
Why is this so hard for you?

340
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:41,291
Because I have nothing
to apologize for.

341
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,086
We were playing a game.
What is wrong with you?

342
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,879
Are you five years old now?

343
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,798
No, I just feel like
I'm owed an apology.

344
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,926
What is your
goddamn problem?!

345
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,805
I will not apologize
for playing good tennis!

346
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,933
You're driving me
fucking crazy!

347
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,779
- Great... now they
think we're that couple.
- What couple?

348
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,656
The couple who
fights in the street.

349

Goddammit.
If Frank bails on me
one more time--

350
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,333

- Oh, I'm sorry. That sucks.

00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,376
Yeah.

00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,163
I'm just gonna go back in,
and tell Amanda

464
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:20,041
I didn't find that
glimmer of hope.

465
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,668
Guess my book's dead, too.

466
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:27,132
Darn. My sad book
keeps getting sadder.

467
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,675
Speaking of dead things...

468
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:35,348
I tried to revive my sex life
with Steve the other day.

469
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,059
I, I really tried hard,

470
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,605
and I'm afraid...
the patient is non-responsive.

471
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,568
- So... no pulse?
- No pulse at all.

472
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,904
It was like two dead people

473
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,740
trying to get it on,
like zombie sex.

474
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,868
And you're sure you guys
wouldn't consider going
back to a therapist?

475
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,621
We tried twice.
We don't need a therapist.

476
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,247
We need the cast of
"The Walking Dead."

477
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,750
Listen, before we get
to all of that,

478
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,670
we have a special
treat that we know
you're going to enjoy.

479
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,424
Someone you'll be
grateful to hear is
not the two of us.

480
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,636
- Yes, you can see

481
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,972
- this amazing performer--
- Use the mic. I beg of you.

482
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,100
in their Netflix
comedy special
"Check the Box,"

483
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,895
- put your hands
together for Che Diaz!
- Che Diaz!

484
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,237
Hi! Yes, aw!

485
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,155
Uh, you know what?
I'll just take hers.
She's not using it.

486
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,741
Hey!

487
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,576
Woo! How we all doin' tonight?

488
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,624
Yeah, you know,
this auction's taking longer
than I did to come out.

489
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,959
It's wild.

490
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,169
So, listen, I usually do
about a 40-minute set,

491
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,421
but don't worry,
they've asked me
to keep it clean,

492
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,423
so I should be done here
in about three minutes. Yeah.

493
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,764
That's Che!
Che's performing?

494
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,517
Oh, yeah.
You know what, Charlotte
roped me into participating,

495
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,477
then I roped in Che, which,
actually, wasn't that big--

496
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,692
Oh, okay, well.
The cheese stands alone.

497
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,113
Oh my god.

498
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,576
Well, I am not
getting laid tonight.

499
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,704
Zero hotties here,
except for the servers,

500
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,831
and I have a strict
no cater-waiter policy.

501
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,791
He's here.

502
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:29,004
- Who?
- The teacher I went
on a date with last night.

503
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,631
- Professor Puke? Where?
- Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

504
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,635
He's, um, he's at the bar.
Wait, is that even him?

505
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,179
It's hard to tell
because I'm seeing more
than the tops of his shoes.

506
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,806
You know what?
Stand in front of me.

507
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,351
It's all right.
Thanks. Have a good night.

508
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:43,560
Is he leaving?

509
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,231
Oh, yeah, it's okay.
He's leaving, okay.

510
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,191
You know what?
Can you follow him out,

511
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,611
and then come back
and tell me when you're sure

512
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,364
he's out of
the building and gone?

513
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,409
You want me to off him, too?
What am I, Mossad?

514
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,704
- My husband died.
- You get one more of those.

515
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,706
Okay. Go. Fast.

516
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,752
We know we're not
your core demo,
but we love you.

517
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,503
- Aww.
- Yeah. She turned me on to you.

518
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,755
I watched your special,
like, I don't know,
like, 10 times.

519
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,382
My husband's like,
"Veronica, what's
goin' on with you?"

520
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,676
I did.
I read that piece on you
in "Vulture" and got addicted.

521
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,011
- Ohh.
- Addicted.

522
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,645
But we're fans
for life, like, for life.
Wow.

523
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:32,734
Listen, I so appreciate this.
I see someone I know,

524
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,819
- so I'm just, uh--
- Do your thing.

525
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,030
- We'll be here a while.
Okay. Okay!

526
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,366
Fans for life!

527
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:43,078
Hey, Rambo.
Were you just gonna leave
without saying hello?

528
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,581
Oh, hi.
No. I, I mean, um...
you were, you were busy,

529
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,542
and I, I was standing
there... for a while,

530
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,586
and it, it looked
like that was...
gonna take a while,

531
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,089
so, I just, you know,
I called an Uber.

532
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,466
Mmm.
Okay, okay.

533
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,219
So, how have you been?

534
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,513
I've been fine, thank you.
And yourself?

535
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,515
What's... going on?

536
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,267
Why are you,
why're you being weird?

537
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,853
Well, I don't
know how to be...

538
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,854
You never wrote me back.

539
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,524
You wrote me?

540
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,609
DM'd me back or whatever.

541
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,782
- Well, when did you DM me?
- Like three months ago.

542
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,619
Three months? Miranda...
I-I've done a ton of weed.

543
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,872
I, I can't--
I can barely remember
three hours ago.

544
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,998
Plus, I get a lot of DMs.

545
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,710
- I'm sure.
- Okay, no.

546
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,672
I meant there's so much volume.

547
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,049
I, I wasn't being a dick.
I just-- I, I seriously
just didn't clock it,

548
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,301
and I'm sorry.

549
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,471
You're busy. I'm busy.
It's all good.

550
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,559
- Did I just say,
"It's all good?"

551
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,271
You should've just
DM'd me again.

552
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,690
Ask for what you want.
That's a turn-on.

553
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,235
I didn't know that.

554
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,654
I'll tell you what I want...

555
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,867
I wanna go someplace
with you...

556
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,704
and take off
all your clothes.

557
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,458
- Really?
- Really.

558
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,550
Well, my Uber is here.

559
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,677
I have a 7:00 AM flight.
I have to go.

560
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,512
No, you can't go.
The auction's not finished.

561
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,055
You didn't tell me
the drama club was doing

562
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,015
three songs from
"Dear Evan Hansen."

563
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,727
- I love you so much.
- Yeah, 7:00 AM flight.

564
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,687
- You can finish this without me.
- Are you crazy?!

565
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,524
I am awful!
I can see it
in people's eyes.

566
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,568
They're like,
"Oh god, not her again."

567
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,487
What do you care if other
people think you're awful?

568
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,238
How could you
say that to me?

569
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,199
- Say what?
- That I'm awful.

570
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,701
- I didn't say that.
- Y-- Okay...

571
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:47,827
Mr. Improv
holdin' all the cards.

572
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm out there humiliated,
doing my best,

573
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,000
and you're gonna stand here
and say that I'm awful?

574
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,461
No, no, no.
I said that people--

575
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,421
I didn't say that.
I said people, people
said that you were awful,

576
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,215
- but I didn't--
- Hi.

577
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,217
- We-we-we're just lookin'
for the restrooms.

578
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,928
- Hey!
- Yeah. Yeah!

579
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:07,722
Sorry.

580
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,432
- No, no.
- I'm so sorry.

581
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,435
Uh, watch
your step there.

582
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:20,318
- Oh, great. Now they
think we're that couple.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

583
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,986
Give it up for
the Arbor School

584
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,530
drama department,
ladies and gentlemen.

585
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,951
I love you, baby.
How can I make it up to you?

586
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,369
Emcee:
They were amazing!

587
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,372
The Arbor School
drama department, everyone!

588
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,792
And sold!
Item number 8248,

589
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,045
a case of wine donated by
a seventh-grade parent from...

590
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,257
wow, vineyard in Tuscany.
Enjoy your wine. All right.

591
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,385
Enjoy your wine, all right!

592
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,595
Carrie, you can't leave.

593
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,846
Your item hasn't even
been auctioned off yet.

594
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,683
I'm sorry,
but according
to Gay Mata Hari,

595
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,017
this is my window.

596
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:57,730
...a date with sex writer
Carrie Bradshaw, huh?

597
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,275
- It was lunch, a lunch date.
- That's...

598
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,443
That's what I told them.

599
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,195
I was only on
the gathering committee,

600
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,113
not on the program committee.

601
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,615
A date with sex writer
Carrie Bradshaw.

602
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,617
Starting bid, $500.

603
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,704
And sex writer?
Like what-what-what?
Like I write porn?

604
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,165
Um, you know what?
It-it's not a date.
It's a lunch date.

605
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:20,503
And she's not a sex writer.
She writes about relationships,

606
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,131
- and the nuances that go--
- Okay, please stop.
Please, please stop.

607
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:27,302
Okay, thank you
for that clarification,
Charlotte, um...

608
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,431
Carrie Bradshaw--
Is that who--?
That's Carrie Bradshaw.

609
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,808
Ladies and gentlemen,
Carrie Bradshaw.

610
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,602
Why don't you come on
up here and help me out?

611
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,103
- Lord knows I need it, right?
- Oh, no, no, no.

612
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,104
You're doing just fine,
just fine.

613
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,107
Oh, come on.
Come on, for the kids.

614
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,319
- Hey, a round of applause
for Carrie Bradshaw, everybody.
- Our friendship is now over.

615
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,404
Come on, it's for the kids.

616
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,240
Hello.

617
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,909
- I'm good, Herbert. How are you?
- All right, starting bid...

618
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,749
Date with sex writer
Carrie Bradshaw, $500.

619
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,585
Anyone?

620
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,837
- Can't! We're all married.
Ah, that's true.

621
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,216
But it is a lunch date,
not sex, right?

622
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,678
Definitely not sex.

623
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,888
$500.

624
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,681
- Oh, $450. $450, yeah.

625
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,267
- There we go, $450.
- No, no, no, no.

626
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,354
We, we have a spill here.
We need a waiter.

627
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,397
- Okay ...
- Do something!

628
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,108
She's about to implode
like the house at the end
of "Poltergeist."

629
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,611
$700! $700!

630
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,029
Oh dear.

631
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,156
$700.
- $800!

632
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,866
Well, now Charlotte's
biddin' against herself.

633
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,452
Pump the brakes, babe.
Pump the brakes.

634
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,412
You know what?
I bid a thousand.

635
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,706
I bid a thousand,
and now, you can, uh...

636
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,583
- Okay, a thousand dollars.
- Yep.

637
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,003
Going once...
Going twice.

638
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,382
Peter:
$1,050.

639
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,552
$1,050.

640
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,055
Once, twice, sold, $1,050.

641
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,890
Uh-oh. He must've
snuck back in when I
was in the men's room

642
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,726
getting a handjob
from that cater-waiter.

643
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,359
Carrie.

644
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,655
- Hi.
- Hi.

645
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,907
- Uh...
- Well, what are the odds?

646
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,369
Wait, you're a,
you're a math teacher.
You probably know.

647
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:20,748
Well, it definitely
involves an X to the...
power of hangover.

648
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,793
- Listen, uh, don't worry.

649
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,003
We-we don't actually
have to go out again.

650
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,382
Yeah. And I'm happy
to cover your bid.

651
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:33,302
- Oh, no.
- You know, that was clearly
charity for all parties.

652
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,429
No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't think of it.

653
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,182
I'm impressed
you even remember
the subject I teach.

654
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,767
Oh, uh, that's
the extent, really.

655
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,395
Well, we should
go out again.

656
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,105
We have so much
to discuss.

657
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,815
Like, how did
I get home?

658
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,859
Did, did we even pay
for those drinks?

659
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:52,321
- Oh, we paid.
- Yes, yes we did.

660
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,367
Oh... yeah, okay.
Let's do it.

661
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,830
- It's for the kids.
- For the kids, yes.

662
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,624
- Okay.
- Okay .

663
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,376
- Good night.
- Good night, okay.

664
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,297
I've never felt anything
so intense in my life.

665
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:15,011
I think I'm
in love with you.

666
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,853
You're in love with you...
with me.

667
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,525
And the weed
doesn't hurt.

668
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,696
No, no.
It's not just that.

669
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,369
True, I'm also
very good at sex.

670
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,373
