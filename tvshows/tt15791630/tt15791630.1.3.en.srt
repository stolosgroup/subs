00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,013
You've gotta be able
to cook something.

749
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,599
I can cook everything,
but I don't wanna cook.

750
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,352
I'm a eater. That's
why I'm Chub Rockster.

751
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,211
Like, if you had to cook,

752
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,940
and we were in the
middle of COVID...

753
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,441
- You wanna know?
- Yeah.

754
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,985
- What would you cook?
- Peanut butter and jelly.

755
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,362
- Peanut butter and jelly?
- That's not...

756
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:57,699
That's spreading stuff
around on a piece of bread.

758

How is New York?

TRAVIS: <i>Oh, it's
amazing. It's amazing.</i>

763
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:14,174
<i>I just got the best news, too. We
went, um, we went to the doctor,</i>

764
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:17,802
<i>and we're not doing egg
retrieval until Tuesday,</i>

765
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:21,222
<i>so Sunday is
literally meant to be.</i>

766
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:25,768
- Oh my god. That's the best!
- Nice. I'm excited for you, man.

767
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,855
TRAVIS: <i>Yeah, it'll happen,
like, on our anniversary,</i>

768
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,815
<i>which is the most
amazing news ever.</i>

769
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,799
Oh my god. Are you nervous?

770
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:36,321
TRAVIS: <i>I'm not, but I know,
like, things I wanna say to her,</i>

771
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:39,199
<i>but I... and I've said them
a million times to her,</i>

772
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:41,576
<i>but saying them at that moment,</i>

773
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,206
<i>is probably gonna be the most
nerve-wracking thing ever.</i>

774
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,542
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna send you this, like,
little note that I made in my iPhone</i>

775
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,794
<i>of what I plan on saying to her.</i>

776
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,296
Oh my god. You have to.

777
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,572
TRAVIS: <i>I'll touch base with
you guys as soon as we land.</i>

778
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:59,511
- Okay, all right.
- Well, have a safe flight, and don't...

779
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:01,679
- Travel safe, man.
- Don't lose the ring.

at all costs, trust me.</i>

00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,187
- Okay, love you, too.
- All right, bro. Love you. Peace.

Oh, look what
he... Look at this.

"A year ago today, I
fell in love with you.

788
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,138
One night with you
was all it took."

789
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:22,516
Aww.

790
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:25,870
Why am I crying?

791
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,705
- Because you love to cry, babe.
- "You've been

792
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:31,042
- "one of my best friends for years."
- Oh.

Will you marry me?"

- Aww.
- What part of this got cryin' into it?

799
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,727
- What's happenin'?
- I don't know. It's just...

800
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,896
That's what girls do when
things like this are happening.

801
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,398
I've, I've never seen

802
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:55,733
this much crying,
babe. [laughing]

803
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:59,571
This is the most tender
thing I have ever read,

804
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:02,115
and it's bringing me to tears.

805
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:05,034
I can't help it. I'm a
crier. What can I say?

806
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:08,872
You gon' be, you gon' be dehydrated
from all the damn crying.

00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,957
Do I need to get you some
water? [Kris laughing]

808
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:15,336
I have had so much anxiety
over this location, this date,

809
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,629
everything that's happening,

810
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:20,675
and I'm just so relieved that
everything's organized, settled.

811
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,260
We have a date. We have a plan.

where you're going?

- I'm gonna get a Coke.

- Oh.
- Or a Dr. Pepper.

sounded like mumble.

- I'm gonna get cheese fries...

- Not a double.
- No.

Um, I don't think so.

I love Travis.

I just love that they
were friends for so long

before making it, like, a thing.

879

- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

880
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:29,614
So, I feel like they have a really
solid friendship foundation...

881
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:31,658
- I agree.
- Which is super important.

882
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:36,538
I just love how, like,
calm, and, like, easygoing,

883
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:38,373
and, like, I don't know.

884
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,625
I just feel like he doesn't
seem like a stress or,

885
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:43,378
whereas Kourtney can, kind of, be,
kind of, you know, a stress or,

886
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,589
so I feel like that balances
them out or something.

887
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:48,591
I just think they're
a really good match.

888
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,261
Yeah, and he wants
us to be involved,

889
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,180
- which I like, too.
- Yeah. Exactly.

I am happy that Travis is
gonna be my new brother-in-law.

I've always really,
really liked him,

even when they were just
friends for a few years before.

00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,866
Like, it worries me sometimes

897
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,578
because I just don't know how
stable he is right now. Do you?

898
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,163
- Like, I haven't spoken to him...
- Mm-mm.

899
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:23,668
On that sort of a level in a long
time so I don't know where he's at,

900
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,838
and with his, like,
mental health.

901
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:32,635
And Kourtney obviously has to continue
to, you know, live her life and be happy.

902
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,077
Of course.

903
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,915
- [phone ringing]
- It's Mindy.

904
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:39,809
Hi.

905
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,312
MINDY WEISS [on phone]:
<i>He's 33 minutes out.</i>

906
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,148
Wait, he's gonna get
there in 33 minutes?

907
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,149
MINDY: <i>Yeah.</i>

908
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,776
Okay, let me call Kendall and
Kylie and see where they are,

909
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,861
and then I'll call you back.

910
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,720
[phone ringing]

911
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:54,908
- KENDALL [on phone]: <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, um, are you guys driving?

912
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:57,744
- Yeah.
- Is Kylie driving her car?

913
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:58,786
KENDALL: Yeah, why?

914
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,123
I'm just worried that they're
gonna see you guys on the freeway.

915
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:03,583
Well, where are they?

916
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:06,461
They are 33 minutes
away from the hotel.

917
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:07,462
What?!

918
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:12,383
- Oh, so we're close to them...
- We're 34, we're 34 minutes away.

919
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,260
Oh my god!

920
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:16,638
I don't know if we should
speed up or slow down.

921
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:20,475
If they're 33 minutes and
we're... Well, we're 33 now, too.

922
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:21,893
My mom would be so pissed if

923
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,895
Kylie and I were the ones
to ruin the surprise.

924
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:24,979
I'd be upset, too.

925
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,731
We're tryin' to figure this
out. We're a little freaked out.

926
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:30,151
You guys get off on the same exit,
and it's a red light, you're screwed.

927
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,820
You'll be at the same exit.

928
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,696
We should've thought this
out a little bit better,

929
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,867
and planned to, like, not be in our cars,
and just be a little bit more discreet.

930
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,327
<i>Someone's gonna see someone.</i>

931
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:42,205
Kendall and Kylie are gonna get
there at the same exact time

932
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,915
as Kourtney and Travis
are gonna get there,

933
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,375
and that cannot happen.

934
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,401
We pull up right behind them.

935
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,756
- And they know where...
- "What're you guys doing here?"

936
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,757
Oh, shit.

937
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:53,967
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

938
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:54,992
ALL: Oh, shit.

939
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,847
KIM: <i>Next on</i> The Kardashians...

940
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:02,308
The minute that sun goes
down, it's showtime.

941
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:03,935
- Where is he doing it?
- KRIS: On the beach.

942
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:06,604
It's perfect. He's
super romantic.

943
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:08,773
[cheering]

944
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:11,776
- This makes me so happy.
- Cheers, you guys.

945
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,611
ALL: Cheers.

946
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:14,988
I know Scott knows.

947
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:18,640
- Do you have, like, sympathy for Scott?
- 'Cause it doesn't feel like you do.

948
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,077
How do they feel
about everything?

949
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:24,372
They were upset. They didn't
understand why they weren't there.

950
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,012
Hopefully, they're
invited to the wedding.

951
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,692
- Am I invited to the wedding?
- I don't know.

952
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,881
Doing my egg
retrieval on Tuesday.

953
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,965
WOMAN: They need a baby.

954
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:37,010
DOCTOR: Well, there's a
follicle here, but it looks old.

955
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,345
Very unlikely to
get a mature egg.

956
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:44,082
All we need is one good egg, and
now, it's just in God's hands.
