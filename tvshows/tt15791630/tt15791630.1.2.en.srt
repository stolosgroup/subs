00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,632
Previously on The Kardashians...

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,093
Hi.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,720
- Let's rub our bellies.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:17,350
- This is a relationship that
I don't think anybody saw coming.

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,018
- I definitely saw this coming.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,895
- Hey, you can't, you can't.

7
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,481
- All I need is just to be acknowledged.

8
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,524
- Right.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,442
- Oh, do I even mean anything to anyone?

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,361
- Oh my god, I'm hosting SNL.

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,279
They were like, "Can you sing?" Nope.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,199
"Can you dance?" Nope.
"Can you act?" No.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,787
There's more footage
from the sex tape that's been out there.

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,665
And it said, "Kim's New Sex Tape"
when you clicked on it.

15
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:45,379
And it's, like, over my dead body is this
shit gonna happen to me again.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,074

17
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:03,104
- So, Ray J's manager
is claiming he has a sex tape

18
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,648
of us in Santa Barbara.
- Oh, oh, oh.

19
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,693
I'm trying to pack for SNL,

20
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,279
and now I have to deal
with this sex tape drama.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,866
Nineteen years
this has been held over my head.

22
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,035
This is the shit that I did
when I was young, and I need to own it.

23
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,745
That was 20 years ago.
I didn't know what to do.

24
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,373
I had no money
and I did not know what to do.

25
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:27,503
I have all the time, all the money,
and all of the resources

26
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,006
to burn them all to the ground.

27
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:34,552
I'll do everything in my power
to protect myself and to protect my kids,

28
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,096
so I'm not gonna be shamed by this,
and, like, bullied.

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,141
Don't you think you should call the guy
and say, "I just want you to know

30
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,727
that this guy is not
the rightful owner of anything"?

31
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,021
- We don't know what this is.

32
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,815
This could be really, really bad.

33
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,485
So, the best thing
I can do is stay positive,

34
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,364
make sure everybody stays calm,
and just keep things moving.

35
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,783
- I'm about to get
all my attorneys involved

36
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,786
to sue the out of these.

37
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,834
- Guys, I love you, but I have a meeting.
Keep me posted, okay?

38
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,629
- Okay.
- Sorry, we didn't help you pack, Kim.

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,923
If you need us to help you
with your looks or anything...

40
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,008
- No, not about the looks,

41
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,052
if she needs emotional support.
- I know, but she's gotta pack

42
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,553
the suitcase so she can leave.
- She's fine.

43
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,014
If you need me to come over
after True goes to bed,

44
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,307
I can come over.

45
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,768
I'm not doing anything.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,604
- All right, we love you, Kim.
- Love you, Joge.

47
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,023
Let us know if you need us, okay?

48
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,067
'Kay.

49
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,092
- I really wanted to see
the houses in Malibu.

50
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,470
- Me too, but I like lookin'
at houses with you.
- Me too.

51
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,640
Travis and I currently
live in separate homes

52
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,308
a block away from each other,

53
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:09,856
and we just wanna, like, explore
the idea of living in one home.

54
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,483
This is cute. This is a cute vibe.

55
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:17,446
We're so in love with our homes
right now and where we live

56
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,242
that it's gonna be really hard
to find something to beat that.

57
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,618
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

58
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,179
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

59
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,171
So, this is actually one of
the most important estates in Bel Air.

60
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,257
It was built in 1934
for a really prominent family.

61
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,550
Walk on through.

62
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,929
But it's got that really beautiful
pedigree look from the '30s.

63
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,265
This house has a really cool style.

64
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,852
It, kind of, reminds me
of, like, old Hollywood,

65
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,147
Frank Sinatra vibes,
like, which is so us.

66
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,816
- This is Mason's room.
- Mm-hm.

67
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,360
Alabama's... Landon's room.

68
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,653
This is Ati's room.

69
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,530
Yeah, and there's even a nice closet.

70
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,908
- I like it.
- I could see us all, like,

71
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,951
laying on the couch
and watching movies,

72
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,787
and cooking together.

73
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,917
My parents had a setup
like this growing up

74
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,793
with two separate sides.

75
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,671
Oh, she's definitely got the better side.

76
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,884
- You should try 'em on.
- No.

77
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,598
- So, the pool has fiber optic lighting.
It lights up at night.

78
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,017
- Oh, cool.
- It's really pretty.

79
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,102
- Yeah, so.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,193
Oh my god, people were, like, pissed

81
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,321
about the Disneyland
video of me on you.
- Why?

82
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,073
They're just like,

83
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,617
"Who's taking the video?
You guys are at Disneyland.

84
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,411
There's kids, there's kids."
- We're like, "It's our tour guide."

85
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,081
Kissing and hugging is not a bad thing.

86
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,917
I'm actually grateful that my kids

87
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,963
can see a loving,
affectionate relationship

88
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,675
because they haven't seen
that their whole lives.

89
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,094
- I just think people
have trouble understanding

90
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,890
how two people can be
so in love and affectionate

91
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,475
'cause they're miserable.

92
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,478
- Yeah, totally.
- That's why.

93
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,023
He was like...
- Yeah, he's like, "You guys are..."

94
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,360
"These two are
makin' out in the backyard."

95
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:32,456
- Like, all these paparazzi were standing
out of their cars taking pictures

96
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,001
and I was like, "How do they even
know I was coming up the hill?"

97
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,129
- I think they're just waiting for you...
- But out of their cars?

98
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,923
It was so strange
and made me so paranoid,

99
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,216
and no one knew I was coming home.

100
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,342
So, like...
- Yeah.

101
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,011
- I don't know who would've told on me.
- They're just hope...

102
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,597
They're just hoping, I think.
- I was just like, "So annoying."

103
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,682
That was the strangest thing.

104
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,226
- Is Kyles home?
- I don't know.

105
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,812
I just gotta pick something up.

106
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,323
Oh, I love this and her chicken.

107
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,450
She brings me eggs every week.

108
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,996
- She's so cute.
- She has chickens over here.

109
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,790
Oh, there's eggs! Look how cute.

110
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,003
- What came first? The chicken or the egg?
- Mind, isn't it?

111
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,506
I don't know.
- I think it was the chicken.

112
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,382
- How did it get here?
- God.

113
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,801
God made humans
and then humans produce eggs.

114
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,888
I think God made chickens
and then chickens produce eggs.

115
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,972
- Sure.

116
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,333
- I have to believe something.
I have to believe in something.
- Yeah... I don't know.

117
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,894
Hey.

118
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,270
Me and Malika are in your backyard.

119
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,398
Where is what you wanted me to pick up?

120
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,317
'kay, bye.

121
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,278
She said her security
will bring it to me in a sec.

122
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,697
Do you wanna just sit while they're...
- Sure.

123
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,741
I definitely didn't tell you this.

124
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,992
The other night...

125
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,037
You just can't even, like,
make this shit up. It's wild.

126
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,792
Me, Kim, Kourt, my mom,
we're all, like, in Kim's closet,

127
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:03,214
and this guy somehow had
access to Kim's sex tape.

128
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,843
There was other footage that was
never released or something like that.

129
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,762
And so, Kim, of course, is stressing.
You know, it sucks.

130
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,765
You don't wanna do SNL
if you know this is coming.

131
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,102
Like, you have to... It-It's just...
The whole thing is so.

132
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,479
- No, but she's gotta block the noise.
100%.

133
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,106
And you've gotta make sure of that.

134
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,524
- She's gonna do great.

135
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,025
Kim doesn't sign on for things

136
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,611
if she, like, doubts herself.
- Kim doesn't fail, babe.

137
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,240
- Yeah, she doesn't.
- She just doesn't.

138
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,369
- Kourt is not going to SNL,
so Scott's gonna come.

139
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,415
And before my mom and I fly to SNL,
I have to do James Corden.

140
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,460
I just have such anxiety
about going, like, just...

141
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,463
It's never the interview.
It's more the aftermath.

142
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,632
Like, now you have to listen
to everybody say this,

143
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,094
or judge you, or overanalyze
something you say, or pick this apart.

144
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:50,971
It's just, like...

145
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:54,807
Social media used to be,
you know, fun and silly.

146
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,894
There was definitely always trolls.

147
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,980
And now, it's...
Everything is so critical.

148
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,984
The way I look,
my situation with Tristan,

149
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,402
is my hair done the right way?

150
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,615
"What is she doing with that laugh?"
That, this? "Oh my gosh, she said this."

151
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:15,494
I think I've gotten to the point that
it's, literally, safer to stay at home.

152
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,121
This shit used to be fun.

153
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,208
You're totally, sort of, like,
gaslighting yourself.

154
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,834
You're makin' up all these scenarios

155
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,504
that who even knows is happening.
- No, it's kinda like a killjoy.

156
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,507
- With all those paparazzi today,
swear I was having, like, a heart attack.

157
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,260
Literally, I thought I was
having a heart attack today.

158
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,305
I mean, anxiety is real,

159
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:38,809
and the amount of criticism and scrutiny

160
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,188
that you have to deal with
is also very real.

161
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,983
But I do like that you do deal

162
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,027
because you really could
run away and disappear

163
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,029
and decide that you don't want
this to be your life anymore

164
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,490
because someone doesn't have
something nice to say to you,

165
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,368
but then you'd ruin everything
you ever worked for.

166
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,369
- Yes.

167
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:02,375
Saying a mantra like,
"the haters," "Tune them out."

168
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,629
Yes, I think that is,
obviously, everyone's goal,

169
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,548
but it's so much easier said than done.

170
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,176
I do wanna know if there's
therapy for, like, overthinking.

171
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,054
- You might need to take a deep breath.

172
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,432
- I took a beta-blocker earlier,
so I'm, sort of...

173
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,727
- Oh, wait, your mom gave you that.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,745
Absolutely.

175
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,295
Are you gonna be excited that
I'm doing Saturday Night Live?

176
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,629
Yeah.

177
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,507
- 'Cause you're my best hype woman.

178
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,182
- I won't do that on stage, I promise.

179
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,808
Have the best day today, guys.

180
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,935
- 'Kay, bye.
- 'Kay, bye.

181
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,813
I'm in New York and I just have
so much to do this week.

182
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,942
I don't think people really get how insane
SNL is and what the schedule's like.

183
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,819
I mean, you come in on a Monday,

184
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,198
and you have, like, these meetings
where they pitch things to you.

185
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,116
Tuesday is sketch pitches.

186
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,369
Wednesday's the table read,
where you read, like, 40 sketches.

187
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,955
Thursday, filming of pre-tapes.

188
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,874
Friday, we start at 5 A.M.

189
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,876
Saturday is showtime.

190
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,085
It's a machine.

191
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,296
I really want this moment.

192
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,591
I don't wanna be thinking
and stressing about something else.

193
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,093
Like, I have a lot on my mind.

194
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,137
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

195
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,140
- Did you find out what
that blogger was gonna leak?

196
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,893
- No, you, you really
can't worry about it.

197
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:48,189
You're doing SNL right now.
That's what you need to focus on.

198
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,570
And I would put your energy there,
and this too shall pass.

199
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,325
- All right, well, I'm gonna
go finish getting ready.

200
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,203
I love you.
- Okay. Today's gonna be a great day.

201
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:06,958
You're gonna kick ass at SNL
and I can't wait to see how the day goes.

202
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,877
- Oh my god, me too.
I'll call you later and let you know.

203
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,254
- Okay, keep me posted.

204
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,882
- Okay, love you, bye.
- Love you, too.

205
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,926
- I mean, my mom's obviously right.

206
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,596
Like, I can't stress about something
that I have no control over anymore,

207
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,307
but it is easier said than done.

208
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,309
- Wait, so, what are you, um,
what are you doing today, like...

209
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,187
- I'm gonna meet Amy Schumer.
- Okay.

210
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,691
- And we're just...
She's been, like, the most support.

211
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,026
She's, literally, the... Just the funniest,

212
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,363
but just giving me advice
and, like, Girl Pep Talk

213
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,700
because sometimes I'm like,
"Why the did I sign on to do this?

214
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,203
Like, I, I can't do this.
Like, why did I do this?"

215
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,372
- So, what's the deal with Kanye?
Is he coming?

216
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,832
- Yeah, he's here already.

217
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,627
He literally took
a coach commercial flight.

218
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,920
- Stop.

219
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:57,008
- Sat, like, in the seat
next to the bathroom.

220
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,760
Kanye is in New York to support me,

221
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,388
but we also have, like,
set some serious boundaries.

222
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,724
Like, Kanye and I are staying
at separate hotels.

223
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,393
I've been really clear
with him as far as, like,

224
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,604
where we stand in our relationship.

225
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,524
Just super-drama-free
is the vibe for this week.

226
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,778
He said he didn't sleep all night long
just so that he can get in town

227
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,157
early enough to meet up with Dave,

228
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,243
and, like, go over jokes
and really, like, help,

229
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,289
and Dave introduced us
to this comedian Michelle Wolf,

230
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,291
who is so funny.

231
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,960
We've all been, like, on this
thread about the monologue,

232
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,171
and what jokes are funny
and what we should take out,

233
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,299
and we've all kinda,
like, collaborated on it.

234
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,303
- I cannot believe that he's helping
you the way that he is.

235
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,318
- But how are you feeling?
When did Tristan leave?

236
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,694
- Sunday.
- Aww.

237
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,405
- He's just in Sacramento
playing the Clippers or something.

238
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,157
- Okay.

239
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:03,866
Just think about it.
He just, like, doesn't have...

240
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,494
- His whole world is here in L.A.
- I know.

241
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,215
- So it's a tough thing.
- So it's not good.

242
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,707
I am on my way to do
the James Corden talk show.

243
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,045
Malika's coming for my emotional support

244
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:20,216
because I do get a lot of anxiety
by doing talk shows these days.

245
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,426
What I remember about
the last time you did this show

246
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,011
- when I went with you...
- Yeah.

247
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,098
- you sat at the table, and he asked
you some pretty insane questions

248
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,016
or you had to eat something nasty.
- I'm not doing that.

249
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,726
- I was gonna say...
Oh, that's not happening this time?

250
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,395
- No.
- Put an eyeball in your mouth.

251
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,438
- I just bit it and then,
I literally spit it out.

252
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,065
It was the nastiest thing I've ever done.

253
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,316
You've got this.

254
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,901
- I think I might throw up.

255
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,405
Well, that would
be wonderful for our ratings.

256
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,491
No, you're not gonna do it.

257
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,247
Oh my god!

258
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,254
- I feel obviously much better
just, just talking it through,

259
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,422
and, like,

260
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,507
it's so easy for people to say,

261
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,009
"You don't know them.
Don't pay attention."

262
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,052
Or da-da...
Trust me, I try not to,

263
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,262
but when you're walking down the street

264
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,181
and then, even paparazzi's heckling at you

265
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,057
the same things that
you're trying to avoid,

266
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,519
it's so deteriorating

267
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,648
on your self-esteem, your confidence,
the way that you view yourself,

268
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,902
and even, like, anxiety
to post photos on Instagram.

269
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,529
I'm just anxious, even when I'm like,
I barely did retouching,

270
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,783
but I'm so afraid to post it
'cause people are gonna say I did this.

271
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,203
It's like, "Ah!"

272
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,413
You ever think you'd just tell
a couple people to off

273
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,291
and it might actually make you feel better
and people will back off of you?

274
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,835
- Why did Tristan say
the exact same thing?

275
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,337
He was like,
"What happened to you?"

276
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:43,090
Malika and Tristan have this ability
that they're able to ground me,

277
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,177
and I feel like that's one of the reasons
why I'm so drawn to the both of them.

278
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,471
He's like,
"You used to tell people to off."

279
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,973
All of us got a " off"
at one point or another,

280
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,601
- and they're strangers!
- Tell them all to off.

281
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,686
- You're right. You're 100% right.

282
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,773
I think I need a therapist.

283
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:10,201
- 'Kay, so, after Saturday,
I have about 20 d... 17 days

284
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,869
to take the Bar.

285
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,289
So, I'm gonna go...
I'll take Sunday off

286
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:19,168
and just really, really, really go for it.

287
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,087
Ten 12-hour days.

288
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,797
As important as SNL is,

289
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,758
it's more important that
I study for the Baby Bar

290
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,636
because I have one last chance to pass it

291
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,055
and then, I can't take it again.

292
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,103
- So much better.
I need to get more confident at my essays,

293
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,729
but this is my last chance.

294
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,330
- You're gonna pass it. I'm not worried.

295
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:46,196
- Yeah... I'll be eliminated
if I don't pass this time.

296
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,378
- Hello.
- Oh. Hi!

297
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,796
Oh my god.
- Are you here?

298
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,884
This place.
- Isn't this... This is what buys...

299
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,635
Hi.
- It's amazing.

300
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,596
I miss you. How are you?
- Thanks for coming over. I miss you.

301
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,473
I'm so good. I'm so excited for you.
Come on, let's work.

302
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,352
Amy Schumer and I have been
friends for a few years now.

303
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:23,649
Of course, she's, like, so funny
that I want her to hear

304
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,111
what I have as my, like, final monologue
and see what she thinks.

305
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:30,489
And I feel really good about it,
and I'm honestly not nervous.

306
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,909
That's, like, the one thing
that I'm not nervous about.

307
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,035
- I'm so excited about this.

308
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,913
You know, like, writing jokes is
my favorite thing in the world.

309
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,290
- I know and that's what everyone says
is you're just, like, the best.

310
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,418
- I'm the joke person, but you're,
like, the best at taking jokes.

311
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,588
- Yeah.
- Like I... Why are you so great at that?

312
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,674
Like, I did roasts,
and it was too hurtful.

313
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,176
I, like, couldn't do it anymore.
- Really?

314
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,679
- Yeah. Wait, let me get one... thing.

315
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,265
Okay, there we go.
What a romantic moment.
- Thank you.

316
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,392
- How are you feeling?
- Do you wanna read it...

317
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:01,021
- Well, I wanna see the,
the latest-latest, yeah.

318
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,315
- So, I feel like you should
read the one on my phone.

319
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,234
- Okay, let's do it.

320
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,735
- I don't want too many Kanye jokes,
but... one good one.

321
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,196
- No, I think, like, a really...
Like, one is great.

322
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,740
- Totally. So, there's,
like, two or three in here,

323
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,992
so I think I'm gonna take this one out.
- Let's pick the best. Okay.

324
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,369
- This one says...
- Is this Chappelle?

325
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,329
- Michelle Wolf.
- Great.

326
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,414
I love Michelle Wolf. She's hilarious.
- Yeah, so there...

327
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,834
- She's a murderer.
- Yeah, yeah.

328
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,962
Dave Chappelle suggested
that I work with Michelle Wolf,

329
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,256
who's, like, the funniest comedian,

330
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,883
and she's really helping me
write my monologue.

331
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,554
"Hey, guys. It's so great to be here
hosting Saturday Night Live.

332
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,265
I know, I'm surprised
to see me here, too."
- Mm-hm.

333
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,599
- "When they asked, I was like,

334
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,518
"You want me to host? Why?

335
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,479
"I haven't had a movie premiere
in a really long time.

336
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,065
"Actually, I've only had
that one movie come out

337
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,234
"and no one even told me
it was premiering.

338
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,986
It must've slipped my mom's mind."

339
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,529
- Wait, what was the movie?

340
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,072
- My sex tape.

341
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,576
- Thank you. Thank you. Great.
- Yeah.

342
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,119
But the joke on the internet was...
- Yes.

343
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,997
That, like, my mom had to,
she's my manager, she had to broker.

344
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,708
And there's a lot of, like,

345
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,626
kinda sex tape drama happening now,

346
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,880
where, like, people are saying that...
- Oh.

347
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,924
- maybe, there's a little bit more
from 20 years ago.

348
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,218
- Is there a part of you that's like,

349
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,555
"Let's get that out 'cause it,
probably, is pretty hot?"

350
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,892
If someone had a video of me,
like, 20 years ago,

351
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,435
I'd be like, "Can we please get that out?"

352
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,270
Because, I mean, if it were today,

353
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,147
you know, different,
but, but okay, so what's...

354
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,857
- So, I was really upset.
- Yeah.

355
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,775
- And then, I was like,

356
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,029
"it, losers.
Do it and I'll sue you or whatever."

357
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,366
And... I just can't, like...
I have to just take my power back on that.

358
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,368
- Yeah.
- This was 20 years ago.

359
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,703
Come on.
- Yeah, like, please.

360
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,831
- So, I think even, like, taking
the air out of those people...

361
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,083
Like, just starting off
with that is kinda funny

362
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,921
without being super, like, sex tape.

363
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,714
- I think I just wouldn't
do any sex tape stuff.

364
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,425
- Really?
- Because this moment in time...

365
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:58,095
Like, th-this piece of, like,
art or whatever will live on,

366
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:01,098
and people might not remember it.
Like, it's not...

367
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,476
- Not that relevant?
- I don't even think you need
to even give it any... yeah.

368
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:07,271
- Um, "I know I have privilege,
but I still struggle.

369
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:10,441
"Like most of the things that I wear,
it's really hard to pee.

370
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,568
"It's, like, a whole ordeal.

371
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,487
"Let's put it this way,
if R. Kelly dressed like me.

372
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,613
- Oh my god.

373
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,240
- he may have stayed out of trouble."

374
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,076
- Oh my god!

375
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,037
It's too long.
It's a long way to go for, like... Yeah.

376
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,874
- Okay, um, "Oh, Khloé,
you have the biggest heart.

377
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:31,045
It's so big, it has room for Tristan
and all of his side pieces."

378
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,463
- Oh shit.

379
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,132
- "And Kris.
Kris, you're not one of my sisters.

380
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,301
That's not a joke.
I just thought I'd remind you."

381
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,303
- No.
- 'Kay.

382
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,806
The one thing I thought I had
and was so confident in,

383
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:46,478
is my monologue,
so I'm a little confused now.

384
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,564
I really want...
- I am not obsessed with that.

385
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,485
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, but let's keep going, yeah.

386
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,475
- So, I think I can take out, like,
that whole middle chunk.
- I think so, too. Yeah.

387
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,786
- Add in what you were
saying at the beginning.
- Yeah.

388
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,330
- Okay, then it goes into this,
which I think is funny.

389
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,707
"Something I'm really proud of

390
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,209
"is that no one can ever
call me a gold digger.

391
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,545
"Honestly, I'm not even sure
how you become one.

392
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,921
"But I asked Corey,

393
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,382
"and he said that a good place to start

394
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,011
is getting a job in my mom's security."

395
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,722
- That's funny.
Calling Corey a gold digger is so funny.

396
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,099
But y-you gotta pause for that laugh.
You know what I mean?

397
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,770
"So, I asked Corey," and then,
give it a beat and let people laugh.

398
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,773
- I really want people to know that
I'm more than just a pretty face,

399
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,526
and good hair, and a great makeup,

400
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,737
terrific boobs, and an amazing butt.

401
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:41,032
- So, if you make it sound like the list
is always about to end, but it goes on.

402
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,533
- Yeah...
- I think,

403
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:46,037
like, just choosing
the funniest, strongest stuff.

404
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,332
- Yeah. Today was the first day
I had a little bit of anxiety.

405
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,667
- And what is it, like, from?
Like, what are you...

406
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,879
- Just like, "Oh shit, this is happening."

407
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,797
- Right.
- You know?

408
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,507
- Yeah, it's... But it's...

409
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,925
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be great.

410
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,468
It's so cool that you're doing it.
- Yeah.

411
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:04,055
- Like, everyone I know is like,
"That's so badass that she's doing it."

412
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,974
To me, it's like, you're just someone
who wants to, like, enjoy their life

413
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,768
and, like, have every experience.

414
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,394
- Yeah, yeah.
- And that's what it's about.

415
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,812
You know?
- That really is what it's about.

416
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,731
- Yeah, you... and you could even say that.
You could be like,

417
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:14,857
"'Cause I don't know
if you guys know this,

418
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,151
but I don't need the exposure
from this show."

419
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,486
- Like, you know?
- Yeah.

420
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,696
- Like, "I'm not hoping
to get discovered tonight."

421
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:25,701
Uh, "If anything, you know, usually,
I'm... I have 250 million followers.

422
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:29,038
If anything, tonight, I just wanted
some intimacy with some close friends."

423
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,456
Yes.

424
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,958
No, you've been so supportive.

425
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,418
Like, even when I'm like,
"Why the am I doing this?"

426
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,295
And you're like,
"'Cause you're a gangster.

427
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,464
And you're doing this."
And I'm like, "Okay, I am. I got it."

428
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,758
- Yeah. 'Cause anything you're scared of
is an opportunity.

429
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,510
It's, like, so exciting.

430
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,221
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

431
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,743
- Hey!
- Hi, Mom.

432
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,706
- Where's the star of the show today?

433
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:15,042
I heard this is the first show
back with an audience.

434
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,127
- Oh, stop.

435
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,129
- Oh yeah.
There's a full audience out there.

436
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,548
- Oh gosh.
- Yeah, they're already chanting,

437
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,927
"Khloé, Khloé, Khloé!"
- Are you kidding or being serious?

438
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,888
- No, there's a m-major audience.
- No, not the chanting,

439
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,890
but the audience part.
- Yeah, I'm serious.

440
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,391
- Oh gosh.
- So, when I heard that

441
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,934
I didn't wanna just call you and tell you.

442
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,519
I thought I'd come down and check on you,

443
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,272
and see if you were gonna
be okay with your anxiety.

444
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,983
- Oh, lovely.
- You're gonna do so great.

445
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:39,693
- Thank you.

446
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:42,321
- Oh, I see we brought
the champagne out already.

447
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,489
Do you want one of my beta-blockers?

448
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,950
- Oh, I love those.
- I know. They're really great.

449
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,786
I'm really lucky
because I get to spend a lot

450
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,456
of one-on-one time
with each one of my kids.

451
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:57,210
I know Khloé has a hard time
with her anxiety from time to time,

452
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,545
so I really wanted to be here today,

453
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:03,007
and just support her
and make her feel loved and special.

454
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:07,012
- It's hard to sit in this thing.
I didn't... plan for sitting.

455
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,599
- Maybe I can wheel you
out there on a little dolly?

456
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,893
- Yeah, okay, good. Perfect.
- Oh, jeez.

457
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,311
- You look so good.

458
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,481
I think any time that
you're in the public eye,

459
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:22,693
it just opens you up
for scrutiny and criticism

460
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:24,654
about every little thing.

461
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,740
And I think with Khloé,
she does internalize that,

462
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:32,745
and I think that you really have to have
tough, thick skin, which all of us have,

463
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:36,291
but every once in a while,
our emotions just get the best of us.

464
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:42,964
- Uh-oh. Hi! Come in for a hug!
- Am I all right to take this off?

465
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:46,342
- I'm really your guest!
- Oh, how are you?

466
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,718
How nice to see you.
- I missed you.

467
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,595
- And you.

468
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:50,388
Yeah, Khloé's gonna be great.

469
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,265
She had a little...
She was a little nervous,

470
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,267
but you're gonna make her feel like...
- You have nothing to be nervous about.

471
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,811
- I always get anxious. Not about you.
- Oh, you have nothing to be anxious.

472
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,312
- You've got this.
- No, it's always the aftermath

473
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,982
of, like, the Twitter
and all of that shit.

474
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,608
- Oh, that.
- I know.

475
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,111
- Why're you even looking at it?
- I don't!

476
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:08,239
It's the paparazzi that's like...

477
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,325
- I always get... It's just an anxiousness.
- Oh it, just everybody's...

478
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,368
- I know.

479
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,788
- But all you have to remember is
none of these things are about you.

480
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,164
Anybody that's like, "Ugh!"

481
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:20,168
it's only a representation
and a reflection of them.

482
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,836
- I know.
- That's it, that's it.

483
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,671
- You're so right.
- It's nothing to do with you.

484
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,256
- You're right.
- What somebody thinks of you

485
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,758
is none of your business.
- I'm just gonna start crying.

486
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,803
- And how can anyone
judge anyone when they don't know them?

487
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:35,349
- Yeah.
- So, you, you become
something else in their mind,

488
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,935
and at various points,
people just go, "Blah."

489
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,187
But it doesn't matter.

490
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:42,023
These words only exist
if I give them any power.

491
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:45,985
They only exist to me
if I allow them to penetrate my core.

492
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,904
- Right. You're right.

493
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:52,575
- Look, you're drinking champagne
at 4 P.M. on a Monday and you're at work.

494
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,202
- Yeah.
- We've won.

495
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,495
We've won.

496
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,706
- All right, I'll see you down there.
- That was awesome.

497
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,792
- That was a great motivational speech.
- Now, let's go out and it up!

498
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,921
- Let's go out and do
an endorsement for Candy Crush!
- Let's go it up! Yeah!

499
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:05,923
- Yeah!

500
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,133
- This speech just makes me,

501
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,511
it sounds so corny,
but, like, warm and fuzzy.

502
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:14,514
I feel understood because
I know he's talking to me,

503
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,849
but I know he's had
this talk with himself.

504
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,090
- That was so sweet.
- Oh my god, did somebody tape that?

505
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:23,815
Oh.
We need that on a loop.

506
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,234
They're ready whenever you are.

507
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,736
- Do they have the new script,
do you know?

508
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,577
- Let's do it.
- All right, let's go. This way.

509
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:48,256
Khloé, you're on in three, two, one.

510
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,467
Khloé Kardashian is on the show!

511
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:12,865
- I am really proud of myself
for constantly putting myself out there.

512
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,246
And I will say that Malika is 100% right,

513
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,457
and sometimes I do have
to tell people just to off.

514
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,628
So, so fun!

515
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,756
So, off.

516
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,384
- To you.
- To you. To us.

517
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,012
To us.

518
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,557
- That's another one in the can, guys.

519
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,699
- Kourtney?
- I'm outside!

520
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,119
- Outside? Okay.

521
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,704
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

522
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:05,041
- Everything looks so pretty.
- Oh my god, you haven't been here.

523
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,627
- What's goin' on? Uh, where's Reign?

524
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:10,087
- My kids aren't here today
'cause they're with Scott,

525
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,924
but Penelope will be here any minute.

526
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:16,178
- Okay.
How are your doctors going?

527
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,721
- Awful.
- What?

528
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,557
- Travis and I want to have a baby,

529
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:27,563
and so, my doctor took us
down this road of doing IVF,

530
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:32,985
and, like, it hasn't been
the most amazing experience.

531
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:38,449
Every single person on social media and...
Is always like, "Kourtney's pregnant.

532
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,077
Kourtney's pregnant.
Kourtney's gained so much weight."

533
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:43,496
And I'm like,
it's so rude to comment on people

534
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,166
when you have no idea what
they're actually going through.

535
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,835
The medication that
they've been giving me,

536
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:53,381
they put me into menopause because...
- Menopause?

537
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:59,012
- Literally into menopause, and so, I'm...
- Based off of what? A drug?

538
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:00,471
- Yes.

539
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:04,600
I think because I'm so clean and careful
with what I put into my body,

540
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,812
it's just, like, having
the complete opposite reaction,

541
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:12,775
and is working as a contraceptive
instead of helping us.

542
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:16,320
The medication basically, like,
put me into depression.

543
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,572
- I feel like I...

544
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:20,032
- I've been...
- I've never seen you happier,

545
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,451
so that would, you know,
that would supri...

546
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,287
The depression thing surprised me.

547
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:27,081
- And I have everything
in the world to be happy about.

548
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,708
I just feel...

549
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,252
- Yeah, physically. Yeah.
- A little bit off and not like myself.

550
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:36,258
Super moody and hormonal.
Like, I'm a lunatic half the time.

551
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,801
And...
- Okay, well, I gotta go.

552
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,346
- And that's it.
- I think I have an appointment.

553
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,266
Even though Kourtney
has three beautiful children,

554
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:48,728
it doesn't make it hurt any less

555
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:52,398
if you're trying to have a baby
and you've been struggling.

556
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,484
I'll tell you that I got pregnant

557
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,696
in 1994...
- Mm-hm.

558
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:03,034
- and had a miscarriage,
and my body entirely shut down.

559
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,453
- Mm-hm.
- It stopped making anything.

560
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:10,416
I was moody and depressed,
and, you know, my... I was bloated,

561
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,252
didn't feel well.
Everything you just described...

562
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,421
- Yeah.
- The exact same thing happened.

563
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:20,927
- I think that we want it so badly because
we want to make something together.

564
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:24,430
- Yeah, of course.
You wanna bring your own...

565
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,517
- Like our...
- baby, your own love into the world

566
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:31,020
in the way, you know,
that you know exactly how...

567
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:34,774
You both know how it feels to have a child
and how to bring a child into the world,

568
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,902
and now, you wanna do it
with the love of your life.

569
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,904
You'll have a beautiful baby.

570
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:42,950
Probably a year from now
we'll be sitting right here

571
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,993
and you'll be going...
- God willing.

572
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,871
- "Yeah, get the baby! It's crying!"

573
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:52,751
- God willing.
- That's right. You gotta claim that.

574
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:54,502
- Yep.

575
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,940
Isn't it beautiful?
The table's beautiful.

576
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,150
This would look good in your house.

577
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,361
Yeah, it would.

578
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:24,031
- This is one of my favorite places,
I think, in the whole universe.

579
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,742
Khloé and I are building homes
next door to each other.

580
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:29,996
They're still under construction,
but they're getting close,

581
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:34,208
so it's time to shop for rugs
and we're here at this fabulous store.

582
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:37,170
Oh my god, it's such
a different vibe than my rugs.

583
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,671
I love it.
- Yeah, very different.

584
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,090
- I'm a little jelly.
- What are your, \what are your rugs?

585
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:44,218
My rugs look like me... Vintage.

586
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,928
- Oh yeah, that's not my thing.
- Not your vibe.

587
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,931
No, but I will love to visit.

588
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,266
You look amazing.

589
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,561
- On every rug that you look at,
you have to do the roll test.

590
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,772
So, start at this end and roll that way.

591
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:59,233
So, do the roll test.
- Are you being serious?

592
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,319
- Yeah, you have to do...
- No, I'm wearing...

593
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,322
- You'll ruin your bun.
- My bun is, you know,

594
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:05,907
hairsprayed to the gods.

595
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:10,328
My mom, she will get down and dirty,
and she will do a carpet roll test.

596
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,623
She'll get down on her knees
and I'm sure do a handful of things,

597
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,209
but, you know, the roll test
is definitely one of them.

598
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,045
- You just have to lay here and just say,

599
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:22,757
"If I was laying on this carpet,
how would I feel?"

600
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:25,343
Look at the ceiling...

601
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,346
lay down and meditate.

602
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,307
Don't give me more anxiety.

603
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:36,771
How great was James Corden
the other night?

604
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:39,649
- It was good. I mean, it's always good
doing those shows.

605
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,193
It's just normally the aftermath
that, like, stresses me out.

606
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,820
- Did you see the tweets?

607
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,531
- No, I don't check the tweets.

608
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,158
- You don't check the tweets ever?

609
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,117
I have to read you a tweet...

610
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,953
- Oh no.
- 'cause it's really funny.

611
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:54,497
"Currently watching The Late Late Show.

612
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:57,709
Excited to see Khloé Kardashian
and get high."

613
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:01,963
People are getting high to you.
- Well, that's nice.

614
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,674
- I mean, everyone just tweeting
and tweeting and tweeting.

615
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,426
- It was fun. I mean, he has...
'Cause we... Talk shows...

616
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:10,847
Have... You haven't been allowed
to be a guest, for a while.

617
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,640
- We were doing Zooms for a year.
- Yeah.

618
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:16,269
- For him to choose you to be
the first one back for a live audience...

619
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,937
- That's nice.
- Is really special.

620
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,481
- Still get anxiety. It's not the host.

621
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:23,776
It's just normally the aftermath
and just hearing everyone's opinions.

622
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,528
And it... I don't like that. Like...

623
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,698
- Well, you just have to learn
when to tur... tune out the noise.

624
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,825
- Even, like, walking around here
and all the paparazzi,

625
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,578
I'm still thinking,
"God, and now, they're gonna..."

626
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:36,497
I don't know. You just, like...
If it's one wrong photo.

627
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:38,791
One thing... I'm sitting somewhere
and they get so...

628
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,668
It's like... Then they're like, "Ooh!

629
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:43,629
Look at her!"
It's, like, who said I had to be perfect?

630
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,298
Who said anything? Shut up.

631
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,924
- You are perfect to me.

632
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,968
- Thank you, but I don't care about that.
- But I'm your mommy.

633
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:50,720
- I don't even wanna be perfect.
- Listen...

634
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,722
- I like not being perfect.
- Do you remember in the beginning,

635
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,056
years and years and years ago,

636
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,601
we started filming
Keeping up with the Kardashians, right?

637
00:32:56,602 --> 00:33:00,563
Just all the wonderful things people said,
and how... what an inspiration we were,

638
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:02,565
and how they looked up to you girls.

639
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:06,360
And one person would write and go,

640
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,029
"Listen, you look fat today, bitch."

641
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,033
And that one person
would ruin your whole day.

642
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,785
- That's how it goes.
- And you had 5,000 people tell you

643
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,371
how fantastic they...
You know, that you are,

644
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:19,081
or they, they felt great about you.

645
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:22,376
All you can do is get up every single day
and do the best you can,

646
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:26,714
love really hard, take care of your kids
and your family, you know?

647
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:27,341
- Amen.

648
00:33:27,342 --> 00:33:29,717
- And I'm excited for you
to start a new chapter

649
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:31,219
in a new neighborhood,

650
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,681
in a beautiful brand-new house
that you designed yourself.

651
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:37,684
- It's gonna be healthy for me.

652
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,936
- I think.
- I think so, too.

653
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,395
- I'm so excited,

654
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,272
and...
- We're gonna have chickens.

655
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,357
We're gonna have...
- What?

656
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,943
We didn't build the chicken coop.
- Oh, we didn't?

657
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,028
- No, they smell,
we decided at the end of the day.

658
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,073
- Oh, okay.
We're gonna have the time of our lives.

659
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:53,242
- I'm excited.
- I know.

660
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:17,139
- We are doing our first days of our promo
photoshoots at Saturday Night Live.

661
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,933
- Is she dressed? Can we go in there?
- She is dressed.

662
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:21,294
Let me just ch... Let me... We'll check.
- Okay, yeah. Okay.

663
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:39,954
- It's pretty crazy.
I had my first table read yesterday

664
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,914
and we read, like, 40 or 50 scripts.

665
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,833
I've never done a table read before.

666
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:46,961
Everyone just started picking it up
and reading them so fast,

667
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:50,256
and people were having accents
and different, you know, energy,

668
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,719
and I had... but I'm in every single skit
of what they presented.

669
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,471
Hello?

670
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,068
- Yeah, and I... we already invited him.
I feel bad.

671
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,905
- I would totally disinvite for you.

672
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:20,620
- There's one pre-taped skit
that they wanted you and Khloé in,

673
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,496
but I think that it could
be Mom and Khloé,

674
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,581
and they're gonna make it in time.

675
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,000
They're gonna leave...
like a few hours earlier

676
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:27,835
just to get here in time and do that.

677
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,837
And it's honestly...
I think it's funnier when it's,

678
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,174
like, the cast playing us.

679
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,857
- Yeah, no, I totally get that.

680
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,741
- All right, well, I love you
and I'll call you later.

681
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,535
- Okay, bye.

682
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,914
- How did your lunch
with Amy go yesterday?

683
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:06,624
It wasn't a lunch, but it was so good.

684
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,001
She's just so supportive, you know?

685
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,671
- What was her feedback on the monologue?
- She's just so funny.

686
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:13,882
Like, even when I hear her talk,

687
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,676
it's just, like... It makes me wanna laugh.

688
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,928
Just hearing her voice and her tone.
- Yeah.

689
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,289
And then, what about the sex tape?
Are you gonna address it?

690
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,725
- I mean, I think I wanna say something.

691
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:28,229
I think I've been in this game
long enough to know

692
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,189
that, like, you just have to be yourself.

693
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,860
So, I wanna say things that feel
good coming out of my mouth,

694
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:36,863
and that, like, are things
I would, actually, say.

695
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:40,741
And so, I'm gonna s... just go
with my gut and stick with it,

696
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:43,954
and do exactly what
I had planned on doing.

697
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,332
- Are you feeling anxious?
- I feel a little bit anxious right now.

698
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,251
I've been to SNL before,

699
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:53,754
but only, obviously, with Kanye
as, like, a musical guest.

700
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:56,382
I've never seen what
it's like to be a host.

701
00:36:56,383 --> 00:37:00,261
I have to work a twenty-three-
and-a-half-hour day tomorrow.

702
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,930
I've never done that in my life, you guys.
I've never pulled an all-nighter.

703
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,600
No one gives you a second to breathe.
There's no lunch break.

704
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:08,186
Like, you just have
to take a bite of pizza.

705
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:10,438
Eat along the way.
Like, there's no breaks.

706
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:12,940
There's no nothing
Like, there's no time.

707
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:16,236
I've never experienced
anything like this before.

708
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,448
Three, two.

709
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,074
- Hi, I'm Kim Kardashian West,

710
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:25,578
and I'm hosting SNL this week
with musical guest Halsey.

711
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,955
- So, Kim, are you nervous
about doing sketch comedy?

712
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:30,416
- Why, I don't have
to write sketches, do I?
- No.

713
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,542
- Memorize lines?
- No.

714
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:32,627
- They're on cue cards.

715
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:34,253
- Everyone else won't look
as good as me, will they?

716
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,505
- No, absolutely not.

717
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:37,965
- I just wanna make sure
that I focus enough

718
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,092
to do a really good job on SNL.

719
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:42,136
- Isn't this like a pinch
yourself moment, though?

720
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,763
Just remembering how far you've come.

721
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,306
I mean, there was
a moment where you, literally,

722
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,141
could not even get a fashion show invite.

723
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,936
- It's either flip-flops or Uggs
with a Juicy sweatsuit,

724
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,437
or a dress and heels.

725
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:53,022
- And 'member when your dream was like,

726
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:56,025
"I wanna be on the cover of Cosmo,"
and your publicist was like,

727
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,028
"Dream realistically."
- Yeah.

728
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,196
- And now you're hosting
Saturday Night Live.

729
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,865
- Yeah, no. That's, like, so crazy.

730
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,701
- During the part when I looked
on the screen and you were like,

731
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,954
"I'm Kim Kardashian West
and I'm hosting Saturday Night Live,"

732
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:09,539
I, literally, just started bawling

733
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,416
'cause I remember,
like, 12 or 13 years ago,

734
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,794
when you were going on, like,
your first talk show, like as a guest,

735
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,128
and you, you were so excited,

736
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,340
and I got that vision,
and it's like, "Oh my god."

737
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,633
I was so proud of you.

738
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:23,846
- Don't make me cry before I go on camera.

739
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:27,515
- Okay, I'm crying.
- Oh my gosh. It's so true, though.

740
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:30,352
It's so true.
Like, I literally got that vision.

741
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,981
Like, Saturday Night Live.
I'm just like, "Whoa."

742
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:35,983
I love you.

743
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,569
Seeing Mario be really emotional

744
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,906
just reminds me of when his agency
told him not to work with me

745
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,825
'cause I was "just a reality star,"

746
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,618
and that, like, I wasn't going anywhere,

747
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,746
and he was never gonna have a career
if he was my makeup artist,

748
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:53,666
and he told them, basically,
to, like, go themselves.

749
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,169
I get what he's saying, and I feel it.

750
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,045
I just, like, can't really cry
'cause I have makeup on.

751
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:01,300
So, I'm just not gonna
go there, but I feel it.

752
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:05,136
It's really, really crazy.

753
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,929
Don't make me cry.
- I know.

754
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,432
- I'm like, "I can't."

755
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,068
- I am.

756
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,238
- I'm studying a little bit,
and I have to read my monologue,

757
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,325
so I'm just tryna do flashcards,
read my monologue.

758
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:32,914
Today, we had to be here at 5:30 A.M.
and I can't leave until 3:00 A.M.,

759
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:36,501
so it's, literally, almost a 24-hour day.

760
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:40,087
I was so tired this morning
doing one of the scenes,

761
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:41,255
and it was a pre-tape.

762
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:44,217
"All right, fine.
You can divorce me, but I need a lawyer.

763
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,135
Will you be my lawyer, fam?"

764
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,720
"No, Kanye."
"Fine.

765
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,847
Then you're not getting a penny, sorry."

766
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,641
"I have the prenup right here."

767
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:54,602
I'm always afraid
of hurting people's feelings,

768
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,771
and I would never go in there

769
00:39:56,772 --> 00:40:00,483
making fun of, especially,
like, the father of my kids.

770
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,152
And it doesn't mean that
because we didn't work out

771
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:06,948
that we don't have, like, a great
love and respect for each other.

772
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,617
The divorce is so sensitive for him,

773
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,537
and so, I'm already saying
that part in the monologue.

774
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,748
I don't wanna, like, make...

775
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,166
I just... Like, like,
maybe I could talk to Chris

776
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,668
and we could think
of something, like, funny,

777
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,669
and I could just tell him, like,

778
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,796
"Hey, this is super sensitive to him."

779
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:24,006
I know he'd wanna be a part of it.

780
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:26,384
I'm just saying... 'cause he'd love it,

781
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:27,802
but I just don't wanna like...
- Yeah, it shouldn't be dis...

782
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,679
It shouldn't, It shouldn't
be disrespectful to him.

783
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,930
So, so how 'bout this?

784
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,307
Let's put it on its feet,
see what it feels like,

785
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:36,018
and just know that we...
This is not unusual for us

786
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,688
to make line changes, lift things out.

787
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,525
Um, so let's... Let me get the writers
and we'll work on that one.

788
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:59,458
We are so excited to be in New York City.

789
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,044
We just are so happy
to be here to support Kim.

790
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,255
You know what?
I just wanna talk to you for two seconds...

791
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,673
- Okay, I'm just saying hi to my daughter.

792
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,092
- No, I'm just, I'm just
on a deadline here.

793
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:10,512
I just have two sec...
Can we call her right back?

794
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:14,515
- Oh, I, I love you, baby.
Gimme a kiss and I'm gonna go.

795
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:19,437
- Sir, can I ask you to leave
us alone for five minutes?

796
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:22,440
I just wanna do something real quick.
Thank you.

797
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,234
- When my mom wants
the driver out of the car

798
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,069
and to have a private conversation,

799
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,322
there's normally only a handful of things

800
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:31,240
that play through my head.

801
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,867
Did somebody up?

802
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:35,620
Somebody's pregnant, there's a crisis.

803
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:36,871
Bye, baby.

804
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:38,289
'Kay, here we go.

805
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,709
Is his window rolled up?
- Yes, but the trunk is open.

806
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,252
- Close the trunk!

807
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:47,883
- So... you're yelling at a guy...
- Close the trunk!

808
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,054
- Excuse me, sir, would you mind
closing the trunk for a moment?

809
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:54,473
Thank you so much.

810
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,935
It's not what you say,
it's how you say it.

811
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,062
- Hi.

812
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,023
- Hi.
- Hi.

813
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,901
- So, I think we secured
the date you wanted.

814
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,653
- Really?
- Yeah, and I thought, maybe,

815
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,864
you could tell Khloé why you...

816
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,866
Maybe, want us to all be
available next weekend.

817
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,661
- Don't even do this to me.
My heart is racing.

818
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:22,291
So, yeah, the 17th is
the first day we ever hung out.

819
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:27,797
Like I told your mom, I've been, like,
madly in love with Kourtney forever,

820
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,217
and I believe she's my soulmate.

821
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,928
And I would like to propose...
- Oh my god, I'm gonna cry.

822
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:38,934
To her on the day that I met her,
or the day that I first was with her.

823
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:43,688
- Oh my god, I'm literally crying.
- I'm crying all over again.

824
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:46,774
Oh my god.
- Oh my god, I'm so happy for you guys.

825
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:50,319
- So, he called me last night
and he said, "I'd really like to..."

826
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,989
Oh my god. I'm so happy.

827
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:56,493
Ugh, just 'cause Kourt
is gonna be so happy.

828
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,912
I do not cry,
and I'm crying 'cause I'm happy,

829
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:02,165
and that's, like, really
weird for me.

830
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:06,169
I don't really experience happy crying.

831
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,797
I don't know.
When I got engaged, I don't think I cried.

832
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:13,718
Oh my god, I can't handle this.
- He's, he's coming next weekend

833
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,178
to do Saturday Night Live,

834
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,722
and he bought her a ring
from Lorraine Schwartz...

835
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,765
- Oh my god!
- And the ring is ready.

836
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,893
And they're gonna fly
home Sunday morning...

837
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:24,562
- I'm having a panic attack, like...
- and thought we could all

838
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:26,814
be there to share.
- Oh my god.

839
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,942
Yeah, I'm trying to, like...
Yeah, I think Santa Barbara's so good

840
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:32,820
' cause we go often
and she wouldn't suspect...

841
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:35,781
Like, and if you guys were all there,
that's the surprise.

842
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,742
So, we, literally, land the 17th.

843
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:40,870
- We're so happy, we're so happy.
- Oh my god. I'm so happy,

844
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:44,373
and I'm so happy to have you
be a part of our family and everything,

845
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:47,460
and we love you, and oh my god.

846
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:50,588
- Thank you. I lo... I love your
guys' family, and I love Kourt,

847
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:55,593
and... I've never felt better,
more sure about anything in my life, so.

848
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:59,805
- To have this secret between
me and Khloé now, and Travis,

849
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:03,392
is really special for us
because we're so excited.

850
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:08,439
One of the biggest things
in her life... is about to happen,

851
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,733
and Kourtney has no idea.

852
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:14,363
- Woo! Bye, Trav.
- Bye.

853
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:20,117
- I am not even so... You know I don't...
- Isn't that the most amazing news...

854
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:23,412
- Oh my god. I'm just so happy
'cause she's never wanted

855
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:28,251
to get married or anything like that,
and I know she does now with him.

856
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,378
I know, I know. It's really exciting.
- And oh my god, I'm just gonna...

857
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:31,671
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

858
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:33,841
- Okay, we can go.
- I'm so excited.

859
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:37,261
- Amazing.
- I know, isn't it crazy?

860
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:40,888
- Next on The Kardashians...

861
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:46,103
- Today is the day that I am
hosting Saturday Night Live.

862
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:50,983
All right, it's happening.

863
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,991
- Travis came to see me
and he asked for her hand in marriage.

864
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,368
- Is Scott gonna lose his shit?

865
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:05,621
- I'm just worried that they're
gonna see you guys on the freeway.

866
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:08,666
- My mom would be so pissed if Kylie and I
were the ones to ruin the surprise.

867
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:12,211
- You guys get off on the same exit
and it's a red light, you're screwed.

868
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:13,838
You'll be at the same exit.

869
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,089
- Ooh shit.
- Oh shit.

870
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,049
- Oh shit.

871
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,050
Oh shit.
