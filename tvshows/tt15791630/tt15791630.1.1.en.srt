Guys, come on.

6
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,281
We have to go to Kim's. Let's go.

7
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,867
<i>Put your pretty-ass lips together
Blow it real nice for me</i>

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,035
<i>Real nice for me</i>

00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,787
<i>Yeah, I'm tryna hit a lick</i>

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>And slide to the dealership

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,292
<i>Why?</i>

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,086
You guys wanna go to the barbecue?
Yeah!

13
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,881
<i>They not gon' believe me
But check the recordin'</i>

<i>Now we makin' money</i>

00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,473
KHLOÉ: Hi.
<i>Hey.</i>

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,933
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,186
I'm at the new house
and the construction is almost finished.

19
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,479
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,691
<i>Amazing. I'm so happy for you.
Can't wait to see it.</i>

21
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,443
<i>'Cause I'm 'bout to go all in</i>

22
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,528
<i>Why?</i>

23
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,822
<i>I can see the champagne fallin'</i>

24
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>I got bills to pay, but bills can wait</i>

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,284
<i>Ah, we ballin'</i>

26
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,421
Hey, Mom.
I'm not feeling too great,

27
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,172
so I don't think
I'm gonna make it today.

28
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>Oh, no. I'm so sorry, honey.</i>

29
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,014
Kylie Cosmetics, how can I help you?

30
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,851
<i>Yes, I'm faded, pupils dilated</i>

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,395
<i>But the man in the mirror sayin',
"Go on, get your paper"</i>

32
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,314
Okay, Kenny, I'll check on you later.

33
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,067
I have to go leave for the barbecue,
or I'll be late.

34
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,486
Kylie, we gotta go.

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,321
I think I'm gonna be late.

36
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,031
<i>Let's go</i>

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,867
<i>Oh, whatever you wanna do, baby</i>

38
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,911
<i>I got ya, I got ya</i>

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,746
<i>Oh, my God</i>

40
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,082
<i>Silk Sonic</i>

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,211
<i>This the big one
You gotta trust your gut</i>

42
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,130
Kylie, let's go. Gotta get to Kim's,
I don't wanna be late.

43
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,215
All right.

44
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>Pretty mother with some money to blow</i>

45
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,970
<i>I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas
after this roll</i>

46
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,430
<i>I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas
after this roll</i>

47
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,931
<i>Come on, 7-7-7</i>

48
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,892
Okay, I have to go meet my family now.

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>7-7-7, let's go</i>

50
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,195
Yeah, I like all of these.

51
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,613
<i>Woo</i>

52
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,616
<i>They can't deal with me, I swear to God</i>

53
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,815
I love that slide... Yeah.

54
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,360
And ball pit situation.
I want to own that.

55
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,112
Do you want it?

56
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,822
If it was a different color.

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,035
<i>It's fun to start
with a clean slate.</i>

58
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,580
<i>I feel like we've had so much time
off filming that we've, kind of,</i>

59
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,500
<i>gone into our own worlds
and done our own thing.</i>

60
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,172
I hate talking about myself,
but I'm two years into school.

61
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,634
<i>I am literally just studying
for the bar.</i>

62
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,470
I'm really working on law school,
SKIMS, and being a mom.

63
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,306
- Mommy.
- Yeah?

64
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,767
- Here, Mommy.
- Okay. I got it, okay?

65
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>I've just been in, like,
mom mode, carpool mode...</i>

66
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,566
Do you want to go with Dad
to the Grammys and be his date?

67
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,819
<i>Just getting it all together
at the house.</i>

68
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,572
You want to swap?

69
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,116
Okay, there might be one more.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,325
We're working on whining,

71
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,495
but let's go inside
'cause you're really hot.

72
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,872
Yeah?

73
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,168
Whoo! Was it fun?

74
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,836
No? Okay.

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,337
<i>To me, that's what's so exciting.</i>

76
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,507
<i>It's just that side of our lives
that people don't see.</i>

77
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:23,053
Like, I cleaned out the playroom today,
like, that kind of stuff gets me...

78
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,516
makes me horny to literally clean out
my playroom. I'm insane.

79
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:31,228
Like, any mom will get that.
Like, if you have a clean playroom,

80
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,606
oh, my God, like,
you can sleep at night.

81
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,149
<i>Oh, here's Mom.</i>

82
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,744
- Hey, you look nice.
- Thank you.

83
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,204
Are you gonna do fine?

84
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,334
You have a very busy schedule.

85
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,462
Do you know that your schedule
is busier than my schedule?

86
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,466
I've been pretty busy
since you last saw us.

87
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,760
<i>I get up at four o'clock every morning.</i>

88
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,224
How can people
not answer their phone at 7:00 a.m.?

89
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,184
It's, like, it's almost lunchtime.

90
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,438
<i>I'm a mom, I'm a grandmother,
I'm running businesses.</i>

91
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,315
<i>There's Kylie Cosmetics.</i>

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,899
<i>And there's Kylie Skin.</i>

93
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,027
<i>Kylie Baby, SKIMS, Good American, 818,</i>

94
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,780
KKW Fragrance,

95
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,157
Arthur George, the hot sauce company.

96
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,659
Halfway Dead, Safely.

97
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,579
Can just one person
be lazy in this family?

98
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,622
Oh! What did I leave out?

99
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,957
Probably something.

100
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,669
- Cheers, babe. Here's to season...
- 92.

101
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,962
A new chapter.

102
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,341
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

103
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,010
- Hi.
- Look at you, cutie.

104
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,764
Oh, look at her. You look so cute.

105
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,266
You left without me?

106
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,392
- What?
- No.

107
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,559
- Hmm.
- What?

108
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,311
You just made it really obvious.

109
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,522
- That what?
- I know what you're having.

110
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,857
Everyone just knows what I'm having.

111
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,818
- It's so crazy.
- Why did she make it obvious?

112
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,779
- I didn't do shit.
- I can now see her belly.

113
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,155
My belly looks the same.

114
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:09,077
<i>I am very excited to have another baby.</i>

115
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,121
I'm almost six months now.

116
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,835
For right now, we are keeping the gender
just between Travis and I.

117
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,798
<i>We're just waiting for the right moment
to tell everyone in a special way.</i>

118
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,049
I think it's a boy.

119
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,468
- You're skinnier this way.
- Oh.

120
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,886
You're prettier...

121
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,723
- How could she get any prettier?
- Than you were last time.

122
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,019
Like the girls take the beauty
to give it to themselves.

123
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,314
The boys, like, know what's up,
and they just, like,

124
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,066
let you be a little bit prettier.

125
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,568
<i>My whole life is so public.</i>

126
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,946
My pregnancy is really public this time.

127
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,283
<i>To have something between
just Travis and I feels really special.</i>

128
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,412
It's just fun keeping that to ourselves.

129
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,497
These kids.
Everyone in this family

130
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:59,001
takes a secret so seriously.
They're so committed.

131
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,424
Khloé's here.

132
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,677
Hi. You look fab.

133
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,596
I'm so happy Tristan's here.

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,515
Why did I think you were
at basketball already?

135
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,726
No. Sunday.

136
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,811
Glad you're here.

137
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,897
Right now,
Tristan and I are just friends,

138
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,108
and I love our relationship
that him and I have.

139
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,110
<i>But my biggest focus</i>

140
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,447
<i>is being a mom
to my beautiful angel, True.</i>

141
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,116
Okay, I'll get it for you.

142
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,952
Tristan.

143
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,584
Let's rub our bellies.
I don't have one anymore.

144
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,587
The food looks amazing, if I do say so.

145
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,258
I think I want regular fries
and chicken nuggets.

146
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,427
- I'll have regular fries too.
- A little more fries, yeah.

147
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,595
Thank you.

148
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,806
I'm a vegan most of the time.

149
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,476
Ninety-eight percent of the time.

150
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,520
But today, I'm...

151
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,355
going wild.

152
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,357
I'm just, like,
living a dream over here.

153
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,026
KHLOÉ: Yeah, this is
a pregnant woman's dream.

154
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,111
Dream.

155
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,822
Travis? Yeah.

156
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,866
Travis and Auntie Kourtney are coming?

157
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,745
Guys!

158
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,456
There they are.

159
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,832
There they are.

160
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,419
- Talk about short shorts.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

161
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,505
- Hi.
- Hi.

162
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,050
Living my life without cameras
was an absolute dream.

163
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,303
I've been spending
a lot of time with my kids,

164
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,932
and I've just, like, let life unfold.

165
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,933
So...

166
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,520
Travis is my boyfriend.

167
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,149
<i>Our homes are a block away
from each other.</i>

168
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,986
<i>He was one of my closest friends
for probably eight years.</i>

169
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,780
We used to work out together
all the time,

170
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,366
just us doing stuff on a friend level.

171
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,868
We could just be ourselves.

172
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,622
We fell in love, and now,
he's my boyfriend.

173
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,003
This is a relationship

174
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,338
that I don't think anybody saw coming

175
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,508
because they've known each other for
so long and they were such good friends.

176
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,261
I definitely saw this coming.

177
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:18,140
For years, we have been telling Kourtney
that her and Travis should hook up.

178
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,186
They are so happy, seem so in love,

179
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,649
and never stop making out,
by the way, like ever.

180
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,532
- What?
- How're we gonna stop...

181
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,284
Who made that?

182
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,372
- Who made that? Who is it?
- I don't know.

183
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,790
Let me see.

184
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,543
Click on it.

185
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,756
Hold on.

186
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,718
Khloé, look at this.

187
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,302
What? Let me see.

188
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,013
I could put a pillow in the chair.

189
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,599
Khloé, come here. I feel like you're
the only one that would understand.

190
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,185
- Okay, I'm coming.
- I'm not sure what this means.

191
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,855
This is a character in <i>Roblox,</i>
but it says...

192
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,275
- What?
- I know. That's why I said...

193
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,487
- Oh, it's a game?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,074
Well, then, we're suing them
if it's a game with my name and picture.

195
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,785
There was a picture of my cry face,
and then I looked at it

196
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,621
and it said something
super inappropriate

197
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,749
like "Kim's new sex tape."

198
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,711
No, it was an inappropriate thing that
popped up on his <i>Roblox</i> about me.

199
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,633
That says they're leaking
something that someone said.

200
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,553
<i>This is supposed to be
unreleased footage from my old sex tape.</i>

201
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,472
The last thing that I want as a mom

202
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,269
is for my past to be brought up...
20 years later,

203
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,690
<i>especially when it's this big party
and my whole family's here.</i>

204
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,485
This is some real embarrassing shit,
and I need to deal with it.

205
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,362
And I will deal with it.

206
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,948
I just cannot believe
this is happening right now.

207
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,965
Okay, let's go outside.

208
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,050
Come on, little lovebirds.

209
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,886
You can make out out there by the table.

210
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,639
- We're sitting here.
- This is you, babe.

211
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,018
Kendall's not here because
she's just got the flu or something.

212
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,109
Hey, I actually didn't have the flu.
I had COVID, and it sucked.

213
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,068
But, you know what?

214
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,529
You're going to get me
for the rest of the season anyways.

215
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,699
And I will be here. So don't you worry.

216
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,245
Guys, can you believe
that this is day one?

217
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,832
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I can. Look at all the cameras.

218
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,750
This is day one.

219
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,835
I know.
I have a little anxiety about it.

220
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:52,919
You do?

221
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,796
Just like what the
are we doing again?

222
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,049
Yeah, same.

223
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,176
You're going to be good.
Just suck it up, honey.

224
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,385
Oh, I'm always good.

225
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,430
So, guys, Mom and I
had lunch the other day

226
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,557
with Lorne Michaels from <i>SNL...</i>

227
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,351
- Yeah.
- And they asked me to host it.

228
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,812
- And so...
- That is huge!

229
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,398
- But did you say yeah?
- I said yes.

230
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,275
Wait. Are you listening to this?

231
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,945
- No. Sorry.
- Your sister's going to host <i>SNL,</i>

232
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,489
<i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

233
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,240
- Super.
- From New York.

234
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,076
What day is it on?

235
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,079
Everyone around me
is like, "You have to do this."

236
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,247
And I get it. It's so cool.

237
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,959
<i>But I always put myself in these
situations that I think I'm fulfilling</i>

238
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,922
<i>other people's dreams, honestly,
of, like, my mom's. I...</i>

239
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,468
don't know why I did
<i>Dancing with the Stars.</i> I sucked.

240
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,345
You just have to come out
and sell it and sizzle.

241
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,429
And you didn't.

242
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,099
Absolutely sucked.
That's just so not me.

243
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,685
If you know me, like, I... It's not me.

244
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,354
- I'm just not funny like that.
- You are funny.

245
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,732
- It's just...
- You are funny. Timing is everything.

246
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,941
But you are funny.

247
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,402
We've always told you you're not.
But you really are.

248
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,071
You really are.
You're more funny than you can dance.

249
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,824
- Just look at it on the bright side.
- Good. Yeah.

250
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,911
Khloé and I are known
to be the funny ones.

251
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,790
But Kim's related to us.
So, I think she can be funny.

252
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,918
I think she has it in her.

253
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,504
- But also...
- I'm kind of going back and forth,

254
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,716
like, since Kanye's album is out,
do I want him to be my...

255
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,135
That would be epic
if, like, he was my musical guest.

256
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,595
But then, do I want my own moment?

257
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,974
Kanye and I are still going
through a divorce now.

258
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,144
<i>We're just trying to figure it out,</i>

259
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,438
how to be good parents
to our kids together,

260
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,231
how to be good friends to each other.

261
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,818
Ultimate goal, no matter what,
is just happiness and following that,

262
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,069
whatever that looks like.

263
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,446
I think, have your own moment

264
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,116
because I think you'd rely on him
for the comfort, right?

265
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,329
This is my first time,
and I kind of want this to be about me,

266
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,123
and not about how are they
going to act to each other?

267
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,500
I mean, I just can't
embarrass us, you guys.

268
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,253
You've embarrassed us before.
It's fine. It doesn't matter.

269
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,465
They haven't announced it yet.
I wonder if I could still pull out.

270
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,301
You're not going to embarrass us.
You're going to be amazing.

271
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,469
I don't know.

272
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,723
Are you sticking to the table?
- Yeah.

273
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,808
See you.

274
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,939
<i>I'm not sure Kourtney really
has a type, but if she does,</i>

275
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,274
it's definitely Travis.

276
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,694
<i>I'd watch them come to a decision</i>

277
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,406
over something as simple as a dessert.

278
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,241
Like, "Okay, babe,
what kind of dessert do you want?"

279
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,161
"I don't know, babe.
What kind of dessert do you want?"

280
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,663
"Babe, I don't know.
Do you want the apple tart?"

281
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,042
"I don't know. Do you want the choc...
What do you think we should do?"

282
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,251
Like, 15 minutes.

283
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,213
I'm like, "For God's sake,
just pick a dessert. Get both."

284
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,219
<i>You probably won't find me
straddling Corey every five minutes.</i>

285
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,930
Maybe after a drink, but...

286
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,348
I'm going to get a burger.

287
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,063
<i>Kourtney has just been
in this amazing relationship.</i>

288
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,941
It's like the first time
that I've seen her happy,

289
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,568
<i>I'm so happy for this win for her</i>

290
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,487
<i>because she really deserves it.</i>

291
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,281
So wait. No one invited Scott?

292
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,159
I don't know. I didn't invite him.
You didn't ask Kourt?

293
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,161
No. I just honestly forgot.

294
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,705
- KHLOÉ: I didn't even think about it.
- I didn't either.

295
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,499
Does that make us awful human beings

296
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,376
that were, like,
going on with our lives?

297
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,837
- I don't think so.
- Everything that he... Thank you.

298
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,797
Everything that he was always afraid of.

299
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,216
"I don't have any family
and you're my only family."

300
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,677
- It came true.
- And now, it's coming true.

301
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,512
<i>Hold on, guys.</i>

302
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,598
Scott and I have been
broken up for seven years,

303
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,185
and I gave him 10 years before that.

304
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,605
So, like, why is everyone making
such a big deal about this?

305
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,109
Let's just not hate on a girl
who finally knows what she deserves.

306
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,027
So, he doesn't know about this at all?

307
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,988
I don't think so. Who would've told him?

308
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,115
Anyhow, one way to find out.

309
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,409
Oh, man.
- So, Reigny, come here.

310
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,661
When you go home, does your dad
ask you what you did?

311
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,414
Is he like, "Oh, Reign,
what did you do tonight?"

312
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,749
No, he doesn't say anything.

313
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,796
I think that your dad's so tired. So,
no need to tell him what we did tonight.

314
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,589
Okay?

315
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,092
Cool. We have an understanding.

316
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,221
What are you doing? You are so cute.

317
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,390
Can I eat you?

318
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,892
You're already eating.

319
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,185
I'mma punch the camera.

320
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,730
Hey, you can't.

321
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,203
Yo, what up, Mase. My main man.

322
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,084
So, this is probably the first time

323
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,628
in 15 years...

324
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,589
that we've had
a really, really long break

325
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,342
from having cameras
follow our every move.

326
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,469
And I think it got a little lonely.

327
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,974
KHLOÉ: <i>Scott and I are incredibly close,</i>

328
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,854
but I guess I just don't know
what Scott I'm going to receive today.

329
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>I think I'm just prepared for anything.</i>

330
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,192
Lord?
Khloverton!

331
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,862
- I missed this place and I missed you.
- Oh, Khloé.

332
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,490
KHLOÉ: <i>We did not always have
a great relationship.</i>

333
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,951
I have gone to anger management
over Scott.

334
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,205
But, somehow,
Scott and I became like besties,

335
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,249
and he really is like a brother to me.

336
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,835
God must have
broke the mold when he made you.

337
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,128
Just hoping.

338
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,673
Get these cameras out of here
and we'll go upstairs, then.

339
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,302
That being said, he does
speak to me maybe a little more...

340
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,263
flirty than my real brother does.

341
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,098
The whole thing's weird.

342
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,975
- Salud.
- Salud.

343
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,685
So, where's your head at with Kourt?

344
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:48,067
Honestly, I think for, like,
the first time, probably in my life,

345
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,820
it's finally starting to change.

346
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,783
Now that Kourtney's got her life
with Travis, like...

347
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,953
As hard as it is, it does give me

348
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,790
a place to finally be able to move on.

349
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,917
Do you genuinely think
that you would be open

350
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,046
to a real loving relationship?

351
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,717
So, if I want to find somebody real...

352
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,468
- Yeah.
- And serious,

353
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,138
and someone I'm gonna
actually spend my life with,

354
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,392
- it would have to be somebody...
- More age-appropriate?

355
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,062
Yeah, like, you know...

356
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,980
- Upward of 20s.
- 21?

357
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,733
When you're with an equal,
you have to go back and forth.

358
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,901
They challenge you. Yeah.

359
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,612
I think that's a big step for me,
but not over 30.

360
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,616
Or fine... Whatev...
30 over... I don't care. Whatever it is.

361
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,703
If I love somebody,
doesn't matter their age.

362
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,166
Not sure about that.

363
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,710
Did you know about
the barbecue at Kim's house?

364
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,466
Nah. A little bit because I think
one of the kids said something,

365
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,177
which the kids always
kind of tell me everything.

366
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,763
Feeling left out
and not being told anything

367
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,390
- is super hurtful...
- Sucks.

368
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:06,186
Especially when I don't have
another family to go to.

369
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,690
But I have a question.
Do you think you can handle

370
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,776
being around Kourt
and her new boyfriend?

371
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,488
I'd rather be around them
and be around my family than not at all.

372
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,700
I will say, at the barbecue
when you weren't there,

373
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,579
I was almost like it's probably best
because it was so small and intimate,

374
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,540
- and they're very lovey-dovey...
- Right.

375
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,752
That I don't know
if that's so comfortable for you.

376
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:35,757
I thought it almost did you a favor by
not having to see that so face-to-face.

377
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,095
Oh, everyone knows he's still in love
with Kourtney. It's not a secret.

378
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,848
But this is 100%
the happiest I've seen Kourtney.

379
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,437
<i>I know how much Travis
and Kourtney love each other.</i>

380
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,608
And that has to be hard
for anyone to process,

381
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,944
especially when everything is so public.

382
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,446
I think maybe she's uncomfortable
and doesn't know what to say

383
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,198
because I know she does love you

384
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,493
and want to
not have this uncomfortableness.

385
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,539
You know, I always had
her friends or our family

386
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,501
in my ear, kind of like,
"Don't worry, honey."

387
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,421
Like, "Eventually,
you guys will figure it out

388
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,799
- "and you'll get back together one day."
- Yeah.

389
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,511
So, my foot was always
halfway in the door.

390
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,973
<i>It was a huge adjustment
losing Kourtney romantically.</i>

391
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,352
But now it's becoming a huge adjustment
losing her as kind of a best friend.

392
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,773
Now we're really just
more of co-parenters.

393
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,860
I would say it's probably one
of the more difficult things in my life.

394
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,739
Listen, at the end of the day,
I understand what the bigger picture is,

395
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,783
what would be best for Kourtney.

396
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,247
She's happy. She's... in a real thing,
and I believe that's true.

397
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,709
Because I also felt like
I did so much wrong to her

398
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,003
- over so many years that...
- You felt guilty.

399
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,464
I felt super guilty,
and I always felt like

400
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,468
if she ever needed me
for any reason whatsoever,

401
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:05,513
I'd be there to make it up to her
because of how bad I was for so long.

402
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:10,560
Kourtney has all right
to despise me and the way I treated her

403
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,647
because it was horrible,
like that wouldn't go on today

404
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,276
for a day, but it went on for years.

405
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:22,030
Do you mind if I talk
about this with Kourtney,

406
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,741
- or would you rather I stay out of it?
- Not at all.

407
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,950
No, stay in it.

408
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,246
- All I need is just to be acknowledged.
- Right.

409
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,540
Do I even mean anything to anyone?

410
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,219
Hi, guys.
- Hi.

411
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,682
No kissing.

412
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,893
You should ride
your mom's new bike.

413
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,354
This bike is kind of hard to ride.

414
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,940
I love going to Travis's studio.

415
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,900
<i>It is like a happy place for him.</i>

416
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,488
<i>We ride bikes and we play ping pong.
It feels like home.</i>

417
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,783
- I'm stealing some of your juice, baby.
- I don't think you'll like it.

418
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,911
I like that you think you know
if I'm going to like it or not.

419
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,956
I was definitely
always attracted to Travis.

420
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,292
<i>I just think it was
the right time in my life.</i>

421
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,795
<i>I had taken, like, a year to myself.</i>

422
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:23,925
But my closest best friends have always
said, "You have to hook up with Travis."

423
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,010
Okay.

424
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,387
<i>We would almost play house</i>

425
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,598
<i>because we would do things
together with our kids,</i>

426
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,226
<i>we would go to museums and go to church,</i>

427
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,896
<i>and last year, during the pandemic,
we were texting,</i>

428
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:41,818
and so, I just put it out there
like flirtatious conversation.

429
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,447
- You've been practicing, baby?
- No.

430
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,034
<i>Finally, I think, once I made it known,</i>

431
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,453
he asked me to watch a movie,

432
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,081
and the whole movie,
he didn't make a move.

433
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,084
Me. I did.

434
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,961
He was taking a long time.

435
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,088
The movie was over,
and then, I was like...

436
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,632
we started another movie,
and I was like,

437
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,051
"I don't have time
for this movie marathon,"

438
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,929
so, I made the first move.

439
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,140
You just do whatever you want,
and then I'll do whatever I want.

440
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,154
No.

441
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,574
A drum battle.
- I would never want to drum battle you.

442
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,004
<i>Watching him play the drums,
watching him on stage,</i>

443
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,965
<i>watching him, though,
even with my daughter,</i>

444
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,176
<i>and how amazing he is with her,</i>

445
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,304
the way he speaks to her is so special.

446
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,100
That was good.

447
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,436
She's a drummer, baby.

448
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,939
Travis and I talk about
a future all the time.

449
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,069
The second we fell in love,

450
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,698
I think we knew how different
it was from anything

451
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,200
<i>either of us have ever had before.</i>

452
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:17,247
And so, I think that
we absolutely see a future together.

453
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,500
Travis, why are you
always like this to my mom?

454
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,045
I'm always drumming.
'Cause he's a drummer.

455
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,130
I said I'm gonna use
your mom as a drum one day

456
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,549
and I'll record it.
Yeah, he's gonna record it.

457
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,676
You're going to use her butt?

458
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,014
Actually, that's what I thought
would make the loudest noise.

459
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,948
Amazing. Is this all for <i>SNL?</i>

460
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,783
Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

461
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,537
<i>So, I'm still really bothered
about what I saw on my son's iPad.</i>

462
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,581
I just want to get to the bottom
of where this is coming from

463
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,749
and what's happening.

464
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,877
<i>And I've been calling everyone
from</i> Roblox

465
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,379
<i>and my attorney's been on it.</i>

466
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,923
<i>So, I'm just going to let them handle it</i>

467
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,135
<i>and go into this fitting
and try to focus on</i> SNL <i>right now.</i>

468
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,389
I feel like they need to know
who my musical guest is ASAP.

469
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,723
And Kanye is out of town.

470
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,268
How would you feel
if he was your musical guest?

471
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,479
- He obviously would be the best.
- Yeah.

472
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,775
But maybe this is my chance
to do something on my own.

473
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,776
You know?

474
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,529
I don't know. It could
either be super calming,

475
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:36,492
it would be so cool for the kids to see
Mom and Dad on <i>SNL</i> together.

476
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,453
That's so cool.

477
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,873
But then, I might be more stressed out,

478
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,501
the more people you know that are there.

479
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,211
I might just be like, "Oh, my God."

480
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,464
- Want me to try this on?
- Yeah, let's do it.

481
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,426
Okay, so I say we try
this, this, and this.

482
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,887
Okay. Who's coming from your family?

483
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,680
I'll make my mom be a part of it.

484
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,390
- Oh, you will? She's always good.
- Totally.

485
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,602
I was like, how funny would it be
if, in all the skits, it was

486
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,521
Kourtney and Travis in the background
making out the whole time

487
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,732
because that's really
all they do anyway.

488
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,818
I brought my whole family
and I'm like, "You guys, no one is safe.

489
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,820
"I'm gonna throw you all under the bus."

490
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,031
Do you know what
you wanna say in the monologue?

491
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,075
No, I want to say hi.

492
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,786
Everyone's forced me to be here.

493
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,830
Listen, I'm the underdog.

494
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,249
<i>Everyone just thinks I'm a ditz.</i>

495
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,543
The girl from <i>Will and Grace</i> came out

496
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,630
and said that she has no idea

497
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,842
<i>why I would be chosen as a host.
But it's like, why do you care?</i>

498
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,846
I don't comment to tear people down,
especially another female.

499
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,182
If that's what you think, dude, then...

500
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,227
cool, tune in.

501
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,814
The long tassels might freak me out.

502
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,440
If I'm like, "Hi."

503
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,651
I use my hands a lot,
and I'll feel like an octopus.

504
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,029
I want this to be a moment where

505
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,491
people are like,
"Oh, wow. She was funny."

506
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,577
- Are you nervous?
- I am nervous.

507
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,496
Listen to this.
I just got this voice note.

508
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,375
<i>Oh, my God, you're hosting</i> SNL.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

509
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,418
<i>Are you dying? Are you dying?</i>

510
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,504
<i>- Are you dying? I'm dying.</i>
- Who is that?

511
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,256
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

512
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,884
<i>- My God. Okay.</i>
- Chrissy Teigen.

513
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,678
But I'm just like, "Yeah, I'm dying."

514
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,972
"I'm dying. Now you're
freaking me out even more.

515
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,767
"Thanks. You're freaking me out
actually even more."

516
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,895
Everyone's blowing me up, like,
my God. I've never gotten more texts,

517
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,483
and I'm like,
"Okay, I'm glad that you're happy."

518
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,403
I really do wanna surprise people,
and I hope that I can bring it.

519
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,530
I literally called, like, Amy Schumer,

520
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,574
and I was like,
"Oh, my God, I'm hosting <i>SNL."</i>

521
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,036
She's like, "I'll help you write
some jokes for your monologue."

522
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,289
And I was like,
"I love having really funny friends."

523
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,168
Kim Kardashian on <i>SNL.</i> It's crazy.

524
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,629
It's going to so epic,
and fun, and historical,

525
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,922
you'll never forget this.

526
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,008
It'll be the coolest moment
of your life.

527
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,260
This will be live.

528
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,096
Live.

529
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,645
Hello, there.

530
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,648
- You look good.
- Thank you. So do you.

531
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:16,527
Tristan and I currently
are not exactly together.

532
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,571
He's one of my best friends.

533
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,573
- What's going on?
- Not much.

534
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:25,202
<i>I see Tristan a couple times a week.
He's a really hands-on dad,</i>

535
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:29,708
and me and Tristan don't have tension.
We get along really, really well.

536
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,627
And so, it's just easy
to co-parent with him.

537
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,962
So good seeing everyone
at the barbecue, you know.

538
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,506
- It was nice, right?
- Yeah. And Kylie looked so good.

539
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,550
I didn't know she was like,
popping popping.

540
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,970
The baby's cooking in there,
like, I see it.

541
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,929
I didn't know she's that far along.

542
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,600
I know if Tristan had his way,

543
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,728
I guess that we would
completely be together.

544
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,647
<i>I just need a little breathing room
and time to think.</i>

545
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,652
I know you're going
to be heading to Sac soon.

546
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,739
And something that I know

547
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,493
means a lot, I think, to the both of us
is the therapy aspect.

548
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,330
I notice such a big difference in you
when you are on top of your game

549
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,042
and you, no pun intended,
and you just stay on,

550
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,213
I think, your personal health,
well-being,

551
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,964
whether that be mind, body, soul.

552
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,050
I think it's great for both of us,

553
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,636
especially because
we've had a lot of room to grow,

554
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,389
regardless of us being friends
or where we stand,

555
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,516
I think we both grow together.

556
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,852
It just makes our family,
and our bond better.

557
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,606
Tristan is very determined
on us getting back together.

558
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,568
He goes to therapy quite often,
a couple times a week,

559
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,947
and we now even do
couples therapy together.

560
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:47,201
I say "couples," but it's really
his therapy that I'm asked to join.

561
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,120
<i>I think I just call it couples therapy</i>

562
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,122
<i>because I don't know
what else you'd call it.</i>

563
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:55,751
It's always such a weird
gray area

564
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,004
- because we are such great friends.
- Yeah.

565
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,967
And I think that's so confusing
to outside people

566
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,845
because I know how to be
a monster to you if I want to.

567
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,014
But you never have been,
which I respect.

568
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,392
- And I appreciate that.
- Okay.

569
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,855
I mean, it's not like you've ever
burned my clothes or slashed my cars.

570
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,733
No. I have thrown
water on all your clothes.

571
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,897
- If I wasn't...
- You have?

572
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,737
When I was nine months pregnant,
when you cheated on me.

573
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,072
- Yah. It was water.
- If I wasn't pregnant,

574
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,366
I would have you up so...

575
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,203
I just didn't want
to break my nails before delivery.

576
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,997
- Shoutout to the nails.
- Yeah, for sure.

577
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,500
Yeah, but let's...
Listen, it's 2021, okay?

578
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,419
We can't be talking about 20...

579
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,673
- Eighteen?
- Eighteen.

580
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,010
Every day, he tries to show me
and prove to me

581
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:50,097
that he is a different person and
that I should have faith and trust him.

582
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,643
But him and I have been
through so much together

583
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,479
that I have a lot of reservations.

584
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,315
My guards are up.
I'm always kind of like this.

585
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,901
And Tristan just wants
to bear hug me, and it's just...

586
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,861
I don't know.
I'm still kind of like this.

587
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,989
You know how I feel about you
and you know I want to

588
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,367
get us back together
and build our family,

589
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,913
and, hopefully, be able to
expand our family one day, God willing.

590
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,917
I think it is the avenue where you or we

591
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,628
- get to hear each other differently.
- Mmm-hmm.

592
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,755
Because we've definitely
had these conversations.

593
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,299
- You've definitely made mistakes...
- Of course.

594
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,929
That weren't taken seriously
or they weren't really listened to.

595
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,725
I don't think someone was there
to kind of hold you accountable.

596
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,228
It's a lot of strain on a relationship.

597
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,979
- Yeah.
- Trust takes time.

598
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,356
Understand what I'm saying.

599
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,233
I didn't say
trust comes after a session.

600
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,859
Trust takes time.

601
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,820
<i>When there's no hope</i>

602
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,948
<i>And the darkness got you down</i>

603
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:54,871
<i>Remember that the good life
always comes back around</i>

604
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,082
<i>Remember the good life</i>

605
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,375
<i>Good life</i>

606
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,587
<i>Good life Good life</i>

607
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:09,718
We're not going to have time, Chris,
to do that full ponytail for <i>SNL.</i>

608
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,888
No?
- Right? It's going to have to...

609
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,974
You've done <i>SNL</i> before.
Right. You did it with J Lo, too.

610
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,434
Did you do all of Jennifer's wigs
when you guys did it?

611
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,687
Or did this show do it?
They made the wigs.

612
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,481
They'll make it. I'll go with her,
and they'll do a head measurement.

613
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,692
Is there time for looks and changeover?

614
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,694
No. It would literally be wig on,
wig off.

615
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,906
But I can make one and put it on.
There would be that much time.

616
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,826
There's certain things and preparation

617
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,246
that people are telling me to do
that are making me way more nervous.

618
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,124
I ran into Pete Davidson at the Met.

619
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,002
I was like, "I'm so scared.
I don't know what I signed up for."

620
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,130
He's like, "Can you read cue cards?
You're good."

621
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,092
And I was like, "I can read."

622
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,011
Scott wants to come
and Jonathan wants to come.

623
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,805
I think Scott's fine 'cause
Kourtney and Travis aren't coming.

624
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,348
Yeah.
- So, that'll be nice.

625
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,685
<i>So, Kourtney can't come.
As long as I have my mom,</i>

626
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,230
<i>and my besties, and Khloé, I'm good.</i>

627
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,273
<i>And, of course,
I wanted to invite Scott.</i>

628
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,818
I love Scott. He's always welcome.

629
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,238
<i>He's always family, and I'm happy
that he's coming to support.</i>

630
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,743
<i>But I probably wouldn't invite Scott
if Kourtney was coming without Travis.</i>

631
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,287
<i>I think that would just be
weird so soon.</i>

632
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,247
But what are you guys
thinking for hair

633
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,082
when she walks out to do her monologue?

634
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,001
The first look should
obviously be the most

635
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,629
because the rest of the time,
it's wig on, wig off.

636
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,941
- It's just kind of ruffling there.
- Are you gonna have...

637
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,300
I just have to be there
and quickly ruffle her up...

638
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,969
- Then someone grabs and pushes her out.
- Not even 10 minutes?

639
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,472
No, like, seconds.
They literally are pushing her.

640
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,016
It's like you're in a wheelchair
and they push you to the crowd.

641
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,185
It's crazy.
Your head's gonna be spinning.

642
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,978
Your wig's ripped off
and they change it.

643
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,605
And then you just have to be really calm

644
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,941
and go out and be like,
"Okay, guys, next up..."

645
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,234
Sarah Silverman was like,
"What if you're like,

646
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,737
"'Okay, I'm gonna ask
some questions to the audience'

647
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:56,200
"and then, I go, 'You.'
It's really Kanye in a disguise.

648
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,660
"But you know it's him.

649
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,830
"He goes, 'Do you believe
in second chances in marriages?'

650
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,499
And I go, 'No!'
and go to the next one."

651
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,584
Love that.

652
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,460
That's amazing.
That's funny.

653
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,836
That's literally all you need.

654
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,172
- Would he do that?
- We're laughing thinking about it.

655
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,383
- Yeah, if Dave tells him to do it.
- He'll do it.

656
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,177
If Dave Chappelle says
it's funny, it's funny.

657
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,137
Yeah.
- That's all I need.

658
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,933
- I don't need a whole audience.
- I feel you're gonna be great.

659
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,352
What if they were like,
"Can you sing?" No.

660
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,145
"Can you dance?" No.

661
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,606
"Can you act?" No.
"Can you do accents?" Nope.

662
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,400
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

663
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,823
You'll be fine.

664
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,036
You're gonna kill it.

665
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,061
Hey, Joge, I do have
a bone to pick with you.

666
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,357
- Just about SKIMS. One thing.
- Okay.

667
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,151
So, you know, I...
You always make fun of me

668
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:16,280
for having a bigger vagina than most.

669
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,116
I'm wearing... Hi.

670
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,368
I'm telling her about a bone
I have to pick with her.

671
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,164
You know, the body suit one,
the one that there's ruching here.

672
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,999
I'm wearing it right now,
and it's amazing.

673
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,253
But it's a slivered...
Is it supposed to just cover my clit?

674
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,382
The vagina needs a little more fabric,
just a little wider.

675
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,677
For all you little bitches,
why does it matter?

676
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,056
Big puss club.

677
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,600
The width wise
is what she's talking about.

678
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:49,355
You don't want your vagina
hanging out of the sides of the SKIMS.

679
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,985
Yeah.

680
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,488
- You look fab.
- I was, like, screaming

681
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,531
at Kanye and his stylist 'cause I said

682
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,284
the clothes have to be
at my house at 11 o'clock,

683
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,079
and by 12:30, I'm leaving.

684
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,291
I'm going out the door, and now,
I look like I'm in the <i>Matrix.</i>

685
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,169
I just want the outfits
lined up in my room,

686
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:16,340
Monday, Tuesday, I'm a robot.
I will operate as such.

687
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:20,135
- Is someone gonna do that for you?
- Well, it's Kanye.

688
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:24,932
He says he wants to quit everything
and just dedicate his life to being...

689
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,683
- Your stylist.
- My stylist.

690
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,103
I think he should still
maybe do a little music,

691
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,523
a little Adidas designing,
and then he can do that on the side.

692
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,983
<i>You know,
Kanye and I remain friends.</i>

693
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,986
<i>Kanye's always dressed me.
He's always styled me.</i>

694
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:42,116
In the early 2000s, he would
literally just send me random e-mails

695
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,410
with all these looks
and what my style should be.

696
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,622
<i>Only wear crop tops
and pencil skirts right now,</i>

697
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,874
or it's all about a boot with a skirt,

698
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,168
and he'll send me
so many reference pictures.

699
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,254
<i>So, that's always really been our thing.</i>

700
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,008
But there's also a side of me
that wants total independence too.

701
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,677
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

702
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,638
Good, thank you.

703
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,806
I'm gonna get
a grilled artichoke...

704
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,930
KHLOÉ: God, she scared me.

705
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,603
With a side of mayonnaise
and the skinny onion rings.

706
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,273
I'm gonna get an impossible burger
and sweet potato fries.

707
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:18,110
May I please get the iceberg lettuce
wedge as well, but all chopped?

708
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,946
Can I add tomato to it?

709
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,865
And can I add egg and ranch dressing?

710
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,450
May I get that, please?

711
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,869
- Chopped as well.
- Chopped.

712
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,830
- She just knows what she's doing.
- I'll just get that, too.

713
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,207
Shut up, are you?

714
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,958
We are foodies.

715
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,043
That's why we work out the way we do

716
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,796
because we'll order everything
and we scarf it down,

717
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,339
and we pray for forgiveness later.

718
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,259
It's horrible.

719
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,302
Ooh. What's a blueberry patch?

720
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,679
Oh, cocktails.
Thought it was a blueberry pie.

721
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,763
Fat ass.

722
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,265
No, we can't...
- I'm kidding.

723
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,684
I'm not talking about me, I mean Kim.
No, just kidding.

724
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,311
- Thank you.
- Is that from the fountain?

725
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,395
The diet Coke?

726
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,772
Oh.

727
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,694
I'll stick with my iced tea.
I love a good fountain soda. So...

728
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,783
I don't think I've ever
had better onion rings.

729
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,870
So, Scott and I spoke about

730
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,539
how he wasn't invited to the barbecue.

731
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,166
Oh, my God, what did he say?

732
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,836
He was actually so incredibly receptive.

733
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,839
And he was so calm because I said,

734
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,551
"Scott, honestly, we did you a favor
by not inviting you

735
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,471
"because it was so intimate,
like you don't want to sit there

736
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,724
"and be exposed to
you and Travis making out."

737
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,271
So, he asked me about it, "So,
do you not want me at this barbecue?"

738
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,399
And I was like, "Your actions
need to match up with

739
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,694
"you wanting to be a part of this,
then act like it."

740
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:47,074
I was in Italy, and he was DMing Younes.

741
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,704
- KHLOÉ: <i>You brought that up to him.
- Then I was like,</i>

742
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,040
- "That's not really the vibe."
- The vibe.

743
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,877
"Don't go DMing my ex-boyfriend."

744
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:02,547
When I was in Italy with Travis
on our summer vacation,

745
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:07,219
I woke up to a text from Scott
saying, "I'm so sorry.

746
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:11,724
"I DMed your ex-boyfriend
who I can't stand."

747
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,687
<i>He sent me a screenshot of it
and said he posted it on his story.</i>

748
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,691
- He was asking if he could apologize...
- To Travis?

749
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,109
Yeah.
That is nice.

750
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,612
- Then I wrote him, "This is despicable."
- You didn't tell any of us that.

751
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,156
I said, "This is despicable."
I was like...

752
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,908
- You pulled out the big word.
- Yeah.

753
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,119
For so many years,

754
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,621
<i>Scott's always gotten away with</i>

755
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,582
bad behavior and still been invited,

756
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,377
and I don't think
that's going to continue.

757
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,714
It could be me or Kim. If Kourt's
too uncomfortable to say something,

758
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,632
I don't mind doing it, but I'd...

759
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,260
But what... No. Why do we have to call?

760
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,264
So, every time we're doing anything,
having a seven-person barbecue,

761
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,890
we have to say... No.

762
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,353
Me kissing the love of my life

763
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,606
- is not anything bad.
- Why do you laugh every time you say it?

764
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,650
- You can own it.
- I'm not. I'm just saying

765
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,279
it's not anything...
I don't want to be taken negatively.

766
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,865
- So, he'll...
- But it's going to be taken negatively

767
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,784
to someone that's not getting their way.
You can't let that affect you.

768
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,996
But I just... No, I don't.
I will continue to...

769
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,582
live my life
and pretend no one's watching.

770
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,750
Ha!

771
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,595
Kim.
- What an ambience in here.

772
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,517
It always smells so good
in here, doesn't it?

773
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,980
Why am I always talking to myself?

774
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,691
Because you're old. Awesome.

775
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:48,195
- I did 15-minute glam today.
- KHLOÉ: You look so beautiful.

776
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,697
You look so cute.
KHLOÉ: Right? Look at her.

777
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,033
- Look how cute I look.
- KHLOÉ: You do look cute, Mom.

778
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,201
You are the cutest.

779
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,704
So what's going on here?
Is this a little <i>SNL</i> packing?

780
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,206
Yes.
KHLOÉ: Ooh.

781
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,460
Hold on, Marty calling.

782
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,544
Hi, I saw it.

783
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,047
Can I patch you in with Tracy?
I'm here with my mom.

784
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,131
<i>Sure.</i>

785
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,093
You're on speaker, and we're filming
my show, and I'm with my sisters.

786
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,261
<i>I mean, I just have
so much to do this week,</i>

787
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,640
<i>SNL's</i> coming up. I'm already
stressed out about that.

788
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:21,478
Then, my lawyer calls about the threats
that there's more footage

789
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,023
from the sex tape that's been out there.

790
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,283
What tape?

791
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,994
So, Ray J's manager is claiming

792
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,123
he has a sex tape of us
in Santa Barbara.

793
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,959
<i>This all started earlier
at the barbecue.</i>

794
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,878
Click on it.

795
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,297
<i>It was clickbait insinuating
that if you click on it,</i>

796
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,218
<i>there was going to be
a new sex tape coming out.</i>

797
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,387
Had my son been a little bit older
and been able to read,

798
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,141
I would have been mortified.
But I died inside.

799
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,893
Marty, I am

800
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:06,148
99.9% sure...

801
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,358
that no other tape exists.

802
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,360
<i>This is supposed to be
unreleased footage.</i>

803
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,696
<i>I really don't know what they have.</i>

804
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,658
For 20 years, this has been
held over my head

805
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,952
of this mistake, or is it a mistake?

806
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,955
It was my boyfriend of years.

807
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,082
We go on a trip, we film a video.

808
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,209
It's embarrassing
for it to be out there.

809
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,878
But it's not the most scandalous thing,

810
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,464
and I'm not going to be made
to feel that way.

811
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,174
I'm just human.

812
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,010
Didn't we deal with this
the first season of <i>Keeping Up?</i>

813
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,679
- This is a good omen, you guys.
- What's a good omen?

814
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,265
KHLOÉ: Talking about your sex tape
in the first season.

815
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,434
I feel like we're back to day one.

816
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,895
- My God, how amazing.
- KHLOÉ: It's a good omen.

817
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,522
So, what do we do, Marty?
<i>Marty,</i>

818
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,692
<i>let's say it's a brand new tape
that Kim doesn't even know exists.</i>

819
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,945
I mean, I'm 99% sure.

820
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,865
But the fact that these people
keep saying they have a tape,

821
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,911
what if I was sleeping and he
stuck a dildo up my ass? I don't know.

822
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,455
Oh, my gosh.
I'd hope you'd wake up from that.

823
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,082
I don't remember anything.
It's completely illegal.

824
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,376
Have Marty scare
the shit out of this guy.

825
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,630
<i>Whatever he has,
isn't that considered stolen property?</i>

826
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,381
I'll sue for nominal damages.

827
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,092
The message is more important
than the dollars at this point.

828
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,177
The message is.

829
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,637
You're not doing anything wrong.

830
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,361
You're protecting yourself
and reputation for your children's sake.

831
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,766
I'm not doing anything wrong.

832
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,312
I'm protecting myself for my reputation
and my children's sake.

833
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,399
- It's 5:00 p.m. You gotta move fast.
- Yeah, they're gonna post this soon.

834
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,443
We gotta move fast
and start calling people.

835
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,403
<i>Let me call...</i>
- Let me call you back.

836
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,781
Let me just call Kanye really quickly.

837
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,578
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

838
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,999
It's not okay, though.
It's not. You know, on <i>Roblox.</i>

839
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,586
Saint was on <i>Roblox</i> yesterday.

840
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,714
And the thing popped up
and he started laughing,

841
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,134
and was like, "Mommy, look,"
and it was a picture of my cry face.

842
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,846
And it was a game that
someone made in <i>Roblox.</i>

843
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,724
And it's said, "Kim's new sex tape
when you clicked on it."

844
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,644
Thank God he can't read yet.

845
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,522
And it's, like, over my dead body
is this shit gonna happen to me again.

846
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,524
I just want it gone.

847
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,236
This is not gonna with me.

848
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,572
Like, it's not.

849
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,366
So, I just want it gone.

850
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:25,120
I am a mama bear. These are
my children. This is my whole life.

851
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,456
And it's really hard to see my kids
go through stuff like this

852
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,168
when people are always trying to attack.

853
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,170
It's just annoying.

854
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,299
I almost died when
Saint thought it was funny.

855
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:41,720
The one thing that got me kind of more
calm about it was, when I was crying,

856
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,432
Kanye was like, "Listen, you have
the power. Nothing will cancel you.

857
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,310
"Stop worrying about
the public perception.

858
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,853
"You know who you are."

859
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,149
Wait. This is
them calling about this thing?

860
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,359
Let me call you right back. Okay, bye.

861
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,445
So, here's the thing, Marty.

862
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,323
Get something drafted so that
it can be taken down immediately.

863
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,200
I don't want it to be copied.
I have four kids.

864
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,287
I can't go through this again.
This was, like, 20 years ago.

865
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,913
I'm not gonna go through this again.

866
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:12,417
I know the right attorneys this time.
I know exactly what to do this time.

867
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,461
I'm not going to let this
happen to me again.

868
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,087
So, we're gonna get on top of this.

869
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,549
I have all the time, all the money,

870
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:23,887
and all of the resources
to burn them all to the ground.

- Whoo!
- Our lives are so hectic and busy.

- Yeah.

It doesn't feel like you do.

891

the only person that I've cared about,
I deliberately didn't invite.

But Scott, I'm saying sorry.
