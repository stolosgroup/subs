1
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:04,121
What the...

2
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:05,256
We ain't even...

3
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:07,325
- Hey, man!
- Hey, Alfred!

4
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:09,559
Hey, man, I'm gonna need some
cash for this mirror, man.

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,561
Alfred!

6
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,561
Hey, hello? Hello?

7
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,930
Hey, hey, hey!

8
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,431
Man, I know you hear
me talking to you, man,

9
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:15,832
- I'm speaking English.
- All right, cool.

10
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,435
Let's just keep it cool, okay, guys?

11
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,601
Nigga, if you don't get out of my face....

12
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:20,137
Worldstar!

13
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,505
- No, don't do that to us.
- No, no, no, no no.

14
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:22,639
I think I'm being more than fair,

15
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:23,474
calmly asking for compensation.

16
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:24,842
So let's go, bro.

17
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,509
No, y'all staying broke tonight.

18
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,278
Well, you trying to get
in the club before 10:45,

19
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:29,980
which means you trying
to get in before 11:00,

20
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,182
which means you also broke.

21
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:33,517
Nobody's stunting on anybody here.

22
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,318
Ain't no one stunting on anyone here.

23
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,486
Bitch, will you please shut the hell up?

24
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:37,787
Don't talk to me like that!

25
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,189
I'll talk to whoever however I want,

26
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,757
if you got a problem
with it, we can settle it,

27
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,625
but my car was not involved, man.

28
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,628
Hold on, hold on, man, I'm
getting crazy déjà vu right now.

29
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:48,900
Okay, where's the dog
with the Texas on him?

30
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,669
Oh, there he is.

31
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:53,004
That's a trip, man.

32
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:56,207
Yo, what's your man on?

33
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,309
Yo, worry about this mirror, man.

34
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:59,676
Just get another mirror. You Paper Boy.

35
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,314
- You rich, right?
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,850
- You Paper Boy?
- You know it.

37
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:09,119
Boy, you so garbage, that
postal mixtape was garbage.

38
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,654
What it was? Uh, "Mucking."

39
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,457
Mucking... what the hell
is mucking, Paper Boy?

40
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,526
Man, you know what it is, I
explained in the hood, nigger.

41
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:16,893
Why we even talking, man? Why...

42
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:18,496
Shit, what's going on? What's good?

43
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:19,964
This is definitely
going on Worldstar.

44
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,464
No it is not! Stop it.

45
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:23,366
Nigga, what are you doing?

46
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,702
Nigga, what are you doing?

47
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:27,237
Okay, well, what's up? Hmm? Yeah.

48
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,540
I got my people waiting right over there.

49
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:32,375
Watch out, baby. What's up?

50
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,345
Let's go! What's up?

51
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,819
Wait.

52
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,121
This is so weird, man.

Why are you up?

77
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,080
I had a weird dream.

78
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,116
I was swimming in this pool,
but it was like the ocean

79
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,752
and I was swimming with the
seaweed, but it wasn't seaweed,

80
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:52,455
it was, like, hands.

81
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,457
And I was swimming with this girl.

82
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:57,128
And she was saying if the hands grab you,

83
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,063
they pull you down and drown
you, so swim above them.

84
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,433
- Hmm. That's deep.
- I know.

85
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,568
I think it's about society, 'cause, like...

86
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,836
Who's the girl?

87
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,806
I don't know.

88
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,773
What she look like?

89
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,976
She was fat.

90
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,345
And not interesting.

91
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,147
Okay.

92
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,313
You jealous?

93
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,150
I'm disappointed in your story,

94
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:22,619
'cause you're first saying
that she's fat and annoying,

95
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,155
and then you all of a sudden turn around

96
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,823
and you're making out with this bitch.

97
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,658
I never said we were making out.

98
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:29,993
- Were you making out?
- Yeah.

99
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,327
Yeah, we were.

100
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,264
Oh, man.

101
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,597
- I know you.
- No, you don't know me.

102
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,168
- Mmm... oh, no.
- What?

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,335
My breath.

104
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:40,837
Oh, I love it. What is that?

105
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,373
Curry?

106
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:44,374
- Are you kidding me?
- Like a very deep curry?

107
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,343
That is not... that's,
like, some freaky shit.

108
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,646
Ooh, I like that.

109
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:50,848
- What are you...
- I love that.

110
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,651
You're so stupid.

111
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:57,587
I don't care.

112
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:07,665
Mm.

113
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,738
Tell me you love me.

114
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,575
Why did you just laugh?

115
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,311
'Cause you always say that, and I'm always,

116
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,546
like, "of course."

117
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,217
Then why don't you just say "I love you"?

118
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,385
I love you.

119
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:46,936
Uh-oh.

120
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:48,404
She's awake.

121
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:50,707
She's gonna kill us all with her cuteness.

122
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,611
You remember you have
Lottie tonight, right?

123
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,112
Hey, there.

124
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:56,914
Of course I did.

125
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,349
I did not.

126
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,384
'Cause I have parent teacher conferences.

127
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,286
Also, I don't always want
her at your parents' house.

128
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,854
She lives here.

129
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,056
I promise she won't be
at my parents' house.

130
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,125
I'll pick her up after work.

131
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:09,726
And if you're gonna be staying here,

132
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,896
I'm gonna need your help with rent.

133
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,265
I'll get it to you tonight.

134
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:16,433
What time are you coming back?

135
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:19,736
I don't know, probably like 11:00?

136
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,806
11:00? 11:00's a little late.

137
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,142
You, uh, taking the parents
to Magic City's? Follies?

138
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,111
You know, Cheetahs is actually
a better spot for that.

139
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,947
I have a date.

140
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,785
You're with Daddy tonight.

141
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:39,789
Mommy's going on a date
with some corny dude.

142
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,892
Yeah, some corny dude.

143
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,226
What?

144
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,596
No, this is a great environment for you.

145
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:47,130
Thank you very much.

146
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,800
You have a nice flight, now.

147
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:51,467
- Excuse me, sir...
- Fuck off.

148
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,137
I know, right?

149
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,671
That was just rude, man.

150
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:56,839
Hey, yo, Compound was lit last night.

151
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:59,575
Man, my cousin had, like
eight bottles up in that bitch.

152
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,745
They fought with, like,
three ho's a piece, my nig.

153
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,580
Shit was crazy.

154
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,151
Hey, we gonna hit $2 Tuesday at
the Ultimate, you want to roll?

155
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:10,854
Earn.

156
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,656
Hey, yo, Earn.

157
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:15,291
Gotti.

158
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:21,431
How you look when you high at work.

159
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,866
Van's dating other people.

160
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,469
She's gonna kick me out the house.

161
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,037
I'm also broke and I can't sign anyone up

162
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,173
'cause I'm not an old lady.

163
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:30,807
Can I go to the Caribbean on this?

164
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,175
Well, of course you can, honey.

165
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,944
I'll even give you an extra flight.

166
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,214
As long as you keep flirting with me.

167
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:40,183
Oh, okay.

168
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,461
This bitch is amazing.

169
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,796
That's really rough.

170
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:53,963
I don't know, I would watch.

171
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,532
That's more rough.

172
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,568
Hey, yo, you heard that
new Paper Boy mixtape, man?

173
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,069
I heard it's coming out this Friday, man.

174
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,503
His last one was hot.

175
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,573
I haven't really been keeping up, man.

176
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:03,907
I don't know who that is.

177
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,009
Man, get out your little cave, little boy.

Damn, she is thick as fuck.

Is that weird for you?

00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,397
No, Paper Boy. Paper Boy is my cousin.

190
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:27,864
That's your cousin, man, you
gonna want to get in there

191
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:30,734
before he gets signed, man.

192
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,904
Offering that boy seven M's on the table.

193
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:35,271
Is that a real offer?

194
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:38,508
That's a real offer, them real M's.

195
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,042
All right, man, I'll catch you later.

196
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,344
Where you going? You going to talk to him?

197
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,913
Hey, tell him I said "what up."

198
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:46,015
Is that really your cousin in
the video with the big tits?

199
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,818
You don't know Paper Boy.

200
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,564
Son.

201
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,934
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

202
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,871
- Hey, Earn.
- Hey, Mom.

203
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:10,675
- How are you?
- Good.

204
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,309
How're you?

205
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:15,047
- I'm good.
- Good.

206
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:18,450
You gonna invite me in?

207
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,285
- No.
- Why not?

208
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:21,485
I can't afford it.

209
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:22,419
Come on, you really think

210
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:23,854
I'm here for money?

211
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,956
We do, yes.

212
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:26,791
I'm looking for Alfred.

213
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:27,626
Also, could you pick up

214
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:28,527
Lottie from Kaya's?

215
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,527
I'm getting a job

216
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:30,595
and Van's on a date.

217
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:31,429
You got a job?

218
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,364
Hey, good for her.

219
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:33,297
Yes, I got a job.

220
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,465
And thanks, Mom.

221
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:35,966
I'm your son, Earn.

222
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,535
I used to live in there with you, remember?

223
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,137
Used to? There was a turd

224
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,472
the size of my arm waiting for me

225
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,139
when I got home yesterday.

226
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:45,176
You supposed to be so smart,
you can't remember to flush?

227
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,113
- That wasn't me.
- It was you. I checked.

228
00:08:48,146 --> 00:08:49,781
You better eat something real.

229
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:51,683
Instead of all them candies and cookies

230
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,518
and whatever other stuff was in there.

231
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:54,953
Did you break it up with a stick?

232
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:57,688
Alfred's at the Glenwood apartments.

233
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,658

What you using it for?

243

Drinking.

Yeah, no, man, don't use that to drink.

Your peephole's for real.

Thanks.

249
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:06,691
- So, Zoo Tycoon...
- You want in on Paper Boy.

250
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:07,691
What?

251
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,527
- No.
- Please, man.

252
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,061
People ain't just nice, Earn.

253
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:12,564
When was the last time
you were nice to a girl

254
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:14,531
- you weren't trying to smash?
- This morning.

255
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:16,434
You talking about your
daughter, man, that's gross.

256
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:19,170
No, it'd be gross if I was trying to smash.

257
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:24,209
I don't want a handout,
I want to manage you.

258
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:25,543
Manage?

259
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:26,710
You know where the word "manage" come from?

260
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:29,080
"Manus," Latin for hand.

261
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:31,650
Probably, but I'm gonna say no
for the purpose of my argument.

262
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:34,152
"Manage" come from the word "man," and, uh,

263
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:35,553
that ain't really your lane.

264
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,288
- My lane?
- Yeah, man, I need Malcolm.

265
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,922
You too Martin.

266
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:40,425
You know what they did
to him? They killed him.

267
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:41,592
Didn't they kill Malcolm, too?

268
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,127
Oh, no, they say that.

269
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:46,064
But ain't nobody seen the
body since the funeral.

270
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,331
That's how funerals work.

271
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,768
Alfred, you already Malcolm, okay?

272
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,136
You have that already.

273
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:52,836
What you really need is a silent wild card,

274
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,839
somebody who's about the
money, the opportunity,

275
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:56,174
who can play both sides if needed.

276
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,176
Oh, like Don Lemon.

277
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,811
Fair point, let me rephrase
what I'm trying to say.

278
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:02,413
Oh, wait, wait, wait. It's 4:30.

279
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:03,815
Oh, damn, man, we late.

280
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,693
- No.
- Since when?

281
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,161
I'm doing business.

282
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:18,463
Hey, you want a manager a rapper,

283
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,365
but you can't do business hot?

284
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:22,933
VH1 is hiring interns.

285
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,768
And that sound like a
joke, but they actually,

286
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,705
they tweeted that this morning.

287
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,509
How's Princeton, by the way?

288
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,878
Still on that year off?

289
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,848
Three years is a long year off.

290
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,682
I guess.

291
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:41,652
- I think I know what happened.
- I really think you don't.

292
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:46,657
Look, man, is there somewhere
we can talk for real?

293
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,393
'Cause...

294
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,027
I'm sorry, who is this dude?

295
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:52,162
- Darius, man.
- Man, I'm fine with talking...

296
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,965
When you first walked
in; I gave you cookie.

297
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,499
No, yeah, I remember who you are.

298
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,167
Look, I'm not asking for money.

299
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,302
You should be, ain't you homeless?

300
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,803
Not real homeless.

301
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,004
I'm not using a rat as
a phone or something.

302
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,706
Don't be racist, man.

303
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,475
That make you schizophrenic,
that don't make you homeless.

304
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,143
Wait, wait, not if it worked, man.

305
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,178
No, if you could use a rat as a phone, man,

306
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,513
that'd be genius. I mean, there's like

307
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:11,048
five rats for every one person

308
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,016
in New York alone.

309
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,720
Everybody would have an affordable phone.

310
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:18,189
Yeah, man, I mean, it'd be messy, but...

311
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,391
worth it.

312
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:22,260
Is he your manager?

313
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,762
Rappers need managers.

314
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,163
I'm just trying to get paid right quick.

315
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,731
Yeah, man, rap
is D-E-D. Ded.

316
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,199
This isn't about rap.

317
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,902
If we do this right,
your kids can live good,

318
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,704
my kids can live good, Darius's kids.

319
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,505
I can't have kids.

320
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,240
I'm sure I'll find out
why when the time's right.

321
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:37,741
When is an appropriate time to talk about

322
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,576
my balls getting smashed?

323
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,946
Right now, apparently.

324
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,748
Look, I'm not dumb.

325
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,383
You're older, you have no real fan base.

326
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,551
You're not white and/or selling sex.

327
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:48,920
I sell sex, man.

328
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:52,122
- Hey, track 28.
- Yeah.

329
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,229
Oh!

330
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,731
- Come on.
- Uh.

331
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:02,200
♪ Hey mucking, mucking ♪

332
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,234
♪ That's massage and ♪

333
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,869
♪ Fucking, fucking ♪

334
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:06,905
- See, the concept is a massage...
- I got the concept.

335
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,138
Okay, 28 tracks?

336
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:09,773
Lot of skits.

337
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,609
- I'd cut 'em.
- No, but his is different.

338
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:12,777
Yeah, mine are really good.

339
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,213
I'd still cut 'em.

340
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,148
Well, you not my manager, Earn.

341
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,755
I still know people at Diamond House.

342
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,090
Promoters.

343
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,758
People who manage big
time artists now, man.

344
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,293
Oh, boy, you think you slick.

345
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:30,794
You coming in here,
acting like you saving me,

346
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,396
when really, I'm saving you again.

347
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,965
Nigga, I'm trying to help you.

348
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:34,965
Man, nigga, I ain't seen or heard from you

349
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,433
since my mom's funeral.

350
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,268
And the first thing I hear out your mouth

351
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,403
is "let's get rich."

352
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,339
Walk, man.

353
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:52,000
What's up, dude?

354
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:54,236
Earn? Yo, what's up, man?

355
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,571
- Yo.
- Good.

356
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,139
Did you just come from that dumpster?

357
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,541
No. How are you?

358
00:13:58,573 --> 00:13:59,708
Oh, yo, I'm good, man.

359
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,144
I didn't know you were in town.

360
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:02,345
Uh, yeah, I've been low-key, man.

361
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:03,645
Yo, obviously... oh, dude, if I knew

362
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:04,547
you was in town, I would've hit you up

363
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:05,380
with this party last night.

364
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:08,050
Yo, we needed a real DJ.

365
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,352
This dude... well, he
can't spin worth of shit,

366
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:12,654
but then he goes and he plays Flo Rida.

367
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,590
- No!
- Back to back.

368
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,324
So I calmly pull him
aside, I was just like,

369
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:19,027
"Really, nigga?"

370
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,030
- You actually said that?
- Yeah, man, I had to.

371
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:24,266
Cool. You know that song "Paper Boy"?

372
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:25,568
Yeah, "Paper Boy" by Paper Boy.

373
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:26,601
Yeah, I've heard it. Shit's fine.

374
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:27,569
Dude, the streets love it.

375
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,404
Y'all should play it.

376
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,106
Yeah, for real.

377
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,241
Yeah.

378
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:33,775
You guys should really play it.

379
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:35,844
Uh, I mean, KP picks all the music.

380
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,179
Well, slide it past him.

381
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,613
I mean, KP will usually spin some records

382
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,215
for some scratch up top.

383
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,551
How much?

384
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,219
- Half a stack.
- $500?

385
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,621
Am I buying the station?

386
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:46,456
Everything is who you know.

387
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:48,191
Then introduce me.

388
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:49,391
Yeah, I'm gonna introduce
every dude in Atlanta

389
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:50,926
with a mixtape in my box. Come on.

390
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,127
I'm not every dude.

391
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,795
Uh, you kind of are.

392
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:56,031
Look, I don't have $500.

393
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,766
I make 5.15, plus commission.

394
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,301
I got to pay rent tonight and my parents

395
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:00,535
won't let me in the house.

396
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:01,536
It's like those drug commercials,

397
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,238
only not funny.

398
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:04,539
Man, you know how niggas out here are.

399
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,976
I mean, he usually charges a full safe.

400
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,478
Then what's in it for
you? Why am I so lucky?

401
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,145
What's your cut?

402
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:11,746
Oh, I'm not about that, I'm too busy, man.

403
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,648
I mean, it's just business.

404
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,615
You give me the money,

405
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,451
I pass it on to KP.

406
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,652
But you know, it's probably for the best.

407
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,222
Music business is gross.

408
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:21,624
All right, man, well, you
know, it was great seeing ya.

409
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,258
I'm taking over for Speedy tonight.

410
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,827
All right? Keep it locked.

411
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,866
What's up, my dudes? What's up, bro?

412
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,937
Hey. Hey.

413
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,074
That guy ever say nigger around you?

414
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:39,408
Yeah, right.

415
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,277
I'd break my foot in his ass.

416
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,246
Right.

417
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,580
Hey, um...

418
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:45,847
- what's your name?
- Prince, man.

419
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,451
- For real?
- Yeah.

420
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:50,952
Hey, how late are you here tonight?

421
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:04,633
What's up, Uncle Riley?

422
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,002
Hey, what's going on, Al?

423
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,135
Man, you know.

424
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,437
Hey. Hey, Auntie.

425
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,173
Oh, hey, Lottie.

426
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:11,707
Hey, bring Lottie over here,
let me say hey to my cousin.

427
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,009
That's okay.

428
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,111
She getting a contact high from here.

429
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:16,779
Contact high...

430
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:17,880
that's that new leather you smelling.

431
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,549
You smelling it wrong.

432
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,217
Yeah, well, I'm smelling
it 'round your head.

433
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,552
- Say what?
- Hey.

434
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:23,885
You got a weird wife, you know that, huh?

435
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,353
Hey, um...

436
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:27,323
hey, look, I know you don't know me...

437
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:28,491
my name's Darius.

438
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:30,625
Um, I was just wondering,

439
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,562
could I measure your tree?

440
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,033
No, not right now.

441
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,135
Not right now?

442
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,904
That basically means no, man.

443
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:44,873
Look, I got a question.

444
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:47,476
So Earn want to manage me.

445
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,010
Really?

446
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,413
And I don't trust him, no offense.

447
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,448
- I understand.
- That's what's messed up.

448
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,185
I don't really think
I know Earn anymore.

449
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,189
Like, what happened at Princeton?

450
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:03,159
I never asked.

451
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,926
He'd tell you before me.

452
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,361
No.

453
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:08,330
Earn is good at
keeping his mouth shut.

454
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:34,055
Earn trying like the rest of us.

455
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:37,426
But when he wants to do
something, he does it.

456
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,294
On his terms.

457
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,342
Your mind's racing.

458
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,480
Tell me, yo.

459
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:13,128
I just keep losing.

460
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,963
I mean...

461
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:17,466
some people just...

462
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:20,602
supposed to lose?

463
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:22,171
For balance in the universe?

464
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:24,073
I mean... like, are there just

465
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:27,442
some people on Earth who...

466
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:30,380
supposed to be here just to
make it easier for the winners?

467
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:35,051
Like, really.

468
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,456
Resistance is a symptom
of the way things are.

469
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:46,261
Not the way things necessarily should be.

470
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:48,029
Actual victory belongs to things

471
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:51,367
that simply do not see failure.

472
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,468
Let the path push you like a broken branch

473
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:57,173
in a river's current.

474
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,140
No, no, I'm not going out like that,

475
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,310
but thanks for the advice.

476
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:08,551
Bite this sandwich.

477
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:13,956
No, I'm good, man.

478
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:16,691
Nigga, if you don't bite this sandwich...

479
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:58,150
_

480
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:10,913
- Hello?
- Hey.

481
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:13,582
Hey, man, you hear that?

482
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:14,582
Hear what?

483
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,583
Hey, turn it up, man.

484
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:17,186
Turn it up.

485
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:18,920
Hey, man, tell him I
sketched Uncle Riley's...

486
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:20,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah. "Paper Boy," boy!

487
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:25,461
Wow. That was quick.

488
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:26,462
Hey, man, look, you should come down here.

He likes your stuff,

519
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,601
Actually, to a fault.

520
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:41,469
Yo, tell them that Flo Rida story.

521
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,205
It's so funny. Yo, tell them.

Oh, uh...

523
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,376
yeah, so I was at a station party.

524
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:51,112
And, uh, the DJ... a friend of a friend,

525
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:52,982
was awful, and, uh...

526

you know, it's a big event for the station,

and the party's going and going

528
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,187
and he's ruining it, and so then he goes

529
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,689
and he plays Flo Rida

530
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:03,859
back to back.

531
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,895
I had to go into the booth,
calmly take him aside,

532
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:09,364
