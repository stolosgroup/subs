1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,937
Hey, you kids!
Don't be bad outside my store!

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,404
I keep a nice store!

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,872
Give it up, old man!

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:11,676
We're just cool bad kids
doing young stuff! Chh!

5
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,724
You guys wanna do
more skateboard moves?

6
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,193
Which ones? The
rad ones, that's which!

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,817
How are you kids?

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,530
Did you know your grandpa's
tryin' to get your attention?

9
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,287
Yeah, yeah, screw off, weirdo.

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,289
Grandson, w-w-what's that mean?

11
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,824
He's one of those cult people.

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,492
They worship some
psycho named roy

13
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,005
That says he's
everybody's grandpa.

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,230
So what do you want to
do today, e-eat some snacks

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,566
And maybe let
me kiss you finally?

16
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,168
Y'know, with my mouth and stuff?

17
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,414
This is going on right now.

18
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,304
L-let's go check
it out. Aw, geez.

19
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,640
C-come on, just
for fun, you know?

20
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,107
No, that's not what I'm...

21
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,909
You guys keep thinking
I'm a religious leader.

22
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,179
This isn't a religion.
This is actual truth.

23
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,580
I'm a scientist in real life,

24
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,693
But this isn't real life,
this is a video game.

25
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,251
Y-y-you at least
understand that much, right?

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,519
This is a video game?

27
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,321
But you said I'm your grandson?

28
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,722
I'm saying everyone is.

29
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,858
Everyone here, everyone
in this world but me.

30
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,060
You're all my grandson,
your name is morty,

31
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,529
You're stuck in a video game,
and I'm here to get you out.

32
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,398
What about me?
Am I your grandson?

33
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,133
I just said everyone is!

34
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,534
- Wow!
- Incredible!

35
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,847
Okay, okay, but
don't react like that.

36
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,472
It's not a religion. This
is what is happening.

37
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,318
You and me and your
sister are at an arcade

38
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,408
Called blips and chitz.

39
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,942
It's been taken
over by terrorists.

40
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,944
The power went out,
the game restarted,

41
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,524
And your identity
has been splintered

42
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,126
Into all the
non-player characters.

43
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,084
So I jacked in as roy,
that's the player character,

44
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,686
To get you, my grandson, morty,

45
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,954
Out of the game before
it's over and you die.

46
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,423
Okay, question over here.

47
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,826
Am I your grandson? Jesus! Yes!

48
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,428
Every single one of you is
one five-billionth of morty.

49
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,563
All of you,
collectively, are morty.

50
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,076
Look, I-I don't
wanna seem impatient

51
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,278
But there's actually a lot
more that we have to get done

52
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,746
So if this is how
hard it's gonna be,

53
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,170
We are in a lot of trou...

54
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,505
Summer, what?!

55
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,707
I can't do this if you
keep bugging me!

56
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,709
Do you understand time dilation?

57
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,489
I'm losing a month
a second out here.

58
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,357
There's an alien
army shooting people.

59
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,647
What am I doing?!

60
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,093
It's a small group
of alien terrorists.

61
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,651
Just do a "die hard."
what does that mean?

62
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,032
Sneak around, use air vents.
You've never seen "die hard"?

63
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,257
I'm 17. No, I've never
seen "die hard"!

64
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,569
Well, neither did
the guy in "die hard,"

65
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,127
So you're nailing it! Good luck!

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

67
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,160
Larry...

68
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,940
No, I'm at the end
of my rope with this kid,

69
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,698
I swear to god...

70
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,927
Oh, you gotta be kidding
me! Your beautiful hair!

71
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,903
This is not a
daughter's haircut!

72
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,749
I'm not a daughter,
I'm a grandson.

73
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,506
Your family had a
perfectly fine religion!

74
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,108
You were raised jewish!

75
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,421
Dad, tell me anything
specific about being jewish.

76
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,912
There's a million things!

77
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,314
You go to the temple with
the... The... the special hat,

78
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,848
T-the falafafluten...

79
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,383
Oh, the falafafluten?

80
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,763
Our jewish words are gibberish

81
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,098
Because we're a 14-year-old boy

82
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,255
Who was raised
nondenominational christian

83
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,568
And we're in a video game!

84
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,058
I don't need to hear
this schmoitenheiven!

85
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,060
Let me ask you this,
little miss grandson,

86
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,862
Little miss video
game character.

87
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,198
If you're not my daughter,
why stand in my house

88
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,666
Spouting this chatschkopfka?

89
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,067
Why even live here?

90
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,269
Good question.

91
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,670
There she goes! My daughter!

92
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,741
One five-billionth of a kid
trapped in a video game!

93
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,343
Yeah, that and a college
degree'll pay the rent!

94
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,483
What do you people want?

95
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,751
We have many interests,

96
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,020
But right now my
primary one is the location.

97
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,822
Of. Your. Safe.

98
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,224
We exchange tokens
for digital currency.

99
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,426
We don't have a safe.

100
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,028
Correction, what you
don't have is a head.

101
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,563
Ohh!

102
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,698
Is this a weapon
or a medical tool?

103
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,834
Why would you give me a
gun with a laser that thin?

104
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,170
Did you hear me tell him
he wouldn't have a head?

105
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,438
- He's dead, isn't he?
- People die in surgery.

106
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,752
<i>Hey! Who don't touched me?!</i>

107
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,708
<i>I don't like being touched!</i>

108
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,177
Check the hostages.

109
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,248
Make sure nobody else
here is doing a "die hard."

110
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,791
- Alright! Yeah!
- Aw, geez!

111
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,125
Yeah. Look. I feel like
every time I explain this,

112
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,127
I lose followers, but
this isn't a religion.

113
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,798
And while I do have a message
from a world beyond this one,

114
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,067
And I do need the entire
world to hear my message,

115
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,736
What I do not need is
any more songs about it.

116
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,805
Not in this genre.

117
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,606
I'm an old-school hip-hop man,

118
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,956
And no, that's not an
invitation for you to try it

119
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,477
Because I'm just gonna say it,

120
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,479
We're missing the
mark on diversity.

121
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,949
Get down!

122
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,797
You're all under arrest for
being religious the wrong way!

123
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,665
It's not a religion! You
know what, just shoot me.

124
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,489
You think your god
makes you bulletproof?

125
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,068
There isn't even a
god in the real world,

126
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,558
You fragmented putz.

127
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,805
There's extra no god in here.

128
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,094
You know what, hippie?

129
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,674
Talking like that is
why you're getting shot!

130
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,898
If you kill him, the game
ends and we all die.

131
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,700
Get down, lady! I'm not a lady.

132
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,101
And you're not a soldier.

133
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,504
We're one person, split
into a lot of little pieces.

134
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,839
Y-you feel me? Dawg?

135
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,908
Y-y-you're not gonna
hurt me. You're me.

136
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,444
My name is kevin!
I'm a marine! I'm 30!

137
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,090
I'm a little racist
but my best friend

138
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,692
Is an immigrant
that translated for me

139
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,382
In a generic overseas war!

140
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,583
That's not true.

141
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,785
We're 14, we like
pizza and masturbation,

142
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,187
We wear a yellow shirt,

143
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,900
And we have hair that
looks like a brown helmet.

144
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,123
A-and we miss our family.

145
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,792
And we're in way
over our heads again.

146
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,372
Why's this always happen, man?

147
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,396
I know, right? Aw, geez.

148
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,665
Aw, geez. Come here.

149
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,399
Aw, geez. Come here.

150
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,645
- Aw, geez.
- Aw, geez.

151
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,069
- Aw, geez.
- Aw, geez.

152
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,403
Who is that?

153
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,916
Her video game name is marta.

154
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,675
Okay. See, this I can work with.

155
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,144
"sneak around.
Crawl in some vents.

156
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,946
Do a 'die hard.'"

157
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,826
Oh, my god, it's disgusting!

158
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,206
Actually, it tastes really good.

159
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,698
Oh, my god, it's disgusting
that it tastes good!

160
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,210
<i>Frank, have you
found him? Report.</i>

161
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,834
Oh. Oh. Walkie
talkie. That's "die hard."

162
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,281
Don't have to
see it to know that.

163
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:14,506
This is jons. I repeat,
have you found him?

164
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,152
<i>Breaker, breaker. Walkie talkie.</i>

165
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,954
<i>I got your walkie talkie. Bitch.</i>

166
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,913
Are you doing a "die hard"?

167
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,314
Maybe.

168
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,849
Are... You? Also?

169
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:25,718
<i>More or less.</i>

170
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,519
<i>And my associate, frank?</i>

171
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,766
Uh, your associate
frank is definitely not

172
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,256
Doing a "die hard."

173
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,459
<i>You might even say
he's doing a die easy.</i>

174
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,529
<i>Because I killed him
and it wasn't difficult.</i>

175
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,531
Calm yourself, winslow.

176
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,865
Winslow!

177
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,601
Ugh.

178
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,469
It's not every day
one meets a fellow

179
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,739
"die hard" enthusiast, ms...

180
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,273
<i>Call me "die hard."</i>

181
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,608
Okay, die hard.

182
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,344
Tell me. What do you
know about "die hard"?

183
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,080
<i>What do you care? You
writing a book about "die hard"?</i>

184
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,949
As a matter of fact,
I've written several.

185
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,284
<i>Every sentient civilization
across the galaxy</i>

186
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,620
<i>Eventually develops
the same myth.</i>

187
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,555
In centauri, it's
known as "tower man."

188
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,358
The orionese have
their "thornberg cycle."

189
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,692
And in andromeda it's called

190
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,028
"foolish to have imagined
you'd be able to kill."

191
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,297
<i>All of them what
you'd call "die hard."</i>

192
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,366
The difference being
that cultures like mine

193
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,902
Are aware of its importance
whereas I'm starting to doubt

194
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,838
<i>You could even
recall a single line.</i>

195
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,440
Walkie talkie "die hard," mother

196
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,643
Aaah!

197
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,089
<i>Not so long ago,
grandsonism was being dismissed</i>

198
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,647
<i>As a doomsday cult.</i>

199
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,160
<i>But since a majority
of the world decided,</i>

200
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,984
<i>Hey you know what,
we like jerking off</i>

201
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,696
<i>And playing video games
and our sister is out there</i>

202
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>Fighting terrorists, major
strides have been made.</i>

203
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,500
<i>The world is united,
because the world</i>

204
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,457
<i>Is one 14-year-old boy, morty.</i>

205
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,725
<i>But where's it all coming from?</i>

206
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,927
Some say
grandsonism's leader, roy,

207
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,997
Has a secret base
somewhere in these mountains.

208
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,332
I-I-I couldn't find it
so I'm standing in...

209
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,534
In the general area
with a microphone.

210
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,403
For good enough news, I'm tony!

211
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,547
There she is, my
right-hand morty!

212
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,016
Got enough spaceships? Not yet.

213
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,684
I figure five more
years of game time

214
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,752
Before I can take the
whole fake population

215
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:08,822
Into fake outer space.

216
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,622
What do we do in outer space?

217
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,156
Nothing. It's fake.
W-we keep going.

218
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,492
The game's map has edges,

219
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,672
But the game's engine
will let us go past them.

220
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,340
That will force
the game to reset,

221
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,844
But first it will kick us out,
which morty should survive.

222
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,145
I mean, whatever amount
of morty we have on board.

223
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,680
So if you don't have
five billion handkerchiefs

224
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,237
Soaked in chloroform,

225
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,949
I hope you can keep
flipping idiots to our cause.

226
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,573
They're not idiots, grandpa.

227
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,952
They're me. Ha.

228
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,576
You'll know how funny
that is when we get back.

229
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,112
By the way, I had your
genius of a father picked up.

230
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,848
He's over there. What? Why?

231
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,760
I thought you'd be
grateful and less distracted

232
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,251
Than if I let him die.

233
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,231
He's been in real bad
shape since he lost his wife...

234
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,521
My mom?

235
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,923
Your not-at-all-real mom,
a mom in a video game.

236
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,103
Occupied by a tiny
fraction of yourself.

237
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,394
A fraction of yourself
which is now dead forever,

238
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,864
And fractions add up, so I
had your dad brought here.

239
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,466
You're welcome,
you heartless monster.

240
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,401
Marta. It's me, dad.

241
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,602
I converted for you.

242
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,738
My name is morty. So is yours.

243
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,939
And there's no conversion.

244
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,719
We're both morty. It's a fact.

245
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,983
Sure, honey, anything you say.

246
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,411
I don't want to fight.
I'm proud of you.

247
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,146
Are you mad at me
because before you became

248
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,326
The world's most powerful
woman, I shamed you for your haircut

249
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,417
And called you a
slutty jobless hobo?

250
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,953
If I were you, I'd be
a little mad about that.

251
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,489
You are me. A-and why
would I be mad at myself?

252
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,358
Good point! Is there anything
to... to eat around here?

253
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,938
There's a kitchenette
in the break room.

254
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,429
Oh, a kitchenette you say.
Such red carpet treatment.

255
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,164
Excuse me? I said
thank you, I love it,

256
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,233
We... we... We're
all part of morty!

257
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,569
Some of us more
important parts than others...

258
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,037
Man, the part of me
that's my father is a

259
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:35,440
That's also gonna be
funny when we get back.

260
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,642
Next time you try
to do a "die hard,"

261
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:41,313
Don't hide under a long table
like the guy from "die hard."

262
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,583
Okay, I won't.

263
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,963
I thought you said she doesn't
know how to do a "die hard"!

264
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,432
She doesn't. She's
killing us off one by one!

265
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,790
What do you expect her to
do, buy us each an ice cream?

266
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,058
Two by two? She's improvising.

267
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,395
Which is how she's going
to fall right into our trap.

268
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,196
I'm going to wander
the arcade unarmed,

269
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,066
And when she comes across
me, I'll pretend to be a hostage.

270
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,001
And because she
hasn't seen "die hard,"

271
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,803
Instead of handing
me an unloaded gun,

272
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,338
She'll hand me a... ugh!

273
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,408
"die hard"! "die
hard"! "die hard"!

274
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,943
What the hell was that?!

275
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,255
<i>"die hard"! "die hard"!</i>

276
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,146
You can't just keep
yelling "die hard"

277
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,148
Into a walkie talkie and... ugh!

278
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,483
She threw her
walkie talkie away!

279
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,218
She hates "die hard"!

280
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,089
Which makes her
the ultimate mcclane.

281
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,158
Forget everything you
know about "die hard"

282
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,160
And just go shoot that bitch!

283
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,895
Thank you
for meeting with me, mr. Roy.

284
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,675
Half the country hangs
on your every word.

285
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,166
Heck, most of the world.

286
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,100
You're, like, uh, kind
of a pope, I reckon.

287
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,948
L... I'm not a pope
because it's not a religion.

288
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,571
We're literally in a video game.

289
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,684
I've heard the message, roy.
You're not on the clock here.

290
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,308
So you want every single
person on a spaceship.

291
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,110
But you got a bunch of holdouts.

292
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,712
Maybe people that prefer their
leaders a little more elected.

293
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:48,913
Right. Your voters.

294
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,226
People that like
being told what to do

295
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,494
But don't like admitting it.

296
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,895
Yeah, not sure
I'd put it that way.

297
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,364
I'm sure you'd
put it a stupid way.

298
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,920
I told you this was
a waste of time.

299
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,922
I've got 92% of you
ready to vamoose.

300
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,859
We're not gonna get the rest
by making deals with parasites.

301
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,661
Mr. President, roy is rick.

302
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,063
He's not us. You
and I, w-we're morty.

303
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,531
Is that really so
hard to believe?

304
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,844
Kid, I've known it
and I've believed it

305
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,401
Longer than you have.

306
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,314
We both became video game
characters at the same moment,

307
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,516
But I knew the truth before
you dropped your skateboard

308
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,340
And went to your
first cult meeting.

309
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,654
How do you think a guy becomes
a president in this game, honey?

310
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,877
By not paying attention?

311
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,345
Sorry to call you honey,

312
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,792
I know we're both parts
of a 14-year-old boy,

313
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:24,127
But my part's old-fashioned
and vaguely southern.

314
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,951
I'm confused. If... if you
know rick is real, why...

315
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,488
Why hold out? Because
he's a rude, entitled

316
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,689
He's here to save us.

317
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,757
He... he could've left
the game and let us die.

318
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,958
He's spent 50 years...

319
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,161
50 years, it's what, a
couple hours to him?

320
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,074
He refuses to leave
without his grandson,

321
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,742
But what's grandson mean to him?

322
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,211
Sounds like it means butler.

323
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,146
Someone to "help
summer with her 'die hard, '"

324
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,369
Whatever that means.

325
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,682
I'll tell you what
it doesn't mean.

326
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,439
Fly fishing. A hug.

327
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:50,175
A little appreciation for what
is clearly a pretty decent kid.

328
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,511
At least the 8% of him that
makes up the decent half

329
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,891
Of the greatest god
damn nation on the planet.

330
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,159
We're not a person to him yet.

331
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,183
We're not morty yet.
We-we're divided.

332
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,363
We're divided because some
of us doesn't trust the guy.

333
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,921
What happens to that part of
us when we're all back together?

334
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,300
One morty? Indivisible?

335
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,169
Under a cranky old bag of dicks?

336
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,553
A man you can lock in a
box with five billion pieces

337
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,173
Of his own god
damn flesh and blood

338
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,908
For 50 god damn simulated years

339
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,266
And never hear
him say "I love you"?

340
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,936
Sorry, pumpkin tits,
that dog don't hunt.

341
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,071
Wa-want some heroin?

342
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,306
I-it's a video game,
might as well.

343
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,988
Just about
ready for launch, kiddo.

344
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,612
I can finally get
outta these clothes.

345
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,214
I don't have nearly
enough pockets.

346
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,015
And it'll be nice to
have my own dick back.

347
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,218
Y-you're fine leaving
8% of me to die?

348
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,997
It's not your finest 8%, morty.

349
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,955
And 8% of anything
is expendable.

350
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,557
8% of pizza is crust.

351
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,959
8% of the snyder cut
was batman dreaming.

352
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:42,405
I don't know what
that reference is!

353
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,763
We're in a video game!
Not for long, baby!

354
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,364
I'm not leaving
without all of me.

355
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,545
What? Oh, no, let me
crunch these numbers.

356
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:51,035
8% of five billion
plus one person...

357
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,638
My god, if you stay, it
changes nothing! Bye.

358
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,018
If she's not going, I don't
think my country wants to go.

359
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,288
Who invited you to
chime in, monitor face?

360
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,512
Why give me a monitor if
my opinion doesn't matter?

361
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,915
Your opinion isn't allowed
to matter for the rest of us.

362
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,382
We're all a-morty.

363
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,828
How many chunks of us are
we a-supposed to give up?

364
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,364
Look, I don't know about
you, but I was already

365
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:09,165
Taking a big
leap of faith, here.

366
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,655
We-we're basically
giving up our lives

367
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,257
To become a tiny
part of a stranger...

368
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,191
These lives aren't a-real!

369
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,193
Yeah, but they're longer!

370
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,862
What... what is this,
suicide by summit meeting?

371
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,198
Everyone stop.

372
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,134
Rick, I'll get every
single part of me

373
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,247
To get on every ship
and go with you. Good.

374
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:28,473
But you have to
tell us you love us.

375
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,253
I mean, at this point
even if he said it,

376
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,654
What... what...
What's with the pause?

377
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,211
Screw you, wait for it!

378
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,813
- Holy war!
- Holier war!

379
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,281
Holiest war ever!

380
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,989
Loyalist
evacucratic grandsonistas

381
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,658
Claimed seven new cities today

382
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,261
While the stayputlican
contrasurgent confederation

383
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,063
Of dedication to
video game reality

384
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,198
Invaded the
territories of mortopia,

385
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,333
New south saint
morty, and wemortyall.

386
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,380
In the end, what does it
matter, everyone's morty,

387
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,315
Nobody wants to die,
and that's a hell of a reason

388
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,606
To kill yourself,
but what can we do?

389
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,075
Aw, geez.

390
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:16,555
You know you're my grandson
and none of this is real!

391
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,091
What are you trying to achieve?
You're only hurting yourself!

392
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,094
The only reason any of us
matter is we're pieces of morty!

393
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,495
You taught us that, rick.

394
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:26,965
But you also taught us
you don't care about morty.

395
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,300
Here's how much I care.

396
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,302
If you don't stop blowing
up my flying saucers,

397
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,704
I will exterminate
every last one of you!

398
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:34,372
Anything it takes!

399
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,309
What do I have to say? I
love and respect you, okay?

400
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,278
Too late for talk, rick.

401
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,714
A robot. Of course.

402
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:45,183
I'm not gonna risk dying
because if I die in the game,

403
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,029
You go brain dead,
you're welcome!

404
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,787
Better to die in roy
than to serve in hell!

405
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,656
And what about summer?
Do... do you not care about her?

406
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,370
We gotta get back,
morty. We gotta help her.

407
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:54,793
You know what, wherever she is,

408
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,861
I'm sure she's doing
fine without your help.

409
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,598
Woof, jinx, anyone?

410
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,778
Should we finish the
job, b-blow the place?

411
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:05,270
No, this can't
end, not like this.

412
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,872
Do you think I jinxed her?

413
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,587
Why aren't you shooting higher?

414
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,589
I don't wanna shoot
the glass. Because...

415
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,280
You don't have to not do things
that were done in "die hard."

416
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,350
You can shoot the
glass. Shoot the glass!

417
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,285
Throw grenades! Do everything!

418
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,921
Just kill her!

419
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,762
Why are you here, miss die hard?

420
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,697
I want to know why
you don't just leave.

421
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,659
"die hard"!
Wait. Shh. Shh.

422
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,747
<i>Aw, geez, we get
every single person on a spaceship,</i>

423
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:39,211
<i>And then what? And then we
help your sister do her "die hard."</i>

424
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,378
Too much. It's too much.

425
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,780
Ooh, sorry.

426
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:50,915
I've got a special guest
with me, ms. Die hard!

427
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,517
Or should I call you...

428
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,719
This guy's sister?

429
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:01,994
Mom.

430
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,062
Hello, dear. I'm
joining the other side.

431
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,197
What? Why?

432
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,265
I wanna live in the
real world with roy.

433
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,894
I wanna help summer
with her die hard."

434
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,536
His name is rick. And we
have no way of knowing

435
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,806
If your generation is
actually part of morty.

436
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,540
Do you know how
offensive that is?

437
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,141
It's parenting like
this that pushed me

438
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,543
Into religious radicalism.

439
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,212
Bye. It's not...

440
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,146
Not a religion.

441
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,682
But okay.

442
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,150
Ma'am, it's really
not safe out here.

443
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,821
Also, it's... Time.

444
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,026
Are we going on
the spaceship now?

445
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,560
Pretty soon, dad. Yeah.

446
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,829
Are you... Lying?

447
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,831
You kind of said it with
that tone in your voice

448
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,499
That we use for dying people.

449
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,368
I won't lie to you.
You're dying, dad.

450
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,170
And we're...

451
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,505
Not leaving the video game.

452
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,218
We're... we're gonna
live our lives out here.

453
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:49,508
What? Why the

454
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,443
Why? It's more real here.

455
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,378
The hell it is! My liver hurts!

456
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,380
I'm old here!

457
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,980
I wanna be a teenage boy!

458
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,649
I want to jump around
and do homework

459
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,317
And jerk off all over the place.

460
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,585
But, dad, that's...

461
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,387
We would've been
one tiny part of that.

462
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,723
In here, we get to
be who we really are.

463
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,058
Yeah. Great. Dead.

464
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,459
I get to be a dead father.

465
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,127
Who do I make the...

466
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,796
who do I... who...

467
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:12,997
Don't talk, dad.

468
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,332
Gotta finish my zinger

469
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,534
You don't.

470
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,669
Who do... who do...

471
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:21,473
Who do I make the check out to?

472
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,008
"best daughter ever...

473
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,944
Incorporated"?

474
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,868
Thought you woulda left by now.

475
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,136
I was hoping to get at
least half of you home.

476
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,604
I can't hold out much longer.

477
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,362
I-I'm pretty much beating my
heart voluntarily at this point.

478
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,964
Okay, this is a little awkward,

479
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,700
But the time dilation has
given me a chance to reflect.

480
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,304
And I-I-I gotta say...
There's no need for that.

481
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,573
I've come to tell you,
I'm giving the go-ahead.

482
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,374
All of morty will
leave with you.

483
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,309
To the real world.

484
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,843
To be your grandson,

485
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:00,979
May we help summer
do her "die hard."

486
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,048
I-I gotta say, I-I was
not expecting that.

487
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,517
W-why the change of heart?

488
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,386
My people are staying
only out of loyalty to me.

489
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,521
I'm a relic.

490
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,456
I don't represent them anymore.

491
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,259
You really are a good
grandson, you know that?

492
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:15,460
I'm proud of you, morty.

493
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,529
Please, call me marta.

494
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,598
That's my video game name.

495
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,735
Speaking of which, I
do have one condition.

496
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,203
I must say I admire
you, ms. Die hard.

497
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,805
You were a genuine mcclane...

498
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,408
A most worthy
yankee doodle ruffian.

499
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:33,745
But now it's all come to an end.

500
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:37,215
And the quarterback,
as they say, is toast.

501
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,764
I don't suppose you have
a gun taped to your back.

502
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,219
What the hell does that mean?

503
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,400
It's how "die hard"
ends. Doesn't matter now.

504
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,157
"die hard" tapes
a gun to his back?

505
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,825
That's the end of
your perfect movie

506
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,094
That you've patterned
your whole criminal life after?

507
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:51,407
Well, it seems to have
worked out pretty well for me

508
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,565
Since you're the
one about to die.

509
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,900
What was it you said? Ah, yes.

510
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,370
"walkie talkie 'die
hard, ' mother"

511
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,440
Why are you laughing?

512
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,907
Well, it's funny.

513
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,576
The way you said mother

514
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,911
Just laughing.
Okay. It's just that...

515
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,291
Oh, does that
happen in "die hard"?

516
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,514
Does john mcclane laugh,

517
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,893
And then hans gruber is confused

518
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,695
But then they start laughing
together for a second?

519
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,719
That actually does happen, yes!

520
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,521
Wait. You knew their
names this whole time?

521
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,856
Not this whole time, no.

522
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,324
You left your book
in the bathroom.

523
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,525
I read it while I took a shit.

524
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,327
I mean, mostly the ending.

525
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,072
Yiiiiiiiiiii...

526
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,411
Ippppppeeeeeeeee...

527
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:46,751
Oh. Dippee doo, baby!

528
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:49,554
Nice timing, grandpa rick!

529
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,624
<i>Tochter aus elysium...</i>

530
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,626
Uh... Hi, remember me?

531
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,028
You shot me on that table,

532
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:59,297
And the near-death
experience got me reflecting.

533
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,699
I didn't used to be like this.

534
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,634
I-I... Uh, ate a kid.

535
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,903
It was dark, and I thought
he was a grown-up.

536
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,372
Ever since then, I haven't
eaten anybody at all.

537
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,174
I think I was channeling
all that pent-up

538
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:10,509
Eating energy into this job.

539
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,110
But now...

540
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,115
Thank you for freeing me.

541
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,719
Classic "tower man."

542
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,565
Almost too on the
nose. Right, morty?

543
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,857
Sure. I mean,
whatever you say, rick.

544
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:27,726
Y-you know best! I
trust you implicitly.

545
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:28,927
Is he alright?

546
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,395
Oh, yeah, he's fine.

547
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,132
Got him all out,
every last piece.

548
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,815
What's with the
jacked-up "roy" machine?

549
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,431
Shouldn't you be
taking that to repairs?

550
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:39,872
Nah, special order.

551
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,607
Some rich douche wants
his last game to keep running.

552
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,054
Hooked it up to
an external battery.

553
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,522
We're just supposed to store it.

554
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:46,789
Weird. Yeah, and get this.

555
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,859
The game's still
going, but roy's dead.

556
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,126
What? Yeah, he's just a corpse

557
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,728
Floating at the
edge of outer space,

558
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,730
But for some reason
the game won't restart

559
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,621
'cause it's centered on
some old lady living a full life.

560
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,223
Hmm. Sounds bad.

561
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,024
Well, put it in there.

562
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,010
Hey is anybody that wants
this later gonna be able to...

563
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:10,569
Huh? Oh, yeah, everything's
cataloged and tracked.

564
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,771
People got the wrong idea
from the size of the space,

565
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,217
But it's all
supported digitally.

566
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,952
So I can put it
anywhere. Here's fine?

567
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,243
That's as fine as anywhere else!

568
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,417
Why isn't anyone attacking him?

569
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,729
It's freezing out.

570
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,219
No, I think it's the sign.

571
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,734
Well, the sign from "die
hard 3" was clearly racist.

572
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:06,090
Obviously. But I think
we went too broad.

573
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,293
"everybody"? I mean,
who is that offending?

574
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:09,828
Everybody?

575
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:13,565
At this point, why even do it?

576
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:16,434
I wish my brother
was still alive.

577
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,437
