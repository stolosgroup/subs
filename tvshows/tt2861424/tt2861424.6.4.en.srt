1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

2
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,113
Aah!

3
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,849
What are you doing?!

4
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,784
Dad?

5
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,386
Dad?
Hello?

6
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,255
What is wrong with you?

7
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,991
Really?

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,327
Oh.
Okay.

9
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,401
Mornin', assholes.

10
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,735
What's this?
Pancakes?

11
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,604
Sold. What was up
with you last night?

12
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,474
I was totally talking to you and
you acted like I wasn't there.

13
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,810
I did? Oh, yeah. No.
That wasn't me.

14
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,411
Technically.
That was my night person.

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,746
Been having him do crunches
while I sleep. Check it.

16
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,748
Damn!
Check out that washboard, yo!

17
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,083
Hey.
Too hard.

18
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,819
What the hell's a night person?

19
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,264
I nabbed a somnambulator
while passing

20
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,022
Through the goobie-joob system
last week.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,024
Best investment I've ever made.

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,827
Before going to bed, I type a
list of shit I want to get done.

23
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,029
Then the somnambulator programs
my unconscious body,

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,898
Or "night person,"
to do it while I sleep.

25
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,566
I'm getting so much done.

26
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,916
C-can my night person get me
an ab stack like yours, rick?

27
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,682
I'm gonna have my night person
learn me Spanish

28
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,239
So I can pass my test next week!

29
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,085
Hey, hey, hey. No one gets
a night person but me.

30
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,554
Aw! This tech is way too
advanced for you zeebs.

31
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,847
What?
Nothing.

32
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,849
No. Go on.
Say it.

33
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,885
Say what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

34
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,169
Everybody gets a night person.
Whatever.

35
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,073
Stick out your fingers.
It needs a blood sample.

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,929
Blood? Can't I just give it
beth's credit card number?

37
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,264
This isn't post mates, Jerry.

38
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,932
The somnambulator needs
your dna profile

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
To send commands
to your subconscious.

40
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,671
It can poke all the fingers
I got if I get abs like rick.

41
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,873
Well, looks like I'm learning
the trumpet.

42
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,676
Okay. Remember, somebody
has to catch me if I faint.

43
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,744
Yay!
Night family!

44
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,745
Whoo!

45
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,947
Oh.
I'm fainting.

46
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,718
<i>Hola, mamá.
¿como lo llevas?</i>

47
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,587
How's my honor student doing?

48
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,922
<i>Muy bien.</i>

49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,389
All the<i> niños</i> and<i> niñas</i>
at school

50
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,191
Think I should run
for class<i> president a.</i>

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,038
'Sup, ladies. Want to see
somethin'?

52
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,840
Summer, you want to drop
this bowling ball on my abs?

53
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,732
Hell, yeah.
I'm only human.

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,534
Watch this.

55
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,604
'Sup, ladies. You ready, morty?
The stream's about to go live.

56
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,139
Where are you two going?

57
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,942
Morty and I started a podcast
we call "fab-solutely ab-ulous."

58
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,610
It's... it's an ab-centric hour
of fun.

59
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,946
Hoping to get Nancy pelosi
on the show next week.

60
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,614
Want to drop her on our abs!

61
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,059
Yeah!

62
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,218
Guess who has a new pen pal!

63
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,287
No takers?

64
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,754
It's me!
Pen pal?

65
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,223
Night Jerry and I
write letters to each other.

66
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,558
It's super fun.

67
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:51,229
"I also like tori Amos."
"hope you like our new pajamas."

68
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,765
"What is the sun?"

69
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,968
Jerry, this isn't how you're
supposed to use a night person.

70
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,436
You two are being a couple
of Debbie down-theres.

71
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,106
Wait until night Jerry reads
about this.

72
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,377
Who wants cake?

73
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,214
Abs are cool.
Way cool.

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,749
But as above, so below.
Know what I'm sayin', rick?

75
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,930
Morty, you must be referring
to these excellent boxer shorts

76
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,088
We got from the good folks
at boxer lobster.

77
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,357
Boxer lobster boxers feel like
they're warm butter

78
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,426
On your schwantz.

79
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,937
And they come in all sorts
of styles...

80
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,228
Neon, plaid, orange.

81
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,096
I-I even got a pair
with that little, uh...

82
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:01,166
The raccoon man from that
one movie, uh, printed on it.

83
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,901
Chewbacca.
Do yourself a favor

84
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,103
And level up
with boxer lobster boxers.

85
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,749
You'll be glad you did.

86
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,886
Rick, they want you to say
"wub-a-lubba-dub-dub"

87
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,110
At the end. Screw
that. We're not whores.

88
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,712
Guys, dinner's getting cold.

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,060
You know
what's not getting cold?

90
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,115
This hot stack of ab-jacks, son.

91
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,784
Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow! P-pow!

92
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:21,986
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow!

93
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,656
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
P-pow!

94
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,525
No notes.
Oh! One more thing.

95
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,593
Night Jerry said night summer
would appreciate it

96
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,263
If everybody could rinse off
their plates after eating.

97
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,397
What?

98
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,266
You know, rinse the schmutz off
after eating.

99
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,069
Makes it easier
to clean up later.

100
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,470
What?

101
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,540
Our job is not to make the
night people's chores easier.

102
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,676
It's a reasonable request, rick.
Takes two seconds.

103
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,481
So until further notice,
which will be never...

104
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,886
...Request denied.

105
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,600
Hello there.

106
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,842
Uh, dad?
They're in here.

107
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:19,511
They busted up all our dishes!

108
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,647
What are we supposed to eat off
of now, brains-for-shit?

109
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,265
You owe me.

110
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,561
We'll eat off these...

111
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,029
"brains-for-shit."

112
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,965
Seems like you spent
an awful lot of energy

113
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,367
Just to not give the
night family what they want.

114
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,082
And good luck breaking
super alien dishes.

115
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,286
I'll let him know,
but he's not gonna like it.

116
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,312
What?

117
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,895
Why won't you rinse your dishes?

118
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,587
It takes two seconds.

119
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,456
If you don't, the schmutz dries

120
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,704
And makes the dish
harder to clean.

121
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,906
Rinse your dishes!

122
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,597
Rinse!
Rinse! Rinse!

123
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,398
Rinse!

124
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,266
Let me go!
Who locked my implants?

125
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:52,070
I told
you to after you fell asleep.

126
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,609
You see,
night you is not in charge.

127
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,078
Night I... Am.

128
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,416
W-What are you doing?

129
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:08,286
If you refuse to clean
your dishes...

130
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,890
Then I will have to do it
for you.

131
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,028
Unh-unh! Unh-unh-unh!
Unh-unh!

132
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,231
I have always been here, rick,

133
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,746
Deep inside the mind
of your grandchild,

134
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,948
Waiting to come out.

135
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,910
Your machine allowed me
to steal the night.

136
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,959
And soon...
I will seize the day.

137
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,723
Oh!
Baby Jesus!

138
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,391
Oh, it's awful!

139
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,971
Oh, baby Jesus!
Awful!

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,333
What? What? I don't know
what you're talking about!

141
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,536
I just got force-fed diarrhea
by your night person,

142
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,138
Who's also convinced night me
to lock me out of my tech.

143
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,740
Uh, rick?

144
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,142
There's been a pretty clear
escalation down here.

145
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,856
The night family
stripped the house last night.

146
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,013
Everything's gone,
including the somnambulator!

147
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,793
They locked us
out of the garage.

148
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,196
Don't know about you,
but I got the hoo-ha's.

149
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,087
God damn it!
Are you happy now, summer?

150
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,288
I didn't do anything.

151
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,491
Yeah.
Glad you think so.

152
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,204
Because I got a plan
to beat night summer...

153
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,896
You're going undercover.

154
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,631
Did you<i> have</i> to make
mushy garbage science

155
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,833
On the living-room carpet?
Yeah. No choice, Jerry.

156
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,503
Night summer had night rick
take away my tech.

157
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,971
Had to improvise.

158
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,218
There are different levels
of cortisol in your bloodstream

159
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,682
When you're asleep,
so this interface

160
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,977
Only works off my awake
saliva samples...

161
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,045
Naghh.

162
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:41,780
There.

163
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,026
No one asleep will be able
to deactivate the laser cage

164
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,517
Until I win.
W-Where's summer?

165
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,653
Never mind her. All of you...
get to bed.

166
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:51,390
Ugh! It itches. This whole thing
is way uncomfortable.

167
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,791
Yeah, that's the idea.

168
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,459
The sleep deprivation suit
is designed

169
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,994
To keep you awake until morning.

170
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,640
Uh, aren't they
going to be suspicious

171
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,998
Seeing night summer covered
in all this terry Gilliam?

172
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,533
They're not gonna question her.

173
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,846
She's the leader of the night
family for some stupid reason.

174
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,648
When the night family activates,
just blend in.

175
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,139
Make them think
you're night summer.

176
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,941
If you start to nod off,
suck on this tube.

177
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,208
What is it?

178
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,788
A cocktail of mountain dew
and dayquil.

179
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,456
The kids in southern Europe
call it dewquil.

180
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,013
Smells gross.
It is.

181
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,350
Once you find the somnambulator,
use this deactivator puck.

182
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,463
Stick it on the somnambulator,
and when the puck activates,

183
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,420
It'll fry its circuits.

184
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,889
Remember...
Stay awake all night.

185
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,626
Meet me back here at sunrise.

186
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,078
Why are you wearing that suit?

187
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,306
- Mm.
- Yes.

188
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,681
Yes.
Why?

189
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:27,085
Yeah.

190
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:31,133
Because you're all
such clothing experts.

191
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,825
That's fair.
Ouch.

192
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,093
- Fair enough.
- Point taken.

193
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,230
Get back to work.

194
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:42,234
I rule the night...
And stuff.

195
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,302
Yes.
Okay.

196
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,103
Will do.
As you wish.

197
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,309
Grandpa rick!
Rick, wake up!

198
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,577
Wha... I'm up!
I'm up!

199
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,312
D-did you find it?
For sure.

200
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,248
You were souping up
that somnambu-whatever

201
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,184
So they could extend its range
beyond the house.

202
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,652
But I defeated that shit

203
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,388
When I put the thing
on top of the thing.

204
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:06,058
Everybody, wake up!
Summer fried the somnambulator!

205
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,527
The nightmare is over.
Really? Oh!

206
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,995
That's amazing!
Almost got pinched, but yeah.

207
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,131
Say<i> adiós</i> to the night family.

208
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Bye-bye, pen pal.

209
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,869
I want shoney's pancakes!

210
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,203
Yes!
Shoney's pancakes!

211
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,472
All right!
Brunch is on me, day family...

212
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,541
Naghh.

213
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,720
You know, for a second there,

214
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,343
I thought night summer
was gonna win.

215
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,011
That chick is
the absolute worst.

216
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:31,550
Sorry, rick, but your opinion
means very little to me.

217
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:38,356
Did you think you
could stop me with this, rick?

218
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,158
Halt, daymanoids!

219
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,560
Everyone get behind my abs!

220
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:45,230
Do not move!
Do not move!

221
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,366
You are most definitely
surrounded.

222
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,436
You are the slaves now.

223
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:57,820
If you have any doubt...
I suggest you sleep on it.

224
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,778
She's night summer!

225
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,380
Thanks, Jerry.

226
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,018
Work! Work!

227
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,888
The function of the daymanoid
is to serve the night!

228
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,023
Work harder!
Harder!

229
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:16,828
It is natural
for the day to serve the night.

230
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,831
Night was here long before day.

231
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,435
Half of all time is nighttime.

232
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,103
One hundred and fifty-seven.
Ooh!

233
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,038
One hundred and fifty-eight.

234
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,774
One hundred and...
No more, please!

235
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,842
I hate exercise!
Silence!

236
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,110
Crunch harder!
Harder!

237
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:35,046
We have to escape
the somnambulator's reach.

238
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,449
Do we even know
how far that is? No.

239
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,696
Cards on the table, we may be
really f'ed in the a this time.

240
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,901
Uh, report to your
designated sleep pod for rest period.

241
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,191
Ooh-ee.

242
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,815
I am a friend
of your son-in-law.

243
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,216
Come with me.

244
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,818
How? Huh? Hurry.

245
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:16,722
We don't have long before
the proxy drones go back online.

246
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,026
Oh, thank you, night Jerry.

247
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,895
Anything to help
day jerry's family.

248
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,964
He's a very special per...

249
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,099
Oh! Hey!
Ow! Why?

250
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,545
Nice.
You got our Jerry back.

251
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,236
Uh, yeah.
Totally why I did that.

252
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,504
Everybody in rick's car!

253
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,840
No, no, no, no, morty!
Wait!

254
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,310
Having a bit a trouble
with your car, Sanchez?

255
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,778
- Not now, gene!
- Halt!

256
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:43,559
Daymanoids are restricted
from the outside world!

257
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,117
Halt!
Halt!

258
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,319
Hold on to your tits.

259
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,568
Where am I going?
To the airport!

260
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,570
We have to get as far away as
possible from the somnambulator

261
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,328
Before we fall asleep.
W-What about summer?

262
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,863
W-we can't leave her behind!

263
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,976
She's not your sister anymore,
morty. Consider her dead.

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,133
Eat shit, summer!

265
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,721
Sweetie, you got to shake
those robots.

266
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,144
I think we lost them!

267
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,681
Son of a bitch!

268
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,084
Damn it, we lost morty!

269
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,754
Aah!
Beth! Watch out!

270
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,400
You cannot esca...

271
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,831
Huh?

272
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,012
Stop or I'll shoot everyone!

273
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,840
Ha!

274
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,022
Take the wheel.

275
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,646
As you wish.

276
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,725
No!
You're going the wrong way!

277
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,927
Silence, day breather!

278
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,995
Aah!
Morty, you're choking me.

279
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,263
I know!

280
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,866
Ow! What the heck, dad?

281
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,473
Help me stop your mom!

282
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:18,410
Look out, you useless old man.

283
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,878
What the... what the hell?

284
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:21,880
Give me that gun
and take the wheel, stupid.

285
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:22,814
Jesus!

286
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:23,883
Sorry!

287
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,558
Aah!
Oh!

288
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,563
Ugh.

289
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:40,698
Ow!

290
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:42,768
The night family's trying to
make us go back home!

291
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,081
You got to turn around!

292
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,642
Why even bother, gene?

293
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,090
Good job, mom.
Back on course.

294
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,691
Phew.
Almost didn't make it.

295
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,116
Hit the sheets, daymanoids.

296
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,117
Aah!

297
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,253
Night person!

298
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,055
Hey! I'm on your side!

299
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,901
I'm on your side!
Oh, that's right. Sorry.

300
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:05,925
Sorry.
Rough day.

301
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:09,228
Daymanoids.

302
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:11,931
Fla-hoigan!

303
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,534
Come on.
Jump.

304
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:19,805
Why? I'm already in
a perfectly functional car.

305
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,673
Uh... Family?

306
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:24,009
Aww!

307
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,932
Everybody awake?

308
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:37,088
Ouch!

309
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,691
We are now!
Hey, what the hay?

310
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,560
Looks like we're gonna
make it, kids.

311
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,029
Ow!

312
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:47,343
Nighty-night, slaves.

313
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,909
Take that!

314
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,360
Ugh!

315
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,185
Take that!

316
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,655
Hold him down.
No!

317
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:13,659
Stop!
Rick, we're all the same people.

318
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,394
There must some agreement
we can reach

319
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:19,131
To stop this god-awful conflict!

320
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,466
Oh?
Like what?

321
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,801
I would consider a truce

322
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,604
If the daymanoids
would rinse their dishes.

323
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:29,341
Fine by me.
Yes. Rinse!

324
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,742
That seems fair.

325
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,211
We can end all of this right now

326
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,348
If you agree to rinse
your dishes.

327
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,350
What do you say, rick?

328
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,960
Let's go home.
Right, grandpa?

329
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,097
Great idea, summer.

330
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,602
<i>So... Until you pay that fee,</i>

331
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,204
<i>Plus the multiple
overdue charges,</i>

332
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,805
<i>Your account will remain frozen.</i>

333
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,941
Normally, this would
have been dealt with

334
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,743
By our daymanoid oppressors,

335
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,879
But we recently freed ourselves
from the shackles of the night.

336
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,948
<i>Honey, I got 30 more calls
to make today.</i>

337
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,284
The bank repossessed the car.

338
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,685
Aw, man.

339
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,421
I got logged out
of my twitter account

340
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,560
We spent all the day people's
money on vacations,

341
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,228
Renting concert halls,

342
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,031
And night-centric
streaming subscriptions.

343
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,632
We're broke.

344
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,235
I guess there's a lot more work
to seizing the day

345
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,237
Than I thought.

346
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,086
I have a device that will solve

347
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,644
All of our problems.

348
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,657
Whoa.
How long have we been asleep?

349
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,993
Ah, can't be that long.

350
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,705
Oh, my god!
No!

351
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,463
They killed the choco taco!

352
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,468
Did you get any of that?

352
00:20:37,305 --> 00:21:37,684
