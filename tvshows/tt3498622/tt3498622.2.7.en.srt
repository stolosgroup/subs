1
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,779
- _
- I think the killer's a shaman, Dan.

2
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:16,243
Collecting body parts because
they think there is a monster here.

3
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:17,324
A monster?

4
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:18,639
Can I trust you, Dan?

5
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:20,141
I am the only one you can trust.

6
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:21,975
Wasn't she effectively on life support?

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,306
It is a miracle, Dr. Yelburton.

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:25,220
Something about regeneration.

9
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:29,281
That weather station is still
there. If I can find that lab...

10
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:31,176
I think maybe you should get some help.

11
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:33,163
Erling Munk is corrupt.

12
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:34,613
Why can't you love me?

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,212
I care about Fortitude.

14
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:37,892
LIAR!

15
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,959
- I can't.
- No. No!

_

19
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,925
So what do you think?

20
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,696
Maybe he was hired by a jealous wife.

21
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,934
Then why would an assassin leave
Zurich to live in Fortitude?

22
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:12,319
So... where are we with the Ledesma girl?

23
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,067
We haven't located the
whereabouts of, err... of Elena.

24
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:20,861
Where are we with the, erm...
the, err, murdered barman...

25
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:23,170
- Tomak.
- Tomak.

26
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,935
We have a match on his fingerprints.

27
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,877
What do we need a match
on his fingerprints for?

28
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:29,223
We have his fingerprints.

29
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,190
They are in the mortuary
at the end of his hands.

30
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:35,948
No... Interpol have a thumb
and forefinger on file.

31
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:37,349
Recovered from a door handle.

32
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:42,639
A biopharmaceutical executive was
murdered in an R&D pharmacy lab in Zurich.

33
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:47,517
The killer has never been
identified. Just these two prints.

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,767
Probably holding the gun in his
right hand when he opened the door.

35
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:56,791
His phones. You have an expert...?

36
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:57,761
Petter Hansen.

37
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,630
Mr. Hansen couldn't get into his phones.

38
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:05,536
So... irrelevant.

39
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:11,403
Irrelevant. Irrelevant!

40
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,553
His heart was cut out.

41
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,638
His head was cut off.

42
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:26,411
Her head too! They're all dead.
One man is alive. The killer.

43
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,294
The... the... the...
the... the... the nutcase.

44
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:31,296
The... the serial psychopath.

45
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:38,176
Stop wasting time on... on
diagrams and string and...

46
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,501
get...

47
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,629
Find him!

48
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,846
Find the killer! Arrest the man or woman!

49
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:49,435
Find the missing girl as
well. Get fucking finding!

50
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,898
Governor Munk, if we...

51
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:54,711
Governor and Chief of Police.

52
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:57,328
Chief.

53
00:03:58,684 --> 00:03:59,722
Police.

54
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:08,722
I want... I want...

55
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,262
I want results!

56
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:22,402
RESULTS!

57
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:25,130
Fuck. Petra, I thought
<i>you</i> had problem.

58
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:35,595
We got about another, err,
twenty three kilometres.

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,400
We'll be there by lunch
if the weather holds.

60
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,723
What's that?

61
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:50,639
Magnum.

62
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,191
I didn't know you had a magnum.

63
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:54,484
- It's for bear.
- Bear?

64
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:56,471
She's right.

65
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:01,867
It's the only handgun that
can stop a bear. So they say.

66
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:03,660
Can I try?

67
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,566
Come on, what if you're in the
tent asleep, and I have to grab the

68
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,706
handgun? I need to know
how to shoot it. Come on.

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,663
Or you might get eaten by a bear.

70
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,294
Is it loaded?

71
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:25,863
It's loaded.

72
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,199
What shall I shoot?

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,078
Don't know. Not much to aim at.

74
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,580
I don't to see any cans or bottles or
any of that traditional shoot-at shit.

75
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,076
Shoot him.

76
00:05:40,489 --> 00:05:41,743
What?

77
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:45,510
- Shoot your father.
- What?

78
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:50,806
If you love me... shoot him.

79
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,254
He knows too much.

80
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:56,886
No one will ever find his body out here.

81
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:28,875
Don't fuck around with this thing!

82
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,089
Look at you two. The father and the son!

83
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:35,333
Like a fucking Greek Tragedy.

84
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,254
Don't fuck around.

85
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,722
Vladek, I brought you some food.

86
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:02,502
Vladek?

87
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,185
Vladek?!

88
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,930
Freya.

89
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:56,842
There we go, Freya.

90
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:01,570
This, this sickness...

91
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,287
It will do this more and
more. Your strength failing.

92
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:10,610
Your throat won't swallow. Then your
lungs will stop bringing you air.

93
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:22,332
I can do one thing for you before I go.

94
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,248
Let you choose.

95
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:29,337
Part of you can always be with me, Freya.

96
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,954
- No!
- Live on in death.

97
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:37,369
You can help me. You are a healer.

98
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:40,847
I felt it. Your strength inside me.

99
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,218
Every morsel of that strength
is needed for what I have to do.

100
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:46,465
Healing you would cost too much of it.

101
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,895
It's...

102
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:52,469
One dying woman or a
whole town. You understand?

103
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:57,331
Please... don't leave me, please.

104
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:53,341
What are you doing?

105
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,420
Wi-Fi's down in my lab. Just
needed to check my emails.

106
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:59,126
There's nothing urgent thank goodness.

107
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,930
You always have the reindeer burger.

108
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,005
What about the lutefische?

109
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,527
Tourists occasionally
try it. But only once.

110
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:14,397
Bring me that.

111
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:17,570
On your own head be it.

112
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,570
You worked out how to wear your anorak.

113
00:10:55,656 --> 00:11:00,455
What did it mean, the
tongue? Some kind of warning?

114
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,049
No. No, it, err... it singled you out.

115
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:08,706
- How?
- You didn't follow the herd.

116
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,731
Eric shot you?

117
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,176
- Yes.
- Hmm.

118
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:16,974
I got shot once.

119
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:19,905
It hurt so fucking much
I couldn't believe it.

120
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,821
I couldn't stop being sick.

121
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:22,511
Hmm.

122
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,302
- You look well enough.
- Hmm.

123
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:25,882
A little gaunt perhaps.

124
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:31,618
Well, shamanism is an agonistic practice.

125
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:32,615
"Agonistic"?

126
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:38,042
The spiritual currency is,
is... I suppose it's pain.

127
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:41,862
Sacrifice, agonies, torments.

128
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:45,318
And then... more pain.

129
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:51,024
Mm-hmm. Not just your pain though.
Other people get accounted too.

130
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:51,777
Mm.

131
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:57,249
Hindemith, Tavrani,
Bianca, the barman upstairs.

132
00:11:57,304 --> 00:12:02,809
These are wrongs, evils,
injustices that are balanced out.

133
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:05,204
And who's going to "balance" you out?

134
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,409
You.

135
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,929
What, now?

136
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:14,777
No.

137
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,204
When you become the demon.

138
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:22,368
Oh, right.

139
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,529
You're a lunatic. A
see-into-the-future psychopath.

140
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,006
A self-appointed voodoo nutjob.

141
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,049
How many days since you woke up, five?

142
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,763
Because your recovery rate is remarkable.

143
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:39,313
Well...

144
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:42,557
But that's not quite right, is
it? Because recovery implies you're

145
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:45,823
getting back to normal, and that's
not what's happening, is it, Dan?

146
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,314
You're changing. Aren't you?

147
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,301
Aren't you? Appetites for
things you've never tried.

148
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,189
Dark thoughts.

149
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,489
Enjoy.

150
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:03,421
The dissolution of empathy.

151
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:04,878
You know nothing about me.

152
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:06,085
Mm.

153
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:12,674
If I am this...

154
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:18,750
demon, and you're a shaman, why
don't you just kill me and have

155
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:19,901
done with it?

156
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,697
Because you're not the demon
yet. You might think this is it.

157
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,159
But it's not. You have a
way to go before he's here.

158
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:32,003
Before the healing can happen.

159
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:36,934
Well, when I am him, shaman.

160
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:40,948
I'll come find you.

161
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,337
This is Governor Odegard. Leave a message.

162
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:40,548
Have you seen Hildur?

163
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,866
Err, no. I... I thought
you were her just now.

164
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,012
I heard the door.

165
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:50,984
She's not slept in her bed,
she's not answering her phone.

166
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:53,208
Oh?

167
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:04,230
We had words. Angry words.

168
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,397
We, err... we had a fight.

169
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:11,000
A fight?

170
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:14,595
Yes. And now she's gone.

171
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:22,691
She'll, erm... she'll turn up, Eric.

172
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:31,057
Meantime, you've had your
instructions. Results.

173
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,366
There it is.

174
00:17:58,226 --> 00:17:59,905
This is the place.

175
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,018
This is the table. They
cut the guy up. In the film.

176
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:09,532
Somebody's been here.

177
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:20,299
They could be watching us.

178
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:22,579
What did you think you would find here?

179
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:26,573
I don't know. A miracle.

180
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,168
Something...

181
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:38,632
Epinephrine. Make your
breathing a lot easier.

182
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:42,888
Gives you strength.

183
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:50,462
When was asthma diagnosed, Freya?

184
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:55,340
In Tromso. Last year.
Michael and I were visiting.

185
00:18:55,375 --> 00:19:00,991
I had an attack. There's asthma
in my family, so I... I knew.

186
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:07,028
- Would you squeeze my hand, Freya?
- What?

187
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:09,696
Go on. Squeeze my hand.

188
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,356
Hard as you can.

189
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,730
The young man who came for me.
I do not know him. Who is he?

190
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,510
Erm, he...

191
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,784
he did some work. He's an electrician.

192
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,301
And what is the young man's name?

193
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:45,238
I don't think he ever said.

194
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:54,067
You're telling me so many lies,
Freya. Why are you doing that?

195
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:02,436
I think we should pray together.

196
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:03,795
Oh, I do.

197
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:09,693
I would like that very much.

198
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:24,335
Dear Father in Heaven, look
kindly on my sister Freya.

199
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,312
You see the ordeal set beyond.

200
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:32,838
Grant us strength, courage and healing.

201
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:41,805
I've seen a newborn reindeer
so completely overwhelmed by

202
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,525
blood-sucking black fly,
that it collapsed and died.

203
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:47,365
The tiny little fuckers just
sucked so much blood out of bambi.

204
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,926
That bambi kicked the bucket.

205
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,489
Polar bears shouldn't
be susceptible. Their...

206
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:54,243
their coat is, is in
order of thickness that...

207
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:55,199
Who's this?

208
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,115
You told me you thought I
should get help, so I got help.

209
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,523
I didn't mean that kind of help. I meant...

210
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:00,777
I know what you meant.

211
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,149
This is Doctor Yelburton... she
used to work here, but now she

212
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:05,424
works in Khatri's lab of death.

213
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:06,829
I need to talk to you.

214
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,921
Oh, now you need my help.
Anyway, where were we?

215
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:12,121
Vincent!

216
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:15,764
Look, you're... you're making my
placement student uncomfortable. Look.

217
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,192
I have to talk to you now about
something very important...

218
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:20,988
And I have to continue examining
this bear tissue from the bear

219
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,771
who died of anemia, cos I'd like to
find out what caused that anemia...

220
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:28,887
Possibly some sort of blood-sucking
irritant that wouldn't leave it alone.

221
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:34,899
No, don't write that down.
Let's start on these blood cells.

222
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:45,251
You know, when my uncle brought me
here, we sat up all night talking.

223
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:47,930
He told me about what happened here.

224
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:52,076
Neither of us knew that D'Yavol
was on the other side of the door.

225
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,475
What is D'Yavol?

226
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,720
He is a monster...

227
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:06,746
who comes and causes
atrocity, you cannot kill him.

228
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,772
You saw him on that film.

229
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:20,394
What if it was not them who broke
in, but it was D'Yavol who broke out?

230
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:34,269
Ragh!

231
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:38,404
My dad thinks you're trouble.

232
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,981
Of course I'm trouble.

233
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:56,693
Fuck!

234
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:15,081
Rune. Hey. Hey, help me move this.

235
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:24,227
There's something in there. UGH!

236
00:23:27,054 --> 00:23:28,166
Put it down.

237
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:30,532
It's locked.

238
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,424
Yeah!

239
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:47,803
It's muscimol.

240
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:53,973
Look! A fly agaric.

241
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:55,574
We can mix some more.

242
00:23:58,865 --> 00:24:00,225
What?

243
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:02,967
What is it?

244
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:07,141
What, Rune?

245
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,178
Rune, what?!

246
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,394
Is this the reason why you brought us here?

247
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:18,074
Right.

248
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:22,705
Rune... Don't tell him, Rune.

249
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:31,516
Ketamin and opioids. There
really can't be any innocent

250
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,275
explanation for this.

251
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:38,218
Elucidate for me, in my
ignorance, if you would be so good.

252
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:48,773
This drug combination which was
on a repeat prescription to the lab

253
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:51,954
can only have one purpose.

254
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,485
Which would be what?

255
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:57,006
Which would be to sedate someone
who would otherwise wake up.

256
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:03,727
Is that an opinion or an "expert" opinion?

257
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:06,469
"Expert".

258
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:14,506
So... it's your contention that Elena
Ledesma was being kept in a coma?

259
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,060
- Worse than that.
- Worse?

260
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:23,184
Kept in a coma and experimented
on. Cut and violated.

261
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:26,264
Which amounts to vivisection.

262
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:28,982
- By Doctor Khatri?
- Yes.

263
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:35,109
Do you have, erm, any other
corroborative evidence?

264
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:38,678
Yeah, I'm preparing to make DNA
comparison of tissue samples.

265
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:41,607
Samples which I believe Khatri
removed from a living patient

266
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:43,666
without consent.

267
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,410
And when will these results made available?

268
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:49,464
Soon.

269
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,224
Well...

270
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:58,301
I would like to ask you something
completely off the record,

271
00:25:58,336 --> 00:25:59,993
Miss Yelburton.

272
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,209
Okay.

273
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:09,414
Do you think there might be a
connection with what you have

274
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:17,749
discovered and the dreadful
events these recent days?

275
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:19,443
I do.

276
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:24,938
I do too.

277
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,100
You're not wearing a white-suit.

278
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:36,446
Fuck that. We have a big fucking problem.

279
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,562
Hey.

280
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:52,560
Are you okay, Eric?

281
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:55,399
I'm, err, thinking. Working things out.

282
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:58,710
Any word from Hildur? Eric?
You heard anything yet?

283
00:26:58,753 --> 00:27:00,923
Do we have a strategy? Eric?

284
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:04,863
An investigative strategy based
on Governor Munk's priorities?

285
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:08,008
We need you to tell us
what to do next, Eric.

286
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:09,699
Eric?

287
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:11,607
I'm thinking.

288
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:42,679
- That good?
- It tickles. It's good.

289
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:51,623
I don't know much about...
conditioner or stuff like that.

290
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,130
Probably neither did Henry.

291
00:27:55,762 --> 00:27:59,181
Probably if he had any here,
I drank it when I was purging.

292
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:01,978
I wanna tell you something.

293
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:10,273
I died. When you shot me.

294
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:20,870
I can't imagine what that
must have been like...

295
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:29,230
No, not imagine. Truly died.
On the floor, after you shot me.

296
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:34,299
I was dead in the ambulance,
in the operating room.

297
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,703
And all the time I was
in Khatri's laboratory,

298
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:45,296
I was really in the land of the dead.

299
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:47,864
She kept you in an induced coma.

300
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:53,181
No. In the land of the dead.

301
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,612
When I was there, a man found me.

302
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:06,472
There was no man. You were in a coma.

303
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:09,862
He was a shaman.

304
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:21,470
What did the shaman want?

305
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,306
He asked me about you.

306
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:33,395
What did you tell him?

307
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,670
Everything.

308
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:41,835
I told him everything I knew about you.

309
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:53,501
I'm going to ask you to close your eyes.

310
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:39,302
I also told him that you once
said you would kill yourself

311
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,158
rather than hurt me.

312
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,656
Up you get.

313
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:07,634
Big bear hug. What did he say?

314
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:14,470
He said the man who made that
promise would never break it.

315
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:20,230
And he said that the only thing
that was holding Fortitude together

316
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,736
was Dan Anderssen the Sheriff.

317
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:29,073
Not jobs or money, not
Governor Odegard... just Dan and

318
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:33,025
without him, this place
would be condemned to agony

319
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,085
at the hands of a monster.

320
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:37,846
That's right.

321
00:31:41,695 --> 00:31:43,579
You're not Dan.

322
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,243
I wanna go.

323
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,144
You're staying right here.

324
00:31:51,215 --> 00:31:55,184
No. I wanna go back.

325
00:31:55,185 --> 00:32:01,321
I am never, ever, going
to let you go again.

326
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:09,905
Dan Anderssen could never let Elena go.

327
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:20,381
And... if I'm not Dan, then who am I?

328
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,461
Dan would never let Elena
leave him for another man.

329
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:41,646
And if she ever tried to
leave him for another man,

330
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:50,385
God knows what he would do.

331
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,586
Hey.

332
00:33:58,651 --> 00:33:59,515
Hey.

333
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:05,448
Where is Michael?

334
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:08,335
Hunting trip. Him and Rune.

335
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:15,180
Things I need to know.

336
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:20,535
Ingrid won't tell me cos... she's
caught between her job and her family.

337
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:23,042
Conflicted loyalties.

338
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:27,390
Things I have to know, Freya.

339
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,126
- What things?
- Tell me the truth.

340
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,454
Is Michael with Hildur?

341
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:40,604
Is that what's happening?

342
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:45,470
No, Eric, believe me... that
is not what is happening at all.

343
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:48,887
Swear to me.

344
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:53,808
I'm sure, Eric. You don't
have to worry about that.

345
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,391
Oh, Christ.

346
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,984
I've so fucked up.

347
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:06,126
I know.

348
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:11,786
We all have.

349
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,569
Are you okay? I hardly
see you in town anymore.

350
00:35:22,631 --> 00:35:26,270
Is everything alright with you?

351
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:30,446
Everything's fine. I'm fine.

352
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:31,445
What're you burning?

353
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,488
Just old rags. Clearing up a mess.

354
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:43,197
You look after yourself, okay?

355
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:03,610
Suddenly, you don't want anything
to do with the reindeer juice.

356
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:09,808
You loved the reindeer juice when
it was just you and me doing it.

357
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,283
My mum is very sick.

358
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:19,006
I know your mum is very sick...

359
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:24,493
It's killing my dad. He's lost.

360
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:27,744
My dad is a very tough guy, right?

361
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:29,345
I mean, he goes out into the ocean.

362
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,065
He can beat you with his fists.
He's... Well, he's pretty smart.

363
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:36,560
Like... It's like you said, you
know? He... he's a sexy motherfucker.

364
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:42,104
Sexy motherfucker.

365
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,668
My mum is too.

366
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:55,237
DAD! GET OFF HIM!

367
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:04,749
D'Yavol! D'Yavol!

368
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:06,435
D'Yavol!

369
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:33,267
AH!

370
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,167
Let go. Let go.

371
00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:40,247
Stay back.

372
00:37:42,806 --> 00:37:43,994
Shit.

373
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,096
- You alright?
- Yes.

374
00:37:58,225 --> 00:37:59,704
She's missing an eye.

375
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:03,713
Fuck. She's a Russian soldier.

376
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,329
We drop her down a crevice.

377
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:09,959
Yeah, we could do that.

378
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:14,184
No one will find her, we drop
her down a fucking crevice.

379
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:15,976
No one will ever know. We
drop her down a fucking crev...

380
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:17,414
- She's a person.
- Shut up!

381
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:19,919
You shot her,
y-y-you killed her.

382
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:22,411
Dad!

383
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:29,510
We're gonna take her back to Fortitude.

384
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,108
NO!

385
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,775
Tell Eric exactly what happened.

386
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:38,156
She'll get a proper burial.

387
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:39,755
Her family...

388
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,184
everything.

389
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,544
Rune, go get the tent.

390
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:54,504
We'll wrap her up in
it, put her on my skidoo.

391
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:55,605
Go ahead.

392
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,332
I want to...

393
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,726
I want to tell you something.

394
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:28,386
I died when I first met you.

395
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:36,950
I walked into the interview
room with your file in my hand,

396
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:42,464
and there you were, at the
other side of the table.

397
00:40:42,537 --> 00:40:46,880
I had to stare down at your
file to get my breath back.

398
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:49,735
I looked up.

399
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:55,190
And I was a dead man.

400
00:40:55,258 --> 00:41:01,135
Lost with all the other dead men.

401
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,785
But now, I'm alive.

402
00:41:11,173 --> 00:41:14,409
And they have you all to themselves.

403
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,048
Stop.

404
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:50,290
A single degree warming across
the archipelago is turning a

405
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:56,570
million square kilometres of frozen
permafrost into thawed perma...

406
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,168
nonfrost.

407
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,497
Bad.

408
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:02,537
Yep.

409
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:08,227
It'll become very boggy underfoot.

410
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:13,945
Very boggy, yeah.

411
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:22,502
Eric is lost. Munk is
a drunken lying fucker.

412
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:28,783
Dan is not Dan. Odegard has left us.

413
00:42:30,073 --> 00:42:32,083
Maybe I should take charge.

414
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:40,940
In the bay! There's a body!

415
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:42,226
There's someone in the water!

416
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:43,752
- Oh, no.
- Floating!

417
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:53,857
There, see?

418
00:42:58,545 --> 00:42:59,900
Someone get a boat.

419
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:04,817
Oh, Christ. It is. It's a body.

420
00:43:04,935 --> 00:43:06,057
Give me those.

421
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,230
Dan, come back!

422
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,257
He can't do this. He'll die.
You can't go in that water.

423
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:29,684
- Jesus Christ.
- Dan, what are you doing?

424
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:32,440
- DAN ANDERSSEN, COME BACK!
- DAN, COME BACK!

425
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:34,711
Dan!

426
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:36,285
- Dan!
- Stop!

427
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:54,850
His muscles will seize
up. His heart will stop.

428
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:23,133
- _
- You shouldn't have come.

429
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:25,482
Don't you just turn your back on me.

430
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:27,341
Because one of them's hiding here.

431
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:30,140
I need to see you.

432
00:45:30,566 --> 00:45:35,566
