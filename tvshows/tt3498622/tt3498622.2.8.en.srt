1
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:14,015
I am never going to let you go.

2
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:16,478
- _
- Elena Ledesma was being kept in a coma?

3
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:19,159
- And experimented on.
- By Doctor Khatri?

4
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:19,951
Yes.

5
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:23,339
This is the place. In the film.

6
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,478
She is a Russian soldier.

7
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:33,729
You're telling me so many lies, Freya.

8
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:37,140
- Forgive me.
- NO!

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,428
In the bay! There's a body.

12
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:46,077
The lock's been broken.

13
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:04,719
This place is supposed to be abandoned.

14
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,799
Sounds like a petrol engine.

15
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:42,861
Jesus.

16
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:44,819
Is that a head?

17
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,224
Oh, fuck!

18
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,023
You shouldn't have come.

19
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:58,602
AH!

20
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:31,234
I'm off to work now, darling.

21
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,768
I'll see you tonight.

22
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:51,928
Hi.

23
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59,796
I should... I should get to work.

24
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:03,569
It's okay. My mum, she always sleeps late.

25
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:12,005
You know, for me, things
are a bit complicated.

26
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:16,368
Yeah.

27
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,849
I have an unbelievable hangover.

28
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:24,745
Everyone has.

29
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,564
Do you trust me, Mr. Anderssen?

30
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,798
Of course I fucking don't.

31
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,173
Hypothesis.

32
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,212
You were infected by parasitic wasp
larvae. You were trapped somewhere.

33
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,773
Or you trapped yourself.
And you didn't die.

34
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:19,562
And the last time anything
like that happened was in 1942.

35
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,297
The wasp larvae carry a microscopic
parasite into their host.

36
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,006
The host usually dies.

37
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,790
But if it doesn't, I believe
the parasite can somehow alter

38
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:32,638
its genetic code.

39
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:35,749
The host develops great
physical resilience.

40
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:38,642
It's able to regenerate tissue and organs.

41
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:43,185
It can even pull bodies out of the
Arctic water without noticing the cold.

42
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:46,555
My genetic code has changed?

43
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,035
I think it's possible.

44
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,989
I'm not human?

45
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:58,500
Of course you're human. You're
just... different, unique.

46
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:08,465
Another side effect of this genetic
change is uncontrollable violence.

47
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:13,316
A monster!

48
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,116
I didn't say that.

49
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,584
A demon.

50
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:21,044
It's not your fault. You're
just sick. Come with me.

51
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:25,510
Somewhere safe. Somewhere you
can't hurt yourself or anyone else.

52
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,177
Help me find a cure. Help me help you.

53
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:30,947
- Nobody can help me.
- It's not too late.

54
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:39,024
She was awake when you cut her open.

55
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,511
Don't leave town, Mr. Anderssen.

56
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,839
_

57
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,737
Do we know how it happened?

58
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:56,726
I had a look at, erm... erm... at Hildur...

59
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:58,489
It's okay.

60
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,556
She died in the water,
before she could drown.

61
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:04,688
The cold would have shut down her organs.

62
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:09,735
She was unharmed, apart from
some light bruising on her wrists.

63
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:12,470
That was me.

64
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:17,070
We had a fight. The last time I saw her.

65
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:19,360
I held her wrists.

66
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:26,950
You, erm... mustn't blame
yourself. Take some time off.

67
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,128
We'll handle the formalities.

68
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:38,790
Lars Ulvinaune saw her walking
in a daze towards the bay.

69
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:44,230
She was distressed. And also
standing out there by the water.

70
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,840
Where she was found.

71
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,465
You're saying she killed herself?

72
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:57,553
Because I wouldn't listen. Because
I couldn't see what she needed.

73
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:59,186
And now she's dead.

74
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:06,276
Dead.

75
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,735
Dead.

76
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:17,633
Er... Eric, err, pl... please.

77
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,696
Dead.

78
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,002
Dead.

79
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:31,212
DEAD! DEAD! DEAD! DEAD!

80
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,248
DEAD! DEAD!

81
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,065
Eric.

82
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,924
Go get drunk.

83
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,187
That's an order.

84
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,751
We can take it from here.

85
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,122
I'm the governor. You're on sick leave.

86
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:26,242
I'm not sick. And I'm not leaving.

87
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,398
It looks like suicide, Dan.

88
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,870
Suicide?

89
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,554
She and Eric had separated.

90
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,177
They had a terrible fight.

91
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,070
Petter Hansen said they
nearly killed each other.

92
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:40,790
And she was depressed because she
was sacked for defending Fortitude.

93
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,510
Hildur was depressed.

94
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:50,575
Also she'd been drinking,
in her room, and making wild

95
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:53,134
allegations against the government.

96
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:58,979
I should've stopped her, I
should've talked to her, but...

97
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:04,355
Where's her stuff? Her bag.
Her car. Find it. Find it all.

98
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:08,599
You're not the Sheriff
here! You don't give orders!

99
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:17,144
There is a killer hiding somewhere
here, there is a sick woman

100
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,169
who... who'll die unless she gets help.

101
00:11:20,204 --> 00:11:25,117
- We must focus our priorities.
- Yes. But there's only two of us.

102
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,446
Okay, okay... you can help,

103
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:38,560
on a consultancy basis, and
you report directly to me.

104
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:41,066
Everyone reports to me.

105
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:51,253
He... he's drinking, Dan.

106
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:52,547
Who isn't?

107
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,230
What shall we do, Dan?

108
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:28,790
I told you.

109
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:31,275
Who was on duty when he
cut out Tavra's tongue?

110
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,795
Me. That was the night Bianca was found.

111
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:36,994
So how did he get into the cells?

112
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,830
We've had a lot on our plates.

113
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:40,573
It's not magic. You punch in a code.

114
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:44,581
I know. And we just had
the whole system upgraded.

115
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,150
Who upgraded it, Ingrid?

116
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:50,630
Ketil Blakstvedt doesn't
cut people's tongues out.

117
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:52,317
No. He doesn't.

118
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:57,089
We should have thought of that.

119
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:01,070
What about Elena? Am I the only
person that's worried about her?

120
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:02,945
I'm sure she's okay, Ingrid.

121
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,972
Oh. No. No. No. No. No...

122
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,646
The light is gone.

123
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:37,421
Erling Munk.

124
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:38,476
I approached Dan Anderssen.

125
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:41,002
It's obvious he's not going
to co-operate voluntarily.

126
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,497
We'll need some help.

127
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:51,028
The problem is Yelburton! She
knows. She knows everything.

128
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,185
She knows nothing. Just do what I told you.

129
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,900
- I'll deal with her.
- How?

130
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,780
This is the biggest
breakthrough since antibiotics,

131
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:01,044
some reindeer vet with a grudge
isn't going to blow it. Is that clear?

132
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,770
I didn't sign up for this.

133
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,572
You signed up for everything.

134
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:17,656
Vincent!

135
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,652
Can you gimme a hand?

136
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,265
Have you got room in your cold storage?

137
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:32,665
We found her out on the
ice, she's stone dead.

138
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,599
Looks like she got shot.

139
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:36,164
What happened to her eyes?

140
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,933
You tell me?

141
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,820
We've got a trolley inside.

142
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,968
Dr. Khatri working today?

143
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:43,521
She's always at work.

144
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,780
- Hey, Doctor.
- Mr. Lennox?

145
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:22,441
I was... I was wondering to know if maybe
you had, erm... a... had a chance to look

146
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:25,067
at those files from Vukobejina.

147
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:28,500
What's your wife's diagnosis? Can I ask?

148
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:33,345
She's got Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

149
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:37,432
We're years from a cure,
Mr. Lennox. I'm sorry.

150
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:41,354
I know, but y... but you-you saw
that film and you saw those wasps,

151
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:45,020
they changed that guy.
He grew his appendix back.

152
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,786
On reflection, I think it's
all a little far-fetched.

153
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,156
No, no, no, i-it's not, it's real!

154
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,959
I went to that place.

155
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,060
Where they operated on
that guy, in, in the film.

156
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,700
I-It's the old weather station.
And it... I s... I saw it!

157
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:04,940
The-the-the table and the
straps and it happened!

158
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:06,396
I'm sure it did.

159
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:12,632
You, you don't have to patronise
me... I know that you know something.

160
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,890
You could help my wife.

161
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:19,530
Please!

162
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:24,505
I'm sorry.

163
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:30,975
Hey. Hey. I'm not an expert on
parasites, but I play a lot of poker

164
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,850
and I know that you're lying.

165
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,628
Why are you lying to me?

166
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:38,109
Don't you just turn your back on me.

167
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:43,740
Hey! Hey!

168
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:47,980
You know something. I know you do.

169
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,524
God damn you. Why won't you help her?

170
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:57,809
HEY! WHY WON'T YOU HELP HER?!

171
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,180
What?

172
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:20,361
Dad. The governor's dead.

173
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:27,060
Mrs. Odegard. She's dead. I'm really sorry.

174
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:42,246
Natalie Yelburton.

175
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:44,035
Governor.

176
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,704
Okay. I'll be right over.

177
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,605
Hildur's phone is ringing.
So it's not in the water.

178
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,970
And it was here, right? Dan pulled her out.

179
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,770
Yeah. It was right here.

180
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,420
Maybe we should interview Vincent.

181
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,594
Vincent? Do you think he
knows something about this?

182
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:57,663
No.

183
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:02,207
But he's cute.

184
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:21,909
- Michael.
- Hey, sweetheart. We just got back.

185
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:23,452
Did you hear?

186
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:28,722
How... how did it happen?

187
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:34,778
We don't know. Dan pulled
her out of the bay last night.

188
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:36,859
It seems like she just drowned.

189
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,635
Hildur did not "just drown"!

190
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:41,595
We're looking into it, okay?

191
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:46,510
I need to see you. Right now.

192
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,993
You idiot!

193
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:01,879
What's that?

194
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:07,270
These are mushrooms used to make muscimol.

195
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:10,127
So we can guess what's in these flasks.

196
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,322
I'll be taking care of this.

197
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,435
Mrs. Odegard came back from Oslo
on the flight Tuesday morning.

198
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:45,922
She pulled up!

199
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:50,607
And I was here and I told her Tomak
was dead and she asked if she could

200
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:54,722
see Eric and I said "Not a good
time" and she just went up anyway.

201
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:16,651
She came in here to talk to Eric, I
listened from outside the door, but he...

202
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:20,360
he cut her dead and
then someone called her.

203
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:21,720
She had her phone.

204
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:24,040
Yes. But not her handbag.

205
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,068
She must have left that in the car.

206
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:28,553
Do you think it was that
Mulberry bag I really liked?

207
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,772
The dark brown one.

208
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:33,000
I preferred the little black
one, the Yves Saint Laurent.

209
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:35,630
- The one Eric bought her in Paris?
- Yes. For her fortieth.

210
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:37,567
Ah no, she hardly ever used it.

211
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:41,097
So who called her?

212
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,520
Michael?

213
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:45,669
Yes, he wanted to show
the scientists that film.

214
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:52,279
I said to her, "Eric's under a lot
of strain" and she said "I know."

215
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:58,889
And those were the last
words she ever said to me.

216
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,742
Eric. I haven't been here. I just got back.

217
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:31,612
I'm... I'm so sorry.

218
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:47,049
Eric, I-I've been, err, hearing rumours,
people are talking about suicide...

219
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,889
you don't believe that, do you?

220
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,395
What do you want?

221
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,693
Hildur, she didn't kill herself.

222
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:00,092
They should have made you Sheriff!

223
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:12,929
Eric. Hildur told me everything.
About Munk. About this conspiracy.

224
00:23:12,964 --> 00:23:18,510
Oh, no, Jesus fucking Christ... the
fucking bullshit, fucking conspiracy.

225
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:21,800
- No it is not bullshit.
- Erling Munk is a fat, boring bureaucrat.

226
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:24,667
He never even got a parking
fine in his whole fucking life.

227
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:31,600
Goddammit, Eric, Hildur overheard
Munk talking on the phone.

228
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:33,121
She needed help. She needed help!

229
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:40,126
Not some sad ex-boyfriend playing
along to get back in her pants.

230
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:52,606
You know what, Eric? Maybe
you should just sober up and do

231
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,584
your fucking job.

232
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:04,199
You know what, Michael? Maybe you should
have spent more time with your own wife.

233
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:08,350
Maybe you wouldn't have
lost your FUCKING BOAT.

234
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:19,929
Eric!

235
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:26,662
Eric!

236
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:45,961
Hildur didn't kill herself!
Sh-she didn't just drown!

237
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,012
She was silenced.

238
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:54,163
Silenced?

239
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:00,713
Erling Munk's taking money,
and that's why he fired Hildur,

240
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:03,960
and that's why he promoted Eric.

241
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:06,760
And that's why she's dead.

242
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:08,643
Munk killed her?

243
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:13,987
Well, it's... it's not Munk,
it's somebody Munk works for.

244
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:16,362
She had proof that he was corrupt.

245
00:25:16,424 --> 00:25:20,280
All she needed was for
Eric just to follow it up.

246
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:21,929
Where's this proof?

247
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,040
The last time I saw her, right over there,

248
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:33,255
she said that she was onto
something. Something big, connected.

249
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,745
That Munk was controlling it,
and someone was controlling Munk.

250
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:41,680
A few hours later, she was dead.

251
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:46,123
Munk said she was depressed. She
was drinking and saying crazy stuff.

252
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:48,619
Yeah, he would say that. Wouldn't he?

253
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:52,460
It doesn't make sense!
There's nothing valuable here.

254
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:53,500
Nothing at all.

255
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,333
Only rock and snow and water.

256
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:57,689
Yeah, you're right...
that's what it looks like.

257
00:25:57,774 --> 00:26:00,174
Evidently, we're missing something.

258
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:09,593
Dr. Yelburton, thank you for coming.

259
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:15,901
Are you alright?

260
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:21,437
- Err, Hildur was an old friend.
- Of course, sir. I'm sorry.

261
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,264
And I'm still shocked about Dr.
Khatri, you know... what you told me.

262
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:28,475
Please. Sit down.

263
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,976
I spoke to an official
I trust at the Ministry.

264
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:43,976
He is taking this very seriously, he
can go straight to the top of the W.H.O.

265
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:47,149
They are the main sponsors
of Dr. Khatri's work here.

266
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:51,854
But he must see all the
proof we have against her.

267
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:55,387
I'm still waiting for the
results of the DNA comparison.

268
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:01,054
Have you told anyone else about
your suspicions, anyone at all?

269
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,905
Not even Vincent Rattrey?

270
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,867
No, not even Vincent.
I haven't told a soul.

271
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:14,613
I'll scan everything and get
them straight back to you.

272
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,753
Ketil Blakstvedt.

273
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:02,562
I heard you died.

274
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:04,433
That's right.

275
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:07,900
A while ago you changed the security
system in the police station.

276
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,201
If you say so.

277
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:12,401
- Did you do it on your own?
- I don't remember.

278
00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:15,264
You're not still sore about that
parking permit, are you, Ketil?

279
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,091
Not at all, Dan.

280
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:22,180
Good. Did anyone help you
with the security system?

281
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:26,200
You're not even a cop
anymore, Dan Anderssen.

282
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm, err, doing some consultancy.

283
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:33,755
I still don't remember.

284
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:38,080
- Jesus, Dan. D...
- Dan.

285
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:40,811
He's an outsider. Recently arrived.

286
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:41,920
AH! I want a lawyer.

287
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:45,120
The only lawyer in
Fortitude is Hildur Odegard.

288
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:47,194
And she's currently unavailable.

289
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:50,425
You're afraid of him, aren't you?

290
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:52,056
He cut off the crazy guy's head!

291
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:55,684
- What about Tavrani Tavra's tongue?
- Don't forget that.

292
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:58,296
Vladek! Vladek Klimov!

293
00:28:58,355 --> 00:28:59,292
Where's he live?

294
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:03,937
I don't know... he stole my fucking
generator... that's all I know.

295
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:05,572
I want a list of all the
people he's worked for.

296
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:07,701
- Enough.
- Because one of them's hiding him.

297
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:08,732
ENOUGH!

298
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:15,724
Have you no fucking respect, Dan Anderssen?

299
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,382
This is Hildur's place!

300
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,230
What's the matter with you?

301
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:09,699
Hey.

302
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:14,096
Hey. Wanna get some lunch?

303
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:16,508
I'm just getting into something here.

304
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:19,292
The Special at the Fox
is sheep's testicles.

305
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,491
Oh.

306
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:23,585
Erm...

307
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,839
I wanted to tell you something.

308
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,905
You slept with Ingrid last night.

309
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,496
That was it.

310
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:35,698
Okay.

311
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:41,115
Obviously you... already knew.

312
00:30:41,195 --> 00:30:42,804
She's always been in love with you.

313
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,127
Ingrid?

314
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:50,935
Right, well, erm, I had no
idea how little it meant to you.

315
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:58,129
- You just slept with someone else.
- You're right.

316
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,347
I'll catch you later.

317
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,083
Your pain will not have been for nothing.

318
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:15,160
I take your pain inside me
and now I will set you free.

319
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:44,116
You go. Be with everybody who loves you.

320
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:57,336
They're waiting for you across the River.

321
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:02,008
I'll see you again soon.

322
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,292
In the land of the dead.

323
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:24,429
So what do you think?

324
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:25,981
I think it's crazy.

325
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:29,928
Crazier than a mercenary
working at the Blue Fox?

326
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:32,378
Or anything else that's
been going on around here?

327
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:39,236
Petra. Dan gave us a job.
I think we should do it.

328
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,532
So... Mrs. Odegard leaves Michael in
the Blue Fox, and she comes here to

329
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,240
talk to Eric again.

330
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:55,240
- She drives.
- She drives.

331
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:56,517
She parks by the door.

332
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:58,669
Because there's always spaces there.

333
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:05,557
She fights with Eric, then she comes
back out here and she runs to the bay.

334
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,800
Where Dan pulls her of the water.

335
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:09,234
So where's her car?

336
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:11,480
Hi, Dad.

337
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,480
Have you seen your mother today?

338
00:33:13,515 --> 00:33:15,971
No, I left early. Why?

339
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,753
Did you see her last night?

340
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,483
What? Isn't she there?

341
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:22,473
Where can she go? She can hardly walk now.

342
00:33:22,508 --> 00:33:25,209
- Her car's missing.
- She can't drive either.

343
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:28,867
- That's right.
- I'm coming right over.

344
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:16,129
Hello, Mr. Anderssen. This will hurt.

345
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,342
What are you looking for?

346
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:43,340
There's something going on with your
mother, something she wasn't telling me.

347
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,166
I felt it for a while.

348
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:51,151
Looking for...
prescriptions, notes, letters.

349
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:53,280
Anything that doesn't belong here.

350
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:56,440
- People always burn that shit.
- What?

351
00:34:56,475 --> 00:35:01,035
Shit people want to hide
from people. People burn it.

352
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,447
Bed stuff.

353
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:11,731
Bed stuff with blood on.

354
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:20,496
Dad. Who was the contractor
for our electrical work?

355
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:24,817
- Who cares about that now?
- Who did the electrical work here?

356
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,989
Ketil Blakstvedt. Why?

357
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:30,428
- Oh, God.
- What?

358
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,789
The outhouse.

359
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:41,733
I've looked here before...

360
00:35:48,156 --> 00:35:50,095
More blood, right?

361
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,801
I'm so sorry. I should have said something.

362
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:56,135
Said what?

363
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,560
She lied to me. She lied to all of us.

364
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:03,243
When Eric shot him, he was here.

365
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:07,175
- Ingrid, who?
- The Shaman... he was working for Ketil.

366
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:10,513
- Vladek?
- He's the Shaman.

367
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:12,920
Vladek is the one that's
been cutting people up?

368
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:14,484
Why has he taken Mum?

369
00:37:19,675 --> 00:37:21,871
Don't get too close.

370
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,708
This is the body of a young woman
found out on the ice yesterday,

371
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:27,884
she died within the last twenty four hours.

372
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:31,947
She was wearing a Russian
Army uniform, so I assume she's

373
00:37:31,994 --> 00:37:33,785
from Vukobejina.

374
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,284
Can you turn the lights
back up again please?

375
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:42,324
There's a milky deposit inside her
mouth. I've taken bloods and swabs.

376
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,394
I'd like your help me with the analysis.

377
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,938
There are some anomalies that
are way beyond my competence.

378
00:37:48,994 --> 00:37:51,165
Why have you removed her eye?

379
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,633
I haven't.

380
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:54,180
She did.

381
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:57,177
I found eye tissue and
blood under her finger nails.

382
00:37:57,244 --> 00:38:00,605
There's no doubt that she
clawed out her own eye.

383
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:06,671
There are insect bites on
her neck, and hands and face,

384
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:08,125
looks like black fly to me.

385
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,382
Also present on our
polar bear and reindeer.

386
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:11,910
You'd expect that, no?

387
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:17,192
My point is, when they bite... black
flies, they inject this powerful

388
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:22,909
anticoagulant, it's a prime vector
for parasites like river blindness.

389
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:27,895
It's in the insects,
it's in the wildlife...

390
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,222
and now it's in humans.

391
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,372
- What is?
- I have absolutely no idea.

392
00:38:33,407 --> 00:38:36,630
We have to keep this
completely between ourselves.

393
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:40,749
I agree. After what this
place has been through, it's...

394
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,776
That's good work, Vince.

395
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:54,280
You should go home.

396
00:38:54,456 --> 00:39:00,468
Listen, erm, I'm... sorry if I hurt you.

397
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,524
Can we get a drink later?

398
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:09,680
If you're up to it. You
look... a little pretty shit.

399
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,917
Thanks. I'm fine.

400
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,069
Where is everybody?

401
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:29,859
Dan's not answering his phone. Eric's gone.

402
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:32,600
Ralfi Sigurdsson said he
saw him driving off inland.

403
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:35,902
When he does that, he
can disappear for weeks.

404
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,523
- What about Ingrid?
- Family emergency.

405
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:47,236
Well. I have to tell you that, err,
Dan has had some kind of episode.

406
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:53,033
He's been taken in to the Research Centre
and Dr. Khatri says he could be very ill.

407
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:54,881
Why not the hospital?

408
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:57,807
It's far beyond the
capabilities of Dr. Adebimpe.

409
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:02,458
So, what progress have you made?

410
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:05,885
We can't find Hildur's car.

411
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:10,817
What? Well, what about her car?

412
00:40:10,915 --> 00:40:15,160
I-I-I-I made it perfectly
clear we had other priorities.

413
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,972
I've searched every street and
carpark in town. It's isn't anywhere.

414
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:21,051
Hildur committed suicide.

415
00:40:21,115 --> 00:40:24,784
Yes. And then hid her car afterwards.

416
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:27,061
Well, she could have hidden it beforehand!

417
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:32,398
Yes. That's a common feature of suicides.

418
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:43,529
I'm going to see Dan.

419
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:48,358
Are you suggesting that, err, Hildur
is another victim of this psychopath?

420
00:40:52,084 --> 00:40:54,859
Yes, Governor. That's
exactly what I'm suggesting.

421
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:59,801
Dan isn't allowed any vi-visitors.

422
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,515
How did you get in here?

423
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,313
I have to take him, now.

424
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:20,439
- Step aside. Please.
- He can't be moved, he'll die.

425
00:41:20,474 --> 00:41:23,039
It'll take a lot more than that now.

426
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:25,141
His value to science is unquantifiable.

427
00:41:25,222 --> 00:41:29,129
- His value to you, you mean.
- I can save him.

428
00:41:29,177 --> 00:41:30,247
No you can't.

429
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:33,673
But I can.

430
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:45,201
The canning factory,
several deserted farmhouses.

431
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:49,559
- Somewhere isolated. He needs privacy.
- Yeah.

432
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:52,430
The mines.

433
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:56,757
Let's go.

434
00:41:56,804 --> 00:41:59,781
- It'll be dark soon.
- Eat a carrot.

435
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:02,202
You two are staying here.

436
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:26,447
Oh.

437
00:42:51,955 --> 00:42:53,090
Dan?

438
00:43:10,886 --> 00:43:12,072
Dan!

439
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:47,578
Dan?

440
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:55,645
Elena?

441
00:44:57,515 --> 00:44:59,093
- _
- AHH!

442
00:45:00,124 --> 00:45:01,410
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

443
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:02,736
FREYA!

444
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:05,403
DAN!

445
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:11,943
