1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,676
(waves crashing)

2
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,716
(wind whistling)

3
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,822
(man screaming in distance)

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

5
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,671
(shutter clicks)

6
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,874
(screaming continues)

7
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,354
(screaming continues)

8
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,694
(man screaming)

9
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,263
(bear growling)

10
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,735
(rifle fires)

11
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,244
(car door slams)

12
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,151
Policeman:
Henry!

13
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,853
Get out of here!

14
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:32,091
Just go home
and leave this all to me!

15
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,258
Go!

16
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,410
â™ª the river did come to me

17
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:56,582
â™ª straight into my arms

18
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,651
â™ª I tried to hold it

19
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:06,258
â™ª but it just ran
through my fingers â™ª

20
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,962
â™ª the ocean did come to me

21
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:14,666
â™ª straight into my arms

22
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,537
â™ª I tried to caress it

23
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,709
â™ª but it ran
through my fingertips... â™ª

24
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:30,516
â™ª water will keep running,
rivers will turn â™ª

25
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:34,920
â™ª water will keep running
and rivers will turn â™ª

26
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:39,791
â™ª water will keep running,
rivers will turn â™ª

27
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:43,095
â™ª water will keep running,
rivers will turn. â™ª

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,250
â™ª the wind blows
from north to south â™ª

29
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,321
â™ª but I'm still where I was

30
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:14,359
â™ª keep taking some shirts off

31
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:19,998
â™ª and taking them off

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,736
â™ª everything is open,
leaking about â™ª

33
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:29,441
â™ª everything is open,
leaking about â™ª

34
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:34,580
â™ª everything is open,
leaking about... â™ª

35
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,049
Liam?

36
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,688
What's the matter?

37
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,095
Hey.

38
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,264
They were in a snow hole.

39
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,832
I'd never have seen it.

40
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,400
The camp blew away
in the night.

41
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,971
Cheap tourist junk.

42
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,239
Hawkeye here spotted them

43
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,974
About half a mile up
over the glacier.

44
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,408
Good work.

45
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,344
Anybody hurt?

46
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,579
They'll hurt when I bill them
for the fuel.

47
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,120
Great, thanks.

48
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,594
Henry.

49
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,497
This is for henry.

50
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,666
Straight from
the governor's office.

51
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,534
Henry tyson's
medical adjudication.

52
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,837
So it's only
a matter of weeks then.

53
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,071
Yes.

54
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,440
So now the governor
has no choice.

55
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,013
Okay, boss?

56
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,758
Woman:
I've put your bowl
on the floor, sweetie,

57
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,826
In case you're sick again.

58
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,795
He was up three times
through the night

59
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,530
And now he's got
a temperature.

60
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,198
What is his temperature?

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
I don't know.

62
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,669
He's burning hot.

63
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,004
So you haven't taken
his temperature?

64
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,839
He's burning up.

65
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,813
You asleep, kiddo?

66
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,384
You've got your mum
all wound up now.

67
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,386
You hear me?

68
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,554
Liam?

69
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,960
You not well, son?

70
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,128
Liam?

71
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,938
Why don't you call the doctor
if you're that concerned?

72
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:50,048
(flight attendant
speaking norwegian)

73
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,595
Vincent rattrey?

74
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,296
Professor stoddart?

75
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,230
Hello, nice to meet you.

76
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,365
Let me take that for you.

77
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,400
Vincent:
And their research suggests

78
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,135
Industrial perfluoroalkyl
compounds

79
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,204
Have begun to breach
the blood/brain barrier

80
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,839
In arctic predators.

81
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,507
Cannibalism's
a psychotic behavior.

82
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,842
Bears devouring
other bears.

83
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,946
I mean, it's the last resort
for any species.

84
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,649
Just put it on the back seat.

85
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,153
We've just come
out of the dark months--

86
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,855
The winter dark.

87
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,290
People are out
and about again.

88
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,459
Bears, too.

89
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,561
Vincent:
Does it not really mess
with your body clock,

90
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,729
Your mood and things?

91
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,565
Don't people suffer
from depression?

92
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,234
The opposite.

93
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,301
Elation.

94
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,670
They say "glethi."

95
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,738
Glethi?

96
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,244
Danish, swedish, norwegian,
icelandic, lap.

97
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,578
We've got them all here,

98
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,714
And I guarantee you'll
never know which is which.

99
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,150
Stoddart:
Friday evening,
I'll make dinner.

100
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,284
I'll get natalie round too.

101
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,619
I'll have finished
my report by then.

102
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,487
Lots to talk about, vincent.

103
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:06,892
Cannibalism's not the only
aberrant behavior we're seeing.

104
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,764
What's the report on,
professor?

105
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,867
Environmental impact assessment
for a tourist development.

106
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,102
While you're here,

107
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,970
These are yours
for departmental use.

108
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,106
You'll need your own rifle
and a hat.

109
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,542
Something groovy
with earflaps.

110
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,910
And, uh...

111
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,179
...Welcome to fortitude!

112
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,361
(indistinct chatter on tv)

113
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,740
I read a review of this
only last night,

114
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,343
And the man was saying
it was the very best

115
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,412
Digital projector
currently available.

116
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:03,682
Like going to the pictures
at home, eh?

117
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,318
I thought liam was coming over.

118
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,587
Liam's sick today.

119
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,088
Liam's not coming?

120
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,326
Have you two fallen out?

121
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,827
No.

122
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,331
What's that you've got?

123
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,699
I found it.

124
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,874
Found it where?

125
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,478
Doctor:
Was liam's dad
in the army?

126
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,913
Woman:
Afghanistan.

127
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,182
His last tour
was February.

128
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,451
So this is your first summer
in the arctic?

129
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,952
Yeah.

130
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,995
Is it bad?

131
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,366
Liam's got the mumps.

132
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,769
Since he was sick last night,

133
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,404
Liam has not
opened his eyes.

134
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,506
Hasn't woken at all?

135
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,008
No.

136
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,477
Sleep is a healing strategy that
the body of a child employs.

137
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:10,715
Liam's body is tackling
a heavy viral infection.

138
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,951
You know,
even when a child is asleep,

139
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,153
They can be fully aware
of what's going on around them.

140
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,356
So what liam needs
from us is calm,

141
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,159
Someone with him
at all times.

142
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,994
Probably best
if it's his mother.

143
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,597
Are you and frank planning on
having any more children?

144
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,765
Are we what?

145
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,400
Has his dad had the mumps?

146
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,768
Uh...

147
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,704
He hasn't told me
one way or the other.

148
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,506
Well, ask him.

149
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,741
Tell him to give me a call
at the surgery if he hasn't.

150
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,721
This could be a trunk.

151
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,289
And that's a tusk.

152
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,693
So it has to be a mammoth.

153
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,595
I think it's
a prehistoric mammoth,

154
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,163
Thawed out of the permafrost.

155
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,397
I think we need
to get out of here

156
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,033
Before any bears show up.

157
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,336
We could both
use this, jason.

158
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,572
When that mine shuts,
I have nothing, jase.

159
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,940
Nothing lined up.

160
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,275
Nothing saved.

161
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,443
Nothing.

162
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,613
Carrie's ten now.

163
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,214
She needs things.

164
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,986
We could try and sell this
to the research center

165
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,688
As a scientific specimen.

166
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,990
Split it 50/50.

167
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,727
What do you think?

168
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,600
Let's get it on the truck.

169
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,626
Very impressive, hildur.

170
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:02,994
And now look.

171
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,497
See?

172
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,065
They've wired it up

173
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,167
With teeny weeny light bulbs.

174
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,970
It really comes to life,
doesn't it?

175
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,876
It's time you and henry

176
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,145
Sorted out your
differences, dan.

177
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,514
By taking him
his exile letter?

178
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,815
Well, he can't die here.

179
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,184
That's the law.

180
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,020
Look, he's old,
he's lonely,

181
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:29,854
He's dying.

182
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,956
You're his friend,
so fix it.

183
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,762
Margaret.

184
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,098
Liam sutter.

185
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,099
Ten years old.

186
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,400
Hildur:
What about him?

187
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,868
Margaret:
He's got the mumps.

188
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,437
99% sure mumps.

189
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,571
But...

190
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,772
Hildur:
But what?

191
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,208
Margaret:
It just might be something else.

192
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,143
Yes?

193
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,878
Why are you telling us this?

194
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,780
Because his dad
was in afghanistan,

195
00:11:55,782 --> 00:12:00,518
And childhood poliomyelitis
is rife out there.

196
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,855
Incubation period
up to 37 weeks,

197
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,757
So it is possible

198
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,593
We are just seeing it now
in liam.

199
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,328
Polio?

200
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,963
It's a quarantine issue.

201
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,765
You up for that, governor?

202
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:14,799
Seal off the town?

203
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,234
It will be your responsibility.

204
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,405
Well, wouldn't we just isolate
the sutter child

205
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,040
And quarantine the family?

206
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,477
If he's been carrying polio
for the past 37 weeks,

207
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:29,180
I think it's way, way, way, way,
way too late for that.

208
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,583
I'll run some tests.

209
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,956
Polio?

210
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,925
I know.

211
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,274
â™ª

212
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,109
(giggling)

213
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,028
You're so gorgeous.

214
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,967
So.

215
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,169
You're search and rescue?

216
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,571
Mm-hmm.

217
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:05,176
What do you do
when you find out there's women?

218
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,314
Do you swoop down
and save them?

219
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,416
(chuckling)

220
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,085
Yeah, something like that.

221
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:18,122
Maybe they're gonna need someone
to save you from me.

222
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,124
You think?

223
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,093
Mm-hmm.

224
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,699
You know, in this place...

225
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,705
...Things can come at you
from nowhere.

226
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,475
Things?

227
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,111
What kinds of things?

228
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,046
Monsters.

229
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,615
Monsters.
Mm-hmm.

230
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:47,952
You won't see them,
you won't hear them.

231
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,955
Until they have you
in their teeth.

232
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,628
You know?

233
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,033
And then they're gone.

234
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,138
Into the darkness
before you know it.

235
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,082
Hi.

236
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,784
You're vincent rattrey.

237
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,687
Natalie yelburton.

238
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,322
So...

239
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,891
You're the guy that thinks pfas
could be responsible

240
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,026
For these reindeer abnormalities
I've been finding.

241
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,995
You saw my paper?

242
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,663
Skimmed it.

243
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,299
So what's this
experiment here for?

244
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,400
This?

245
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,969
Oh, this is dinner.

246
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,618
Where did you get this?

247
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,920
Out of its mouth.

248
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,755
Its mouth?

249
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,757
I found a carcass.

250
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,759
Thawed out of the ground.

251
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:38,262
You know, wiry,
matted ginger hair, a trunk.

252
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,898
Has somebody
put you up to this?

253
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,901
No.

254
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:47,405
There's an entire carcass?

255
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,519
I mean, its value to science
is just incalculable.

256
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,689
What's your name, please?

257
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,857
Jason.

258
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,828
So... Put a precise number on
incalculable for me, professor.

259
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,898
How do you mean?

260
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,400
What's it worth?

261
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,268
It's priceless.

262
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,203
No, I mean
what's it worth to you?

263
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,373
How much will the research
center give me for it?

264
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,242
No, you...

265
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,045
No, you listen to me.

266
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,013
The law about finds
of this nature

267
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,048
Is perfectly clear.

268
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,982
Okay...

269
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:32,817
Hey!

270
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,985
Hey!

271
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,221
Hey, I know you!

272
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,924
Your name's jason!

273
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,227
Jason!

274
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,045
Dan:
Are you still employed
at the hotel?

275
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,180
Elena:
Yes.

276
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,948
Dan:
Has anyone in fortitude

277
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,683
Spoken to you
about the incident

278
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,319
Or given you reason to believe

279
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,722
They may have learned
about the incident?

280
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,391
Elena:
No.

281
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:17,128
Dan:
I'm required to ask you
if you feel safe in fortitude.

282
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,963
Elena:
Yes.

283
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,800
Dan:
I'm required to ask you

284
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,037
If you have any plans
to leave fortitude.

285
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,139
No.

286
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,810
Because you know if you do,
you must tell us.

287
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:33,945
Otherwise, you would be

288
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,346
In serious breach
of your license

289
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,481
And liable to recall.

290
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,849
Mm-hmm.

291
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,357
Are you seeing anybody?

292
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,927
(laughs)

293
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,632
Is that an official question?

294
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,268
Officially...

295
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,204
It would be none
of anybody's business.

296
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,982
Thank you.

297
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,366
Hildur:
I don't like you going up there
without telling me.

298
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,268
All I was doing was
going up to the cabin

299
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,904
To fix the storm shutters.

300
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,406
Listen, you stood in a bear
trap, for goodness sakes.

301
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,541
You could have lost your leg.

302
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,509
Okay, look,
I'm sorry, hildy.

303
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,445
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,684
So how's everything
coming along?

305
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,952
How's your speech?

306
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,954
Do you need
any good jokes for it?

307
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,823
The ice drill's en route.

308
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,158
Really?

309
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,326
Left oslo
this morning,

310
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,929
So it arrives on Wednesday.

311
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,864
All happening.

312
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,439
Storm shutters.

313
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,575
What?

314
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,423
You're lying to me, eric.

315
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,867
<i>We live in the one place</i>
<i>on earth</i>

316
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,836
<i>Guaranteed a quiet life.</i>

317
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,838
The honeymoon was a night
of thrills and...

318
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,541
Thrills and magic,
thrills and magic.

319
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,911
<i>Eric took me up</i>
<i>onto the glacier in a tent,</i>

320
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:51,816
<i>And now we are building</i>
<i>a hideaway in the ice,</i>

321
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:56,554
<i>A hotel hewn</i>
<i>into the glacier itself,</i>

322
00:20:56,556 --> 00:21:00,591
Where lovers of the wilderness,
lovers of the northern lights,

323
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,326
Or just lovers...

324
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:06,163
<i>Or just lovers.</i>

325
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,121
Good morning.

326
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,188
How you doing?

327
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,090
Fortitude police.

328
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,997
Now, I see you're not
carrying any hunting rifles

329
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,932
For protection
from the polar bears.

330
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,234
I understand.

331
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:45,202
I understand, sir,
where you're coming from...

332
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,103
Good.

333
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,538
But the waiting period
for firearms

334
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,407
Put that precaution
out of our reach.

335
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,642
So that is that.

336
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,177
I beg your pardon?

337
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,746
That is that.

338
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,783
See, we're only
traveling inland.

339
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,217
No bears.

340
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,621
No bears inland.

341
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,790
No bears inland.

342
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,694
What my friend means is
since, as we all know,

343
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:10,995
Polar bears
are coastal predators

344
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,930
And we're not traveling
along the coast,

345
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,900
Then the recommended precautions
were not applicable

346
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,435
In our time scale.

347
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,039
How are you?

348
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,208
I'm good.

349
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,344
What's he doing?

350
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,080
He's norwegian.

351
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:30,481
Ah.

352
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,187
Look at this.

353
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:40,691
A polar bear will be eating you
before you are dead.

354
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,328
Once he has a hold of you,
he is eating you.

355
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,131
This is all the bear left
of billy pettigrew

356
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,400
Once he was done
with eating him.

357
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,902
So you need to go
back into town

358
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,438
And equip yourselves properly
before you continue.

359
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,407
Oh, fuck this.

360
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,708
Fuck this?

361
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,076
Fuck this!

362
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,916
And fuck him.

363
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,337
Hey!

364
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,239
We have a gun!

365
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,261
This would not stop me,
never mind a bear.

366
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,401
So you will walk back
down the glacier into town.

367
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:00,438
You will keep my rifle
for protection.

368
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,841
When you get back,
you will bring my rifle to me

369
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,676
And I will return
your handgun.

370
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,952
Is that the cop
you told me about?

371
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,520
No.

372
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,756
I put that one
in the hospital.

373
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,959
Do you mind if I make
more steam?

374
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,261
No.

375
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,767
(sighs)

376
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,609
That's me.

377
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,422
Ah!

378
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,260
Pints?

379
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:31,462
For concussion.

380
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,731
Are you taking wine
to the professor's?

381
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:34,899
Yep.

382
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,769
Who's that?

383
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,738
It's the sheriff.

384
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,007
Is he a good sheriff
or a bad sheriff?

385
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,009
Well, no one knows.

386
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,477
Why not?

387
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,645
In fortitude,

388
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:50,514
There's two fundamental rules.

389
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,449
You have to have a roof
over your head

390
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,485
And you have to be able
to provide for yourself,

391
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,620
So it follows
everyone's got a job,

392
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,289
<i>No one is poor,</i>

393
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,292
<i>So there's no stealing</i>
<i>and there's no crime.</i>

394
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,427
<i>Everybody's always happy.</i>

395
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,496
Vincent:
<i>Then there's nothing for him</i>
<i>to do, then?</i>

396
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:10,935
<i>Whether he's a good sheriff</i>
<i>or a bad sheriff.</i>

397
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,336
Henry?

398
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,038
Drinking yourself to death?

399
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:17,875
Join me.

400
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,416
Do you want me
to throw this lot out?

401
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:26,584
No, leave them.

402
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,493
Are we gonna talk, henry?

403
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:39,096
"billy pettigrew
was a geologist," it says.

404
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,598
Yes.

405
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,069
"he was looking for something
up on the glacier."

406
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:47,071
That's right.

407
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:50,207
No wife and no kids.

408
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,443
Just like you and me, dan.

409
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,244
Yes.

410
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:58,849
And no mention anywhere at all
of the bullet that killed him.

411
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:02,186
Nobody found a bullet.

412
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,488
That was down to you.

413
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,525
The state he was in, they
weren't looking for a bullet.

414
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,928
If I don't keep myself
topped up,

415
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,331
I shake like
a fucking leaf.

416
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,173
I was stone cold sober
that morning.

417
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,109
It was a mercy you shot him.

418
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,046
A mercy I shot him.

419
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,051
Meant to hit the bear,
but I shot him.

420
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,419
Bang.

421
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,458
Then the car door slams,
and I think,

422
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,194
"no engine, no siren?"

423
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:48,465
The car door slams,
and there you are.

424
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,000
You were there.

425
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,836
Weren't you?

426
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,209
The governor is advised
that your prognosis

427
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,479
Is now final stage
palliative care.

428
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,616
You can go back
to the mainland, henry.

429
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:06,817
Tell me.

430
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,686
You can die in peace
in a hospice,

431
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:09,653
Being cared for.

432
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,188
Not by yourself in this hovel.

433
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,389
Forget what happened.

434
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,524
He was as good as dead.

435
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,792
Tell me!

436
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,961
I can't tell you.

437
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,997
Why don't you trust me?

438
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,870
If frank hadn't shown up,

439
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,974
Another couple of hours,
I'd have gnawed it off.

440
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,243
How long till
you can walk?

441
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,245
(lighter flicking)

442
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,914
I can walk now.

443
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,618
Means I don't have
to sit through

444
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,986
Poor hildur's presentation.

445
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,354
(laughs)

446
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,625
Do you know a bloke
called jason?

447
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:49,860
Coal miner.

448
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:50,828
Yeah, I know him, why?

449
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,730
We had a fight.

450
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,833
A fight?

451
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,768
Well, more of a scuffle.

452
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,337
He showed me a bit
of something that he'd found.

453
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,072
What?

454
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,874
Animal remains.

455
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,976
What kind of animal?

456
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,278
Can I just say

457
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,581
If he did find it
on this island...

458
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,950
You don't want to look like
a gullible arsehole.

459
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,985
Can you arrest him?

460
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,421
Find out if he's
telling the truth.

461
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:22,292
Because if he is,
this thing needs protecting.

462
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,562
I'll tell you what:

463
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:28,132
When I get back, I'll pay him
a visit, all right?

464
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,375
Ronnie:
So what do we do next?

465
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:42,079
Jason:
We let him stew for a while,
mull it over.

466
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,216
I'll go and see him again

467
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,485
And tell him he's got 24 hours
to make an offer.

468
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,922
Or the carcass gets torched.

469
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,293
I'll go this time.

470
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,427
Fuck with him.

471
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,595
No, you won't, ronnie.

472
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,399
This thing needs calm
and fucking diplomacy.

473
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,170
I mean, look at you.

474
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,550
<i>Liam hasn't opened his eyes.</i>

475
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:23,554
He isn't responding to my voice
<i>or his dad's.</i>

476
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:26,523
<i>I think...</i>

477
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,759
I think we need
to get him out of here.

478
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:31,361
I think he's...

479
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,464
I want him in a proper hospital
where they know what to do.

480
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,233
I think he's much sicker
than that woman...

481
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:37,534
Hey, hey, it's okay.

482
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,169
I think he's much sicker
than that woman says.

483
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,470
She's...

484
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:43,373
I don't trust her,
that dr. Allerdyce, she's...

485
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,442
Jules, listen to me.

486
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,212
If liam is not better
by tomorrow morning,

487
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,781
I will have him
airlifted.

488
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,017
Airlifted?

489
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,220
If there's no improvement
in liam's condition

490
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,221
By tomorrow morning,

491
00:30:57,223 --> 00:31:00,557
I will requisition a flight
to the mainland.

492
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,426
Really?

493
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,795
Yes, of course.

494
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,231
(relieved laugh)

495
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,233
Good.

496
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,636
Now, I have to go.

497
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,671
Have you met elena?

498
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,540
Elena?

499
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,908
Hi.

500
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,943
You must be jules.

501
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,746
Yeah, that's right,
jules sutter.

502
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,615
You're married
to the search and rescue guy?

503
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:25,849
The new guy.

504
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,118
You know frank?

505
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,855
Well, I know who he is.

506
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,462
Stoddart:
How much does an ice drill cost?

507
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:42,532
Hildur:
We'll recover the capital outlay
soon enough, charlie.

508
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,501
You're putting all your eggs
in one little basket.

509
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,435
I have no choice.

510
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,536
You know that.

511
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,671
The mines are mined out.

512
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,072
There's no future apart
from tourism, is there?

513
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,607
Tourists.

514
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,710
That's all the glacier
really means to you, isn't it?

515
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,179
It means businesses
staying in business, charlie.

516
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,015
Shops, bars, hotels,

517
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,750
Restaurants, hire firms,
camping equipment...

518
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,118
You won't win this argument

519
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,920
By resorting
to emotional blackmail.

520
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,454
There isn't
any argument!

521
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,624
Where the hell is this
coming from all of a sudden?

522
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,865
You have reassured me
at every stage of planning

523
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:18,902
That it is a foregone conclusion
that your report

524
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,104
Will permit the development
of the glacier hotel project.

525
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:21,872
I gave you no...

526
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:22,973
I have committed funds...

527
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,042
I gave you no cast-iron
assurances.

528
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:25,943
Public finances...

529
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:26,843
Hildur.

530
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:28,111
You promised me, charlie!

531
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,589
So...

532
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,027
Will the report
give final approval

533
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:47,464
For the glacier hotel
project or not?

534
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,667
What if something
was found up there,

535
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,402
And we had to protect it?

536
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,206
What?

537
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,775
Something.

538
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:01,178
That came out of the ice.

539
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,847
What something?

540
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,717
Charlie?

541
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,313
â™ª

542
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,966
(dog barking)

543
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:10,480
(whimpering and barking)

544
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,083
Hey.

545
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,854
(sighs)

546
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,490
I spoke to dan anderssen.

547
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,293
You spoke to dan?

548
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,501
You spoke to dan,
what about?

549
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,204
He said if there's
no improvement in liam

550
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,440
By the morning, he's going
to have him flown out

551
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,041
To the mainland.

552
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,643
You spoke to...

553
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:40,911
Why?

554
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,079
Why would you do that?

555
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,447
Why would you go
behind my back?

556
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,115
It's mumps,
for christ's sake!

557
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,249
(angrily):
What if it's not?

558
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,784
You can watch him!

559
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:48,852
Where are you going?

560
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:49,820
Jules!

561
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,199
(car driving away)

562
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,708
Wow.

563
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,947
(gasps)

564
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,216
You've never
seen that before?

565
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,117
No.

566
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,818
I thought you studied
polar bears.

567
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,054
Well, apex predators.

568
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,088
Not polar bears.

569
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,256
Oh, okay.

570
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,557
Grizzlies?

571
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,725
No.

572
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,929
Vincent, your paper was
on bio magnification

573
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,932
Of perfluoroalkyls
in apex predators.

574
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,634
Yeah, in the uk.

575
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:41,104
In the uk?

576
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,606
(laughing)

577
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,773
Badgers?

578
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,275
Yes, badgers.

579
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,878
A badger can give you
a pretty nasty bite, actually.

580
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,045
(laughing)

581
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,620
(banging)

582
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,529
(lights faintly humming)

583
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,361
(faint music from bar)

584
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,772
(rock music playing)

585
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,851
(screaming)

586
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,479
(moaning)

587
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,639
(heavy rock music continues)

588
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,148
â™ª

589
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,594
â™ª

590
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,005
(screaming)

591
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:23,226
(music stops, audience cheering)

592
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,228
(wind blowing)

593
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,047
(breathing heavily)

594
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,170
(door closes)

595
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,338
Jules:
Hi!

596
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,041
Liam?

597
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,911
You're awake.

598
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,713
Are you feeling better?

599
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,283
Frank?

600
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,521
Frank, come here,
he's all better!

601
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,490
(relieved laughter)

602
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,568
My little soldier.

603
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,070
The swelling's gone down
completely.

604
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,705
Oh, yeah.

605
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,577
I'm hungry.

606
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,545
(laughs)

607
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,712
He's hungry.

608
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,777
â™ª

609
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,908
Jules:
All the time,
I'm afraid to speak

610
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,210
In case I annoy you.

611
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,713
I spend my life
trying to think

612
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,983
What it is you want,

613
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:02,485
And I'm afraid
I get it wrong.

614
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,526
(loud screaming)

615
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:10,994
Liam, what's the matter?

616
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,161
Are you all right?

617
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,296
Liam, what is it?

618
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:14,397
What is it, son?

619
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,933
My feet are burning!

620
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:18,568
(screaming)

621
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,870
Sweetie, it's all right,
calm down.

622
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:21,938
Get the car keys!

623
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,606
(screaming)

624
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:24,774
Jules, get the car keys!

625
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,660
Charlie stoddart said
something's been found.

626
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:45,695
He's not going to give us
the go-ahead.

627
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:46,829
What's he talking about?

628
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:47,997
What's been found?

629
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,600
He didn't say.

630
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:51,801
Man:
Governor?

631
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,603
He didn't tell me.

632
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,517
(sighs)

633
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,688
(crowd chatting)

634
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,899
Third- and fourth-degree
frostbite.

635
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:24,968
We'll have to wait
a few weeks.

636
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,103
Wait for what?

637
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,405
To see if debridement
is necessary.

638
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,741
Amputation, perhaps.

639
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:39,349
It's beyond me how you could let
this happen to a little boy.

640
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,802
Jules:
What have you done?

641
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,007
What?

642
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,178
You're lying to me.

643
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,048
Jules, I'm not lying.

644
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,050
You left him on his own,
you must've done.

645
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,385
He must've gone
looking for you.

646
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:16,786
He must've gone outside
because you weren't there.

647
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:17,987
Please, jules, not now.

648
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,088
"please"?

649
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,657
"please" what?

650
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,561
What have you done?

651
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,430
Where did you go?

652
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,534
Where did you go?!

653
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,508
(wind whistling)

654
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,196
(doorbell ringing)

655
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,934
Hello?

656
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,773
Professor stoddart?

657
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,051
Hello?

658
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,187
Professor stoddart?

659
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:28,991
(panicked):
Hello?

660
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:29,992
(knocking)

661
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,729
Hello?

662
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,408
(loud shattering)

663
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,099
(angry barking)

664
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,200
(gunshots)

665
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,035
Stay down there.

666
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:14,203
Face down.

667
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:15,037
Face down!

668
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,941
I just got here...

669
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,276
Cross your hands
behind your back.

670
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,226
Please, I just
found him there.

671
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,631
I didn't...

672
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,032
Kneel down.

673
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,400
Stay there.

674
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,982
Dan:
<i>We have a very</i>
<i>serious problem here.</i>

675
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,818
I don't think
this is a bear attack.

676
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,286
Man:
<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>earlier this evening?</i>

677
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:04,687
You were doing something
you shouldn't have...

678
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:06,923
(gasps)

679
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:07,990
Something happened to liam.

680
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,292
It's much worse than that.

681
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,260
Hildur:
<i>I've told dci morton</i>

682
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:13,029
<i>That we will extend him</i>
<i>every consideration.</i>

683
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,263
Get out of here.

684
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,599
Natalie should've
been there too!

684
00:47:17,305 --> 00:48:17,861
