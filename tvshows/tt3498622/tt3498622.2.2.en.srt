1
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:13,135
- _
- The demon's jaw crunching.

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,110
Man's head is full of fairytales.

3
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:19,666
The victim was assaulted,
murdered and decapitated.

4
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:22,349
I'm not leaving my home and
that's what the doctor will do.

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,601
He punched Hildur Odegard.

6
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:27,470
Michael Lennox! Your boat!

7
00:00:28,177 --> 00:00:32,200
Three hundred thousand tons
of ice and snow buried forever.

8
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:33,528
We're just clinging on.

9
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:34,819
Dan?

24
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:37,630
Dan has acute alcoholic poisoning.

25
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:41,650
Traces of ethylene glycol
still in his blood, antifreeze,

26
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,667
coolant, can't be sure... that's
why we have him on dialysis.

27
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:50,291
There's renal failure,
cardiovascular compromise.

28
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:54,414
In your opinion, the
condition you see him in now...

29
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:56,872
would he have been capable of...

30
00:02:56,925 --> 00:03:00,543
strenuous physical activity
in the last twenty four hours?

31
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:04,646
I'm surprised he could even walk.

32
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:18,034
How did he survive all that time and
we never saw him, heard him? Nobody.

33
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,749
Could he have anything
to do with the dead man?

34
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,436
I'll find out.

35
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,295
- How is she?
- Afloat.

36
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:03,258
It's horrible. It's like an
assault on somebody you love.

37
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,922
Probably get the wiring done today.

38
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:09,425
Patch up the rest tomorrow
and Saul's got cable he can...

39
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:12,094
- Michael.
- Pick up a finder second hand.

40
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,425
There's no money for a finder.

41
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:20,885
Every boat in the fleet is out
there, using that data, my data.

42
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,006
Hauling in money.

43
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,839
The Muriel's finished.

44
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,747
I'll be on the crab by the weekend.

45
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:31,583
Michael. Baby. You have to
start facing up to reality.

46
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,183
I am.

47
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,120
You okay?

48
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,342
Mum. Listen. Anything unusual...
Or anybody around who shouldn't

49
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,260
be out here, let me know. Okay? Call me.

50
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,116
So that man was murdered then.

51
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,455
Just call me.

52
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,966
Eric? This thing wasn't bent out of shape.

53
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,548
It's supposed to be like this.
It's called a wrecker bar.

54
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:10,616
Geologists use them.

55
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,644
FARC said only one of their
researchers has one like this.

56
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,354
It's a German make.

57
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,780
Laszlo Hindemith. Arrived here last month.

58
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,021
Connecting flight from Kinshasa.

59
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,749
He rents a place out on the
airport road. Five, Amundsunveien.

60
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,928
So let's go...

61
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:32,180
Hindemith works at the geology
department at FARC, but he's not

62
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,783
affliated to the centre.

63
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:37,657
He is an independent researcher.
Freelance, no colleagues.

64
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:39,172
What was he researching?

65
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:40,703
Nobody knows.

66
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,442
Mr. Hindemith! Fortitude Police!

67
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,588
I could probably get in
through the kitchen window...

68
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:07,249
Mr. Hindemith!

69
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,047
There's nobody home.

70
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,608
He's been living here a month.

71
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:39,212
Eric?

72
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,541
Aruwamo. I think that's
where Hindemith was based.

73
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,081
The Congo.

74
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:56,886
Mustard. Mustard and chilli
sauce. And no hotdogs.

75
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,230
Hot spices and condiments.

76
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:02,618
This kind of food can
be a sign of depression.

77
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,837
People need the kick it
gives them to feel alive.

78
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:27,299
He was taking animal sedative.

79
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,451
Anything else?

80
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:50,103
What? No... Just drugs...

81
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,529
Lots of drugs. Yeah.

82
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,231
Prints and swabs, then we can bag it all.

83
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,218
Don't go in today.

84
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:29,867
I have a date... with a
hermaphroditic reindeer foetus.

85
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:33,915
So I'm chucked.

86
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,761
You are so chucked.

87
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:40,761
Thought you were done with
those biopsies. The reindeer...

88
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:43,428
Thought you had ran out of little foetuses.

89
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:45,926
Few left.

90
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:26,833
I saw absolutely no behavioural
changes in the first rat.

91
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:29,583
When the larvae matured
inside, the rat simply died.

92
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,398
The larvae feasted on the rat's tissues.

93
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,719
Standard parasitical wasp outcome.

94
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,648
Perhaps the wasps function as a vector.

95
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:40,328
Like mosquitoes and malaria,
deer tick and Lyme's disease,

96
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,540
sand fly and Oncochersiasis.

97
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:43,622
Oncochersiasis?

98
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:46,966
A sandfly gouges a wound in the
victims flesh in order to feed

99
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:49,878
the parasitic roundworm forces
its way out of the sandfly's

100
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:52,423
head into the victim's blood.

101
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,441
Result... river blindness.

102
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,774
There's just no nice way
to be a parasite, is there?

103
00:09:58,936 --> 00:09:59,888
How do you mean?

104
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:03,269
- I'm being facetious.
- Oh, I see.

105
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:06,379
The wasp I brought down
from the glacier is clean.

106
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:11,071
It's not a vector for anything
horrific. It's just... a wasp.

107
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,786
- It's a nasty little syringe with nothing in it.
- Yes.

108
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,923
Then we can declare an all-clear.
We can start telling people this.

109
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,048
That would be... injudicious.

110
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,270
Injudicious?

111
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,728
Precipitatous. Premature. Ill-advised.

112
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,011
That's a "no", isn't it?

113
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,472
You might think I'm not smiling
at these occasional witticisms

114
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,547
because I'm humourless.

115
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:36,022
You might think that,
Natalie, but you'd be wrong.

116
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,593
I'm not smiling much at all these
days because everything about

117
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,845
this place has me shitting my
pants in expectation of some

118
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:45,355
hurtling environmental catastrophe.

119
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:49,372
Boom boom.

120
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,182
Ow, fuck!

121
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,319
You can't take this boat out there.

122
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,903
The fire did us a favour.
Just collect the insurance.

123
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:24,249
Make the best of it.

124
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:25,778
There is no insurance.

125
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,925
'Course there is.

126
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:31,529
Michael.

127
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:32,843
It's gone.

128
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,139
You didn't tell me.

129
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,626
What would it matter
if I told you or not...?

130
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:48,326
Lamont...?

131
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,980
I couldn't let you go out there alone.

132
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,366
We both know what the seas
are like this time of year.

133
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,058
Get the fuck off my boat.

134
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:04,234
The Muriel wouldn't have made it back...

135
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,170
Get the fuck off my boat!

136
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,537
I need to speak to Rune
straight away. Rune Lennox...

137
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:18,051
Fortitude police need to
ask him some questions...

138
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,277
Is he in some kind of trouble?

139
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,091
No... I need to ask...

140
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,021
What's the flight time
from Kinshasha to Oslo?

141
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:32,638
What?

142
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:35,953
Would Hindemith fly in
from the D.R.C via Schiphol?

143
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,508
Err? I'll find out.

144
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:42,955
Who's that, what's going on?

145
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,075
Nothing. I'll check
the flights for you now.

146
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:09,831
Now I know I've got to run away.

147
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:19,103
I've got to get away, you don't
really want any more from me,

148
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,520
to make things right, you
need someone to hold you tight.

149
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,599
I'm not convinced this
is a suitable environment.

150
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:33,114
It's the only suitable environment.

151
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,609
She'd be more comfortable in my hospital.

152
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:37,573
Until the patient has been determined to be

153
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,492
pathogenically sterile, then it is
my responsibility to contain her.

154
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,527
Isn't that right, Governor Odegard?

155
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:46,966
The specialist committee from the
mainland agreed this arrangement.

156
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:48,121
Yes.

157
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,084
You think this is acceptable?

158
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,785
Keeping the girl like
a rat in a Perspex box?

159
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,300
The subject is in an irreversible
vegetative comatose condition.

160
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:03,104
I'm sorry, governor, had I been
part of that conversation, I would

161
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:05,025
never have agreed to do this.

162
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:13,501
Maybe he's right.

163
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:17,365
Here, she contributes.
Her sacrifice has meaning.

164
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,081
What we learn from her may yet save lives.

165
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:28,268
Doctor. Governor.

166
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,164
And her existence is not
without some stimulation.

167
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:42,910
Fortitude police.

168
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,608
It's Michael Lennox.

169
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,727
I just saw a flare go up
near Matti's husky pen.

170
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:52,513
It's a reindeer. We're four
months too early for bear.

171
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:55,430
I know, but it's still
gotta be logged, Eric!

172
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,776
Michael, you see Matti, you
tell him, frankly I've more

173
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:00,629
important shit to worry about.

174
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:09,907
I did what I could for you Hildur.

175
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,511
But they were always going to get you.

176
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:14,754
What is this?

177
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:19,655
You gave them their excuse.
You'd loaded the gun yourself.

178
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,451
What gun? What, what are you talking about?

179
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:26,008
In direct contravention of
express instructions from

180
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,728
minister himself.

181
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:31,240
You released fuel subsidies.

182
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:34,760
Yes, I know... but I, I had to do that.

183
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,681
Without authorisation.

184
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:39,380
The fleet had to have fuel.

185
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,497
I told you this would never
work on the ground, Erling, Oslo

186
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:44,414
always trying to second guess...

187
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:48,039
You're right. It didn't work.

188
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:52,106
The idea of prosecution was
mooted. Criminal prosecution.

189
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:55,369
Misappropriation of governmental...

190
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:59,225
you know the kind of shit they
can cook up without even blinking.

191
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,434
Who's behind this?

192
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,229
They all are.

193
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,715
Termination of appointment.

194
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:14,354
You will be given time within
reason to clear your desk and to

195
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,816
make interim arrangements.

196
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:22,113
I will be in charge during
the transitional period.

197
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:25,434
Until a new appointment is made.

198
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:28,990
New appointment.

199
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:37,067
As of this time, you are no
longer the governor of Fortitude.

200
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:48,715
I'll check into my room.
Give you time to take this in.

201
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,672
Hey.

202
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,823
Hi, mum. Rune's been
messing around with a girl.

203
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,067
Of course he has.

204
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:26,496
Do you know her?

205
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:30,678
I know she's gorgeous and
she's a bit older than him.

206
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:33,627
And she's from Vukobejina.

207
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:35,922
Do you know her name?

208
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,577
They don't use names when they text.

209
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:42,625
You read his texts?

210
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,185
No, Ingrid. I read their minds
using my special psychic powers.

211
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:51,996
I have to find her.

212
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,470
Are they in trouble?

213
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:56,724
No.

214
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:04,629
They always meet in the MS. I'm
assuming it stands for Midnight Sun.

215
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,181
Laszlo Hindemith. Geologist.
Recently arrived at the, err,

216
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,558
Research Centre.

217
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,160
Anyone know Mr. Hindemith?

218
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:25,153
- That the headless human being, Eric?
- You know him?

219
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:28,513
You said it was not my
plough that took his head off.

220
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:29,708
It was a clean cut.

221
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:33,336
It wasn't your plough, Lars.
Forensics established that.

222
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:36,652
Forensics.

223
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,327
You mean Petra and her eyebrow tweezers.

224
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:43,772
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying...

225
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:48,720
if it was a clean cut, then
it was a blade of some kind.

226
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,394
Means he was murdered. That right?

227
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:53,895
This is a road accident.

228
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,412
Two days ago, you were hiding up a glacier.

229
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,881
How the fuck did you get to be sheriff?

230
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,846
Sit down, Lamont.

231
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:02,597
- Don't tell me to sit down.
- Sit down.

232
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,869
Answer the fucking question.

233
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:06,064
Sit. Down.

234
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,295
I knew Laszlo Hindemith.

235
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,288
What?

236
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:20,523
Hindemith. He comes in here when
the place is quiet. Drinks scotch.

237
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:21,815
Lots of it.

238
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,401
What do you know about him?

239
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,599
Talks a lot.

240
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:32,214
- What about?
- The "demoniacal cacophony" he said.

241
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,894
"Childrens' voices". They
die in the hands of cannibals.

242
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,368
"The demon's jaws".

243
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,507
Stuff like that.

244
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:44,699
Permit me to corroborate the
barman's account of things.

245
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:51,532
Demons and Cannibals. But I'm sure
you have contingency plans. Hmm?

246
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,095
Just like last time.

247
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,817
All the time you were gone, Dan.

248
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:28,359
I prayed that Eric would
find you and bring you home.

249
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,760
Those terrible events... we,
we wouldn't have survived them

250
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,202
without you.

251
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:42,054
I don't know if you even know I'm here.

252
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,659
Know it's me talking to you.

253
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
You remember...?

254
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:59,146
Do you remember the little
model I had made, the ice hotel?

255
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:03,744
Little lights inside. You laughed at me.

256
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:10,610
You said I was like a princess
with a doll's house... and I was

257
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:14,071
all tight-lipped but, you were right.

258
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,702
Teeny little lights.

259
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:28,310
Elena didn't die the night you shot her.

260
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:32,231
She hasn't woken up since that night.

261
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:38,486
She's in a special unit,
inside FARC, on life support.

262
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,351
They don't think there's any
chance she's ever going...

263
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,755
Dan.

264
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:56,071
Dan!

265
00:22:57,975 --> 00:23:00,359
Help! Someone help!

266
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,140
I need some assistance
here! Oxygen and lorazepam!

267
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,935
Move away from the patient.

268
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,340
He's in seizure. Try it on. Quickly.

269
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:10,480
Go ahead.

270
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,160
Hey! Wait!

271
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,378
Stop or I'll shoot...!

272
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:54,330
Shoot you!

273
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,899
I'm Rune Lennox's big sister.

274
00:24:13,707 --> 00:24:15,307
I know.

275
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:18,906
I found this in Laszlo
Hindemith's house. In his room.

276
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,739
And his room was full of fucking drugs.

277
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,528
Never been in his house.

278
00:24:24,701 --> 00:24:27,967
Don't tell lies. Is Rune doing heroin?

279
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:30,165
- No.
- Don't lie to me!

280
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:33,766
Hit me again and I will
fucking garrote you.

281
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:44,458
Okay. Okay. Just... tell
me this. Two nights ago.

282
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:49,896
Were you and Rune with Hindemith?
Is Rune involved in what happened?

283
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,762
Please.

284
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:58,797
You can't arrest me.

285
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:05,105
You can't do anything to me
without getting him in trouble too.

286
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,850
Hey, wait. Please.

287
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:17,385
Why were you and Rune
stealing all those carrots?

288
00:25:22,217 --> 00:25:24,209
Bad things come at night.

289
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:32,849
You need to be ready; you
need to see what's coming.

290
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:41,101
The princess lay in the coffin of glass.

291
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:45,308
Dead to the world till the end of time.

292
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:50,130
And no one cared. No one remembered her.

293
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:55,973
The sound of her voice,
her laughter. No one at all.

294
00:25:57,632 --> 00:25:59,122
The end.

295
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,951
Poor Snow White.

296
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:32,801
Hey what's going on? Hey. What's happening?

297
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:34,957
There's a bear.

298
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,140
Where... the playground?

299
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:37,455
No. Inside.

300
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:38,455
Inside?

301
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:39,464
Yes.

302
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:43,095
Mr. Huseklepp...?

303
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,008
Yeah.

304
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,931
Harald's not here.

305
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:48,379
What do you mean, he's not
here? I saw him with us!

306
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:50,923
Hey. You know it's okay.
No one's angry with you.

307
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:52,364
Where did you see him?

308
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:56,833
He went to get Princess.
He said bears eat rats.

309
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,746
Give me the rifle.

310
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,175
- No.
- Give me the damn rifle!

311
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:07,660
Look, you stay here.
These kids, they need you.

312
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:08,817
Alright?

313
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:12,873
Have you been drinking?

314
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:13,649
You're not fit to be around
my children if you're...

315
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:17,828
Hey. If you wanna wait for
the police, go ahead, call 'em!

316
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,623
Call Eric. Go on, call him.

317
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:23,687
I don't think he's coming very soon.

318
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,815
Bears don't come into town
here unless they're starving.

319
00:30:47,928 --> 00:30:49,648
Really desperate.

320
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,464
Certainly not in daylight.

321
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,655
And even if they are crazy with
hunger, they don't enter buildings.

322
00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:00,731
They just don't do that.
Look at its eyes. They're red.

323
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:05,722
Inflamed. Possibly this bear
was infected with something.

324
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:08,142
That's hemorrhaging from the head-shot.

325
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,568
Maybe.

326
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:18,397
This bear isn't starving. It
isn't even fucking peckish.

327
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,010
So this is a typical
predator behaviour. Again.

328
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,415
Vincent. This isn't it happening again,
this isn't what your so frightened of.

329
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,793
I know what you think. This isn't it!

330
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:36,250
What?

331
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,642
Tell me what you think it is I think.

332
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:41,950
Wasps.

333
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,852
I know all about wasps.

334
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,770
And you know they're all gone.

335
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,370
- Do I?
- We'll never see them again. Chance in a trillion.

336
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,090
You two brought the roof down on
the glacier cavern and that was that.

337
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:58,864
No more wasps.

338
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,239
As for this bear,

339
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:05,477
you can't tell aberrant
behaviour from stomach contents.

340
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,002
I think you need to find a live one.

341
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:26,290
Yes. No. I, I understand. It's
just... I've been calling all day.

342
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:29,415
But I'll try again tomorrow.

343
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:32,927
Maybe the minister will have
time to speak in the morning.

344
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:42,423
She is not up there.

345
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:44,582
And who, may I ask, are you?

346
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:46,244
I'm here to help.

347
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,770
You can't help me, my
business is with the Governor.

348
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:54,170
I am officially authorised to
expedite gubernatorial concerns.

349
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:55,496
"Gubernatorial".

350
00:32:57,595 --> 00:33:00,699
I'm sorry, my time is spent
in the corridors of power in

351
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:05,398
Oslo, and um, we often employ
language which must seem to be

352
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:08,713
a quaint and hermetic.

353
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,145
Get out of my way, you ridiculous man.

354
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:17,104
Oi, oi, oi, where the fuck
do you think your going?

355
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:22,187
You were not here! The authorities
lost control of everything!

356
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:26,616
People died, and now people are
dying again and what the fuck are

357
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,148
they doing about it?!

358
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:29,699
You're not going up there!

359
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:39,018
- Hello!
- Hildur, can you come down and take a look at this?

360
00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:41,117
I'll be down in five minutes.

361
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,350
Nine years he worked out there
and the conditions in the Congo

362
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:50,896
were truly hellish.

363
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:55,121
Warlords being financed by
multi-national mineral companies.

364
00:33:55,156 --> 00:33:58,717
Hindemith in the middle of all this.

365
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:05,380
They excavate enormous mountains
of mud, they use little children

366
00:34:05,415 --> 00:34:08,376
and they find diamonds,
called blood diamonds.

367
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:13,935
Rubies, emeralds, valuable
rare earth metals like coltan...

368
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,570
Where does this take us?

369
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,347
All of this activity, most
of this activity, involves

370
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,968
unspeakable suffering.

371
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:25,495
Child labour, mass executions,
there are reports of cannibalism.

372
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,589
Eric I, I don't see...

373
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,467
The barman says he spoke of it.

374
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,411
Hindemith?

375
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:31,732
All the time.

376
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,090
So...?

377
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:41,610
I think he witnessed things that
haunted him. Terrible things.

378
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:46,215
- And...?
- They sent someone here to kill him. To silence him.

379
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,450
Who did?

380
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:49,096
These people.

381
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,922
So who cut the spine out of the husky?

382
00:35:01,972 --> 00:35:04,010
That could have been a warning.

383
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,010
They sent him a warning after
they cut off his head off?

384
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,048
I'm trying to build a profile of the crime.

385
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,308
This isn't how it's done.

386
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:12,653
- I'm trying.
- I know you're trying!

387
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:24,770
I have to tell you something.

388
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,010
What?

389
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:38,071
I can't come home tonight.

390
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:41,761
I have so much to do,
I'll sleep in the office.

391
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:07,161
Oh. Don't turn on the light.

392
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:13,764
Where were you? Been phoning.

393
00:36:15,446 --> 00:36:18,279
Stuff happened in the school.

394
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:19,651
What stuff?

395
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,386
Come here.

396
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:36,190
How are you? Mmm? You okay?

397
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:44,010
I have, erm... I'm having
a little trouble swallowing.

398
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:50,154
- There is a clinic...
- No clinic...

399
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:52,132
No, don't. Shh. No, no, no.

400
00:36:55,290 --> 00:37:02,610
I am going to sell the
Muriel for scrap. To Bergson.

401
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:06,605
Fifty thousand maybe.
This place that I've found

402
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,317
as a treatment that I read all about...

403
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,417
- It's a fraud.
- Hey...

404
00:37:10,452 --> 00:37:16,818
No. There's testimonials from
people... people who've got better.

405
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:20,329
It's the one thing they
know for sure, honey.

406
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:24,748
Nothing has ever slowed this down
or changed its course in anyone.

407
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:26,811
It's scientific...

408
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:35,010
The worst thing we could
do... is lie to ourselves.

409
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:52,815
They are taking everything away from us.

410
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:57,725
Everything. And this is how it starts.

411
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,729
I am no longer governor of Fortitude.

412
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,026
Good night, Dan.

413
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,556
There we go, princess.

414
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,079
I thought it might be whisky, but
it doesn't smell like whisky to me.

415
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:33,150
Know what it is?

416
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,610
Smells like reindeer juice.

417
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,284
I appreciate this, Captain Tannar.

418
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,117
What the hell's going on?

419
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,308
Ingrid. Fuck's sake.

420
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,579
Get in the car, Rune.

421
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:44,255
- Hello, Tavrani. Got a moment?
- Yeah.

422
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,700
You remember once you got hold
of some, err, reindeer juice?

423
00:41:55,424 --> 00:42:00,113
- What?
- You know. Muscimol. We didn't dare take it, we were just kids.

424
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:03,983
Ever try it since?

425
00:42:05,618 --> 00:42:07,695
It's not like a bit of weed, Eric.

426
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:10,268
You don't mess with that stuff.

427
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,928
We used to mess with everything else.

428
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:15,757
This is a very serious
trip. It can go very wrong.

429
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:16,798
And then?

430
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:24,066
Horrors. Nightmares. Unnameable
dread. It can last for days.

431
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:27,109
Some people don't ever come back.

432
00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:31,635
They say it lets your
soul join the spirit world.

433
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:35,442
Battle demons so you can heal your tribe.

434
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,135
Sounds like just your kind of stuff.

435
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,438
Why are you here, Eric?

436
00:42:43,453 --> 00:42:45,953
Ever heard of a Laszlo Hindemith?

437
00:42:45,988 --> 00:42:47,370
Nope.

438
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,890
Just started at the Research Centre.

439
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:54,793
About two weeks ago, he dropped
out. Started doing weird stuff.

440
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:56,970
Pills. Animal sedatives.

441
00:42:57,046 --> 00:42:58,243
No shit.

442
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,970
Seems he was hiding some
serious mental health issues.

443
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:07,005
In fact, I'd say he was falling apart.

444
00:43:08,073 --> 00:43:09,637
Why are you telling me this?

445
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,872
He was drinking reindeer juice, Tavrani.

446
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,024
I told you. I don't do it.

447
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:17,937
Let alone give it out.

448
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:28,299
So if I open this and find
a fresh batch, you'll have an

449
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:29,992
explanation for that?

450
00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:40,407
I bet you've got half a
litre chilled down in here.

451
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:49,631
_

452
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:53,370
The demon is among us.

453
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,571
Ingrid!
