You had him.

165
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:14,032
He taunted you and then
you let him get away.

166
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,234
I shot and wounded him.

167

Is that a fact?

168
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:23,037
And then he turned into, err, a big
dog and ran off into the blizzard.

169
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,265
I didn't say...

170
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:27,342
That's exactly what the
other men are saying, Eric.

171
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,686
Perhaps...

172
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:32,639
Someone killed Bianca in the
muscimol den and put her body

173
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,888
where we found Hindemith's
body, because they wanted us to

174
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:38,266
think it was the same
killer when it wasn't.

175
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:40,807
So we could be looking at two
killers, and one is a copy cat...

Cat Killers in the real world!

a package in my room.

190
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:35,954
Doing... bad?

191

To Elena.

Elena's condition is intractable.

Everyone in the specialist team
who examined her. Listen to me, Dan.

Khatri is in a terrible position.

She can't simply let Elena
die, that's not a possibility.

As long as there is life there,
Khatri has to treasure that life.

the overwhelming smell is fear.

all that death because out of it,
