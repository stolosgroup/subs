00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,900
But how could he?

171
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,931
He went outside.

172
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:58,035
Liam was sick, and he went outside.

173
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,710
Why?

174
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:03,615
Why would he do that?

175
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,682
Maybe he called out.
There was no one at home.

176
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,318
Who knows what he wanted or what he needed?

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,055
(sighs)

178
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:17,656
But his mother wasn't there.

179
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:21,630
I should have been
there, but I was with you.

Natalie Yelburton.

192

D11's bigger. It'll sleep two people.

197
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:18,357
D11 is closer.

198

Why do you think she's not alone?

Turn around. Put your
hands behind your back.

Who's she with?

204
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,579
Is he a flight risk

205
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:47,451
or a danger to society?

206
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:49,683
Don't speak to the suspect.

207
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,956
What I hear from you is a man

208

who likes the sound of
his own clever voice.

209

Why do you find my being
here so threatening?

(chuckles) I don't find you threatening.

211

Should I find you threatening?

212
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:01,425
Are you threatening me?

213
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:02,865
If I'm a suspect for what's happened,

214
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,095
it's fucking ridiculous. Don't you agree?

215
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,862
Have you spoken to a U.K. lawyer yet?

216
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:06,861
No.

217

You look after him, don't you?

Nobody. Why, that's what I'm saying.

<i>Hildur Odegard.</i>

504
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:01,136
What had Charlie found?

505
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,871
Didn't say.

506
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,239
I don't believe you.

507
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:08,310
This new policeman...

508
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:12,812
you think he's going to sniff you out?

509
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:20,145
You know, nothing buried
in permafrost ever decays.

510
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:23,721
Disease doesn't die in the ground.

511
00:27:23,786 --> 00:27:27,352
And you're a toxic old
man, aren't you, Henry?

512
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:30,357
So you and your cancer will leave here,

513
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:33,726
and you'll die all alone on the mainland.

514

(chuckles)

515
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:38,194
Say cheese, Hildur.

516
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:39,995
- Bye, Henry.

<i>He wanted to tell me about it... </i>

519

<i>said it would change everything.</i>

520
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,011
<i>I told Hildur.</i>

521
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,778
<i>Then I went to bed.</i>

522
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,850
<i>I couldn't sleep, though.</i>

523

<i>I wanted to find the phone</i>

524
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:13,918
and listen to Charlie,

525
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,422
Charlie again.

526
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,156
The message had gone.

527
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:22,555
Gone?

528
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:26,456
What had he found?

529
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,894
<i>I don't know.</i>

530
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,995
He said he'd have to rewrite his report.

531
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,363
What report?

532
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:37,867
<i>Hildur's Glacier Hotel.</i>

533
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:41,202
She can't go ahead
without government say-so.

534
00:28:41,268 --> 00:28:43,802
The government's waiting
on Charlie's impact report.

535
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:45,843
Charlie said in his message

536
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:48,410
that he'd found something
that changed everything.

537
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,283
<i>Morton: Okay. All right.</i>

538

<i>Let's start with wind
chimes and infidelity.</i>

539
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:57,382
<i>What about them?</i>

540
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:59,579
<i>What other illicit connections
should I know about?</i>

<i>(indistinct audio playing on headphones)</i>

542

What are you doing in here?

543
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:16,502
I have some information I need
to feed into the interrogation.

544
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:18,198
Information? Right.

545
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,207
Yeah.

546
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:20,575
Fuck off.

547
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,110
Beg your pardon?

548
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:24,142
Oh, I'm sorry.

549
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,342
Is it the accent? It's the accent.

550
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:31,285
You can fuck right off.

551
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:36,320
All right.

552
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:38,528
Let me put it to you this way.

553
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,030
Does she know that you are fucking Trish?

554
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:53,133
Give that to Dan,

555
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:54,971
and set up a video feed for me

556
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:56,537
so I can watch this interrogation...

557
00:29:58,274 --> 00:30:00,440
preferably someplace
where I won't be disturbed.

558

<i>(no audible dialogue)</i>

00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:39,977
Jason, can you give us an account

569
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,841
with witnesses, if possible,

570
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,008
of your whereabouts throughout
Friday and into Friday evening?

571
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:45,976
No, I don't think I can.

572
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,512
Between 7:00 and 7:30.

573
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,480
(chuckles)

574
00:30:50,554 --> 00:30:53,352
I was with my brother Ciaran in his shop

575
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,855
arguing about money.

576
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:58,087
Bring Ciaran Donnelly in.

577
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:11,435
Tell us about this.

578
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:14,738
That?

579
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,739
<i>Okay.</i>

580
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:21,179
It's been in a box in a cupboard

581
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,609
in our house for years.

582
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:24,113
It's an elephant's tooth.

583
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:28,417
Why are you carrying it around?

584
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,649
Just found it, shoved it in my pocket.

585
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,785
No reason.

586
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,661
<i>This was found in Stoddart's bedroom.</i>

587

What is this?

588
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,801
It's a diagram of a mammoth's jawbone.

589
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:56,472
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

590
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,368
I showed that tooth

591
00:31:58,442 --> 00:32:00,441
to Stoddart in the car park.

592
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:03,041
I told him I found it in the ground.

593
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:06,849
He got annoyed when I wouldn't
just hand the thing over.

594
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:08,345
It got a bit shove-y.

595
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:10,352
And that's absolutely

596
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:11,888
everything that happened.

597
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:13,657
So this... this thing,

598
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,153
it's a fake?

599
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:17,025
He said if I found it on the island,

600
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,688
then it wasn't mine to sell.

601
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:21,359
And he believed you?
Did he offer you money?

602
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:23,495
Did he think it was real?

603
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,735
Is this what got him killed?

it's not an affair.

This is Fortitude. It gets cold.

00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:15,885
We get close.

620
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:18,922
It's uncomplicated.

621
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:23,425
- Are you all right?
- What?

622
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:25,025
Yes. Yes, I'm...

623
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,231

He was lovely.

625
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:35,834
He was a lovely man.

626

No, this is just...

627
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,938
brutal.

628
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,904
Jason didn't do this.

629
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:47,808
Do you know that for a fact?

630
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:50,111
No.

631
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,144
I was with him.

632
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:55,415
He was just ordinary.

633
00:33:55,482 --> 00:33:57,921
He's just an ordinary man.

634
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,256
I want you to take this to your laboratory,

and I want you to run tests on it,

636
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:07,389

<i>how old it is,</i>

00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,629

Listen, you don't tell

Liam got very excited
about seeing polar bears,
