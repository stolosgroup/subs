1
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:13,040
Let me go now, please.

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:14,337
Your wife's sick.

3
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:15,787
What if I could help her?

4
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:19,982
Khatri found someone with
altered genetic qualities.

5
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:21,767
A way to repair diseases.

6
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:22,883
Speak to Khatri.

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:24,721
(SCREAMS)

8
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:26,291
We need to get you to the hospital.

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,513
You need stitches.

10
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:29,721
Talk to her. Calm her down.

11
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:30,947
Let me go!

12
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:32,276
Who's the extraction?

13
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:33,302
It's the sheriff.

14
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:34,728
Anything we should know?

15
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:36,321
Bit of a character apparently.

16
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,137
It's not this boy who'll kill the demon.

17
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:42,116
It's you. Only Dan.

18
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:44,750
Too late.

33
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,226
Sheriff.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,463
Sheriff Anderssen?

35
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,739
Governor Munk.

36
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:04,216
The, um, the man you brought out.

37
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:06,524
The, uh, the dead man.

38
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:07,936
Yup?

39
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,586
He made a confession?

40
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:15,727
He certainly did.

41
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:23,894
Is that his blood?

42
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:25,829
Yep.

43
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,312
Did you do this?

44
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:33,257
No. He did it all on his own.

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,324
Mutilated himself.

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,790
Cut off his own genitals.

47
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:48,855
Well, who knows the full
extent of his madness?

48
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,704
Hmm.

49
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:52,606
Tomak,

50
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,857
Governor Odegard...

51
00:02:58,676 --> 00:02:59,972
Bianca Mankyo,

52
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,032
the geologist.

53
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,038
- Hindemith.
- Hindemith.

54
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,094
Perhaps we'll never know.

55
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,347
It was a...

56
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:14,862
A blessing you stopped him.

57
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,828
A fucking blessing.

58
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,334
Out of my way, please.

59
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:40,233
Lars has found a body
and this eyeball in a car.

60
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,266
He recognized the
deceased as Trude Ekeland.

61
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,391
This is her eye.

62
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,217
Where's the car?

63
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,526
Top road.

64
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,603
You're coming with me.

65
00:03:58,303 --> 00:03:59,918
When a parasite infects a host,

66
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:02,017
manipulation of the
host's genome can occur

67
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,195
at an epigenetic level.

68
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,500
Uh-huh. Go on.

69
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:08,591
The parasite and the host
are competing inside

70
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:11,617
the same genetic space
and something has to give.

71
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,260
What gives?

72
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:15,598
Dan Anderssen.

73
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:17,724
What's he got to do with this?

74
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,191
He was infested by the wasp larvae.

75
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,954
Should have died but he didn't.

76
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,991
He changed.

77
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:25,350
I've already witnessed
his increased pain thresholds,

78
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:29,410
his aggression, vitality
and most significant,

79
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:33,244
his ability to regenerate
damaged tissue.

80
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:37,643
Tissue regeneration, Michael.

81
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,478
Everything I do,

82
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:45,310
everything that motivates me,
my work and knowledge

83
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:46,902
is about hope.

84
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,190
This might be Freya's hope.

85
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,074
You need to bring him to me.

86
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,305
Yeah, you want me to bring him to you?

87
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,387
Open this.

88
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:13,078
More padding.

89
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,238
Especially around the head.

90
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,047
The lining's thermally insulated.

91
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:19,073
Sedative drip in here.

92
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,341
Delivery timer.

93
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,017
Keep him under once he's in the chopper.

94
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,407
Good. Last thing I want's
a ruckus in a helicopter.

95
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,493
Did you enjoy it?

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,817
Killing him?

97
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,059
I don't know that I enjoy
anything much anymore, Petra.

98
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:47,101
I see the thing that has to be done

99
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:49,839
and I have no hesitation in doing it.

100
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:53,683
Who decides what has to be done?

101
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,777
It declares itself.

102
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,570
I never used to see things so clearly.

103
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,385
But things change.

104
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:10,713
People don't.

105
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,760
Dan Anderssen killed Vladek.

106
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,424
That's not the Dan Anderssen we knew.

107
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:21,808
That's some kind of monster.

108
00:06:22,844 --> 00:06:24,944
What Doctor Khatri thinks is,

109
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,135
is that monster,

110
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,911
it could be...

111
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,666
could be the hope we're looking for.

112
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,187
If I sit here with you honey,

113
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:52,169
and I don't try this one last thing...

114
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,867
And I lose you?

115
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:00,179
I wouldn't be your Michael.

116
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:34,580
I love you, girl.

117
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:16,644
Hmm.

118
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,683
Both her eyes are gone.

119
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:24,827
Did she do this to herself?

120
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:26,742
Yep.

121
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,579
She has a sister in Vukobejina.

122
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,181
It's happening again.

123
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:34,878
When everything went crazy before,

124
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,917
the one thing that kept me sane,

125
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,273
that I clung too all the...

126
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,133
all the time...

127
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:53,869
No matter how dark and frightening,

128
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:56,306
I trusted you...

129
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,181
Guarding us.

130
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,489
I felt safe here,

131
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,829
even in that madness.

132
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:07,572
And then you were so sick.

133
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:10,095
All those weeks.

134
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,501
And what came back...

135
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,651
Like Dan died

136
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,846
and walked over into
the land of the dead

137
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,963
and a demon took his shape...

138
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:32,931
and came back into the world amongst us.

139
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,124
I look at your face, Petra.

140
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:49,425
And for the first time ever,
I see it in you.

141
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:51,304
What?

142
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,665
Sami. Reindeer herder.

143
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:00,183
The blood of the tundra
flowing in your veins,

144
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:03,846
beneath your beautiful pale skin.

145
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,276
Did you kill Elena?

146
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,117
Yes.

147
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,203
I think I did.

148
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,118
She wanted me to.

149
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,133
Hey...

150
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:39,351
I'll drive Trude back in to town.

151
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,964
It's like...

152
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,453
Like I've had the most wonderful,

153
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:58,781
like, peaceful sleep.

154
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:00,417
Yeah?

155
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:02,677
Yeah. Vincent. Yes.

156
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:07,457
Like I can't remember
ever having before,

157
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:08,660
in all my life.

158
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,723
All the things I was worried about...

159
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:14,522
Work. You.

160
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:17,826
The shit I thought Khatri was up to.

161
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,746
It was just evaporated.

162
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,891
Love and goodwill, Vincent.

163
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,965
I know it sounds like hippy shit but I,

164
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:31,731
honestly... I mean...

165
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:35,250
(SIGHS)

166
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:42,715
And I heard a chorus, a choir.

167
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,368
It was celestial.

168
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:46,183
That's the word.

169
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,507
Shit.

170
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,825
Oh, he's not there.
Just the girl on her own.

171
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,133
Leave her!

172
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,644
What happened?

173
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:15,917
Shh.

174
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:17,706
Don't move, Petra.

175
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:20,549
- Your car got hit...
- I'm okay...

176
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,343
Hey, be still.

177
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,781
Let me up.

178
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,983
Let me go!

179
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:33,684
Let me go! Don't kill me, Dan!

180
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,946
Please! Let me go! Please!

181
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,656
Dan Anderssen!

182
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,422
Petra?

183
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,594
Sheriff around?

184
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:29,007
Petra, I am looking for Dan Anderssen.

185
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,454
Dan's gone.

186
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,117
I'm pretty sure.

187
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:37,228
You're gonna help me.

188
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,260
I know where Dan was...

189
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:49,986
last time he was Dan.

190
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:51,368
We'll start there then.

191
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,439
Come on.

192
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,458
I have one task:

193
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,383
the extraction of Dan Anderssen.

194
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:02,441
Yes, of course. I understand.

195
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,340
What about Khatri?

196
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,316
She'll be leaving, too.

197
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,967
I'll make my own
arrangements, fair enough.

198
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:12,733
No.

199
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
No?

200
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,206
You're staying.

201
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,643
The fuck do you mean by that?

202
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:18,976
What I mean by that,

203
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,014
is Schenthal Pharma

204
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,219
have paid you, to date, 185,000 euros

205
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,700
for managing this mess.

206
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,169
And before you go
anywhere you'll earn it.

207
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:35,139
And... If I refuse?

208
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,767
(CHUCKLES)

209
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:28,067
I found him here.

210
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:30,377
Not long after he went missing.

211
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:33,011
Completely...

212
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:35,619
completely crazy.

213
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:38,467
Chained to the stairs.

214
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,767
I was afraid he was gonna die.

215
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:44,817
He was raging, fevered,

216
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:48,554
drinking everything, purging.

217
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,541
- For two months.
- Two months?

218
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:54,968
Doctor Khatri said that Dan

219
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,700
had that parasite inside
him all that time.

220
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:02,233
Everyone else that was
infected like Dan was,

221
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
they all attacked someone.

222
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,810
He saw it coming.

223
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,173
He fought the thing, all by himself.

224
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:25,916
Why didn't you tell someone?

225
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,790
Because you love him?

226
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,634
Where did you get this stuff?

227
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,127
In Vukobejina.

228
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,908
A colleague, they knew all about it.

229
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:44,467
They acquired the knowledge
from the Sami Shaman

230
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,400
and reindeer herders.

231
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,475
It's known as reindeer
juice, or muscimol.

232
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,470
It'll protect me, against all this
blindness shit that's coming?

233
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,970
Well, I obviously used it
myself when I was there.

234
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:57,441
Jesus.

235
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,087
How did that work out?

236
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,900
Some side effects.

237
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,309
Side effects?

238
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,376
What kind of side effects?

239
00:18:06,473 --> 00:18:07,933
Mild hallucinations.

240
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,441
What, like cannabis?

241
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,185
I've never used cannabis.

242
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,538
No, I bet you haven't.

243
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:19,517
Ah Jesus, Jesus..

244
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,306
That, be careful!

245
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:26,626
That's really, that's really painful.

246
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,973
When I was told to hold back
the fuel for the fleet,

247
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:33,651
I was in fear of my life.

248
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:35,100
I know...

249
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:36,976
First because I thought Dag Tannar

250
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:38,396
was going to knock my block off.

251
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:42,278
And then because Hildur
was glaring at me.

252
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,933
Like a beady-eyed herring-gull.

253
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,567
I don't think that's right.

254
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:49,571
And I mean no disrespect when I say this

255
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,844
but I always thought Governor Odegard

256
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,191
was a very attractive woman.

257
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:56,807
Sexy?

258
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,577
Yes. That's what I mean.

259
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,631
Hildur.

260
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,028
CROWD: Hildur!

261
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:15,775
When I, uh, when I put on this jacket.

262
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,681
I become every man and
woman in this bar.

263
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:25,331
All of us loved Hildur Odegard.

264
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm just the one wearing the jacket

265
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,400
while you're all too busy going to work

266
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,920
and raising families and
doing what Hildur wanted.

267
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:42,964
Hildur Odegard was murdered.

268
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,700
She killed herself.

269
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:50,213
No.

270
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:52,882
She was murdered.

271
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,400
In cold blood.

272
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:56,826
Her killer made it look like suicide.

273
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:58,969
Murdered? Hildur was murdered?

274
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,536
So who murdered her?

275
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,848
I'll show you.

276
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:22,330
He's got the whole town with him.

277
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,481
All the hard drives.

278
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:33,518
- She infected?
- Yes.

279
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:35,051
How advanced is she?

280
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:36,774
Very. She's nearly done.

281
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,494
Right, are you going
to need all this stuff?

282
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,674
Incinerator.

283
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,191
Always liked you, Hildur.

284
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,421
Always thought that we had

285
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,314
an awful lot more in common than
we were able to acknowledge.

286
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:16,306
You had Eric.

287
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,900
I had Phyllisha.

288
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:28,433
Things could have been
very, very different.

289
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:34,567
Mmm.

290
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,333
No need for that kind of language.

291
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,296
I am not a murdering bastard!

292
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,362
It was an accident!

293
00:21:58,252 --> 00:21:59,448
Shh!

294
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,931
Keep your fucking voice down!

295
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:21,037
From inside that office,

296
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,350
Hildur Odegard protected us.

297
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,463
Cared for us.

298
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:32,313
Your families. Your kids.

299
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:40,153
And in there now, is
the man who killed her.

300
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:45,639
Erling Munk pushed Hildur Odegard
into a hole in the ice.

301
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:46,633
What the fuck?

302
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,967
Lars, you saw him out there.

303
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,289
Yes, I did!

304
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,552
Ralfi, you sent her to meet him!

305
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:56,341
- Arrest him!
- Yes, arrest him!

306
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:57,500
Arrest him?

307
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,878
Of course, fucking arrest him!

308
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:00,333
He's the governor.

309
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:01,741
He killed the governor!

310
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,921
Erling Munk is
the governor of Fortitude.

311
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:07,867
Erling Munk is the chief
of police of Fortitude.

312
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,767
They all love you.

313
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:13,158
This is all your fault.

314
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:16,300
- She was our shepherd!
- (CLAMORING)

315
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:19,160
She saved this town,
when it all went to hell!

316
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:20,153
Yes!

317
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:24,316
I am his sheriff. I answer to him!

318
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:27,679
He murdered Hildur!

319
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,391
Oh, you want justice?

320
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,839
ALL: Yes!

321
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:33,133
You want the rule of law?

322
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,233
Yes, we want the fucking rule of law.

323
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:39,367
The law you want is in your own hands!

324
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:40,633
(CLAMORING)

325
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,900
- Get him!
- Kill the fucker!

326
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,400
Get him!

327
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,700
(SHOUTING)

328
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:56,957
Dan.

329
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,300
It's Michael Lennox.

330
00:25:13,837 --> 00:25:15,170
(GRUNTS)

331
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:23,067
Khatri!

332
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,033
Doctor Khatri, wait!

333
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,216
Where are you going?

334
00:25:26,698 --> 00:25:29,500
Please. You can't leave.
I can't help her by myself.

335
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,833
Hey! Quieten down.

336
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,967
Fuck off!

337
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:33,149
Hey, no, don't.

338
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,908
Fuck!

339
00:25:38,822 --> 00:25:40,856
You need to find her
some reindeer juice.

340
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:43,653
More infection is on
the way from Vukobejina.

341
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,895
Fuck!

342
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,233

344
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,356
You pulled me out of
that burning cave, Michael.

345
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:43,233
This is the miracle.

346
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,967
This is what you're searching for.

347
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,862
And you're not the only one.

348
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,483
Hey. Hey. Sorry.

349
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,450
Hey, sorry. The, uh...

350
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:15,617
I need the reindeer juice.

351
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,083
The woman you brought back. The soldier.

352
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,497
You... you had some in a box.
Where is it?

353
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:20,094
My, my dad took it from us.

354
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,033
- Where, where did he put it?
- He destroyed it.

355
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,283
- Why would he do that?
- Because it's drugs.

356
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,083
We could go to prison.
He didn't want it around.

357
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,457
He didn't want us taking it
or selling it or anything.

358
00:27:27,483 --> 00:27:29,262
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

359
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:30,950
Give me the muscimol! I need it!

360
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,283
I have to have the reindeer juice!

361
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,491
Hey! You can't come in here and yell!

362
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:34,657
My mum is sick!

363
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:36,117
It's the cure for Natalie.

get this fucking thing

that Dr. Khatri say's is
coming at us from Vukobejina.

366
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:41,917
If Rune says Dad destroyed it

367
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:44,143
then he destroyed it
and that's all there is.

368
00:27:45,403 --> 00:27:46,562
He didn't.

369
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,442
He hid it.

370
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:52,851
I watched him.

371
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,805
Where?

372
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,562
Where did he put it?

373
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:01,995
Petra, open the door.

374
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:05,487
Munk's dead.

375
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:07,646
I know. It was Dan.

376
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,024
Open the door.

377
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:13,854
Promise me.

378
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,946
What?

379
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:16,963
You won't kill Dan.

380
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,650
He's no use to me dead.

00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:41,842
Unclip your seatbelt.

384
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,737
- Take off your headset.
- Why?

385
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:54,543
Just take off your headset.

Uh-huh.

390
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:01,769
When a polar bear catches its prey,

391
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:03,892
it eats them alive.

392
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:05,247
Did you know that?

393
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:09,806
It's true. I saw it once.

394
00:32:09,922 --> 00:32:11,189
Bear took a man.

395
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:14,674
Terrible thing.

396
00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:17,377
Terrible.

397
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:21,219
But at the time I thought,

398
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:26,837
"Wow, what must it be like?"

399
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,983
The Shamans, they think that
when a bear devours a man,

400
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:36,535
the man's spirit lives on in the bear.
