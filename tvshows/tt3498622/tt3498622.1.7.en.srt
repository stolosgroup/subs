Oh, so you want Dan
to lose his job? For what?

332
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
You used that phone,

333
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,740
and you called London.

334
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,450
You told them
I murdered Stoddart

335
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,750
just as I murdered Pettigrew.

336
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,350
I told you about
my feelings for Elena.

337
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,620
I trusted you with that

338
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,430
the same day Morton brings
her in for questioning,

339
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,730

340
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,990
<i>just to get at me.</i>

341

No, that's not right.

342
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,730
I trusted you, Henry.

343
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,470
I let you stay on this island

344
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,000
so you could die well.

345
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,480
I wanted to be there for you.

346
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,310
<i>So tell me.</i>

347
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,540
Where's Morton?

348
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,280
All I did was make the call

349
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,750
and nothing else.

350
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,650
What the fuck
have I done? I...

351
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,230
I don't know.

352
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,930
You didn't actually
see Eric Odegard

353
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,510
put Billy Pettigrew
into the police car?

354
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,010
I didn't have to.

355
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,510
He disappeared.

356
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,370
The next day, they're pulling
his carcass off that beach.

357
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,780
See, what you're giving me here
is circumstantial evidence.

358
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,350
I think I will be taking
that printout back with me.

359
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,340
<i>I found that on the beach
where Pettigrew was killed.</i>

Hmm, hmm?

363
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,290
Do the ballistics
on Eric Odegard's rifle.

364
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,560
That's his slug
I found on the beach.

365
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,330
Why not another cop?

366
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,930
Oh, they're all in it.

367
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,330
They're all covering for Eric.

368
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,930
Sheriff Anderssen, too?

369
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,575
He carries around photos
of Pettigrew's body parts.

370
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,540
He tried to scare me with them.

371
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,070
Why would he scare you?

372
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,720
I said he tried.

373
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,520
I've given you plenty.

374
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,020
You can go now.

375
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,270
Eric killed Pettigrew
for that printout, okay,

376
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,200
but that's mine now.

377
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,340
And I get the Fortitude
Police off your back

378
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,100
if I nail Eric, right?

379
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,440
Sounds like a deal.

380
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,010
Sounds like paranoia.

Aren't you curious...

383
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,130
What?

384
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,110
What Pettigrew found
beneath the ice?

His buried treasure?

Okay, we're ready.
Let's go.

<i>Yeah.

399
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,970
I'll take them now.

400
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
Get off the boat.

401

I kill her.

402

Okay, move.

All right.
It's a mix-up.
