1
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:12,694
- _
- I am no longer governor.

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:13,891
I will be in charge...

3
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:15,883
What we learn from her may yet save lives.

4
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:21,601
Bears don't come into town
here unless they're starving.

5
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:24,356
The victim was murdered and decapitated.

6
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,958
Is Rune involved in what happened?

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,000
- I'm trying.
- I know you're trying.

10
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:32,221
Okay.

11
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:35,444
I'm talking to you as your sister.

12
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,765
As opposed to what?

13
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:43,330
Laszlo Hindemith was found dead.
The place was full of drugs.

14
00:01:43,365 --> 00:01:45,135
Your belt was in his bed.

15
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,055
I lost that belt. Weeks ago.

16
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:48,871
Where?

17
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:51,169
If I knew that, Ingrid,
I wouldn't have lost it.

18
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:56,222
Where were you when Hindemith was killed?

19
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:04,503
Rune Lennox, you're under
arrest for suspicion of murder.

20
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:05,880
- What?
- And fuck your rights.

21
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:08,630
Woah...

22
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,152
Shit.

23
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:16,153
This is Eric... Tavrani Tavra is
now a murder suspect, repeat...

24
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,678
- Tavra is a murder suspect...
- That was him.

25
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:22,653
Apprehend and arrest.
Repeat. Apprehend and arrest.

26
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,181
Eric, I just saw him, he went
right in front of me, he's heading

27
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:28,349
East out of town.

28
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:40,957
There he is!

29
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,454
Go right at the fork.

30
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:05,970
Good morning, Hildur.

31
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:15,675
I assume that's not government property?

32
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,982
- The mouse mat?
- Yes. The mouse mat.

33
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,568
This is your notice of termination.

34
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:41,775
It includes a legally binding
confidentiality clause.

35
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:47,579
Three copies, each of the
three requires a signature.

36
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:54,230
I have also prepared a press release.

37
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,471
"Looking forward to new
challenges in local government".

38
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,109
Let's not make it any
harder than it has to be.

39
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:19,765
Erling Munk.

40
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,274
Dmitri Podnikov?

41
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,390
He's the Mayor of Vukobejina.

42
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,278
If it's an official call,
you must hand it back to me.

43
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:38,146
_

44
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:43,225
_

45
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:44,643
_

46
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,922
_

47
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:55,725
_

48
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,874
_

49
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:08,807
- I speak excellent Russian.
- I know.

50
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:13,598
I thought it was a wasp.

51
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,572
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

52
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,581
Really?

53
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:26,944
Yeah, yeah. I'm fi... I'm fine.

54
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:32,548
Okay then, let's go.

55
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,154
- You want milk?
- What?

56
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:39,892
With your Americano.

57
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:43,904
You don't put milk in an Americano.

58
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:47,887
It's the only one you don't but milk in.

59
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:52,927
That's why they call it an
Americano. Not a Latte, for example.

60
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,595
Or a Cappuccino.

61
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,338
You're the guy that killed the bear.

62
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,394
So?

63
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:01,121
Coffee expert too!

64
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:04,812
You're welcome.

65
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,847
An Americano with milk.

66
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:14,192
I need you to take me round
the coast of Vukobejina.

67
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,866
The Mayor just called me, for a meeting.

68
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,315
You've got a chopper, get
you there in half hour.

69
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,415
What the fuck do you need a boat for?

70
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,500
I like the sea air.

71
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:28,806
Hildy, you hate the sea air.

72
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:33,411
So obviously you have some
good reason to lie to my face.

73
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,044
I'll pay you, of course.

74
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:39,637
No, thank you, Governor.
I don't need your charity.

75
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:45,342
I'm not the Governor
any more. They fired me.

76
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:47,984
They didn't.

77
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:49,464
They fucking did.

78
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,361
Oh, Hildy, I'm sorry.

79
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,319
Thank you. Yes.

80
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:04,711
I got Hindemith's killer...
it's Tavrani Tavra.

81
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:07,875
The taxidermist?

82
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,685
What... they can't kill people?

83
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:14,344
No, I was just, surprised.

84
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:18,264
We're looking into motive,
but it's, it's definitely him.

85
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:19,707
Okay.

86
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,063
You don't seem very interested.

87
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:29,711
No. No. That's, err,
that's good. Of course.

88
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,785
Thanks for letting me know.

89
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:36,554
- Are you okay?
- Sure. Listen. I have to go.

90
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:43,016
Well?

91
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,455
I'll take your charity.

92
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,392
Brain scan's clear.

93
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,280
Pity.

94
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,104
Ingrid? Need you to get over to Tavra's.

95
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:07,021
Lock it down and start a
search before it gets dark.

96
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:07,982
Okay.

97
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:11,443
Don't worry. I'll do everything.

98
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:25,445
Doctor... where the hell's Dan Anderssen?

99
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,493
I don't know.

100
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:34,016
You told us he was sort of... dead.

101
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:40,257
He is arisen.

102
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,517
I'm Dr. Khatri.

103
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,064
I'm Dan.

104
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:53,464
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

105
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,034
I want to see Elena.

106
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:57,153
So I was told. Are you a relative?

107
00:10:57,602 --> 00:11:01,879
No. I tried to kill her. But I missed.

108
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:05,225
Call the hospital.

109
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:10,170
She's everything to
me. The love of my life.

110
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:13,957
You're the Sheriff?

111
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:19,424
Err, I'm sorry. I heard
you were... very unwell.

112
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,093
I want to see Elena.

113
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:59,304
I'm afraid her coma is the severest
type, a metabolic encephalopathy.

114
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,006
But she's in no pain.

115
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,363
Is it because I shot her?

116
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,984
Not at all.

117
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:10,631
She was attacked by wasps from
the mammoth and infected with a

118
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,295
tiny parasitic organism... a toxoplasma.

119
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:16,274
We've seen nothing like it.

120
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,324
It's been in deep freeze in the
permafrost for thousands of years.

121
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,002
Her immune system is fighting it.

122
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:23,657
We're helping her fight
it in every way we can.

123
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,217
Can she hear me?

124
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,688
I'm afraid not.

125
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,925
She doesn't know I'm here?

126
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,661
She's asleep, Mr.
Anderssen. She knows nothing.

127
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:34,904
Will she wake up?

128
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:37,342
The machines are keeping her alive.

129
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:42,638
Why the security?

130
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,469
It's just a precaution.

131
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,601
She's the only survivor we have.

132
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,625
We still don't know
what we're dealing with.

133
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:03,762
Please feel free to
visit any time you like.

134
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:21,322
Did they say why? They fired you?

135
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:23,623
Ignoring the fuel quota.

136
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,085
That was the official excuse.

137
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:33,072
Was there an unofficial one?

138
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,712
In politics, always.

139
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,560
You did the right thing.

140
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:56,716
There it is. The Arctic Riviera.

141
00:14:55,545 --> 00:15:03,025
Eric? Petra? Who's there?

142
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:09,956
Dan. Are you alright?

143
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,678
I'm a bit dizzy.

144
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,044
What are you doing here?

145
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:20,524
I went to see Elena. She
doesn't want to be there.

146
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:21,724
What?

147
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,404
She's not happy.

148
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:26,675
Dr. Khatri's taking good care of her.

149
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:30,844
I didn't like Dr. Khatri.

150
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,844
You need to go back to hospital.

151
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:35,204
I didn't like her at all.

152
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,364
I'm getting you back to hospital now.

153
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:46,965
No, you're not, Eric. I'm fine. Really.

154
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:57,487
Okay. If you're not going back to
hospital, you're staying with us.

155
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:01,923
Your call.

156
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,891
How was it?

157
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:24,553
Cold. Wet. Here...

158
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,416
Thank you, Rune.

159
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:44,795
Ingrid just called.

160
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,046
Oh, mum. She's being ridiculous.

161
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:50,615
It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Please.

162
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,051
Okay, baby.

163
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:11,760
Hey! Hey! Hey! Mum. Mum. Open the door!

164
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:17,904
Mum! MUM! MUM!

165
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:19,122
Where's the head?

166
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,428
- What?
- My head. Where is it?

167
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,339
It's not really your head, is it?

168
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:28,590
I mean, technically it used
to belong to someone else.

169
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:31,155
- I'll ask the questions.
- First you tell me where it is.

170
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:36,364
It's here. In a fridge.

171
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:37,427
It's evidence.

172
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:49,115
Okay. I killed Hindemith.

173
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:56,324
We know you killed him. You
had his head in your fridge.

174
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,041
We want to know why you did it.

175
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:09,124
I killed him... I killed
him because he was crazy.

176
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:14,468
His soul was in torment.
He was, erm... I...

177
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,833
Anyway, I released him. He was happy.

178
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,279
It was all good.

179
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,029
- Happy?
- Yeah.

180
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:28,810
So you took his head. As a souvenir?

181
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,269
He didn't need it.

182
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:36,280
- Who's been living with you?
- No one.

183
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,509
There was a holdall on
a bed. With clothes in.

184
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:41,924
And a hunting knife.

185
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:45,977
You should never have come.
You should have stayed away.

186
00:19:46,024 --> 00:19:47,217
Someone took it. Just now.

187
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,474
You don't know what this is,
you don't know what you're doing.

188
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,421
WHO TOOK IT?

189
00:19:55,456 --> 00:20:00,987
The demon is among us. We're
going to die. All of us.

190
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:03,445
Nothing else can save us.

191
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:10,944
Slow down, Natalie. What's that there?

192
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,204
The deer was eating it.

193
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,484
That's not possible. They're herbivores.

194
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,732
Bears prey on reindeer.
Not the other way round.

195
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:46,593
Did it kill it?

196
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:48,823
That's not possible either.

197
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:57,493
Fuck! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

198
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:58,688
FUCK!

199
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,168
It's out here, you know it
is, it's fucking everywhere.

200
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:14,530
They're fucked. We're
fucked. Everything's FUCKED.

201
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,044
Vince.

202
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:19,060
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

203
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:24,761
I'll go get the tents, you saw
up the corpses for samples. Okay?

204
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:35,417
FUCK!

205
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:47,045
I'll be dead by the morning.

206
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:10,061
I found his belt in Hindemith's place.

207
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:13,844
I wanted to deal with it. I'm sorry.

208
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,693
I wasn't sure it was important.

209
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,333
Important?

210
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,967
Someone took a holdall from
Tavra's... it could have been him!

211
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,001
He won't talk to me.

212
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:30,006
Fine. He can talk to me.

213
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:37,764
What's your meeting about?

214
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:40,070
Ah. He didn't say, exactly.

215
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:46,286
Does he know you're not governor any more?

216
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:50,724
I haven't told anyone yet.

217
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:53,065
He didn't want to talk on
the phone. He sounded...

218
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,597
Where is everyone?

219
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:01,364
He sounded what?

220
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:02,525
Scared.

221
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm not gonna make it home by nightfall.

222
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm gonna find us a place to stay.

223
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:15,614
Okay. Good.

224
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:28,724
Hildur.

225
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:30,165
Dmitri.

226
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:40,181
Hildur, this is Major Potemkin
of the Federal Security Service.

227
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,568
He just arrived today.

228
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:47,389
Unfortunately Governor Odegard
speaks no Russian... but luckily

229
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:51,853
Major Potemkin has a little English
so he can follow our conversation.

230
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,884
Oh, good. Very good.

231
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:57,101
So, what brings you to
Vukobejina, Governor?

232
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,190
I just, err, wanted to say
goodbye in person, Dmitri.

233
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:03,738
I'm leaving Fortitude.

234
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,051
I'm sorry to hear that.

235
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:09,592
We have always been able to
meet and share our problems.

236
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:14,124
I'm looking forward to new
challenges in local government.

237
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:18,172
I see. I only hope I'll share
the same excellent working

238
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,006
relationship with your successor.

239
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:24,159
I can't tell you how much I respect him.

240
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:29,644
I know you leave Fortitude a much
better place than you found it.

241
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:33,384
Well, sadly, not everybody
would agree with that.

242
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:39,524
- But things here are great.
- Yes.

243
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:43,524
It's, erm, certainly nice and quiet.

244
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:47,199
On the surface maybe, but
underneath Vukobejina is a very

245
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:48,743
happening place.

246
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,204
With such a fascinating history.

247
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:56,764
You remember my interest in local history?

248
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:58,564
Of course.

249
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:02,901
I'd love to tell you about it some time.

250
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,539
Yes, I'm, err, staying at
the hotel tonight, so....

251
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:15,498
Well, thank you for
making time for me, Dmitri.

252
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:18,230
God be with us all.

253
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:21,769
Yes.

254
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,964
I'm sorry about before.

255
00:26:55,965 --> 00:27:02,404
I, I overreacted and it was,
undignified and unscientific.

256
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:03,725
Yeah.

257
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:13,199
When I was a kid, I
wanted to be a magician.

258
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:14,324
What?

259
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:17,444
Just saying. Y'know. Bit of background.

260
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:22,392
Right. Do you want to do it?

261
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:26,444
Huh?

262
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,005
With me. Now. It.

263
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,255
It's not a new advance
in epigenetics, Vincent...

264
00:27:35,678 --> 00:27:38,209
It's a simple Yes or No answer.

265
00:27:38,763 --> 00:27:39,963
Yeah.

266
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:45,964
Fully clothed in one
sleeping bag? Can't be done.

267
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:48,114
We're scientists, Vincent.

268
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:56,165
We explore the furthest boundaries
of the possible. It's what we do.

269
00:27:56,965 --> 00:28:01,125
Well... when you put it like that.

270
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:38,457
_

271
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:08,157
_

272
00:29:18,805 --> 00:29:24,525
Eric. Thanks for coming in. Please.

273
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:29,631
Great news about the murder.

274
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:31,261
There are still some loose ends.

275
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,242
Ah, and I'm sure you'll tie them up.

276
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:40,575
Eric, you've been acting Sheriff
for a while now, with great

277
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:45,912
distinction... it's time
to make it permanent.

278
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,605
What about Dan? He seems much better.

279
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,219
It's, it's amazing.

280
00:29:53,317 --> 00:30:02,714
Sick leave. Forever.
Congratulations, Sheriff Odegard!

281
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:06,044
But, the governor of
Fortitude appoints the Sheriff.

282
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,397
What's your point?

283
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:08,731
Not Oslo.

284
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:14,476
I'm sorry, I thought
you, I assumed you knew.

285
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,444
Your wife was relieved
of her duties yesterday.

286
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:21,925
I am now acting governor of Fortitude.

287
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:32,884
Eric. Eric, I need you to focus now.

288
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:35,424
The town has been through terrible things.

289
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,844
It needs to get back to normal.

290
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:46,364
Ingrid? Yes, what?

291
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:49,757
What?

292
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:55,959
What? Call Petra in. I'll meet you there.

293
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:00,845
What?

294
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,270
It's coming.

295
00:31:58,025 --> 00:31:59,569
Jesus, Hildy.

296
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:02,952
That icy nordic gloom.

297
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:10,104
Come on, let's face it.

298
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:16,970
- My shit is way worse than yours is!
- How is that?

299
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,777
I bet you got a big fat payoff.

300
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:21,825
You can sell your boat!

301
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,776
- Buff up your resume.
- I'm middle-aged!

302
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:26,408
It's a bureaucrat's best years.

303
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:28,187
I'm unemployable!

304
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:34,664
So what? Who cares? So you
retire and live off Eric.

305
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:38,223
With Eric. Is what I meant.

306
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,576
No, I don't think I can.

307
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,825
Hmm?

308
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:50,648
I don't think I love Eric anymore.

309
00:32:53,145 --> 00:33:00,704
Oh, you are so fucking competitive.

310
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:01,291
What?

311
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:03,008
It doesn't matter how bad my shit is,

312
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:05,532
yours is always gotta be worse. Doesn't it?

313
00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:08,257
- Bullshit!
- You were always like that.

314
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:10,944
- No, I wasn't!
- Unbelievable.

315
00:33:17,585 --> 00:33:21,374
Look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry.

316
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:25,549
Yeah.

317
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:29,790
Have you told him?

318
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:39,556
You should probably
mention it. At some point.

319
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:47,348
Trust me, for that conversation,
there is no 'good time'.

320
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:53,744
As I'm sure that we both remember.

321
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:56,210
You broke my heart.

322
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:59,439
You broke mine first.

323
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:00,982
You broke mine worse.

324
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,686
Unbelievable.

325
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:14,582
Ugh! Damn, this vodka's good.
I want to get out of here.

326
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,542
You're right. Let's get a bottle.

327
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:17,852
Yeah.

328
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:19,351
Get a bottle.

329
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,082
Mr. Anderssen. Do you know what time it is?

330
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,271
No. I came to see Elena.

331
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:01,358
Well, I'm afraid it's not convenient.

332
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:03,340
Why's that? Is she busy?

333
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:05,280
It's not possible now, Mr. Anderssen.

334
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:07,398
- Why?
- I'm her doctor.

335
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:11,080
You said feel free to
visit anytime you like.

336
00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:12,701
I don't have to explain myself.

337
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,456
Those were your words.

338
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,514
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

339
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:20,703
I just want to say "good night".

340
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,965
It's me. We may have a problem here.

341
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,864
Something unexpected.

342
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,701
It's a girl. Lief Ericson saw
her when he was driving home.

343
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,479
- Where's her head?
- It's gone.

344
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,245
I can see that.

345
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:40,926
Then why did you ask?

346
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:44,426
We think it's been
taken. Like the other one.

347
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:48,142
Hindemith.

348
00:36:48,177 --> 00:36:51,475
I know his name. Jesus, Jesus Christ!

349
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:54,589
I have to report to Munk.

350
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:00,864
Why is anyone reporting to Munk?

351
00:37:04,046 --> 00:37:06,646
At least we know Tavra didn't do this one.

352
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:51,102
Hey!

353
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:57,935
Ingrid?

354
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:13,845
I'm sorry.

355
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:28,061
INGRID... INGRID...

356
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:29,584
INGRIIIIIIID!

357
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:30,737
INGRIIIIIIID!

358
00:38:33,405 --> 00:38:35,154
Did you see that guy in the bar?

359
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,348
Hmm.

360
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,406
I think he was watching us.

361
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,709
Err, it's just probably routine.

362
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:45,028
I bet you anything they watch
all the unemployed governors and

363
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:47,290
bankrupt trawlermen that pass through.

364
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,229
You were always good at that.

365
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,839
- What?
- Making me laugh.

366
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:59,270
Yeah. Just not anything else.

367
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,030
What will you do when you sell the boat?

368
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:17,507
Freya's sick. She's real sick.

369
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,270
There's no cure.

370
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,429
What?

371
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:30,746
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

372
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:35,660
You just get weaker and then
one day you just can't breathe.

373
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:38,262
Oh, no, Michael...

374
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:43,322
Everybody dies, Hildur.

375
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:46,414
You... you know, you just
hope it's not too soon.

376
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:53,842
You know, you hope it doesn't hurt
too much. Nobody gets out alive.

377
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:01,058
Tough on Rune and Ingrid though.

378
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:06,414
Yeah. Tough on them.

379
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,115
Okay, your shit is worse than mine.

380
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:26,367
Yes. That's something.

381
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:00,638
Go round the back!

382
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:03,967
INGRID! INGRID!

383
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,614
Rune!

384
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:29,916
Tavrani's tongue was cut out.

385
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:33,138
What? The head's gone. It's been taken.

386
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:34,879
How did they get in?

387
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:36,738
How did they get out?

388
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:38,779
I'll call the ambulance.

389
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:40,440
He spoke to Tavra.

390
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:47,078
I've heard the voice before. I think.

391
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:49,799
Where?

392
00:42:18,774 --> 00:42:20,279
These are carrots.

393
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:36,485
Blood.

394
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,998
This is where she was killed, isn't it?

395
00:42:46,894 --> 00:42:47,915
Who was?

396
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:13,249
Vince. Vince, Vince...

397
00:43:13,284 --> 00:43:14,371
What are you looking for?

398
00:43:14,406 --> 00:43:19,942
Turn the light on. Please put the light on.

399
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:20,957
It's okay. I'm here.

400
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:22,609
You're here, there's nothing else...

401
00:43:22,677 --> 00:43:24,237
Please put the light on.

402
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:33,660
What?

403
00:43:34,118 --> 00:43:35,624
Fucking torch is dead.

404
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:37,813
I put new batteries in this morning.

405
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:38,973
Vince.

406
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:48,551
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry I... I woke you.

407
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:50,500
I'm s...

408
00:43:57,982 --> 00:44:02,907
I'm okay. I'm... I'm fine.

409
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,306
Just... go back to sleep.

410
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:08,846
Natalie.

411
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:13,311
It's okay.

412
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,210
Come here. Come here. It's okay.

413
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,598
It's just a nightmare. I'll be fine.

414
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,814
Everything's gonna be okay.

415
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:40,072
Yeah.

416
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:46,835
- _
- There's clear evidence of complex

417
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,791
- tissue regeneration.
- WERE YOU ALONE?

418
00:44:48,857 --> 00:44:50,555
I can't go on like this.

419
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,980
Still nothing... in either eye?

420
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:55,492
Still, you come here, into
this shitty little office.

421
00:44:55,828 --> 00:44:57,827
Enough!

422
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,959
We're dealing with a fucking psychopath.

423
