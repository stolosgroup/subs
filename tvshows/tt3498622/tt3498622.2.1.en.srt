you are guaranteed a quiet life.

The safest place on earth.

4
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:23,717
In Fortitude, you have to be able
to provide for yourself. Everyone

5
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:26,007
has got a job, so there is no crime.

6
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:28,228
Everybody is always happy.

7
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:32,540
While you are here, you will
need your own rifle and a hat.

8
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,763
Something groovy with ear flaps.

9
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:39,811
I am required to ask you if
you feel safe in Fortitude?

10
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:41,135
Hmm mmm.

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,414
Are you seeing anybody?

12
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:45,174
(LAUGHS) Is that an official question?

13
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:47,496
Where did you get this?

14
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:48,662
I found a carcass.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,346
There is an entire carcass?

16
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:51,576
What is it worth?

17
00:00:51,654 --> 00:00:52,868
It is priceless.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,045
Hello?! Hello?!

19
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:01,582
We have a very serious problem here.

20
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:04,562
Did you see Charlie before he died?

21
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,924
He found something precious.

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,048
Is this what got him killed?

23
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:13,485
I want you to take this to your labratory.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,510
Run tests on it.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,295
DCI Morton can provide
invaluable analytical skills.

26

You know, nothing buried
in permafrost ever decays.

28
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:27,565
This place is a forensic treasure house.

29
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:31,472
It's not that I can't forgive you...

30
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:34,944
It's that you are not my man anymore.

31
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:39,227
In this place, things can
come at you from nowhere.

32
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,980
What kind of things?

33
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:42,625
Monsters.

34
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:48,743
It's happened again, Doctor
Allardyce has been attacked.

35
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:50,614
And Shirley is missing.

36
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,140
I think there is something
very bad going on in this place.

37
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,345
This bear attacked and
devoured another adult male...

38
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,521
We don't see that happen, it is psychotic.

39
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:01,873
What are you proposing?

40
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:05,814
The tests I carried out, I want to
do the same with Shirley Allardyce.

41
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,605
If we find what we are looking for,

42
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:10,398
then that means it is
not safe to live here.

43
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,758
We cannot let fear take hold.

44
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,919
I would never hurt you.

45
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:17,264
I would kill anybody that hurt you.

46
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,610
Are we looking at a virus here?

47
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,362
No.

48
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:22,152
What is causing this?

49
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:25,138
Prehistoric frozen wasp thaws.

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,254
Wasp injects eggs into human blood stream.

51
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,603
The host is compelled to find a victim.

52
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,442
Don't open the door. We
can't let these things out.

53
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,987
We will have to kill them all.

54
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,498
Everyone in Fortitude could be infected.

55
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:48,959
