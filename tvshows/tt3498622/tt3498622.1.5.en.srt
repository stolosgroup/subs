00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,477
I'm not allowed to say.

169
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:16,214
The lab is not forensically
accredited is it?

170
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:18,015
No. Any results we give you

171
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,751
wouldn't be admissible as evidence.

172
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,018
I understand.

173
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,321
We just need to know if
there is a blood match.

174
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:26,557
Five? Six hours tops.

175
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,958
We'll have a result for you in five.

176
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:29,193
Okay.

177
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:36,634
(Shirley) Red wine or white wine?

178
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,469
(Markus) That is the conundrum.

179
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:41,105
(Shirley) Exactly. Is it meat or fish?

180
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:45,343
(Markus) I decided that rosé
would be a suitable compromise.

181
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,979
(Shirley) My mum's going to have kittens.

182
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:53,583
She resolutely refuses to
embrace any non-British grub.

183
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:56,787
She does the whole expat
marmite and baked beans thing.

184
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,556
Well I think if you can
swallow marmite then you can

185
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:01,792
manage minke whale.

186
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,794
Just don't tell her its whale, Markus.

187
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,062
See if she likes it and then say.

188
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,497
Okay.

189
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:09,866
Want some stew, mum?

190
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,568
(Doc Allerdyce) Mmmm?

191
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:13,737
Thank you.

192
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,740
Oh, hello Markus.

193
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:18,907
(Markus) Doc...

194
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:22,077
Markus brought a starter.

195
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,548
So. Margaret.

196
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:30,285
I hear you were brought in
to check up on Frank Sutter.

197
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,588
I'm not surprised they've arrested him.

198
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:34,423
He's a violent man.

199
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:38,661
I don't talk about my patients.
Shirley is the one for gossip.

200
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,929
You're wrong about that.
Shirley doesn't gossip.

201
00:15:41,997 --> 00:15:45,066
She tells everyone what
is happening in town. She

202
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:48,670
doesn't exaggerate or embellish
and everybody trusts her.

203
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,172
I noticed this and I understood something.

204
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,907
Something quite exceptional.

205
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:57,111
In this town your daughter is
the one person everybody loves.

206
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,622
How's your whale, mum?

207
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,934
♪

208
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:32,582
(Vincent) Taq polymerase.

209
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:37,219
(Natalie) This is going
into the PCR for four hours.

210
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,754
Can you prep the eyebrow follicle?

211
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,756
We'll run it alongside. Yep.

212
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:45,026
(Petra) These do not look
right, these reindeer fetuses.

213
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:46,394
What is wrong with them?

214
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:50,198
Hermaphroditism. Male and
female sex organs developing

215
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:53,602
simultaneously. They're
all spontaneous aborts.

216
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:55,370
What is causing this?

217
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:58,673
Well that is what we are
working to find that out.

218
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:09,550
(Morton) Are you in any pain, Frank?

219
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:19,025
Did you know Professor Charles Stoddart?

220
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,295
- No.
- You never met him?

221
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:24,565
Never. Didn't know him, never
met him. Didn't kill him.

222
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,569
Can you tell me how your
t-shirt got covered in blood?

223
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,904
My little boy was sick.

224
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,374
Doctor Allerdyce diagnosed mumps.

225
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,443
Liam had been sick in bed for two days.

226
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,246
Friday night I was at
home with him all evening.

227
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:40,314
Hm-mm.

228
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:41,948
I went into his bedroom to check on him.

229
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:44,084
He'd got out of bed and
was lying on the floor.

230
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,320
I picked him up and I noticed
that the swelling round his

231
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:48,789
throat had gone down and
he was covered in blood.

232
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,291
The swelling had ruptured.

233
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:54,560
I carried him into the bathroom.
He was dopey, half-awake.

234
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,963
I put him in the shower,
checked him all over.

235
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:02,201
He started talking for the
first time since he'd been ill.

236
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:04,569
I gave him a wash and put him back to bed.

237
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,940
The t-shirt I was wearing
was covered in blood.

238
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,741
It was ruined so I threw it in the bin.

239
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,544
I didn't think about
it it was just a t-shirt.

240
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:17,883
Jules came home. Liam
was seeming a lot better.

241
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,287
She made macaroni cheese
for the three of us.

242
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:28,694
So the blood that was
all over your t-shirt

243
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:29,929
was your sons blood?

244
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:31,263
Yes.

245
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:32,731
So where did that blood come from?

246
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,500
From lacerations, from cuts, from what?

247
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:37,837
I told you, the swelling had ruptured.

248
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:40,138
The swelling in his throat has ruptured?

249
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,505
Yes. Yes.

250
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:45,276
That is a lot of blood.

251
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:47,946
What is your point?

252
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,747
Well the point is that there
was so much blood and then

253
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:52,683
the bleeding ceased, just out of the blue.

254
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:54,618
Which is unusual.

255
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,957
He was hemorrhaging then is just stopped,

256
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:02,493
then he was fine and then
he ate macaroni and cheese.

257
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:03,962
That is unusual.

258
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,069
Why did you leave the army?

259
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:14,739
I had done five years in Afghanistan.

260
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:17,807
I missed my wife. Missed my son.

261
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,743
So you brought them here.

262
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,444
That's right.

263
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:23,280
But now you and your wife are separated.

264
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:25,849
And that is none of your business.

265
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:27,851
Fair enough.

266
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:34,091
Y'know I look at pictures of
helicopter squadrons in the

267
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:37,928
British army. And I see
all these white, freckled,

268
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:43,333
hooray Harry... Henry
or whatever fella's...

269
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,236
You know, British army officer class.

270
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:49,706
But you know what I don't
see? I don't see black faces.

271
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:52,642
I don't see you. So it
is very impressive that

272
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,213
you achieved he status you did in the army.

273
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:01,817
You have a glowing commendation
from your superior officer.

274
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,753
And then, out of the blue...

275
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:08,590
You have a central retinal vein occlusion.

276
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:11,860
And you go blind while you were flying.

277
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,235
So you didn't choose to leave
the army. You were discharged.

278
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:24,373
(Frank) Yes.

279
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,576
That must have been very frustrating.

280
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,612
All that achievement. All that hard work.

281
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,249
All those years, just gone
in the blink of an eye.

282
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,917
No pun intended.

283
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,019
It has never reoccurred. And doctors say

284
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:39,688
with the medication I take it never will.

285
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,456
(Morton) But it wasn't
on your medical records

286
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:43,858
when you applied for search
and rescue here. Was it?

287
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,527
There is no connection
between me leaving the army

288
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,696
and Stoddart getting killed. None.

289
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:51,766
Well, the DNA test will give
us a result and either it

290
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,502
will be your son's blood and
you'll be released to pursue

291
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,606
a wrongful arrest and
assault charge against sheriff

292
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,276
Andersson. Or it will be Stoddart's blood

293
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,078
and you'll be charged with his murder.

294
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:05,280
DNA doesn't lie. Does it.

295
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,984
You're right. It never does.

296
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:15,782
(Odegard) Hey. (Eric) Hey.

297
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,951
Did the search of the
house give us anything?

298
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,586
No. Nothing.

299
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,622
Right, we need to bring in the wife.

300
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:26,493
She is staying with her son
all the time, he is very sick.

301
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:29,362
What the hell am I going to tell her?

302
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,368
Is Trish okay?

303
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:40,406
No, Hildy. Trish is not
okay. She's in pieces.

304
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:54,319
(Morton) Frank has said that he
found Liam on the floor of his

305
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:56,822
bedroom covered in blood.

306
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,593
And that is why Frank's
t-shirt was covered in blood.

307
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:09,101
- Did you not know that?
- (Jules) No.

308
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,905
Frank didn't tell you that your
son had bled all over himself?

309
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:14,373
No.

310
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:20,279
Why do you think he didn't tell you that?

311
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:28,988
Frank didn't say anything about any blood.

312
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:32,257
We went...

313
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,228
We took Liam to the hospital
when he started to scream.

314
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,063
(Morton) Why was he screaming?

315
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:42,133
Because he had frostbite.

316
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,435
Frostbite?

317
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:45,270
Where did he have frostbite?

318
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:47,806
On his feet.

319
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:51,276
On his feet? How did he
get frostbite on his feet?

320
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:52,877
He must have gone outside.

321
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:54,979
How, where were you
when he had gone outside?

322
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,516
I'd left the house. I left him with Frank.

323
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:01,453
(Morton) What time was this?

324
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,390
7-ish...

325
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:10,328
But Frank was at home with Liam?

326
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:15,199
Uhm...

327
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:20,771
Yes or no?

328
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,418
Frank went out...

329
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:39,523
(Morton) You lied about that night.

330
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:41,959
Friday night.

331
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:47,465
Between seven o-clock and seven thirty.

332
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,332
You went out. Left the house.

You went and you met a woman.

335
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:56,807
Who was the woman that you met.

336
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:06,483
Frank, the woman that you met, who was she?

337
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,556
Elena Ledesma.

338
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:18,662
The woman that I met was Elena Ledesma.

339
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,730
(Morton) Where did you
go and what did you do.

340
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,332
(Jules) Excuse me?

341
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,234
(Frank) We went to an empty
building and we fucked.

There's something outside...

00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,564
Right.

(Ronnie) Hey. It's alright.

354
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,880
It's just a reindeer.
Chewing our guy ropes.

355
00:25:43,947 --> 00:25:45,948
Got a bigger fright than I did.

356
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,989
Carrie, if there's reindeer
around then that means there

357
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:55,323
won't be any bears.

358
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:58,727
Not for Miles and Miles and Miles.

359
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,730
Means we're safe.

360
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,868
Safe and snug and watched
over by the reindeer.

361
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:11,106
Come on. Come on and have a look. Come on.

Come on. Come and have a look.

00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:18,246
There. You see?

364
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:21,617
There is nothing there.

365
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,353
Come on, get inside.

366
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:35,431
(Dan) You must have been
young when you had Liam?

367
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:40,402
(Jules) I was seventeen
and he was so sweet to me.

368
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:44,205
He completely convinced me to
marry him and have the baby.

369
00:26:45,574 --> 00:26:48,676
My mum didn't approve.

370
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,246
So didn't...

371
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:58,954
You said to me that you'd air-lift Liam

372
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:00,989
if he didn't get better.

373
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:03,658
Yes I did.

374
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:09,130
That's the most kind and
considerate thing anybody

375
00:27:09,198 --> 00:27:12,266
said to me since we got off the plane.

376
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:15,902
You're a good man Dan.

377
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:33,620
Excuse me Jules.

378
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:40,995
Thank you for coming Elena.

379
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,299
Governor Odegard and DCI
Morton have some questions

380
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:47,601
they want to ask you.

381
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,403
Ingrid will show you to the interview room.

382
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:53,639
I know where the interview room is.

383
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:17,530
She's so beautiful.

384
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,633
(Morton) What did you do when you went to

385
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,467
Frank's house that night?

386
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,638
I...

387
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,073
I threw a snowball at his window.

388
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,742
Why?

389
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,644
To make him come to the window

390
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,113
so he would see me and follow me.

391
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,650
And where did you want to lead him?

392
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,118
A car repair workshop.

393
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,154
Why did you take him there?

394
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,389
Erm...

395
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,328
That morning I met his wife. Where I work.

396
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,032
And her little boy was ill.

397
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:58,670
So I made a decision that
I wouldn't be with Frank.

398
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,839
So I wanted to talk to him
and tell him that we were not

399
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,008
going to be together again.

400
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,079
So you told him that.

401
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,717
Well, I wanted to tell him that.

402
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,886
But it didn't work out.

403
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,721
In what way?

404
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,794
(Morton) He told us that you had sex.

405
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,598
He's telling you the truth.

406
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:32,069
Okay. But you said you went to
see him to break up with him.

407
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,871
But instead we had sex.

408
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:37,173
You changed your mind.

409
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,335
Is your relationship with
Dan Anderssen also sexual?

410
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,839
(Elena) No.

411
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,576
No. I have no relationship with him. No.

412
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,714
(Morton) That's good.

413
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:15,296
When sheriff Anderssen
arrested Frank Sutter,

414
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:16,963
he arrested him in your hotel room?

415
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:18,231
(Elena) Yes.

416
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,702
He was in the shower.
And you got between them?

417
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:25,406
(Elena) Yes.

418
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,875
(Morton) Why do you think they
that violent confrontation,

419
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:31,812
why do you think the
sheriff was so violent?

420
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:35,382
I don't know.

421
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,386
I don't know what is in the sheriff's mind.

422
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:43,890
(Morton) Are you afraid to talk about this?

423
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:44,925
(Elena) No.

424
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,827
(Morton) Are you frightened to talk to me?

425
00:30:46,894 --> 00:30:49,863
- No.
- Good, that's good.

426
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:56,602
Excuse me.

427
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,684
She says she doesn't have a relationship

428
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:13,118
with sheriff Andersson.

429
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:14,620
(Eric) So she doesn't.

430
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,024
Is there some other connection?

431
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,634
Could you get me her file please?

432
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:31,536
What file?

433
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,639
The file that you have on her.

434
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:39,144
It's in Dan's desk.

435
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:41,613
Well could you get it.

436
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:51,757
Fuck you.

437
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:09,441
(Morton) Eight years ago. Ricardo Scelsi.

438
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:13,779
Stabbed through the right
eye. Cause of death, scissors.

439
00:32:13,846 --> 00:32:16,214
Into the brain.

440
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:19,518
Stabbed directly through
the orbit of his right eye.

441
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:21,319
Yes.

442
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:25,056
Your fingerprints were on the scissors.

443
00:32:25,124 --> 00:32:27,726
As were the finger prints of your lover.

444
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:29,127
Yes.

445
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:32,464
But nobody knows which one
of you killed Ricardo Scelsi.

446
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:34,699
- Nobody.
- You do.

447
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,100
Nobody knows.

448
00:32:39,939 --> 00:32:42,240
Esmerelda is a beautiful name.

449
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:45,243
I'm Elena now.

450
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,279
You can change your name.

451
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:50,315
You can change where you live.

452
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:53,617
Go some place where no-one
knows you, no-one recognizes you.

453
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,920
But you can't change what you did.

454
00:32:55,988 --> 00:32:58,656
I wouldn't change it if I could.

455
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:04,862
(Markus) Shirley.

456
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:09,434
There can't be any closer bond
between two people than this.

457
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:13,904
You are very beautiful.

00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:16,140
You are.

459
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:19,743
I would never say such a thing casually.

460
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:22,513
You are beautiful.

461
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:26,650
And what I want us to do this together.

462
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:28,952
This adventure.

463
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:34,358
You changing, becoming
ever more beautiful...

464
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:38,528
This is not a fanciful, whimsical thing.

465
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:41,031
It is a deep and powerful desire.

466
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:44,934
It will bring us together completely.

467
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:48,771
Now you have a start on most women.

468
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:54,444
In my heart I see you as a special beauty.

469
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,414
Truly.

470
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:12,662
Okay.

471

<i>(Overhears chatting)</i>

472
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:54,671
You are beautiful.

473
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,272
- No more.
- Just one more.

474
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:59,207
- I'm sleepy.
- One more.

475
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:01,276
Markus, please I've had enough.

476
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,617
Okay. One more.

477
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,354
(Odegard) She killed a man.

478
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:25,591
Spent seven years in prison for his murder.

479
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,493
(Dan) Read the thing. Joint enterprise.

480
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,961
She and her lover. Killed a man.

481
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:31,797
Who tried to kill her.

482
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:34,499
She was harassed and abused
and threatened by this man.

483
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,301
And you kept this from me.

484
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:39,170
She has a new identity.

485
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,306
She has a new life here.

486
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,208
It is proper procedure.
In order to maintain...

487
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,042
Dan. Dan. Please...

488
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,013
You treated this woman's
history as your personal secret.

489
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,215
To protect her.

490
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,184
To protect her! She's a convicted murderer

491
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,589
and you keep this fact
secret from me... from me!

492
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,825
In order to protect her!

493
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,505
Are you in a relationship with her?

494
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,673
No.

495
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,413
Don't lie to me, Dan.

496
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,716
I'm not lying to you, Hildur.

497
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:30,121
I don't have any sort of
relationship with Elena.

498
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,457
None at all.

499
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,263
You know, when I was in
prison, I met this man,

500
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,901
a man who tried to help me. A psychiatrist.

501
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,940
He said to me that everyone
is made up of many...

502
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:54,110
Atomos? Aatoms? You understand?

503
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,813
- Atoms.
- Atoms. Atoms, yes.

504
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:01,785
So for a human being it takes
seven years before every atom,

505
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,254
one by one, is replaced with a new one.

506
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:10,059
So that means that after
seven years this person...

507
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,795
Is no longer that.

508
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:18,001
So you are saying that Elena
is a completely different

509
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:21,271
person than Esmerelda.
That's what you mean.

510
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,341
Everything is changed.

511
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:30,780
That is how you console
yourself. That you've changed.

512
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:32,515
That you are different. You
are not that person anymore.

513
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:34,249
Somebody else did it. You didn't do it.

514
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,353
I am not her. Not anymore.

515
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:43,158
(Morton) But you did you do it
again. You found another stooge.

516
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:44,794
Frank Sutter.

517
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:48,831
And you and Frank Sutter
killed Professor Stoddart?

518
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:51,299
No. No. I did none of this.

519
00:37:56,138 --> 00:37:57,839
Billy Pettigrew.

520
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:08,616
When I asked you the other day
if he had stayed in the hotel.

521
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:11,853
The day I met you, you blushed
like you are doing right now.

522
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,988
Billy Pettigrew.

523
00:38:14,056 --> 00:38:15,857
He was eaten by a polar bear.

524
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:17,959
You knew him though.

525
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:19,961
(Eric) Why is he asking her this?

526
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:22,964
(Elena) I served him coffee
like I served you coffee.

527
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:25,333
(Morton) Eugene Morton.

528
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:30,605
See, if I say my name you don't blush.

529
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:37,144
Why the fuck is he asking
her about Billy Pettigrew now?

530
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:40,348
Because...

531
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:43,918
Pettigrew is the reason he's here.

532
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,125
(Petra) It matches?

533
00:38:51,193 --> 00:38:54,228
(Odegard) The blood on the t-shirt
is Charlie Stoddart's blood.

534
00:38:54,296 --> 00:38:55,596
(Natalie) That's beyond doubt.

535
00:38:55,663 --> 00:38:57,131
(Odegard) Beyond doubt?

536
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,868
(Natalie) The DNA is the
same. That's Charlie's blood.

537
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:02,302
Right.

538
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,238
How it got there or who killed
him is absolutely separate.

539
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:06,639
(Vincent) All we can tell
you is the simple fact.

540
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:08,641
Nothing we've found can
offer any kind of explanation.

541
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:09,943
Thanks.

542
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:15,882
It's him.

543
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:18,651
(Eric) Frank killed him.

544
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,287
(Ingrid) Why would he do that?

545
00:39:20,354 --> 00:39:22,422
(Odegard) It must be to do with Elena.

546
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,757
She's lying to protect him.
They are one another's alibi.

547
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:27,426
No. There's no motive. There is no reason.

548
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,295
(Morton) We are still
trying to find a motive.

549
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:32,664
(Odegard) She says she was with
Frank at the time of the murder.

550
00:39:32,732 --> 00:39:35,600
Now we know it is Charlie
Stoddart's blood. Yes?

551
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:39,671
That proves he murdered
Charlie, therefore she's lying.

552
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:41,240
No, she is not lying.

553
00:39:41,308 --> 00:39:44,843
No? If that's not the case
what is the case, sheriff?

554
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:46,745
Do you know something that
we don't? Is there some

555
00:39:46,813 --> 00:39:49,114
kind of explanation here
that only you can see?

556
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:50,182
You know her criminal record.

557
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,217
No, she didn't do this!

558
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,322
(Morton) You're besotted.

559
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:01,693
They think you and Elena murdered Stoddart!

560
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:04,228
They think you are infatuated with Elena.

561
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:06,431
Enough to kill a man over her.

562
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:08,767
Are you Frank?

563
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:11,970
My son. Covered in blood!

564
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,207
I thought he was going to die.

565
00:40:16,275 --> 00:40:19,444
That's what I thought
so I panicked badly...

566
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:23,949
But I didn't do it...
I didn't kill Stoddart.

567
00:40:24,817 --> 00:40:26,651
I know you didn't.

568
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,252
♪

569
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,139
(Vincent) The Professor told me this word.

570
00:40:49,207 --> 00:40:51,407
An Icelandic word for elation.

571
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:53,075
(Natalie) Glethi.

572
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:54,811
(Vincent) Glethi. That's it.

573
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,180
It's sort of what I am
feeling now. You and me.

574
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,483
We could have helped catch
the person who did this.

575
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:01,751
Yeah.

576
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:06,122
I want to get drunk or something.

577
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:08,625
Yes. You should do that.

578
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:11,961
I haven't got any drink at mine.

579
00:41:13,363 --> 00:41:15,532
Well, I have.

580
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,067
Come to mine.

581
00:41:19,135 --> 00:41:20,669
(Vincent) Okay.

582
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:24,606
(Jules) What are you looking for?

583
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:27,843
I believe Frank. I believe Frank and Elena.

584
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:31,179
I need to prove he didn't
do this terrible thing.

585
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:34,683
What was Liam wearing? When you left him.

586
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,718
Just pyjamas.

587
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,153
And do you know where they are?

588
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,421
No. I couldn't find them.

589
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:41,623
- Think, Jules.
- I don't know.

590
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:43,659
Under the bed?

591
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:45,126
I would have found them there.

592
00:41:46,662 --> 00:41:48,663
Dan, talk to me, what is going on...

593
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,944
In the little boy's bedroom.

594
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:05,680
Covered in blood.

595
00:42:05,747 --> 00:42:08,283
Caked in dried blood.

596
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,851
Frank was telling the truth.

597
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,090
The frostbite.

598
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,625
Something terrible happened to him.

599
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,161
The little boy was there when
Charlie Stoddart was murdered.

600
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:24,231
He was right there.

601
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:29,436
(Frank) Dan?

602
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:32,573
The window was open.

603
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:35,643
Liam's bedroom window.

604
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:37,712
(Dan) Someone took him.
