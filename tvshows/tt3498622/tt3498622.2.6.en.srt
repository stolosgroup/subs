The Sami, they chained
him up and left him to die.

But he didn't die.

And he beat the wasp.

169

But when they took the chains off of him,

170
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,762
he killed sixteen people.

171
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:33,430
And they had to take him down with
four bullets, it took to take him down.

172
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,821
The doctors started opening him up.

173

the Gods send down a plague to
remind everyone of their power.

a sort of demon rises up.

be defeated by a powerful magic,

needs certain body parts.

Yesterday, I flew down to Oslo,
to see his former secretary.

368
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,196
She's also his mistress.

369
00:28:12,282 --> 00:28:16,030
She told me he has a second
property, something he could

370
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:18,290
never afford on a government salary.

371
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:21,834
He keeps a sports car there in a garage.

372
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:24,373
Everything in a different
name, some relative of his.

I, I have a... A photo of
Munk in the car at the house.

The local police will easily find it.

In the meantime, we need a

And by then, the voices were inside me.
