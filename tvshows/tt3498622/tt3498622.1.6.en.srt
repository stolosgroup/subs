1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,468
Never met him.
Didn't kill him.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,237
Can you tell me how your T-shirt
got covered in blood?

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,739
- My little boy was sick.

4
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:08,173
Something terrible
happened to him.

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,508
The frostbite.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,610
In the little boy's bedroom...

7
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,545
covered in blood.

8
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,547
I found it in Stoddart's study,

9
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,217
but the scan has
Pettigrew's name on it.

10
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,519
When I asked you if he had
stayed at that hotel,

11
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,954
you blushed like you're
doing right now.

12
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,655
You knew him, though.

13
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,524
Pettigrew's the reason he's here.

14
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,761
The little boy was there when
Charlie Stoddart was murdered.

15
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,396
He was right there.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,074
The best IPTV in the UK
WWW.ALLIN1BOX.CO.UK

17
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,594
Miss.

18
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,762
B-be careful.

19
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,465
Frostbite could cause

20
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,534
serious damage to your ears.

21
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,002
Frostbite really could.

22
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,772
Take hold of this.

23
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,608
I'll...

24
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,909
you have this. Put it on.

25
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,611
I only live up there.

26
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,813
Eh? And you can put it through
the letterbox in...

27
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,481
No, I'm okay.

28
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,550
- Lao.

29
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,452
Come on, Lao.

30
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,923
Come on.

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,693
Eat.

32
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:53,999
Hey, hey, hey. Eat.

33
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,537
Oh, Doctor, I...

34
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,938
- years ago,

35
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,440
my mother used to say to me...

36
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,608
- Quiet.
- She'd say,

37
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,909
"In this world, Elwood,

38
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,712
you must be... " she always
called me Elwood.

39
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,614
"In this world, Elwood,

40
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,083
you must be, oh, so smart..."

41
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,087
Well, for years, I was smart.

42
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,456
I recommend pleasant.

43
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,590
Quiet.

44
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,025
And you may quote me.

45
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,532
Lao, stay there.

46
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,079
- What's your name?

47
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,850
You sit there.

48
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,154
There you go.
Is that better?

49
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,057
What's all this?

50
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,193
Have you not been well?

51
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,462
Oh, you're absolutely freezing.

52
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,199
Will you tell me your name?

53
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,103
What were you doing
out there in the cold?

54
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,175
Oh. Oh, your feet.

55
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:12,878
Dear me.

56
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,981
Your feet are stone-cold.

57
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,741

71
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,943
Mr. Sutter?

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,881
Hi. Mr...?

73
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,416
- Huseklepp.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,484
Yeah, we have met.

75
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,886
Parents evening.
You were there

76
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,155
in spirit, if not in person.

77
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,656
I'm Liam's teacher, eh.

78
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,091
I know who you are.

79
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,459
Mm-hmm.

80
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,561
He's a very bright boy.

81
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,563
Yeah.

82
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,431
Yeah. Very talkative,

83
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,566
friendly, helpful.

84
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah.

85
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,505
Takes after his mother, I guess.

86
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,441
- Probably.
- Uh-huh.

87
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,176
I need to get on home.

88
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,878
I hear he has the mumps.

89
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,380
That's right, yeah.

90
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,616
I need to...

91
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,737
Hey.

92
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,813
Okay, you're bleeding.

93
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,415
Where are you bleeding from?

94
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,052
Liam, tell me what happened.

95
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,522
Liam, are you hurt?

96
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,495
Liam, what has happened to you?

97
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,129
Liam, are you hurt?

98
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,698
Son, tell me what happened.

99
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,436
Are you hurt?

100
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,473
Don't understand.

101
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,612
Where is the bleeding?

102
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,981
Okay. Okay.

103
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,084
Okay.

104
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,756
Find anything...
I can't...

105
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,425
I don't understand.

106
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,905
I threw up.

107
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,473
Oh, it's okay, son.

108
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,948
Where's mom?

109
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,818
She's...

110
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,488
She'll be home in a minute.

111
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,434
Door open, Dad.

112
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,505
Yeah.

113
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:17,215
Petra, can you hold this for me...

114
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,987
right up there like that,
just like that?

115
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:25,890
Okay, so the potato peeler's
used first,

116
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,492
and that's hese superficial
wounds here.

117
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,761
That's why there's not a
great amount of blood.

118
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,465
And the stabbing arc
is quite short.

119
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,067
Then he picks up a knife,

120
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,503
and he slashes closer,

121
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,505
downward, like this.

122
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,841
And finally the cleaver,

123
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,976
and that's what causes
the blood to spray.

124
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,478
Right.

125
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,546
Which is consistent with the assailant

126
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,215
sitting astride the man

127
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,351
and hacking downwards and...

128
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,856
What?

129
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,124
I don't know.

130
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,259
I can see something
strange, I think.

131
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,363
There's something inside him,

132
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,898
something tiny.

133
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,204
What do you see?

134
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,806
A foreign object,

135
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,841
a fragment stuck
to the lower left rib,

136
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,943
the underside of the rib.

137
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,879
Can't see it.

138
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,716
Would you pull it out, please?

139
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,729
At first, I thought it was
a bone fragment, but...

140
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,235
It's a fingernail.

141
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,674
From a child?

142
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,978
Hyperbaric oxygen treatment

143
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,181
can help damaged cells recover.

144
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,883
Any tissue in Liam's feet
that can be saved

145
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,386
will be as long as he is in there.

146
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,388
And what happens
if we wake him up?

147
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,857
Just long enough
to speak to him.

148
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,992
When he becomes fully conscious,

149
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,229
the pain will be unbearable.

150
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,098
Well, then that's not an option.

151
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,366
We could leave the child alone

152
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,102
and learn nothing,

153
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,938
or we can wake him up,
and we get some answers.

154
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,341
I think we have to wake him up.

155
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,879
Yes.

156
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,915
But not before I talk to the mother.

157
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,485
No. No.

158
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,820
No, you listen to me.

159
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,455
Someone must have
put that there.

160
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,923
That is not him.

161
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,925
I'm sorry, Jules.

162
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,926
No!

163
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,464
- Don't touch me!
- Come on.

164
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,999
You get off me!

165
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,768
Somebody's done this to him!

166
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,072
Jules, look at me.

167
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,912
Liam's going to be okay.

168
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,815
I won't let any harm come to your son.

169
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:04,937
You promised me that before.

170
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,887
We have to wake him.

171
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,055
No. Fuck you!

172
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,524
Leave him alone!

173
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:15,026
Fuck you! Leave him alone!

174
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,995
You leave him alone, Dan!

175
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,920
Hey, sweetie.

176
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,288
It's mommy.

177
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,824
Mommy's here.

178
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,661
Are you awake?

179
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,031
Liam...?

180
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,500
Rapid low-voltage EEG.

181
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,469
He's beginning to wake now.

182
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,772
Going to up his painkiller
by five mil.

183
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,409
Liam, can you hear me?

184
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:08,914
Mom?

185
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,815
Hey.

186
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,116
It's okay, sweetheart.

187
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,818
You're safe,

188
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,119
and the doctor's
looking after you.

189
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,821
I want you to talk to somebody.

190
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,922
Okay?

191
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:25,029
Answer the questions.

192
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,234
W eso qio lonsk

193
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,802
Liam... I think he's drifting.

194
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,770
Give it a moment.

195
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,405
- Be quick, please.
- I will.

196
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:39,010
Liam, were you
with someone that night?

197
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:44,817
No.

198
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:45,818
No?

199
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,820
How did you get across town?

200
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,221
Walk.

201
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,223
Alone?

202
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,357
Please.

203
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,725
Okay.

204
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,462
Yes.

205
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,963
Liam, can you remember

206
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,231
what happened in the kitchen?

207
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,169
Onions.

208
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,874
And do you remember...

209
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:10,975
Doggy.

210
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,710
Doggy.

211
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,784
Feet hurt.

212
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,653
Thwack!

213
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,925
All wet.

214
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,960
- Thwack!
- Stop this.

215
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,828
My feet, Mom.

216
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,997
My feet!

217
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,165
My feet are burning!

218
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,068
- You have to stop this now.
- Hands!

219
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,937
- Wait. Wait.
- Thwack!

220
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,172
Liam, Liam, what happened?

221
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,741
My hands.

222
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,877
Hands.

223
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,946
I put my hands inside the man.

224
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,389
Let me out! Let me out!

225
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,325
- Margaret.
- Enough.

226
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,060
- Let me out!
- All right,

227
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,295
- put him back to sleep.
- Let me out! Let me out!

228
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,430
- What's happening?
- Do something.

229
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,231
My feet! I'm burning!

230
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,701
What's happening?!

231
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:10,735
Let me out! Help!

232
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:14,339
Please! Get him out of there!

233
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,474
Let me out! My feet burning!

234
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,710
They're burning!

235
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,179
Let me out!

236
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,748
Let me out!
Let me out!

237
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,049
Let me out.

238
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,657
He's stable.

239
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,958
It's all right, sweetheart.

240
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,929
I'm here.

241
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,165
I'm here.

242
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,569
I'm here.

243
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,873
How can she ever...

244
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,742
cope with this?

245
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,244
She can't.

246
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,247
Charlie must have...

247
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,151
He must have brought him in
from the cold,

248
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,352
and then...

249
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,224
Poor Charlie.

250
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:42,995
Dad.

251
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,630
What?

252
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,498
I'm very tired.

253
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,667
I know, pet.

254
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,909
Hey, come here. Give me a hand.

255
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,606
I can't get me big, fat fingers
in here. Look.

256
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,611
Look, you see these?
See these two wires?

257
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:01,913
- Uh-huh.
- The black and the red one.

258
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,214
Yeah.

259
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,049
I want you to touch 'em
together for me.

260
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,084
Why?

261
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,219
Because it'll make
the engine start.

262
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,754
- Come on.
- Can't you do it?

263
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,122
No, I can't, pet.

264
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,591
Because you've hurt your hand.

265
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,294
- No, I haven't.
- You have. I know you have.

266
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,929
Carrie, will you do as I tell you?

267
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,664
Touch the two wires together, please.

268
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,566
- No. No.
- Carrie!

269
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,635
You'll do as you're fucking told!

270
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,237
Now do as you'r fucking told,

271
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,839
touch the wires together,

272
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,541
and we'll get out of here!
Please!

273
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,910
No, Dad! No,
I don't want to anymore.

274
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,414
I want to go home.

275
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,550
I want to go back to school.

276
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,620
I want to see Liam.

277
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,623
I'm only 10, Dad.

278
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,593
I'm only 10.
I want my mom.

279
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,027
My baby, come here.

280
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,497
Hey, you're my baby.

281
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,866
I'm sorry.

282
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,935
Hey, I'm so sorry.

283
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,575
Oh, Carrie, I'm so sorry.

284
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,612
Everything I've done,
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

285
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,680
You're my baby.

286
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,016
I love you.

287
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,152
I'm so sorry.
I'm so...

288
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,490
I'm so... I'm sorry.

289
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,072
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,609
I'm sorr...

291
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,917
Please.

292
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,494
Come here.

293
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,664
Come here.

294
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,752
Your leg still hurts?

295
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,954
Yeah, a little bit.

296
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,691
Listen, Trish...

297
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,094
we have the murderer for sure.

298
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,496
Sutter.

299
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,099
The search and rescue guy.

300
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,701
No, not him.

301
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,736
His son.

302
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,571
His son?

303
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,006
Yes, his little boy.
He did it.

304
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,576
A little boy?

305
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,112
Yes, he's 10 years old.
He did it.

306
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,914
A 10-year-old child?

307
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,916
Yes.

308
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,617
A child killed Charlie?

309
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,718
Yes, Trish.

310
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,853
That's what you're
telling me now?

311
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,266
How do a mom and dad cope
with a thing like that?

312
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,333
I don't know.

313
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,968
I mean, how does
a little boy have...

314
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,103
sorry, Markus.

315
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,706
How does he even
have the strength?

316
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,709
Well, from experience,
I'll tell you

317
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,712
children can be
surprisingly strong.

318
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,148
A 10-year-old boy
having a tantrum...

319
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,716
Tantrum?

320
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,953
Well, struggling, you know.

321
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:32,923
Hello, Henry.

322
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,458
Morning, Shirley.

323
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,726
Madness has its own strength.

324
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,629
There's an offer on the Blue Swan
vodka this week.

325
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,964
- Ah, I don't want it.
- Sorry.

326
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,166
So this child,

327
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,734
10 years old.

328
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,236
It's a boy I know well.

329
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,771
What about him?

330
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:49,040
Oh, it transpires is the killer.

331
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,143
I don't know.

332
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,611
You run out of words, eh,

333
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,112
out of thoughts.

334
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,814
- What child?
- I know.

335
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,716
Beyond human understanding,

336
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:01,118
but that is what happened.

337
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,721
Liam Sutter, 10 years old,

338
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:06,490
hacked a grown man to death.

339
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:11,662
I try to teach them that life
is a precious thing,

340
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,863
a gift.

341
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,801
No, hey, hey, hey, hey!

342
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,769
Hey, what are you saying
about Liam Sutter?!

343
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,706
What's he saying?

344
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,595
Frank.

345
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,936
I understand that you were...

346
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,058
telling me the truth about where
the blood came from.

347
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,643
We found corroborating evidence.

348
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,651
Liam lost a fingernail,

349
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:11,122
and it was inside Stoddart's body.

350
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:17,027
Liam told us what he did.

351
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,230
He told us all in front of his mother.

352
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,598
Stop it.

353
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,633
I am more sorry
than I know how to say.

354
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,834
Dan, stop it.
Stop talking.

355
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,971
You know. You know
this is all shit.

356
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,111
Open this.

357
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:03,774
Julia, I heard about your son.

358
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,276
I'm so sorry.

359
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,578
Is there anything
I can do to help?

360
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Eh?

361
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,980
Here. Take this.

362
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,150
Can I help you?

363
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,288
- A drink.
- What?

364
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,023
Have you got a drink?

365
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,125
A drink? Oh.

366
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,498
Here.

367
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,482
I've lost him.

368
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,035
Jules.

369
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:40,771
Jules.

370
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,027
Questions of motive don't even 
enter into it, do they?

371
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,496
No. No.

372
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:08,599
This is a profound psychosis.

373
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,900
I mean, he takes
the chopping block,

374
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,869
and he smashes it down
on Stoddart's head.

375
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:15,406
And then hacking
a-and stabbing and...

376
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,908
relentless.

377
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,911
I mean, inhuman savagery.

378
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,647
From a 10-year-old kid.

379
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:24,949
Where does that come from?

380
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,517
I mean, where?

381
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,852
This is not something we're qualified
to answer, Gene.

382
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,155
No, I guess not.

383
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,357
Okay.

384
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,627
Pettigrew.

385
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:37,294
Yeah, Pettigrew.

386
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:41,131
Th tk GPan Pettigrew.

So?

392
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,343
I was just thinking
get some candles,

393
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,545
close the curtains,

394
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,380
have yourself a little séance,

395
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:58,549
and ask Pettigrew
what the fuck it was

396
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:00,150
he found before they killed him.

397
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,485
Good-bye.

398
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,585
Sheriff.

399
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:38,489
Elena.

400
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,227
You attacked Frank.

401
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,765
- No. No, I was trying to protect...
- Just shut up. Shut up.

402
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,800
You attacked him.

403
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:52,302
I'm brought in, questioned.

404
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,538
I'm asked about Pettigrew.

405
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,774
Stop. Stop. Just stop.

406
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,111
I just came to say
one thing to you.

407
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:04,048
Stay the fuck away from me.

408
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,385
You get it?

409
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,288
You're bad.

410
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,023
You're bad, Sheriff.

411
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:29,506
Feed a fever.
Starve a cold.

412
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:33,477
Hmm? When I was a boy,

413
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:37,347
my mother used to make this 
soup for me, Shirley.

414
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,150
Cream of chicken broth

415
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,832
with little herb dumplings.

416
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,291
I used to enjoy being ill

417
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,126
just for the soup.

418
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,096
Mmm.

419
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,867
Mmm.

420
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,469
Utterly delicious.

421
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,170
Sit up, honey.

422
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,143
Sit up, please.

423
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,180
Shirley.

424
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,617
No, thank you.

425
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,652
Markus, I can't.

426
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:25,129
Well, we're going
to have to do something...

427
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:28,098
before you fade away
to nothing at all.

428
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,883
- - Yep?

429
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:48,085
Is this room 2.5?

430
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,720
Uh-huh.

431
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,555
Max, hey.

432
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,627
You lost this.

433
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:58,929
I-it's not mine.

434
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,464
Look, before you go down

435
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,001
this sort of hopeless road
of self-incrimination,

436
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,069
I should tell you that Pettigrew

437
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,005
made the scan
that was in this folder.

438
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,474
Now the scan is gone,
and Pettigrew is dead,

439
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,442
and I think
you know who took it.

440
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,313
And I would suggest you tell me,

441
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,635
or you're probably
gonna wind up dead, too.

442
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,665
Yuri Lubimov.

443
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,827
Who is he, and what does he do?

444
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,836
He's the head of security

445
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,438
at the Russian
mining town, Vukobejina.

446
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,875
He left to go back there today.

447
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,711
And are you frightened
of Mr. Lubimov?

448
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,450
Yes, I am.

449
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,952
I'll take care of him.

450
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,522
Thank you, Max.

451
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,432
You see, Tavrani,

452
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:09,766
I think all this tourist tat

453
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,636
is a smoke screen
for what you really are.

454
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:15,772
And what is it that I really
am in your eyes, my friend?

455
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,608
You're a powerful man

456
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,710
with powerful connections,

457
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,713
the old world
of darkness and grudge.

458
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,348
Say it.

459
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,719
I think you're a shaman.

460
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:31,989
Henry, I'm...

461
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,057
I'm just a stuffer
of dead beasts,

462
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,393
a peddler of tat,
a cigar-store Indian.

463
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,666
I can't fix your cancer,
Henry. I'm sorry.

464
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:45,035
It's not my cancer
that needs fixing.

465
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,236
It's not?

466
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,007
It's Liam Sutter.

467
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,375
The little boy?

468
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:55,512
I believe he needs very 
powerful protection, Tavi.

469
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,447
Something terrible has happened.

470
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:01,451
His young mother in a state of shock
and disintegration.

471
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,887
Something is attacking them.

472
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,756
I fucking know it.

473
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,091
And I want you to build them

474
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,127
one of those things
to protect them.

475
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,628
What things?

476
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,497
Oh, it's like a golem, a...

477
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,399
you told me all about it once.

478
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,401
You mean a tupilaq?

479
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,869
That's it, tupilaq.

480
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,305
If I was a shaman,

481
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:23,874
I would tell you that there is
no such thing anymore.

482
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,309
If I was a shaman,

483
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:28,312
I would tell you that to 
complete the tupilaq,

484
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,813
according to all
the old rituals,

485
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,848
the creature
must be finally baptized

486
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,350
in the blood of a murderer.

487
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,851
Do you follow me?

488
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,553
Otherwise, it will
have no power.

489
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,588
Now...

490
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,357
where would a shaman
lay his hands

491
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,559
on half a pint
of murderer's blood, hmm?

492
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,383
May I join you?

493
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:18,328
This is a 20-year-old Mossbank
single-malt whiskey

494
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,065
distilled on the banks of...

495
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:25,902
"Dumfries and Galloway
since 1788."

496
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,841
And they have it here
in Fortitude.

497
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,412
Incredible.

498
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,623
Sláinte.

499
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,833
I have ordered the lutefisk.

500
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,769
Good choice.

501
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,037
Well, I thought I'm leaving

502
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,072
in a couple days' time.

503
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:06,376
Might as well find out the truth
about the lutefisk.

504
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,863
Have you ever shot a man?

505
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:27,865
Not with that.

506
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:34,137
- The lutefisk.
- Thank you.

507
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,276
Okay.

508
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,744
The truth about the lutefisk...

509
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,878
Mm-hmm?

510
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:45,782
Is you should never
eat the lutefisk.

511
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,488
Ohh.

512
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,173
Liam.

513
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,743
Baby...

514
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,078
can you hear me?

515
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:21,351
Can you hear me, Liam?

516
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,353
Baby?

517
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,599
You don't know me.
My name's Elena.

518
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,302
Um...

519
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,942
it was my fault,

520
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,044
what happened...

521
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:53,250
not your dad's fault.
It was my fault.

522
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:02,159
I'm so sorry, Liam.

523
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,664
I'm so sorry.

524
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,973
It was Christmas Day

525
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:20,143
when we landed in Scotland,

526
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,412
Prestwick.

527
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,915
And there were
six of us, all FBI,

528
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,850
and they had a little coach

529
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,118
to take us to this town,

530
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,220
and when we got
to the town, Lockerbie,

531
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:33,190
a lot of the houses
were still burning.

532
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:36,193
And we were each appointed
a local constable.

533
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,695
The fellow who was appointed to me,
his name was Stephen.

534
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,665
And we were given
radios and maps and...

535
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,803
a huge sack filled with
polythene body bags.

536
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,040
So Stephen and I,

537
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,710
we set out across this moor.

538
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:57,314
Every piece of any body
we found...

539
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:02,052
we picked up,
I photographed it...

540
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,322
and he bagged it.

541
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:08,091
And we did that all day,

542
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:11,928
all night until our torches
ran out,

543
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,763
and then we just sat there
in the dark,

544
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:19,269
surrounded by 18 full body bags.

545
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,674
But there was not a whole person

546
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,109
in any one of them.

547
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,849
And Stephen said,

548
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:36,753
"Why could they not have just
stayed up there?

549
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,955
Why did they
have to come down?"

550
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:44,366
He said, "Why could they not have 
just stayed up there...

551
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:50,100
flying around the lovely 
world forever?"

552
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,670
Shit.

553
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,598
Fuck you, Ronnie.

554
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,766
War stories.

555
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:35,772
You show me your scars.

556
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,207
I show you mine.

557
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,746
This is about Pettigrew,
isn't it?

558
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,717
I know what you're doing.

559
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,720
Psychology.

560
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,824
You're using psychology.

561
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,206
Billy Pettigrew
wasn't eaten by a bear.

562
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,809
He was murdered.

563
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:16,780
Now Professor Charlie Stoddart has
been murdered as well.

564
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,449
The Governor is responsible.

565
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,284
Her Sheriff killed them both.

566
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,953
Someone called in,

567
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,022
said they'd seen a man
walking out of town

568
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,124
on his own along the coastline

569
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,725
without a rifle.

570
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,129
Bear season.

571
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,200
Time of year when the sea ice
is mostly gone

572
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:13,203
and the bears
aren't able to find seals.

573
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:14,938
They're crazy with hunger.

574
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,244
I drove slowly out of town
along the coast road

575
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:22,645
looking for the missing man.

576
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,017
After 10 miles, I turned back,

577
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,620
because nobody could have got 
that far in this temperature.

578
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,124
On the way back...

579
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,395
I saw a huge bear
down on the foreshore

580
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:42,832
dragging its kill across the rocks
and the ice floes.

581
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,736
I knew at once
what this was going to be.

582
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:51,407
I pulled over,

583
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,809
took my rifle...

584
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,012
ran down onto the foreshore.

585
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,856
The bear...

586
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,859
was leaning over its kill,

587
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,696
and... and in a split-second,
I took aim.

588
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,401
I could see that
what it was tearing apart

589
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:21,037
wasn't a seal.

590
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,672
It was a man.

591
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,612
The bear was disemboweling 
and eating Billy Pettigrew.

592
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,118
And Pettigrew was screaming...

593
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,855
inhuman screams.

594
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,628
I shot Pettigrew
through the head.

595
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,786
No witness.

596
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,323
No motive.

597
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,060
No crime.

598
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,767
A mercy killing.

599
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:31,709
Okay.

600
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:39,916
Except...

601
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,867
I don't believe
a fucking word of it.

602
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:34,797
Hey. Hey!

603
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:35,898
Come here!

604
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,103
Sorry.
The door was open.

605
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:42,371
When was this carpet changed?

606
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:45,843
What?

607
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,877
When was the carpet replaced?

608
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,748
Why do you change a carpet?

609
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,318
Because there's an immovable stain
on it, right?

610
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,353
Like red wine or something.

611
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:03,092
But why do you change the 
floorboards underneath?

612
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,260
I don't know.

613
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,661
I do.

614
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,765
If the stain is blood...

615
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,834
Pettigrew's blood.

616
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:17,708
Hello, little bird.

617
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,709
- My throat hurts.
- Hello.

618
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:21,244
Let me know where
you're calling from.

619
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:22,246
I don't know.

620
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:23,247
- What the fuck?
- Carrie?

621
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:24,313
What the fuck?

622
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,848
You'd tell me, wouldn't you,

623
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,183
if people were saying things

624
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:28,384
that made me look ridiculous?

625
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,319
Oh, they're all in it.

626
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,388
They're all covering for Eric.

627
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,390
Sheriff Anderssen, too?

628
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:34,924
I'm just an idea in your head.

629
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:36,325
No.
