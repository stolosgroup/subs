00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,533
Can you give us an account

2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:02,801
of your whereabouts throughout Friday

3
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:04,136
and into Friday evening?

4
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,372
I was with my brother Ciaran in his shop.

5
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,974
Move it. Move it. Come on. Move it. Go.

6
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,944
Hildur's Glacier Hotel, she can't go ahead

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,278
without government say-so.

8
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,447
Charlie said in his message

9
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,449
that he'd found something
that changed everything.

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,917
Message deleted.

11
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,319
What have you done?

12
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,720
Where did you go?

13
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,122
Are you seeing anybody?

14
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,656
Is that an official question?

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,594
I shut my eyes,

30
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,496
but I just see his dead body.

31
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,499
Normally I need seven hours,
and then I can function.

32
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,101
Any less, and I'm...

33
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,104
cranky and easily distracted.

34
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,673
How many did you get last night?

35
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,775
None. And you?

36
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,777
I didn't go to bed at all.

37
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,613
Ingrid, it's Petra.

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,981
Where are you?

39
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,149
Hey, Petra. I'm coming now.

40
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,400
You can keep that key.

41
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,801
I'll get another one.

42
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,473
Mm-hmm. Great.

43
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,841
- Bye.
- Bye.

44
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,096
Good morning. Fresh coffee?

45
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,598
Thanks.

46
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,719
Dan.

47
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,621
Unknown person is discharging a firearm

48
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,122
on Tavirani's premises.

49
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,791
Shouts and screams from inside.

50
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,093
No police in attendance yet.

51
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,528
No information on casualties.

52
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,029
You're closest, Dan.

53
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,765
God damn.

54
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,175
Henry?

55
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,010
The fuck you doing?

56
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,212
Why, Sheriff. Now we're safe.

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,749
Put the rifle down now, Henry.

58
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,052
Okay, Henry.

59
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,787
Look what he's done to my puffins.

60
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,222
I shot the fucker.

61
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,990
I shot the fucking puffin.

62
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,396
Solved the exile problem, Dan.

63
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,032
Just shoot myself.

64
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,202
Tavirani here will stuff me,

65
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,737
stand me in arrivals,

66
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,840
a warning,

67
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,843
"Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

68
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,011
Abandon hope."

69
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,446
Let go of the gun.

70
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,220
Do it.

71
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,657
Put me out of my misery.

72
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,259
Don't tempt me.

73
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,094
Come on.

74
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,865
Come on.

75
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,366
It's okay.

76
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,843
Here.

77
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,314
How 'bout I just heave all this junk

78
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,151
out into a skip and torch the lot?

79
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,719
Yeah.

80
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,955
Get rid of all the evidence of my life,

81
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,457
burn the lot.

82
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,895
You can strike the match down

83
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,963
on behalf of the Governor,

84
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,799
do the dirty work.

85
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,133
That's what you do, isn't it,

86
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,568
the bitch's dirty work?

87
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,975
What is that?

88
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,950
Now get the fuck out.

89
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,820
You have a killer to catch.

90
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,321
Don't let me keep you, Sheriff.

91
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,656
Get out, will you?

92
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,157
Sit down, Henry.

93
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,659
Out.

94
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,160
Sit down.

95
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,836
Listen to me, Henry.

96
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,270
No more guns.

97
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,408
Stop behaving like a mad old bastard.

98
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,877
I promise I will find
whoever killed Charlie.

99
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,546
Keep your head down.

100
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,849
No more public displays of rage.

101
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,352
You said you didn't trust
me 'cause I'm a drunk.

102
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,323
I did.

103
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,760
Now maybe all this...

104
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,596
this is all my fault,
my fault you're drinking.

105
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,097
Eh, no.

106
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,567
No, I'm a drunk for reasons all of my own.

107
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,739
I shot a man in the head.

108
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,141
I killed a man.

109
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,676
No, Henry.

110
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,945
That was my doing,

111
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,947
my fault, my responsibility.

112
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,583
So tell me how.

113
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,586
I can't.

114
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,991
GPR stands for...?

115
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,026
Ground penetrating radar.

116
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,961
Okay, well, this is progress, isn't it?

117
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,930
Yes, I guess.

118
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,799
I mean, I found it in Stoddart's study.

119
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,334
He was looking at the images himself,

120
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,337
but the scan has Pettigrew's name on it.

121
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,039
And it's creased and folded,

122
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,874
as though it's been
passed around quite a bit.

123
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,644
Well, I mean, where does the map lead us?

124
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,745
What did Pettigrew find?

125
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,980
I don't know, Bernard.

126
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,884
"Max 2.5"

127
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,420
Somebody wrote that in here. See that?

128
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,256
We could be looking at an
oil field the size of Belgium

129
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,259
or the size of that bed
over there. I don't know.

130
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,628
Okay, Gene, I'll have
Tech Resources examine it.

131
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,163
Okay.

132
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,001
Jason said he was with
his brother last night,

133
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,237
but we can't find Ciaran to check that out.

134
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,939
Eric tried here last night?

135
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,307
Yes. Nothing.

136
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,374
Jason doesn't have an alibi

137
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,476
unless we get hold of Ciaran,

138
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,111
but Ciaran's nowhere.

139
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,319
Call his mobile.

140
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,624
It's ringing.

141
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,259
Keep trying.

142
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,374
His phone's inside.

143
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,210
Ciaran!

144
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,182
Ciaran?

145
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,223
Damn it!

146
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:27,859
Ciaran?

147
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,327
Get the lights.

148
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,870
Call an ambulance.

149
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,538
- It's Petra.
- Ah, fuck.

150
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,973
- Medic and ambulance needed straightaway.
- Ah, Jesus.

151
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,974
Ciaran Donnelly's camping shop.

152
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,909
It was Ron... Ron...

153
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,277
it was Ronnie,

154
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,446
Ronnie Morgan.

155
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,181
He came in here last night.

156
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,988
Ronnie wanted a boat.

157
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,325
He didn't have any money,
so I told him where to go.

158
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,862
Wouldn't take no for an answer.

159
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,398
So I picked up

160
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,401
a big fucking bowie knife off the display.

161
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,369
He grabbed the blade, Dan.

162
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,139
He grabbed the blade,

163
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,341
twisted the knife right out of my hand.

164
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,445
Then he just laid into me.

165
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,049
He's taken a boat, he could be anywhere.

166
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,484
Ronnie's out of control.

167
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,653
It was as if he was possessed.

168
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,412
Liam?

169
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,780
Liam?

170
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,882
All right, sweetheart, I'm here.

171
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,584
Liam?

172
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,352
Help!

173
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,054
Help!

174
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,323
I mean, I don't know what's happening.

175
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,591
- Doctor is on her way.
- Liam!

176
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,960
Liam, it's all right, sweetheart. I'm here.

177
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:32,016
Liam! Do something!

178
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,785
Check round the back.

179
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,188
Carrie's rabbit's gone.

180
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,257
Why would she take her rabbit?

181
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,260
Companionship.

182
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,863
Or maybe to make a casserole.

183
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,265
Whoever killed the professor
must have been very strong,

184
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,467
very physically violent.

185
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,181
Prescription pills

186
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,683
in Ronnie's name, unopened.

187
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,085
What are they?

188
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,821
800 mils Thimotomaline.

189
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,389
You know the name?

190
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,991
These are antipsychotics.

191
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,594
He's left home without his med pills.

192
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,667
We've had no trouble with
Ronnie since he arrived here?

193
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,068
No, none at all,

194
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,404
but if he's off his medication...

195
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,206
And we've no way of knowing

196
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,607
the severity of his condition.

197
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,276
They don't prescribe antipsychotics

198
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,744
unless it's absolutely necessary.

199
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,314
Ciaran said that he grabbed
the knife by the blade.

200
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,249
House to house.

201
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,252
Anybody seen them in the
last 24 hours, we follow up.

202
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,421
I'll get my gear.

203
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,757
Frank and I will take
a launch up the coast,

204
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,392
- track the stolen boat.
- No.

205
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,495
I'll go with Frank.

206
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,399
Dan, I'd rather help Frank chase a murderer

207
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,234
than drag my sore leg around town all day.

208
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,503
Get busy.

209
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,415
I've got the coordinates

210
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,251
of Ronnie's boat from his GPS.

211
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,587
He's about seven miles up the coast.

212
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,589
I could easily follow his route

213
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,090
since he left Fortitude harbor.

214
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,595
This, this is odd.

215
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,967
He sailed 30 miles northwest.

216
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,869
Then he sailed all the way back.

217
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,274
And no sign of Carrie at home or at school.

218
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,775
Ronnie must have her with him.

219
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,143
Longer she's alone with him,

220
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,746
the more she's at risk. Gotta go right now.

221
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,221
Liam had a fit this morning.

222
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,023
- He couldn't breathe.
- A fit? What kind of...

223
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,459
You have to see him. You
have to go and see him.

224
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,294
- Jules, what kind of fit?
- It's not right, Frank,

225
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,363
what's happening to him,
and they won't listen to me.

226
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,664
He's asleep now.

227
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,165
Just go and see him, Frank.

228
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,301
Sorry, Jules. I need Frank.

229
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,237
Yeah, well, his son needs him more.

230
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,840
Go and see him, Frank.

231
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,951
What's going on with you two?

232
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,452
Oh, I've moved out of the house.

233
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,988
Into the hotel?

234
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,723
I'm not talking about this just now.

235
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,593
While your son is sick?

236
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,428
There's nothing I can
do about that, is there?

237
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,730
Just concentrate on your job, Frank.

238
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,599
I need you to do that.

239
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,800
The GPR scan that we
gave to the professor...

240
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,034
Yes?

241
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,402
Morton has the scan.

242
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,805
He found it in the professor's house,

243
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:14,906
and he took it.

244
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,209
Who's Morton?

245
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,244
The British policeman.

246
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,413
He has the scan.

247
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,549
Do you understand?

248
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,750
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,518
I don't care if you are sorry, Max.

250
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,920
I don't...

251
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,031
This little girl here is missing.

252
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,202
Either of you seen her
in the last 36 hours?

253
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,603
Missing?

254
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,740
No?

255
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,241
Me neither.

256
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,176
Sorry, Officer. I'd love to help.

257
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,850
Mind telling me your name, sir?

258
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,818
Sorry, Officer. My friend's Russian.

259
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,320
He doesn't speak English.

260
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,123
So you speak Russian?

261
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,290
I'm afraid not.

262
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,960
Then how can he be your friend

263
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,461
when you can't speak to each other?

264
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,831
He's not really my friend.

265
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,369
just gave me Out.

266
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,139
He gave you a lift here.

267
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,541
Here you are. Out you get.

268
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,088
Do I know you?

269
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,268
Russki!

270
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,369
Russki!

271
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,006
Dickless asshole.

272
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,859
This bear was in a fight.

273
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,729
Eh, who are you?

274
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,199
You know who I am, Henry.

275
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,936
You spoke to my colleague D.I. Littlejohn

276
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,005
at the Pettigrew inquest.

277
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,842
You remember?

278
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,646
I'm the inevitable consequence.

279
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,719
Did you take this one, too?

280
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,356
Oh, I took them all with my little camera.

281
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,360
How close do you have to be
to take something like that?

282
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,363
Little camera, very long lens.

283
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,404
They're very big, polar bears.

284
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,441
Well, largest carnivore

285
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,277
on the surface of God's earth, they are.

286
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,947
So Pettigrew...

287
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,282
What about him?

288
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,717
wandered out of town...

289
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,519
Apparently so, yeah.

290
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,953
eaten by a bear.

291
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,055
Terrible bad luck, well.

292
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,058
You think he would have
been fully cognizant

293
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,393
of the risks.

294
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:26,564
Apparently he liked to drink.

295
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,067
Do you have any idea what
he was looking for up here

296
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,569
or what he might have found, even?

297
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,005
None whatsoever.

298
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,708
You were good friends
with Professor Stoddart?

299
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,911
Well, yes. He... good friends.

300
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,280
Do you think their deaths
are connected in any way?

301
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,447
No, I don't.

302
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,448
You don't?

303
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,716
No.

304
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,289
You know when they say
your call may be recorded?

305
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,324
What they mean is

306
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,260
your call is being recorded.

307
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,564
Billy Pettigrew wasn't eaten by a bear.

308
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,099
He was murdered.

309
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,102
Now Professor Charlie Stoddart
has been murdered as well.

310
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,438
The Governor is responsible.

311
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,341
Her Sheriff killed them both.

312
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,549
I can fly you to London,

313
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,051
and I can guarantee your protection.

314
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,856
Huh.

315
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,191
No point in that.

316
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,660
Why not?

317
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,629
That's not my voice.

318
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,252
Dan, can you pass me the GPS?

319
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,322
Dan.

320
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,928
Dan!

321
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,397
So you'd rather stay here

322
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,232
than stay with Eric and me just now?

323
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,906
Well, the service is definitely better.

324
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,742
I need to go home.

325
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,478
Okay.

326
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,351
The next flight's on Thursday.

327
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,119
I've booked a seat.

328
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,957
I need to be alone.

329
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,060
Okay. I understand.

330
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,796
My theory is that somebody a long time ago

331
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,800
in Fortitude came across a bag of gravel,

332
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,136
and they mistook it for
a sack of coffee beans.

333
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,573
The gravel habit stuck.

334
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,841
Would anyone like one?

335
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,509
Not for me.

336
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,877
I've got things to do.

337
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,179
Excuse me.

338
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,383
You're good friends, huh?

339
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,219
Yes, since she married Charlie.

340
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,721
How is she doing?

341
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,289
Well, not good.

342
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,091
Hardly surprising.

343
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,728
She move out of your house?

344
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,729
Yes.

345
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,031
Hardly surprising.

346
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,301
Really?

347
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,702
Yeah.

348
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,804
She thinks you killed her husband.

349
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,479
What?

350
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,849
She has a theory that Charlie
was going to deny you permission

351
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,852
for your Glacier Hotel

352
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,854
and that you had him killed.

353
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,657
He didn't deny us permission.

354
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,228
No, I know, but he was
going to change his report,

355
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,164
and he left a message
saying that on her phone,

356
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,334
a message which she believes you deleted.

357
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,973
This is really what she thinks?

358
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,809
Yes.

359
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,345
And what do you think?

360
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,647
Well, I asked myself

361
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,383
what scenario is more likely,

362
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,386
a conspiracy involving
a Governor and a Sheriff

363
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,090
and a very lucrative Glacier Hotel or...

364
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,959
some poor bastard off his meds

365
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,662
has a psychotic episode
in a stranger's house.

366
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,368
And...?

367
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,104
And...

368
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,240
50-50.

369
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,324
Carrie never said anything
at all about her dad

370
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,328
or how things were at home recently?

371
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,663
I wish I could tell you something, but no.

372
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,036
She seemed happy while she was around here?

373
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,173
Yeah, always.

374
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,514
So one minute, you're in Afghanistan.

375
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,848
The next, you're in the Arctic.

376
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,350
Must be tough,

377
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,151
bit of a culture shock.

378
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,887
I wasn't in Afghanistan.

379
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,388
Oh.

380
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,056
I was in family quarters

381
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,059
at RAF Odiham in the U.K.

382
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,828
while Frank was in Afghanistan.

383
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,062
For long?

384
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,365
Four years, maybe five.

385
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,499
You hardly saw him.

386
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,002
No.

387
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,305
That's tough.

388
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,541
Me and the Governor

389
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,576
haven't been apart since we were married.

390
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,044
- You're married to the Governor?
- Yeah.

391
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,515
She won't let me leave.

392
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,984
She can't do anything

393
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,486
without running it past me.

394
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,388
Utterly dependant.

395
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,189
I'm the real power behind the throne.

396
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,525
Hildy is simply my stooge, you know.

397
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,562
Never tell her this.

398
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,531
Truth might kill her.

399
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,846
Ronnie Morgan,

400
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,649
this is Sheriff Anderssen,

401
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,150
Fortitude Police.

402
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,652
Ronnie, can you hear me?

403
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,657
I need you to show yourself, Ronnie.

404
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,663
Okay, Ronnie, we're going
to have to come aboard.

405
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,533
You were teaching her to swim.

406
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,834
- Who?
- Carrie Morgan.

407
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:51,969
She's gone missing.

408
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,271
With her dad.

409
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,839
- Ronnie?
- Yeah.

410
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,274
You know, she is best friends

411
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,542
with the little boy Liam?

412
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,877
- Yeah.
- Mm.

413
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,312
I think Frank Sutter is the
man they should be looking at.

414
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,848
He is violent and unstable.

415
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,950
His son is in the hospital.

416
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,619
Now Carrie is missing from her home.

417
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,622
- Here.
- Thank you.

418
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,893
Sutter was in Afghanistan, you know?

419
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,795
Terrible things happen there.

420
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,897
Terrible things happen everywhere.

421
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,732
Yeah, of course they do, but...

422
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,600
Terrible things happen here.

423
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,178
- Mmm.
- Yeah?

424
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,679
How is that burger?

425
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,680
Delicious.

426
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,292
Is Dan back?

427
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,060
- No.
- Shit.

428
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,429
You smell of very strong perfume.

429
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,301
I found this in Frank Sutter's house.

430
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,103
Frank Sutter's?

431
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,804
- Blood? Whose blood is it?
- Oh, my God.

432
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,306
We have to tell Dan.

433
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,875
Test the blood. See if
it's animal or human.

434
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,376
I'll try to get a hold of Dan.

435
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,163
Ronnie?

436
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,133
It's Sheriff Anderssen.

437
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,124
Fuck!

438
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,194
Dan?

439
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,897
Dan, you all right?

440
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,898
Dan?!

441
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,569
Hah. Scared the fucking life out of me.

442
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,389
Come on.

443
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,890
How are you gonna get the money

444
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,392
for the tickets to Norway

445
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,561
if you can't get in the house?

446
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,729
Gonna bring them something we can sell.

447
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,798
What?

448
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,700
It's a surprise. Come on.

449
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,926
Good boy.

450
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,399
Dogs'll look out for you.

451
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,535
Fierce dogs, huskies,

452
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,538
but only when it comes to bears.

453
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,173
A husky will never, ever attack a man.

454
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,546
Ah, it's a wood burner.

455
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,214
You'll be fine here.

456
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,386
Why can't I come with you?

457
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,724
No, they'll be looking for
a man and a little girl.

458
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,630
I'm scared, Dad.

459
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,668
Make us some dinner.

460
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,303
It'll warm me up when I get back.

461
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,341
I'll be back soon,

462
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,443
and I'm gonna bring
you something marvelous.

463
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,526
Natalie, they let me go.

464
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,028
No charges.

465
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,596
No connection to the
professor's death whatsoever.

466
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,032
I was with my brother in
his shop when it happened,

467
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,466
right up until me and you left.

468
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,901
Your brother was attacked by Ronnie Morgan.

469
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:18,902
That's right.

470
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,904
So they think it's him?

471
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:21,905
Yep.

472
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,144
What are you doing with that?

473
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,781
Yeah, I've been asked to analyze this

474
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,483
by the Governor and DCI Morton.

475
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,552
Oh. Right.

476
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,456
And...?

477
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,059
It's a mammoth's tooth.

478
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,727
Is that right?

479
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,162
Well, radiocarbon dating

480
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,631
puts it at 32,000 years old.

481
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,068
So where'd you get it?

482
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,303
You mean is there more than just a tooth?

483
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,572
Is there?

484
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,642
What would it be worth to
you if there was, Natalie?

485
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,278
So where's the rest of it?

486
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,446
Who are you?

487
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,214
Vincent Rattrey,
post-doctorate research...

488
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,583
Badger boy.

489
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,051
This is badger boy?

490
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,686
You know, animal remains like this

491
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,121
are required by law to be surrendered

492
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,589
into the care of the research institute

493
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,091
for study and archiving.

494
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,525
Only if they're from here.

495
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,261
Obviously, but, I mean, if
this was genuinely from here,

496
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,930
it would be an astonishing discovery,

497
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,965
and you'd be required to
surrender the remains to us.

498
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,100
Surrender them?

499
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,601
That's right.

500
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,103
I don't think I'd be inclined

501
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,005
to surrender anything to you, Badgers.

502
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,307
You wouldn't have a choice.

503
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,579
It would be some discovery, wouldn't it...

504
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,048
a mammoth on this island.

505
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,350
First one ever.

506
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,192
That thing's been in a drawer

507
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,495
since we cleared out my
uncle's house 20 years ago.

508
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,997
He was in the Merchant Navy,

509
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,066
sailed the world and picked up

510
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,734
shit like that all over the place.

511
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,236
Right.

512
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,904
You see, people believe what they want

513
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,640
when they think there's
profit and glory in it.

514
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,249
They told me you took Charlie's report.

515
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,019
Yes. It was commissioned by the government,

516
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,221
and it recommends that we
proceed with the development,

517
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,057
so I have to send it to the government

518
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,125
Environmental and Development Agency.

519
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,293
You shouldn't have taken it.

520
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,596
Trish, it's my job.

521
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,865
All right? It's my responsibility.

522
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,934
Charlie was going to rewrite it.

523
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,469
How would I know that?

524
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,739
You listened to his message.

525
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,276
Then you deleted it.

526
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,811
God, I'm sorry.

527
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,280
Trish, have you spoken to Dr. Allerdyce?

528
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,582
See if she can give you something

529
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,850
just to calm you down,

530
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,685
to help you sleep,

531
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,720
'cause I know you haven't been sleeping.

532
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,556
DCI Morton knows all about you.

533
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,428
Yes. He said you think I killed Charlie

534
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,664
in order to get my hotel built.

535
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,135
Trish, I would throw all this,

536
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,803
the hotel, the glacier,

537
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,739
the whole fucking town into the sea...

538
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,043
if it would bring Charlie back.

539
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,614
You wiped the message, Hildy.

540
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,284
You think Ronnie's taken her back to town?

541
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,619
How the hell should I know?

542
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,989
I'm not a psychiatrist.

543
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,394
Listen, Dan, have we got a problem?

544
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,030
I don't know, Frank. Do we?

545
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,531
No. Well, I don't,

546
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,433
but I'm getting a lot of hostility here.

547
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,935
Okay, then, Frank.

548
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,205
I'll tell you what my problem is.

549
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,374
You're letting your private
life interfere with your job.

550
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,541
I'm what?

551
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,176
- Your wife in the harbor...
- She never accused...

552
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,012
causing a scene 'cause
you've walked out on her

553
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,046
and you've left your kid.

554
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,047
Ah, fuck you.

555
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,682
No, fuck you, Frank!

556
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,952
There's a little girl missing,

557
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,187
and her father's a possible
danger to them both,

558
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,922
and half the time, you're so caught up

559
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,958
in all the shit you
created in your own life...

560
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:15,992
- That's enough.
- you and Elena,

561
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,127
when you should be concentrating...

562
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,229
- That's enough!
- on your job!

563
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,730
It's my family life,

564
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,365
is none of your business.

565
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,634
Neither is who I fuck.

566
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,537
We're going back.

567
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,039
We need to keep looking.

568
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,241
No. We lose light in an hour.

569
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,842
We go back.

570
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,632
Shh.

571
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,634
Quiet down now.

572
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,175
These are for you.

573
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,314
I'm famished.

574
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,082
You all right?

575
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,155
Oh, I'm so hungry.

576
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,430
Do you know what they are?

577
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,233
They're from the monster.

578
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,602
They're ivory, worth a lot of money.

579
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:18,314
Carrie, I want you to know something.

580
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,150
Come here.

581
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,651
Look at me.

582
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,720
Something bad happened.

583
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,523
Someone got badly hurt.

584
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,691
It was nothing to do with me,

585
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,727
but the police will think it was,

586
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,263
'cause the man that did
it was a friend of mine.

587
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,298
It means that the police
are going to make sure

588
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,900
you and I are separated.

589
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,036
Do you understand?

590
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,037
No.

591
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,181
When mom passed on,

592
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:54,184
I didn't manage things too
well for a little while.

593
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,319
Just not getting you
ready for school in time.

594
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,854
And crying.

595
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,131
They wanted to put you into care.

596
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,201
And I told 'em then...

597
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,803
and this is what I'm telling you now...

598
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,807
I will never, ever let that happen to you.

599
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,146
Right.

600
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,315
That's it.

601
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,760
Eric, what are you doing here?

602
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,663
Found a T-shirt in Frank's bathroom.

603
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,932
It's soaked in blood.

604
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,734
Petra's testing it to see if it's human.

605
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,971
He's been lying to me.

606
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,640
I knew he was lying.

607
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,111
Dan...?

608
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,612
Keep him here.

609
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,934
Where's Petra?

610
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,438
Dan, it's human blood.

611
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,949
- Dan...
- We found human blood

612
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,350
all over Frank Sutter's T-shirt.

613
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,351
What?

614
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,320
It's Frank Sutter!

615
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,390
I couldn't just keep him there, Dan.

616
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,892
He's at the hotel.

617
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,663
Sheriff.

618
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,867
Get out!

619
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,918
No! No!

620
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,891
Get out!

621
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,263
Frank?

622
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,404
Get out!

623
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,439
Get out! Now!

624
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,211
Oh, please.

625
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,713
If that's not the case,
what is the case, Sheriff?

626
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,148
Do you know something that we don't?

627
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,151
Is your relationship with
Dan Anderssen also sexual?

628
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,122
You kept this fact secret from me!

629
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,424
It's bad for Frank, and
it's bad for me, too.

630
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,693
Frank was at home with Liam?

631
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,128
Yes or no?

632
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,063
Well, DNA doesn't lie, does it?

633
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,831
You're right. It never does.

634
