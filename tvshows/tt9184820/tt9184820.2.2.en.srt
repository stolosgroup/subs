1
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:05,363
I'm so zonked.

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:07,234
The red alerts
from that wormhole

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,410
- kept me up half the night.
- Oh, I know.

4
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:11,586
It's, like, are we crossing
the event horizon or not?

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,328
Like, I don't care, actually.
I just want you to pick one.

6
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:16,026
Jet. What are you doing here?

7
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,331
Got reassigned to Beta shift.

8
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,290
Looks like we'll be
showering together.

9
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,856
Cool. Well, welcome to the team.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,554
I'm sort of the
unofficial leader.

11
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:25,513
Feel free to come to
me with any questions.

12
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:26,906
She's joking, right?

13
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,951
Nope.

14
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:37,675
Ooh, actually, usually Boimler
leaves that one open for me.

15
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,658
He has issues with
communal nudity.

16
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:42,139
Well, I'm not him,
and he's not here.

17
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:44,793
Cool. Hope this isn't
too high for you.

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,034
- Ooh! Ha-ha! Fine with me.

19
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:49,798
- I could go higher.

20
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,019
- Uh, that's
a little high, don't you think?

21
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,499
- Not for me!
- This is my favorite!

22
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:59,112
- I think I'm clean!
- Yeah, I'm good!

23
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:02,550
:
I could do this all day!

24
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,770
Never felt more alive!

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,074

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,283
Captain's
log, stardate 58001.2.

27
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,024
Those who spend their
lives and fortunes

28
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,592
gathering scientific rarities
from around the galaxy

29
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:29,768
call themselves "collectors."

30
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:31,987
Now, a prominent
collector has died,

31
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,817
leaving behind a starship full
of hazardous treasures that need

32
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:37,384
to be safely catalogued.

33
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:40,474
The Collector's Guild has
asked the Federation for help,

34
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:42,998
so theCerritos has been
tasked with the job.

35
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:46,088
Chairman Siggi, allow me to
offer my deepest condolences

36
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,090
for the loss of your friend.

37
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,614
Kerner Hauze was no friend.

38
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:52,443
His collection pales
in comparison to mine.

39
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,227
Well,
I'm sure that's true.

40
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,837
How can we help?

41
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:57,665
Well, I'm supposed to
auction off his things,

42
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,667
per Guild rules,
but I don't know

43
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,732
what kind of dangerous items
he might have been hoarding.

44
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:04,498
I need you guys to come in
and safely dispose of anything

45
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,631
that could, you
know, atomize me.

46
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:08,633
Happy to help. We'll
prepare a team.

47
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:11,331
And I'll be overseein' 'em...
I don't want any of your crew

48
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,681
getting sticky appendages.

49
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,466
Ugh, Collector's Guild.

50
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:16,858
Just a bunch of greedy packrats.

51
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:18,991
Wasn't he the one who
tried to collect Data?

52
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,688
They all tried to collect Data.

53
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,342
Why couldn't they
leave Data alone?

54
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,778
He just wanted to feel.

55
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:25,780
This is the last thing
I need right now.

56
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,913
I'm supposed to
find out the results

57
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,523
of my command evaluation today.

58
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,109
Well, sounds like your
basic tag-and-bag.

59
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,309
Want me to head it up?

60
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:34,441
No, I think this
is a fine first job

61
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,661
for our brand-new
head of security.

62
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,536
Lieutenant Kayshon,
welcome to the Cerritos.

63
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,583
Rapunki, when he
joined the seven.

64
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:50,109
Ah, sorry. The universal
translator doesn't always...

65
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:52,111
What I meant was, uh,

66
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:54,722
"It is my honor, Captain."

67
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,246
Jah! This is so cool!

68
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:58,267
Lieutenant Kayshon is the
first Tamarian in Starfleet

69
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,467
and we get to go on
a mission with him!

70
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:03,427
Eh. We're basically clearing out
a dead dude's storage locker.

71
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,038
A mission's only as important
as you make it, Mariner.

72
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,866
Okay,
Commander Protocol.

73
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,911
- You always this fun?
- We're on the clock.

74
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:12,305
I'll have fun
afterwe do the job.

75
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,307
Ugh. You sound
uptighter than Boimler.

76
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,657
Ah, man, Boims would
have loved this mission.

77
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:18,659
He took Ethics of
Collecting at the Academy.

78
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:20,574
Yeah, but the Titan's
such a big deal.

79
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,446
I bet he's living the dream.

80
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,015
Mr. Boimler, attack
pattern Delta.

81
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,669
Target the aft shields.

82
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:31,106
Let's see how these Pakleds
do with their aft hanging out.

83
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,326
Uh, yes, sir.

84
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,335
- Photon torpedoes locked and ready.
- Fire!

85
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,036
Yeah!

86
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,125
Hasta mañana, Pakleds!

87
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,346
- Great job, everyone. That's a wrap.

88
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,655
Lieutenant Kayshon,

89
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,613
we're your away team,
reporting for duty.

90
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,268
It is a pleasure to meet you,
and I look forward to, uh...

91
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:05,140
Oh, geez... Darmok and
Jalad on the ocean...

92
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:06,359
"Working with you"?

93
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:08,230
: Yes! Thank you.

94
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,146
Apologies, my Federation
Standard is still shaky.

95
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,453
It's no problem,
sir. Or should I say,

96
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,629
- it's no "beast at Tanagra."
- : Oh!

97
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,849
More like suck-up at Tanagra.

98
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:24,682
About time, Starfleet.

99
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,815
What'd you do, stop to debate
the human rights of a robot?

100
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,295
I-I do not believe so.

101
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,818
Perhaps we should
review our logs.

102
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,299
Hey, just bustin' your
bioducts. Here's the deal.

103
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,954
I need youse to comb through all
this stuff on the floor here.

104
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:38,130
But the high-ticket
items in these cases?

105
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,088
That stuff stays here.

106
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,786
Uh, okay.

107
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:44,615
All right, if we split up, we
can knock this out in an hour.

108
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,921
Whoa, big fella. This
is just the first room.

109
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:49,359
Most of the collection's
further in the ship.

110
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:50,577
There's more?

111
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,274
Oh, how much can
one guy collect?

112
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,276
Sister, you got no idea.

113
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:57,889
There's a pattern

114
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,673
to the Pakleds' attacks
on these outposts.

115
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,066
They're after Varuvian ore.

116
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:02,850
Uh, s-sorry. What ore?

117
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:05,157
Varuvian. Contains minerals
which become volatile

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,028
at high vibratory frequencies.

119
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:10,728
Those terrorists tried
to use it to blow up Starbase 58.

120
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,817
Oh, uh, yeah, I think
I remember reading that

121
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,948
in one of your logs.

122
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,689
Huh. Titan'sseen
a lot of action.

123
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,232
: Ain't
weaponizing Varuvian ore

124
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:18,997
a bit above the
Pakleds' grade level?

125
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,391
Way above, which is why
Starfleet Command believes

126
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,480
there may be another
player involved.

127
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:25,351
Intel says the
Pakleds' next target

128
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:27,788
is a Varuvian mining
colony on Karzill IV.

129
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:29,792
We'll embed an away team
there disguised as miners

130
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,792
with the goal of planting
a tracking device

131
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,141
on their shuttle.

132
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,274
They'll lead us right
to their puppet master.

133
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:37,276
And that's when we
cut the strings.

134
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,366
- Cutting the strings.
- You don't have to write that down.

135
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,848
I don't have to write that down.

136
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:49,636
Got another
old disintegrator here.

137
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,683
Oh, hey, Cyborg. You're
pretty rare, huh?

138
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,468
Yeah, as far as I know there's
only a few of us in Starfleet.

139
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:56,948
Interesting.

140
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,578
Careful, Ruthy, he's
gonna try to collect you.

141
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,038
- Take my card.

142
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,040
I got a top-notch menagerie.

143
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:07,088
So, Kerner Hauze just lived here
all alone on an automated ship?

144
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:08,916
He must have been so lonely.

145
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,441
Perhaps to him the
silence was, uh...

146
00:07:11,484 --> 00:07:13,704
"Temba, his arms open."

147
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,488
- A gift?
- Yes, gift. Sorry.

148
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,359
Perhaps he preferred
to be alone.

149
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,753
Yeah, I guess more
time to enjoy...

150
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:22,277
"Kahless' fornication helmet."

151
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:24,236
Oh, that's fun. Safety first.

152
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,935
This way,
mortals, or thou shalt be smited.

153
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,329
We got a lot to do. You
might want to focus.

154
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:32,113
And you might want to loosen up.

155
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,594
Oh, yeah, loosen up while
carrying ordnance...

156
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,378
Great idea, Mariner.

157
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:40,295
Whoa! Uh, what's going on?

158
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:42,123
- Ah-ah-ah.

159
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:45,300
If you're seeing this
holo-message, it means I'm dead

160
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:49,479
and you're trying to steal
from my precious collection.

161
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:51,611
Oh-ho, great!
Automated defenses!

162
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,744
- You must've moved something.
- What?!

163
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:56,007
You had us move lots of things!

164
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,443
For your greed,

165
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:00,664
you will now be part
of my collection!

166
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:10,998
- Lieutenant Kayshon!

167
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,415
Help me! It's-it's...

168
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,809
"Zinda, his eyes red!"

169
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,115
He's saying, "It hurts."

170
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:19,247
Yeah, man, I get
it. Context clues.

171
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,470
That beam turned
him into a puppet!

172
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:25,819
He'll be worth a fortune.

173
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:28,126
Could you stop
collecting for one...

174
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,344
Aah, flying orb!

175
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,228
Whoa! Manhaver to
Cerritos, come in.

176
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:47,014
- Comms are blocked.
- We've got to get out of here! Now!

177
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,170
I've got him.
No,

178
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:54,674
- I'vegot him.
Guys!

179
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,112
- Out of my way.
- Hey! - Let's go.

180
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,902
I told you to keep your
hands to yourself, Orion.

181
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,338
- Just great.

182
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:09,297
This is what I get for
involving Starfleet.

183
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,386
Oh, you want to try to get
through the killer ship

184
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,040
on your own? Be my guest.

185
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:16,000
- Oh, man, it's just gallery after gallery.
- We need to get

186
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:18,002
to the engine room and
disable the defenses.

187
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:19,849
For us to make it out of here,
we're gonna have to travel

188
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,528
- into the belly of the beast.
- Quiet. I've got a safer plan.

189
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:25,270
What? No, you don't
cut off my badass plan.

190
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,489
- Not even Boimler would...
- Shh. He's gone.

191
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,013
Get over it. Now listen.

192
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:30,623
There are escape
pods right here.

193
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,321
And fewer galleries to go
through means better odds.

194
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,975
We don't need to be
heroes today, people.

195
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,411
We just need to survive.

196
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:38,196
- I'm with the hunk.
- You don't get a vote.

197
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:40,720
Uh, actually, I think
I like Jet's plan, too.

198
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,809
Tendi. Okay, Rutherford,
what about you?

199
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:44,550
Yeah, it just sounds less risky?

200
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:46,378
It's more like what our
training says to do.

201
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,641
Exactly. If we
follow our training,

202
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:51,644
we get out of here
alive. All of us.

203
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,605
Ooh,

204
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:57,215
I love me an undercover op.

205
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:58,627
You could tell the
captain was bummed

206
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,783
to have to stay on the ship.

207
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,219
: Badass like Riker,

208
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,351
you know he'd rather
have boots on the ground.

209
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,310
He must have been so
bored on the Enterprise.

210
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:08,008
I mean, seven years
of what, exploring?

211
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,620
On a ship with five
day care centers.

212
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:12,883
Are you talking about
the D? The flagship?

213
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:14,246
They went to
different dimensions.

214
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,060
They fought the Borg.
They insurrected.

215
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,670
They had regular
string quartets.

216
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:19,977
- Wow, what a rush.

217
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,848
Play me a concerto.

218
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:24,024
That's dumb.

219
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:28,638
Uh, Captain?

220
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,682
You feeling okay?

221
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,597
Hmm? I'm fine. Why?

222
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:33,904
This is typically about
the time you'd start asking

223
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,993
for a second or even
third status report

224
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,342
from the away team, but, uh,

225
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:39,083
you haven't even
asked for one yet.

226
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:42,173
Commander, are you suggesting
that I micromanage?

227
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,020
- No, no, no. Not at all. I...
- Because that is

228
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,090
what Starfleet Command
said in my evaluation.

229
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,265
Can you believe that?

230
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:50,137
Since when do I micromanage?

231
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:55,403
I am going to have to "show
more trust in my subordinates."

232
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,930
Lieutenant Kayshon
is an accomplished officer.

233
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:02,628
I am sure he's got
a handle on things.

234
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,981
Rutherford, take the puppet.

235
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,592
- Tendi, target the hinge.

236
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:18,359
Inorganic
matter compactor!

237
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,386
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Rutherford!

238
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,955
- Don't let go!

239
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,398
Hey, what the
?! Little help?

240
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:28,001
Not my problem!

241
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:44,452
Huh?
Whoa.

242
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:47,847
Hey! Thanks for
helping out back there.

243
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:49,346
You couldn't lend a
frickin' tentacle?

244
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,330
- Get your lousy hands off me.

245
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:55,115
Kahless's sex
helmet? You took it!

246
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,595
That's what set off the ship!

247
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:59,511
This is all your fault,
you pervert! No judgment.

248
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:00,686
Oh, save it, Orion.

249
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,732
I don't got to answer
to nobody but me.

250
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:06,561
That's how I got on top,
that's how I'm staying on top.

251
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,824
Don't move.

252
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,236
I'm done
listening to youse.

253
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,092
Maybe his helmet saved him?

254
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,661
Guess we have to go up and over.

255
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,887
Uh, remind me again how
this was the safer option?

256
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,063
There's unknowns to any plan.

257
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:32,022
If we'd gone your way,
we'd have had to fight

258
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,501
twice as many collectables

259
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,026
andfree-climb a
radiation coolant pipe.

260
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,636
I'm not afraid of a little risk.

261
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,769
- But what about them?

262
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,161
Maybe you've got a death wish,

263
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,076
but you can't ask them
to follow you there.

264
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,750
Oh, don't act like you're
watching out for them.

265
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:47,385
You're just using them
to prop yourself up.

266
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,387
What are you talking about?

267
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,129
You want everyone to see
you as this big, brave hero

268
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,870
who only cares
about the team, but

269
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:56,065
-Oh, God, get
out of here. Stupid vacuum.

270
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:01,225
Uh-oh. I think you triggered
some kind of network response.

271
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:03,531
Aw, what are they gonna
do, suck us to death?

272
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,795
Ow!

273
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:07,927
They're gonna suck us to death!

274
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,279
There's too many of them!

275
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:21,245
We need a barricade.

276
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:23,421
No, guys, grab a bone.
Just swing on 'em.

277
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,771
- No, help me build.
- Don't listen to him.

278
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:28,426
- Stand down, Mariner.
- Youstand down.

279
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,471
- I told you to stand down. You stand down.
- Uh...

280
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:38,044
We are strong. We
take your mine.

281
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:40,655
It is our mine now.

282
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:46,009
Stay strong, brother. We
miners shall overcome.

283
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:47,401
Dude, you're clearly Starfleet.

284
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:48,814
Your hands are super
soft and clean.

285
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,883
Uh, no, I'm a miner
with a heart of gold.

286
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:52,450
And I have dad issues.

287
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:54,471
Okay, the Pakleds' shuttle is
unattended. Now's our chance.

288
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:56,541
Hold it. We got a
'Led over there.

289
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,891
We have to stun him,
or he could sound

290
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,347
- the alarm.
- But our orders are to avoid...

291
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:01,938
We can't leave
anything up to chance.

292
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,765
Oh.

293
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,947
Sorry, pal, but this
ain't your lucky...

294
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,296
Huh?

295
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,645
It's a pile of snacks.

296
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:17,083
Hey! Those miners are
stealing our snacks.

297
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:18,650
We're blown!

298
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:21,174
Fall back to that tunnel!

299
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:27,833
There, this
should buy us some time.

300
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:29,313
I'll try to come up with a plan.

301
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:31,358
Enough with this whole
textbook leader routine.

302
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:32,751
We're not buying it.

303
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:33,946
I'm just trying to step up here.

304
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,362
You'rethe one with the act.

305
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,495
The whole "dive in
headfirst" thing.

306
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:40,454
You're just desperate to be seen
as some kind of renegade hero.

307
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:43,240
No, I'm not. Diving in
is just how I work best.

308
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,894
And I like to think things out.

309
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:47,505
Sorry if that comes off
all "textbook" to you.

310
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:50,334
What, you think I'm trying
to be like Ransom up in here?

311
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,640
Square jaw, all squinting,
like, "Let's roll"?

312
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,860
Uh, no,
not a good look.

313
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:57,950
I'm just surprised that you'd
ever trash-talk a superior.

314
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,169
Are you kidding me?

315
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:00,692
Don't even get me
started on Stevens.

316
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,868
Do you know he keeps a
log about his mustache?

317
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,829
Gah, this isn't gonna
hold much longer!

318
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,094
If I had thought for one second
before I hit that stupid vacuum,

319
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:12,375
none of this would
have happened.

320
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,314
No, it was my call
to go this way.

321
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:15,968
I led us into this mess.

322
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:19,015
Great. So, then, what, neither
of us should be in charge?

323
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,147
- Oh.
- Ha!

324
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:23,802
- Rutherford, Tendi.
- What do you two think we should do?

325
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:26,631
- We two?
- I-I don't know, this isn't really my...

326
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:30,026
Well, actually, these
are Excalbian bones.

327
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:32,767
With enough friction, they
break down and become acidic.

328
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,571
Which we could use to cut
through the wall paneling

329
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:36,336
and access the
engineering sub-conduits.

330
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,820
And those run the
length of the ship.

331
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:39,557
Honestly,
we could've bypassed

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,230
all this scary stuff by
using them from the start.

333
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,995
What?! Why didn't you
say something before?

334
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,954
Because you guys were in charge.

335
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:46,738
- Uh...
- Uh...

336
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:52,657
There. This will buy us
some time, but not much.

337
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,746
Riker to away team.
- Go ahead.

338
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,942
We've entered the system. What
the hell happened down there?

339
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:59,620
Long story, sir. Requesting
emergency transport.

340
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,274
- Get them out of there.
- I can't, sir.

341
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:02,972
- Why the hell not?
- There's some sort

342
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,538
of distortion field.

343
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:06,366
It must be interfering
with the transporter.

344
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,152
That Varuvian explosion must
have released an ion cloud.

345
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:11,415
Hang in down there.
We'll figure this out.

346
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,634
Get the saw!

347
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:16,333
We need to hit the
door with the saw!

348
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:21,947
I can't say this is how
I pictured going out,

349
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,383
but I'll tell you what,

350
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,298
there's no other blokes
I'd rather be with.

351
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:27,170
This is what we
signed up for, men:

352
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:28,823
To boldly go.

353
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:30,869
Boimler?

354
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:31,957
Uh...

355
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,350
I'm sorry, I gotta be honest.

356
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,439
I didn't join Starfleet
to get in phaser fights.

357
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,223
I signed up to explore,

358
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,269
to be out in space
making new discoveries

359
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:41,097
and peaceful
diplomatic solutions.

360
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,837
That'sboldly going.

361
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,100
And you know what?

362
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:45,623
I'd love to be in
a string quartet.

363
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,209
I love that when Riker
was on the Enterprise,

364
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,800
he was out there
jammin' on the trombone

365
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,324
and catching love disease
and acting in plays

366
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:53,587
and meeting his identical
transporter clone Thomas.

367
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,112
That stuff may not seem as
cool as what you guys do,

368
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:58,070
but it's Starfleet all the way.

369
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:01,291
Ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!

370
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,641
I got into Starfleet
to study moss.

371
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:06,339
I joined up 'cause
I love beaming.

372
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:08,341
Thanks, Boimler.
If we're going out,

373
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:10,343
at least it's remembering
that Starfleet

374
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,737
isn't just about
kicking enemy ass.

375
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,827
Can't believe the
captain has a transporter clone.

376
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,655
Yeah, Thomas Riker...
He was created

377
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:19,874
from a distortion field that
was actually a lot like...

378
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,094
What are you doing?

379
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,617
We might not have to die!

380
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,406
- Ah.

381
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,845
Ha-ha! Yeah!

382
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,849
Okay, the escape pods
should be down this way,

383
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,111
if that's still the plan.

384
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,852
It is if you say it is, buddy.

385
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,159
Stay alert, stay alive.

386
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:45,074
- Damn!
- Damn!

387
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,468
Captain, it's okay
if you want to check in

388
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,340
- on Lieutenant Kayshon.
- No, no, no, no.

389
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,690
: I can be
a hands-off captain.

390
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:53,821
I don't mind.

391
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,780
Captain, two escape
pods just launched

392
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:58,696
- from the collector's ship.
- What?! On screen.

393
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,699
What the hell is going on?

394
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:04,049
The ship tried to
collect us, Captain.

395
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:05,268
Where's Kayshon?

396
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:07,531
Kayshon, when he
became a puppet.

397
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:10,099
This is what being
hands-off gets me?

398
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,884
Well, never again!

399
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:21,545
Initiating drill.

400
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:24,156
Reversing the polarity.

401
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,636
I got signal lock.

402
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,333
Get them out of there!

403
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:36,081
Whoa, no. No, no, no, no.

404
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:43,543
Boimler?

405
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,264
- Boimler!
- Ah. Huh?

406
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:47,440
Oh, God.

407
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:53,838
The distortion
field's reengaging.

408
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:55,622
- I'm losing him.
- That's not an option!

409
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,841
Rerouting main power.

410
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:58,712
Initiating second
containment beam.

411
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,545
Well done, Mr. Boimler.

412
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,286
Thank you, Riker...
I mean, Mr. Captain.

413
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,046
Get him to sickbay, have
the doc check him out.

414
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,985
Riker to bridge. Give me warp

415
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,007
- in the factor of five, six, seven...
Captain,

416
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:15,468
shuttle craft incoming
from the planet, it's

417
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:17,340
- ours.
- What? That's not possible.

418
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:18,906
We all beamed off.

419
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,362
Shuttle
pilot's in distress.

420
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,306
- Requesting transport.
- Could be a Pakled trap.

421
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,476
Energize.

422
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,785
- Mr. Boimler?
- You guys made it!

423
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,830
Oh! The Pakleds got stuck
in the door, so I...

424
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:32,572
Aw, man. A copy of me
got transported out?

425
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:33,834
Boo.

426
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:35,706
I'mthe transporter clone? Boo.

427
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:37,577
The distortion field must've...

428
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:39,927
Oh. I've heard this tune before.

429
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,364
Let's hear it for the Boimlers!

430
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:42,408
- Yeah!

431
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:49,850
Meeting your exact
copy is never easy.

432
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:51,156
Believe me, I know.

433
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,027
Mr. Boimlers, you
showed great bravery

434
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,160
- and ingenuity down there.
Thank you, sir.

435
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:57,249
I just wish I could
keep both of you.

436
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:59,338
Starfleet Command feels our
missions are too complex

437
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:02,428
to have the added complication
of two identical crew members.

438
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:05,431
I'm afraid one of you will
have to return to the Cerritos

439
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:06,998
as an ensign.

440
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:11,045
I should be the one to go.

441
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:13,004
- Huh?
- All right, works for me.

442
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,677
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
I thought we were both

443
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,375
gonna step forward, and
then, like, you'd go,

444
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:18,420
- "Oh, I should be the one to go."
- Nah. I'm good to stay.

445
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:20,707
- But what was that nod?
- I don't know, I just thought

446
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:21,969
we were doing a copy thing.

447
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,338
But thanks, man, that's
really big of you.

448
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:25,582
Hey, I wish I could be on
a ship that's exploring

449
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,672
and solving science mysteries
instead of nonstop fighting.

450
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:30,543
- Like on the D?
- Exactly.

451
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:31,805
Damn, do I miss that ship.

452
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:33,459
Enjoy it while you
have it, Bradward.

453
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:34,939
I will, sir.

454
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,810
Hey, Cap, the name Brad

455
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:38,247
just feels kind of
"meh" to me now.

456
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,814
What do you think of
"William" Boimler?

457
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,077
I love it! Hey, you
like Romulan ale?

458
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,383
Ah, I can learn.

459
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,820
Computer, play "Nightbird."

460
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,305
Hey, Enterprise.

461
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,352
- You did good.
- Go boldly out there, mate.

462
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:04,229
You think we'll
ever see him again?

463
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:05,752
I do.

464
00:21:05,796 --> 00:21:07,774
'Cause, like, his clone's
here. We'll see him every day.

465
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:09,147
- Whoa!
- Oh, yeah.

466
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,067
This isn't my first
"guy got turned into a doll."

467
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,851
He'll be back to
normal in an hour.

468
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,331
Aw. Look at this little guy.

469
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,420
I could use him
as puppet therapy.

470
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:22,552
- Hey! Migleemo!
- Yeah?

471
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,554
Read the sign!

472
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,776
Whoa! Did you get double
promoted? Congrats!

473
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,125
Huh? What do you mean?

474
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:32,494
You got a whole new
pip right there.

475
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,303
Nah, just a piece of corn.

476
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:35,347
That's always happening.

477
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,001
Half the time when
you see someone

478
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:38,872
with the wrong amount
of pips around here,

479
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,048
it's usually just
delicious street corn.

480
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,398
- Want some?
- Sure.

481
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:44,269
I had you wrong, Jet.
I thought you were

482
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:46,793
another one of those try-hards
who only wants to rank up.

483
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:48,795
But you love the job,
and I respect that.

484
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,146
Thanks, Mariner. It's the
best job in the galaxy.

485
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,887
You're a true Lower Decker, man.

486
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,996
And something tells me we're
gonna make a great team...

487
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,848
Oh, my God, it's
Boimler! It's my friend!

488
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,000
- What are you doing here!?
- You're supposed to be on the Titan!

489
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:01,417
I got transporter cloned.

490
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,157
- Ha-ha! Pay up.
- Damn it!

491
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:05,072
How did you possibly guess that?

492
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,355
Oh, I don't know, it just seemed
like a Boimler thing to happen.

493
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:10,034
Clone me's staying on
the Titan, so here I am.

494
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:12,166
Wow. If you think
you can leave us

495
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,691
for the big time only
to come crawling back,

496
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,649
you would be right about that!

497
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,347
Get over here, man. Sit down!

498
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,524
Oh, there's no room
for me to, um...

499
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,961
- Oh. I'll let you all catch up.
- Ha-ha-ha!

500
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:27,070
- I know you got, like, a shared history and stuff...
- Oh, man, so much to tell you.

501
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:29,943
- We just did a mission on a collector's ship.
- Ooh! And our away team leader

502
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:32,665
got zapped by a ray and it
turned him into a puppet!

503
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,711
- What?!
- So, was the Titan

504
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,103
as awesome as everybody says?

505
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,429
Eh, it was a bunch
of complex characters

506
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,193
thrown into heavily
serialized battles

507
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:40,978
which always ended in
mind-blowing twists

508
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:42,825
and made me question the
basic tenets of my reality.

509
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:44,068
But who cares about that?

510
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:45,437
Tell me more about
this puppet ray.

511
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,288
That's the kind of
stuff I live for.

512
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,420
Time for shots!

513
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,030
All right! Shots! Shots!

514
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:51,834
- Whoa!
- Yeah, go get 'em. You have a lot of work

515
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:54,339
- to do for abandoning me.
- You're not letting that go, huh?

516
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,385
- Nope.
- Yeah, so hurry up, huh?

517
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:58,188
- Drinks don't replicate themselves.
- Okay, okay, I'm going.

518
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,737
From now on, you'll get all
the drinks, you backstabber.

519
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,063
- : Lower Decks! Lower Decks!
Ha-ha!

520
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,438
Are you tired?
Because you've been.

521
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:09,441
Arnock, at the race of Natara
through my mind all night.

522
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:14,881
Well, Shaka, when
the walls fell.

523
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:19,103
