00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,074
Apologies for the delay.

3
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,817
You aren't the only Federation
spy I'm interrogating today.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,385
Ensign Beckett Mariner!

5
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,822
Ah, no biggie. I don't have
anything else going on.

6
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,693
We'll see if you're so cavalier

7
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:36,783
after a taste of
my... excruciator!

8
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:40,570
Ready to talk?

9
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:42,137
Yes.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,443
It's only been a couple of
months working with my mom,

11
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,682
instead of behind her back...
The line between mom stuff

12
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,665
and captain stuff has
gotten real fuzzy.

13
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,101
Your captain is your mother?

14
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:51,774
Yeah, lady, everybody
knows that, keep up!

15
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:52,906
I thought you were good at this.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,280
- Ow!

17
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:58,390
I used to sneak away and
do all sorts of little,

18
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:00,807
off-the-book side missions
without cluing her in.

19
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,983
Now that's impossible!

20
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:05,029
- She's so happy.

21
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:06,813
It's very sweet, but
I am losing my mind.

22
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,772
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

23
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,035
- Guards!

24
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:24,527
Oh, my God, Mariner, you
got to get me out of here!

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,791
- They keep showing me lights.
- No, I am still mad at you.

26
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,184
What, for going to the Titan?

27
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:30,683
But you knew I wanted
to get a promotion.

28
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:32,100
You're supposed to be my mentor.

29
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,468
You snuck off in the
middle of my shift

30
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:34,667
without saying goodbye.

31
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,036
You know who my
best friend is now?

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,106
My mom... it sucks,
it's like work.

33
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,890
Look, I'm a hologram, okay?

34
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm sure real Boimler
had his reasons.

35
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,937
I don't know, maybe, did
you ever... intimidate him?

36
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:46,549
- What? No, shut up!
- No, no, no! Mariner?

37
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,854
Aah!

38
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:49,465
You're abandoning
your fellow officer?

39
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,771
Yeah, well, he did it first.

40
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:56,559
Stop her!

41
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,474
Look, I never asked
for special treatment.

42
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:00,582
That is not my style. I mean,
I won't turn it down, though.

43
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:02,193
Oh, wait, does that
make me a bad person?

44
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:03,957
You are an extremely bad person.

45
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,177
Wow, you are nasty!

46
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:08,242
Words can hurt just as much as
torture equipment, all right?

47
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,138
Good!

48
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:15,119
I guess I'll just have to
get used to it, you know?

49
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,970
Life is all about
change. I just always

50
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,209
thought she'd kick
me out of Starfleet.

51
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:20,278
- You'll never escape!
- Right?

52
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,256
Oh, wait, you're talking
about the detention center?

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,760
Come on, I'm, like, practically
escaped already, read the room.

54
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,567
Oh!

55
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,265
They're locking weapons!

56
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:51,938
- Oh, stop being such a...

57
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,964
Computer, pause program.

58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,619
What do you want, Jennifer?

59
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:57,968
What are you doing?

60
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,554
Cardio, plus a little
strength training.

61
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:02,233
So you work out by staging
Cardassian prison breaks?

62
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:04,931
- Yeah, what do you do?
- Uh, yoga.

63
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:06,803
- Wow, how unique!
- Whatever.

64
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,935
Captain wants you
in her ready room.

65
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:12,200
Look, I know we're not supposed
to have interpersonal conflict,

66
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:14,245
but I really hate that Andorian.

67
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,161
All right, here we go.
Computer, resume program.

68
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,296
What are you... Why
are you squatting?

69
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,950
We're going to die. Stop that!

70
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,649
I can't... it's leg day.

71
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,678
Captain's log:
TheCerritos is finishing

72
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:41,941
second contact
duties on Apergos.

73
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:44,030
On a personal note, my daughter

74
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,294
has yet another side
mission request.

75
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,252
When I agreed to give
her more autonomy,

76
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:51,081
I never realized how
often I would be catering

77
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,519
to her whims. It's
getting a bit old.

78
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:57,479
Mom, you don't have to keep a
trinket from every side mission

79
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,219
we do together.
What even is this?

80
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,570
That's a gratitude mask from
when you gave root juice

81
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:02,658
to the Vornilians.

82
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:03,765
Right. Right,
right, right, right.

83
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,356
Speaking of which...

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,812
I want to do one last thing
before we leave system.

85
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:09,273
- Of course you do.
- The capital city is filthy.

86
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,295
They never cleaned up after
their industrial revolution.

87
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,059
Can I power-wash a
couple buildings?

88
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:14,646
I mean, if the locals
see how good it can be,

89
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,082
maybe they'll start
cleaning up on their own.

90
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,412
Officially, no.

91
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,762
Starfleet does not
prioritize aesthetics.

92
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:22,112
But as your cool mom,

93
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,288
- I say go for it.

94
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:27,073
The away team is awaiting
your orders, Captain.

95
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,685
Sorry, Commander, I
forgot you were there.

96
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:32,122
That does tend to
happen a lot these days.

97
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,926
The Apergosian high leader
just needs to select

98
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,561
a subspace communication
number and we'll be good to go.

99
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,607
Sure, you're
authorized to proceed.

100
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,435
Oh, and, Jack?

101
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:42,393
Make sure Mariner gets
whatever she needs.

102
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:43,568
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:46,049
: Thanks, Jack!

104
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,336
Hey, have you guys seen my PADD?
I just zinged Ransom so hard.

105
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,144
I got to do a personal
log before I forget.

106
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,755
- Did you check Boimler's bunk?

107
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,279
He'd lose his mind if he knew
we were using this for storage.

108
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:01,369
He probably has a huge room
to himself on the Titan.

109
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:04,154
Yeah, he's probably so excited
about serving with Riker

110
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,851
he isn't thinking
about us at all.

111
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,592
- Okey dokey!

112
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:10,247
Ensign Barnes just confirmed
our date for tonight.

113
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,249
Whoa, she's crazy
hot! Are you nervous?

114
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,729
Wait, that sounds familiar.

115
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,905
No, not nervous at all.
This is gonna be great.

116
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,013
Oh, actually, you went on a
date with Barnes last year

117
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:20,736
and it wasn't a good match. She
didn't care that a red alert

118
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,433
failed to override
maintenance hatch 70's

119
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:24,217
access protocol...
Can you imagine?

120
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,958
That's okay... This
is our third date.

121
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,831
It's been pretty great.
Ensign Barnes is super cool.

122
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:31,050
Oh! Oh, okay.

123
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,314
Eh, went the wrong
way again.

124
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:36,969
Does Rutherford seem off to you?

125
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,231
Yeah, always. Why?

126
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,668
Last year, he didn't like pears.

127
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,670
And now he eats
them all the time.

128
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:43,517
I mean, his implant and part
of his brain got ripped out

129
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,152
of his head and put back
in, so "liking pears"

130
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,024
doesn't seem like
that big of a deal.

131
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,591
What about Barnes? Three dates?

132
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,723
- He's not supposed to like her.
- Tendi?

133
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,333
If Rutherford dating
someone bugs you,

134
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:54,813
maybe you should talk to him.

135
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:56,467
Ha! No, I don't care about that.

136
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,165
I'm worried about SMD:
Synthetic Memory Degradation.

137
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,839
It's a rare condition
that affects cyborgs

138
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,125
with new implants.

139
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,648
First your opinions change,

140
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:06,477
then your brain liquifies
and melts out of your nose!

141
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,697
Luckily, this is exactly
what I've been training for.

142
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,960
I will save my friend!

143
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:12,527
Cool.

144
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,722
So, you really think Boimler
has a big room on the Titan?

145
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:16,661
Yeah, it's probably huge.

146
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:26,410
Hmm, no. No.

147
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:28,064
Ugh. No.

148
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,718
You know, your
communication number

149
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:31,502
doesn't really matter,
Your Excellency.

150
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:32,808
People just say, "Computer,

151
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,592
contact the Apergosian
High Leader,"

152
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,788
- and it does it automatically.
- Well, Apergosians have

153
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:39,205
a deep relationship
with numbers, Commander.

154
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,207
It needs to have gravitas...

155
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:43,340
Digits our grandchildren
can be proud of.

156
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:44,950
Yes, yes, right.

157
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:47,475
Hey! Look at this one!
This one's got gravitas.

158
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:50,042
Mm, too close to my
ex-girlfriend's number.

159
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,044
I need more options.

160
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:55,178
Fine. Mariner, could
you grab me some more PADDs?

161
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:56,788
Ooh, no can do. Sorry.

162
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:59,138
Sort of busy with, you know,
whatever I feel like doing.

163
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:01,097
I'm in command of
this mission, Ensign.

164
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,402
Get me my PADDs!

165
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:05,057
But I am authorized
by the captain

166
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,537
to do my own mission.

167
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:08,254
Have Stevens grab 'em.
He's your little buddy.

168
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:10,106
- He is not!
- Here's those PADDs, sir.

169
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:11,542
Stacked 'em just
the way you like.

170
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:13,805
Get away from me, Stevens.

171
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,948
Whoa. I never knew the ancient
ones decorated these buildings.

172
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:27,732
You seeing this?

173
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,778
- Hmm.

174
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,344
Clean your public
spaces, people.

175
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:32,998
It's not that hard.

176
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,348
Who knows what you'll
find under all this soot?

177
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,619
Oh!

178
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,490
Uh, we got sci-fi stuff
happening over here!

179
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:50,276
Mariner, get out of there!

180
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:55,847
Sir, I'm reading a buildup
of strange energies.

181
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,849
Mariner! Mariner!

182
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:00,373
- Ah!
- Ah!

183
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,289
Commander?

184
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,595
Commander, can you hear me?

185
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,162
Oh, God, is he alive?

186
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,729
- Please tell me he's alive!

187
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:09,426
Calm down, Stevens.
He's gonna be fine.

188
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:10,819
Don't lie to me!

189
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:16,172
I told you not to
deviate from the mission.

190
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,566
Hmm. Looks like you
took a full load

191
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,829
of strange energy
straight to the cortex.

192
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:23,005
What
is "strange energy," Doctor?

193
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,660
Electrical phenomena
with unknown properties.

194
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,662
It can have all sorts
of physical effects...

195
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:31,622
Unlock parts of the brain,
even endow god-like powers.

196
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,016
Humanity has a
complicated relationship

197
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:35,626
with organized religion.

198
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,106
Well, strange energies doesn't.

199
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,455
Ever hear of Gary Mitchell?

200
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:40,457
Uh, it got real weird real fast.

201
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:43,982
Those energies weren't
that strange. I'm fine.

202
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:48,857
: Now
unhand me. I must rise!

203
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,336
And he's hovering.

204
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,164
I think he might be
going god-like on us?

205
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,167
Let's not jump to conclusions
until I run some tests.

206
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,082
You mortals tire me!

207
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:00,738
Excelsior. I am healed.

208
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:02,087
My power swells.

209
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:04,612
My brain is unlocking
its full potential.

210
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:05,961
Well, lucky for us,

211
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,155
there isn't much
to unlock in there.

212
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,659
I can hear your thoughts!

213
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:10,400
Uh, I mean, hey, I was
just joking around,

214
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,880
privately, in-in my head.

215
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:14,143
I have to figure out the
right harmonic frequency

216
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,710
that will disrupt
his power cycle.

217
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:29,332
What is he doing now?

218
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,942
It's easy
to become a god.

219
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:33,031
The trick is staying a god.

220
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,686
He seems to be focusing
on his bi's and tri's.

221
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,688
Captain, we have an
incoming communication

222
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:38,994
from Admiral Freeman.

223
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,778
I'll take it in my ready room.

224
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:43,825
Hey, sweetheart. Just
checking in on the mission.

225
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:46,175
Oh, sorry. Did I catch you
in the middle of something?

226
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:49,352
Nah. Just having lunch...
Some hot chili.

227
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:50,788
No, the mission is great.

228
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:52,485
Second contact is
almost complete.

229
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,463
You know, Carol Bear, you
impressed some important people

230
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,446
with your showdown
with the Pakleds.

231
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,554
This could be your year to get
promoted to a capital ship...

232
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:00,252
As long as you keep a
clean record, of course.

233
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,712
: Oh, the Cerritos?

234
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:05,107
Oh, it's the very image of
Starfleet responsibility.

235
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,587
Mariner, get Ransom
under control

236
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,851
and get that number picked now!

237
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:11,548
Yelling at me isn't
going to help!

238
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,898
Oh, yeah. Feel the burn!

239
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,728
So, wait. My brain's
gonna melt out of my nose

240
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:19,077
because I like pears?

241
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:20,644
No, no, no, no, no.

242
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,143
There's a problem in the
way that your hippocampus

243
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,865
and your implant
are communicating.

244
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,562
Okay, so what's
with all the disks?

245
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:26,868
They provide a low-level shock.

246
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,652
A shock? There's,
like, a hundred of 'em!

247
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,109
Reacting to pain can often kick
neurons right back into place.

248
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:33,091
Wait. How much pain? Aah!

249
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,895
That kind of hurt! Can
you warn me next time?

250
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,312
Uh, sorry, I can't.

251
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,768
The shocks have to come
at unexpected times.

252
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,445
- I can't tell you when I'm...

253
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:40,708
That one was worse!

254
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:41,772
I have to randomize the voltage,

255
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:42,753
or your brain will tune it out.

256
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:45,625
Do you still like pears?

257
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,062
Yes!

258
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:50,543
Huh?

259
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:51,849
How about now?

260
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:53,242
Uh, pears? No, I hate pears.

261
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:54,765
I'll never eat a pear again.

262
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,114
Then you should pass this test.

263
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:58,203
Three sets of twins
are lost at sea.

264
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,249
Each set shares a
parent with the other,

265
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,033
but no two sets are the same.

266
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:04,819
What is the name of the boat?

267
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:08,605
Uh, um... The Salty Dog?

268
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:09,911
- Yes!
- Really?

269
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:11,913
- No.

270
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:13,784
No, what are you doing?
No, don't do that!

271
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:15,370
- I'm late for my date.
- But your brain!

272
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:17,396
Was feeling great until
you started shocking me.

273
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,137
This isn't like you!

274
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:23,185
Looks like I'm going to have to
resort to more extreme methods.

275
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,020
That displeases Ransom.

276
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,110
He made the moon disappear.

277
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,522
Hey, buddy, look
at... look at this.

278
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,113
- This... this might be

279
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:39,854
the best subspace
number I've even seen.

280
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:45,381
He just ruined our
museum of popular music!

281
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,470
Hey, that sounds like
something you don't need.

282
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,820
Mom, I don't think this
is going to happen.

283
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:51,474
Well, it has to!

284
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:54,433
I never should have authorized
you to break mission parameters.

285
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:55,976
Well, how was I supposed to
know this was all gonna go

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,262
all Ransom on the mount?

287
00:12:57,306 --> 00:13:00,613
I will create a
race of Ransomites!

288
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,619
Hey, don't transform
my constituents!

289
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:08,143
Ooh, ooh, do me, sir!

290
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:10,058
it. I'm gonna blast him.

291
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:12,103
No! Shooting
from the hip is what

292
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:13,844
landed us here in
the first place.

293
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,324
Just calm him down.

294
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:17,674
Mom, I feel that you
are not listening to me.

295
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:19,517
I amgoing to calm him
down... by blasting him.

296
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:22,157
When you say that,
what I hear is

297
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,029
that you don't like
being disagreed with.

298
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:31,166
Ah!

299
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,256
Ah, damn it!

300
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:37,626
We have to
be a team on this.

301
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,522
Yeah, no. Of course,
yeah, love to be a team.

302
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,611
Stop pretending to
like each other.

303
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,353
It's making me furious!

304
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:47,008
I am superior to all of you!

305
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,401
Oh, it's true. All hail Ransom.

306
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,751
I bow. I bow before thee, sir.

307
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:54,798
Emergency transport to sickbay
for Commander Ransom now.

308
00:13:57,714 --> 00:13:59,368
Dude, not cool!

309
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,172
Doc, how did they
deal with Gary Mitchell?

310
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:02,893
Kirk smooshed him
with a boulder.

311
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:06,027
Gary Mitchell was an
ant, and I am a lion!

312
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:14,774
You know what?

313
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:16,698
Maybe we shouldn't be
seeing each other tonight.

314
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,083
My memory's all messed up
because of my new implant.

315
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:20,693
Sorry if I say anything weird.

316
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,173
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

317
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:23,914
My older sister got a symbiont,

318
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,568
and it totally changed
her personality.

319
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,372
Oh, is it because she has all
the memories and experiences

320
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:29,050
- of her past lives in her head?
- Meh.

321
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:31,922
It's more that she always has
to bring up having a symbiont.

322
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,402
It's like, we get it.

323
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:35,752
- When are you back on duty?

324
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,948
Me and a couple girls from
cetacean ops are going swimming.

325
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:39,234
Want to join?

326
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:40,975
Sure. This thing is waterproof.

327
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,846
- I can swim all night.
- Great.

328
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,022
Uh, I think your friend
is gonna shoot you.

329
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,459
What now?

330
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,437
- Tendi, what are you doing?!
- Sorry to interrupt,

331
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:51,420
but I really don't
want you to die again!

332
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:54,118
- Hi. I'm Tendi. We're friends.
- Nice to meet you.

333
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:55,791
Tendi, come on! You
don't have to do this!

334
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:58,862
I'm in medical, he has SMD,
I'm just saving his life.

335
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:00,255
What's an SMD?

336
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:03,780
It's just a cyborg
thing. I'm fine. Aah! Uh.

337
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:05,086
Well, when you're cured,

338
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,522
just meet us outside
cetacean ops.

339
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,132
I'm going to go change
into my swimsuit.

340
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,091
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I can come with you!

341
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:12,093
Oh, no, you can't!

342
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:13,244
What's in
those hyposprays?

343
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:14,617
Medical venom!

344
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,879
Ugh. Stop!

345
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:17,291
You can't just keep
attacking me and trying

346
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,640
to surprise me into
getting better.

347
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:20,928
- If I do have this LSD thing...
- SMD.

348
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:23,582
Whatever. You can't cure it
like getting rid of hiccups.

349
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:26,455
-  You're right.
- Thank you.

350
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:28,326
I'll have to get your
brain out of your skull

351
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,807
and freeze it so I can nano
suture your dendrites by hand.

352
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,331
Tendi, please! I just want
to go swimming with girls!

353
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,812
- Then give me your brain!
- No!

354
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:38,380
My will be done!

355
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:41,774
Behold the first
coming of Ransom!

356
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:44,125
Captain, there's a giant
head approaching the ship.

357
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:45,996
Red alert. Evasive action.

358
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:56,485
Is this gym equipment?

359
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:59,140
He's creating
his own Jack utopia.

360
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:05,015
Wait. If we can't
nullify his powers,

361
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:06,538
we should boost them.

362
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,192
Why the hell would we do that?

363
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,542
There's a chance it could
short out his godliness.

364
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,892
Yeah, or make him
extra vengeful.

365
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:14,416
Aah!

366
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,026
Oh, what, you have
a better idea?

367
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,334
Mom, hit that head
with everything you've got.

368
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:21,292
Doc says it'll overload him.

369
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,690
Oh, yes, feed me your
phasers. I can feel

370
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:31,259
myself becoming more
powerful than ever before!

371
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:34,131
More power just
gave him more power!

372
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,915
I have to
reason with him.

373
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,439
Open a channel.

374
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,137
Why are you doing
this, Jack? Stand down.

375
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,358
I used to be your number one,
but then Mariner took it all

376
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,708
just because she's
your daughter.

377
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,493
Then from now on, you
can work with us, too.

378
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:50,452
I don't want to work with her!

379
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,331
Stay away from me. I want
my brain right where it is.

380
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,961
I'm just borrowing it.
I-I'll give it right back.

381
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:03,900
Computer, activate force field,

382
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,380
- Corridor 755.

383
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:07,251
I'm trying to save you.

384
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:08,731
I don't need to be saved.

385
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:09,906
But we're best friends!

386
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,386
We have to trust each other.

387
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,083
Well, then, maybe we
shouldn't be friends.

388
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:21,874
You don't have Synthetic
Memory Degradation.

389
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:23,224
What?!

390
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:27,576
Mom,

391
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,186
hit him with photon torpedoes.

392
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,927
Don't you give me orders.

393
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,103
- I thought we were partners.
Lies.

394
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,409
You hate working together!

395
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:36,933
That's not true. Right, Mom?

396
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:38,239
I, uh...

397
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:40,197
He's right.

398
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:42,417
What? Well, I do

399
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,027
actually feel the
exact same way.

400
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:45,594
I hate being your sidekick.

401
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:48,162
And I hate the way you
question me all the time.

402
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:52,079
You're both fakers! And now
you'll pay the ultimate price!

403
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:17,321
You don't have SMD,

404
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,212
but there's definitely
something wrong with you.

405
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:22,152
If you knew I wasn't in danger,
then why were you hunting me?

406
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:23,869
Well, you changed your
opinion on so many things,

407
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,721
I was worried that if
I didn't do something,

408
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,854
you might decide you didn't
like me anymore, too.

409
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:31,422
I'm a monster. I
shouldn't be your doctor.

410
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:33,337
So, you were utilizing

411
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:35,818
highly invasive
neuro-medical procedures

412
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:39,082
in order to make
sure I liked you?

413
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:41,519
Yes. You can hate me.

414
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,131
Computer, deactivate
force field.

415
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:45,915
Ha! How could I hate you?

416
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,700
Tackling an emotional problem
with scientific experimentation

417
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:50,354
is exactly what I
would have done.

418
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:51,834
- Really?
- Yeah.

419
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:53,464
But you don't have
to, 'cause guess what?

420
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:56,273
No new implant is gonna stop
me from being your friend.

421
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:58,057
Aw. Thanks, Rutherford.

422
00:18:58,101 --> 00:18:59,624
It's nice to know
no matter what,

423
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,278
we still love science.

424
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:03,019
And how.

425
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:04,847
Also, don't date Barnes.

426
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:12,202
He's growing hands.

427
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:13,899
Brace for grabbing!

428
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,511
Shoot him

429
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,208
with the dang torpedoes already!

430
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:19,557
And I'm gonna go find a boulder.

431
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,081
- No! Power down weapons.
- But Captain!

432
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,736
I'm not shooting
my friend anymore.

433
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,129
Why not?

434
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:27,391
Because you're right.

435
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:29,437
Mariner and I
haven't been honest,

436
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,960
and you got caught
in the middle.

437
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,744
You're a great officer, Jack.

438
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,877
I shouldn't have
taken you for granted.

439
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,401
Captain, his
power is... diminishing.

440
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:40,274
Your validation feels so good.

441
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:41,579
Tell me more.

442
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,494
I can end this with praise.

443
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:46,236
Uh, J-Jack, you're
a-a fine commander.

444
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,890
You're in phenomenal shape.

445
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,893
Yes, fine commander.
Yes, so yoked.

446
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:52,764
Mom, you've got to
hit him. He's a god.

447
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,549
You can't appeal
to his ego forever.

448
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,899
Stand down, Ensign.
I've got this.

449
00:19:56,942 --> 00:20:00,946
Jack, you're an amazing pilot,
a-a brilliant tactician and...

450
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,514
Oh, you're right. I
should be captain!

451
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:04,883
Yeah, well, I don't
know about that.

452
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:06,778
- Why not?
- That position is filled.

453
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:08,780
: We can't
have two captains.

454
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:11,000
Not two. Just me.

455
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,481
Full stop, mister.
This is myship.

456
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:15,265
I want to be the captain!

457
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,488
Wait, Jack, no!

458
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:21,706
You've got great hair,

459
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,273
and you're so good
at guitar and...

460
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:28,147
What? It worked? Was
it the guitar thing?

461
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,236
Uh...

462
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,369
I'm going to destroy
you...

463
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,461
What the hell is
happening down there?

464
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,289
Ow!

465
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,031
Sorry, Mom. I had to take
matters into my own feet.

466
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:52,911
Mariner? What was I doing?

467
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:54,522
You were trying to
eat the ship, sir.

468
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:56,785
I had to apply concentrated
force to your neutral zone.

469
00:20:56,828 --> 00:20:58,526
I'm sorry. Those
strange energies

470
00:20:58,569 --> 00:20:59,701
may have given me powers,

471
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:01,485
but it was my ego that turned me

472
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,618
into a monster!

473
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:05,184
Sorry. Your eyes were glowing.

474
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,988
: Thank
you. I could feel myself

475
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:10,015
succumbing to the
power.

476
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,297
Would you
stop it, Beckett?

477
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,279
No can do.

478
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,033
Oh!

479
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:31,123
Here, I picked a
number. Just go.

480
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:34,213
No!

481
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,521
TheCerritos
is on its way

482
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,218
to the Bitrus Expanse,

483
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:41,743
and Commander Ransom should
make a full recovery.

484
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:43,353
I'm really sorry

485
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:44,896
about the whole omniscient
murder-god thing, Captain.

486
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,878
Well, you just focus
on getting better.

487
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,707
I need you by my side.

488
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:51,883
All right, big guy.

489
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:53,644
Today, I'll be reading
you "Nightingale Woman."

490
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:55,539
Thanks, little buddy.

491
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,715
Hey, Mom. How's Ransom?

492
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,239
He's fine. Stevens
hasn't left his side.

493
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:02,024
You know, it was cool

494
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,374
being an unstoppable
mommy-daughter team for a while,

495
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:06,594
but I think maybe we
work better apart.

496
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:08,900
Agreed. I'm proud
you're my daughter,

497
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:12,034
but I can't stand
sharing command with you.

498
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,470
Hey, maybe from now on,

499
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:15,254
we only do someside
missions together.

500
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:16,604
I would like that.

501
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:18,083
There's a team

502
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:19,757
waiting to take me to
the brig, isn't there?

503
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:22,392
- Ah, you know me so well.

504
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:24,089
Love you, Mom.

505
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:27,266
Love you, too. Never
disobey me again.

506
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,051
I do what I want!

507
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:32,097
So, your brains
aren't going to melt?

508
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:33,577
Nope. I mean, not
from the implant.

509
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:34,970
But we're in Starfleet,

510
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:36,382
so who knows what's
gonna happen next week.

511
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:37,862
We worked together
and managed to revert

512
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:39,366
one of his synaptic pathways.

513
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,300
- Oh, that's nice. Which one?
- I hate pears again.

514
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:44,283
They're so mealy and
bland.  pears.

515
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:46,285
Well, it seems like
everything's back to normal.

516
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,723
Yeah. Only thing
missing is Boimler.

517
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,377
I do miss the guy,
but I can't blame him.

518
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,943
I mean, think of all
the fun adventures

519
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:53,423
he's going on working with Riker

520
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:55,512
on a ship that's way
cooler than the Cerritos.

521
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:57,166
It's everything he ever wanted.

522
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,430
He's got to be having
the time of his life.

523
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,266
-  Shields at 30%!
- Red alert!

524
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:11,876
I'm starting to think
this jam session's

525
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,009
got too many licks
and not enough comp.

526
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:16,141
What does that even mean?!

527
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,535
More Pakled battle harpies
just dropped out of warp!

528
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:19,623
They've got us surrounded!

529
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,687
Someone punch me a way out.

530
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:21,756
Punching.

531
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,149
I'm taking us into the anomaly.

532
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:26,978
- Brace for gluonic disruption.
- Gluonic what?!

533
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,854
I love my job!

534
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:33,349
Chirp.

534
00:24:34,305 --> 00:25:34,923
