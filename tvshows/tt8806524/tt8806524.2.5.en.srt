1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,377
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,512
Until the auto-repair
heats the ship,

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,015
why don't we find you somewhere
where we can light a fire?

4
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,717
What do you want?

5
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,387
A chorus of thoughts to drown
the gnawing silence,

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,588
but from you,

7
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,124
I'll settle for your ship.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,127
Poor Agnes Jurati.
Left behind again.

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,629
You felt it, too, didn't you?

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,164
Connection.

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,134
You've impressed me.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,237
Laris, last night. I was...

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,273
- You.
- Nothing has to change.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,342
It's too late for that,
Jean-Luc.

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,178
- You lost someone.
- We're getting him back.

16
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,113
And losing him
was not your fault.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,748
What I want is to try
to figure out

18
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,550
how to fix the timeline.

19
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,752
You want Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

20
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,721
If you don't get to Crystal Ball

21
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,222
before he's transferred,

22
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,425
- no paper trail.
- Adios,

23
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,493
Captain.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,829
I was given coordinates
to this place

25
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,831
to find a Watcher.

26
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,466
Guinan.

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,368
Yeah?

28
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,170
I was told I had

29
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,440
three days to stop
something critical

30
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,709
that will change
the future forever.

31
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,678
A safe galaxy

32
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,647
is a human galaxy.

33
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,283
You can't do it.

34
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,354
That's unexpected.

35
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,523
You're looking for a Supervisor,

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,425
otherwise known as a Watcher.

37
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,196
They see themselves
as guardian angels.

38
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,532
Laris.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using PureVPN
From 1.99 USD/Month -> bit.ly/getpvpn

40
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,814
Houston, this is Shango.
I'm reading

41
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,517
-  1202 alarm up here.
Standby.

42
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,586
We're getting word of a Russian
satellite collision.

43
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,455
Orbital debris heading your way.

44
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,667
- Where are we?
- My apartment.

45
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,836
Better place for a chitchat
if you get disagreeable.

46
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,305
Laris, how did you get here?

47
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,741
"Laris."
There's that name again.

48
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,277
Did Q do this?

49
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,647
What's a Q?

50
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,617
You don't know, do you?

51
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,656
Is that what you really want?

52
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,365
- You're not Laris.
- No.

53
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,900
My name is Tallinn.

54
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,602
Pleasure to meet you.

55
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,805
Houston, I'm gonna try
an engine burn.

56
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,407
See if I can't nudge
this bucket of bolts

57
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,708
- out of the way.
Negative, Shango.

58
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,277
Counter thrusters are offline.

59
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,312
- What?
- Brace position.

60
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,650
I've been sent
from a future time.

61
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,586
Yeah, well, I don't like
time travelers, whoever you are.

62
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,454
Uh, my name is Jean-Luc Picard.

63
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,792
Impact. Three...

64
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,794
Two...

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,896
One.

66
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,502
Boom. You're dead.

67
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,781
Why is everything stuck today?

68
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,550
Take a deep breath. It's okay.

69
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,485
Launch is in three days.

70
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,854
It's just some jitters.

71
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,890
Like others in my profession,

72
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,292
I have a singular purpose.

73
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,997
I have devoted
my entire being to protecting

74
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,633
one individual, a single string

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,502
in a grand tapestry
to which I'm not privy.

76
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,539
There is a divergence coming.

77
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,343
Something that alters
the future I'm from.

78
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,944
It's possible either you,

79
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,980
or the person
you are protecting,

80
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,649
is of great importance

81
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,719
to that future.

82
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,821
Interesting...

83
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,558
because that person,
Jean-Luc Picard, is apparently

84
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,727
your ancestor.

85

♪ ♪

86
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,665

Alone,

90
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,658
but not lonely.

91
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,429
Silence so loud.

92
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,599
Voices

93
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,435
carried everywhere
on invisible strings.

94
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,842
Hmm.

95
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,117
Mm.

96
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,488
Computer,

97
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,792
intercept local
cellular tower frequencies.

98
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,895
Voice pattern not authorized.

99
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,029
Mm.

100
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,664
Computer,

101
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,033
intercept local
cellular tower frequencies.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,769
Voice pattern not authorized.

103
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,204
Computer,

104
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,741
intercept local
cellular tower frequencies.

105
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,776
Voice pattern not authorized.

106
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,113
Computer,

107
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,982
intercept local
cellular tower frequencies.

108
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,651
Channel open.

109
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,791
Yes, I would. The La Barre,
France constabulary, please.

110
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,951
I got him.

111
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,485
About a minute
in that direction.

112
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,687
We can have Jurati lock on

113
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,055
and transport him out of there.

114
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,991
If we beam him out

115
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,860
in front of a dozen
eyewitnesses, who knows

116
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,595
what effect teleportation
might have on the 21st century.

117
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,129
Uh, "time travel" rules?

118
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,998
We're about to lose
Rios forever.

119
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,066
What the hell is wrong with you?

120
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,901
We'll get him out alive.

121
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,636
In a way that doesn't
screw up the timeline

122
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,538
even more than it already--
Give me the tricorder.

123
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,741
You're being too careless.

124
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,243
And you're being
too goddamn careful.

125
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,048
Raffi...

126
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,984
please.

127
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,023
400 meters out.

128
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,995
I get it. You're angry

129
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,631
- about Elnor, about Gabe.
- Don't.

130
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,967
I know you. You need a target.

131
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,169
You want to set your feet
and fight.

132
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,005
And all you want to do
is run away.

133
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,106
That's right.

134
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,119
Because something that's
not moving is vulnerable.

135
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,188
Nobody move!

136
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,557
Back in your seats
and stay there.

137
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,232
Shut up.

138
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,774
I said shut up.

139
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,920
Whew.

140
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,792
Rios.

141
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,593
This is a very bumpy century,
but I

142
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,195
think I'm getting
the hang of it.

143
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,097
Somebody's gonna start
missing this bus at some point.

144
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,966
We need to get them
out of here, fast.

145
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,300
Come on. Go, go, go.

146
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,135
- Go. You're here.

147
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,670
Elnor.

148
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,141
Ma'am, are you all right?

149
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,711
Yeah, of course, of course I am.

150
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,113
G-Go, go, go.

151
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,948
So, now what?

152
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,817
Uh, like you said,

153
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,186
we're vulnerable.
We need to keep moving.

154
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,356
I've got your back,
you got mine, right?

155
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,131
Pedro.

156
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,866
Nice work.

157
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,804
That's a good hit.

158
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,382
Rios, let's go.

159
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,320
You say this is your profession?

160
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:58,024
I was chosen for service
as a Supervisor.

161
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,393
Supervisors.

162
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,263
Kirk's Enterprise

163
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,665
crossed paths with

164
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,434
a human called

165
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,003
Gary... Gary Seven.

166
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,806
He, too, was recruited
by superior beings

167
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,207
as an agent who would,

168
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,711
in your words,
protect the tapestry of history.

169
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,780
And sometimes that means

170
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,948
protecting a single thread.

171
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,818
Tell me about Renée.

172
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,387
All our futures depend on it.

173
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,022
Let's visualize.

174
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,793
I want you to be kinder
to yourself, Renée.

175
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,463
You should know that I abide by

176
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,832
one rule.

177
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,034
I watch, but I'm never seen.

178
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,104
I've never met Renée.

179
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,942
She taught herself
to be an expert sailor.

180
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,745
Learned in the south of France,
where she grew up.

181
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,213
That was by age ten.

182
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,715
By age 11, it was chess,

183
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,018
fluid dynamics, and Cantonese.

184
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,854
University at 16.

185
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,790
Then a couple of years
as a test pilot.

186
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,293
Those were nail-biters.

187
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,096
NASA couldn't wait
to get their hands on her.

188
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,264
She sounds remarkable.

189
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,033
She is.

190
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,002
That's...

191
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,338
not to say that she
doesn't have her struggles.

192
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,240
There's a melancholy.

193
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,910
Sometimes anxiety,

194
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,879
sometimes depression.

195
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,249
It's a shame,

196
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,818
for a mind that can burn
so brightly.

197
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,288
Depression in a human
can be debilitating.

198
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,060
She's... maybe lucky to survive.

199
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,363
That's the problem. I'm not sure
she is surviving it.

200
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,832
I'd say to myself,

201
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,034
"Are you ready for this,

202
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,104
"or are you gonna choke
when they need you?

203
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,306
Because lives depend on it."

204
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,509
The Europa Mission launches
in three days.

205
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,113
The Europa Mission
was a pioneering space flight

206
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,149
in my history.

207
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,284
Quite frankly,
I'm not sure she'll be on it.

208
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,554
What do you mean?

209
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,995
I'd be brutally honest.

210
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,930
This is a therapy session.

211
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,333
Mandatory psych evaluation
for the Europa Mission.

212
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,935
And you monitor it?

213
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,070
- This is private.
- Is it?

214
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,207
Here's the relevant part.

215
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,942
It feels like...

216
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,311
nothing matters.

217
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,982
I start going numb,

218
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,151
and that scares me.

219
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,888
I don't know
if it's my gut, or...

220
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,990
just plain fear.

221
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,129
Fear does not have to be
your enemy, Renée.

222
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,131
Fear can be your friend,

223
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,034
telling you that, perhaps...

224
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,004
- ...you are not ready.
- Stop.

225
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,075
He's talking her out of it.

226
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,176
Why?

227
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,213
Something's off here.

228
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,181
I need an angle on the doctor.

229
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,327
That's not a therapist.

230
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,128
That's Q.

231
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,398
He's using Renée

232
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,034
to change the future.

233
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,510
To understand the true potential

234
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,913
of the human genome

235
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,615
is to envision a future

236
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,217
free from disease.

237
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,186
Imagine,

238
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,488
if you will,

239
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,957
I am a god.

240
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,226
And as I look down at humanity,

241
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,996
I see them at a crossroads.

242
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,231
Will they evolve

243
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,900
toward enlightenment,

244
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,369
or will there be a divergence

245
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,904
into darkness?

246
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,607
How'd it go, Dad?  Shit.

247
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,142
That bad, huh?

248
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,244
You didn't do the

249
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,347
"humanity is at a crossroads"
thing?

250
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,549
I did.

251
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,551
Didn't take.

252
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,021
Kore, my child,

253
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,455
if I could encapsulate

254
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,959
all the knowledge
I've gained through the years

255
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,328
from life experience and

256
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,463
careful study into a

257
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,699
single pearl of wisdom for you,

258
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,968
it would be this:

259
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,970
People are idiots.

260
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,406
Picture a world

261
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,408
free of genetic defects.

262
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,177
If I had the power

263
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,346
to nudge us
in the right direction,

264
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,547
isn't that my responsibility?

265
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:55,187
Someday soon, you'll get to
step into the outside world

266
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,589
and meet some morons up close.

267
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,091
I promise.

268
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,163
How soon?

269
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,367
Uh, I-I'm almost there.

270
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,737
So, what if we discovered

271
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,672
that precious key

272
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,342
to unlocking our perfection.

273
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,479
How far are you willing to go?

274
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,086
When I can finally go outside...

275
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,223
...I want to learn to swim.

276
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,726
I want to see nothing
but sunlight hitting the pool.

277
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,596
Breathe the ocean air.

278
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,569
I'll do anything
to make that happen.

279
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,490
Dr. Soong, you were running

280
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,658
genetic experiments
with a privatized

281
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,761
military organization,

282
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,131
Spearhead Operations,
on soldiers.

283
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,133
- Ex-soldiers.
- Unmonitored,

284
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,535
unregulated,
illegal experimentation.

285
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,637
For a greater good.

286
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,573
You don't understand.
This genetic defect means

287
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,375
the smallest speck of dust
will ruin

288
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,411
my daughter's
respiratory system.

289
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,247
UV light from the sun
turns her blood to poison.

290
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,249
She's confined to a room.
She has no life.

291
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,450
Adam.

292
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,185
Breaking the Shenzhen Convention

293
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,620
has serious consequences.

294
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,655
I'm doing this for our children.

295
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,357
We have no choice but to revoke

296
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,527
your license and your funding.

297
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,263
You are not to engage
in any further

298
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,766
research relating to genetics.

299
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,175
What?

300
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,818
What the hell?

301
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,672
"Q"?

302
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,905
Help me.

303
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,707
Are you hurt?

304
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,843
- Alone?
Hurry.

305
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,719
Merde.

306
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,488
- Hello?
They're
coming back soon.

307
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,990
I hear you.

308
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,525
I can't see you.

309
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,827
Follow my voice.

310
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,245
My hero.

311
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,452
Nicotine addiction.

312
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,956
I can help you with that.

313
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,326
No! No!

314
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,508
Dr. Soong, I presume?

315
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,514
Hacking into my network
was a cute little trick.

316
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,017
So was teasing me with data

317
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,419
that was mysteriously specific

318
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,022
to the exact problem
I'm trying to solve.

319
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,923
Oh, well, thank you,
I worked hard on that.

320
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,525
Do you have any idea

321
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,428
how many crackpots
contact me about my work?

322
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,899
I get everything from
basement-dwelling Nazis to

323
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,336
rich heiresses who want me
to clone their fucking cats.

324
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,305
Let me be clear,

325
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,908
that's not what I do,
so don't waste my time.

326
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,777
Oh, I wouldn't think of it.

327
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,646
Seems I have, uh, taken time
for granted of late,

328
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,415
and now she's threatening
to abandon me.

329
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,617
See, right there,

330
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,985
crackpot talk.

331
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,587
- I'll be leaving now.
- Uh, Dr. Soong,

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,956
in 17 seconds,
you're going to take a seat.

333
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,658
How do I know?

334
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,894
You drove an hour
to meet a total stranger,

335
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,698
not for mystery
or intellectual curiosity,

336
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,433
but because you're a father,

337
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,902
and you're desperate.

338
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,545
There. 17 seconds,
right on the tick.

339
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,416
If you know that much about me,

340
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,685
you know I'll kill you
if I think you're a threat.

341
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,388
Yes, and
that's what I like about you.

342
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,623
Who the hell are you?

343
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,792
I am the

344
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,695
evolution of stardust.

345
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,599
I'm the gentle flutter
of a butterfly.

346
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,768
I am Death,

347
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,037
destroyer of worlds.

348
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,475
And I'm also a big fan
of your work.

349
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,710
And a visionary who knows
how important you are

350
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,812
to the future of this planet.

351
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,114
What do you want?

352
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,648
This meeting is about
what you want.

353
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,017
What I want will come later.

354
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,787
She doesn't have
much time, does she?

355
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,055
That's none of your concern.

356
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:13,725
What a sad, sad irony.
A geneticist

357
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,062
whose daughter has
an incurable genetic disease.

358
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,831
Sunlight burns like fire.

359
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,801
Air turns to acid.

360
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,937
Nothing... nothing is incurable.

361
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,540
Well, you have neither the time
nor the funding

362
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,408
to prove that theory, but...

363
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,677
you do have this.

364
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,452
Analyze it.
If you like what you see,

365
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,053
give me a call.

366
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,789
Then maybe

367
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,591
you can help me with something
that I might want.

368
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,895
If Q is so all-powerful,

369
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,063
why not just snap his fingers

370
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,099
and make the Europa Mission
ship disappear?

371
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,201
I don't know.

372
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,170
Or even Renée herself?

373
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,204
I don't know.

374
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,139
But if he's trying

375
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,975
to change the timeline
by manipulating Renée,

376
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,478
then he's robbing her
of the destiny

377
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,680
you were sworn to protect.

378
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,148
Okay. Tomorrow,

379
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,517
she goes into
pre-launch quarantine.

380
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,820
Once she does, it's...

381
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,122
pretty impossible to back out.

382
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,458
So, we need simply
to stop her from quitting

383
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,727
for... next 15 hours.

384
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,897
I don't suppose
you've any sedatives?

385
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,966
We can't do that.

386
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,568
She has to go
to the gala tonight.

387
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,870
What gala?

388
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:35,574
It's a-a big party before all
the astronauts go in quarantine.

389
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,043
Attendance is mandatory.

390
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,711
Lots of press.

391
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,146
Meeting donors.

392
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,482
So, we attend this gala,

393
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,752
we cover Renée, we monitor
her state of mind,

394
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,654
and isolate her
from potential threats.

395
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,590
We should

396
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,192
rendezvous with my crew.

397
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,262
They may have gear on the ship.

398
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,497
I think you're mistaking me
for someone

399
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,966
who takes orders from you.

400
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,635
I know you protected her

401
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,136
for 24 years,

402
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,039
but you need to be strategic

403
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,208
about this.

404
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,110
We need to help each other.

405
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,512
We're stronger together.

406
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,683
Agnes.

407
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,656
Agnes, I have a surprise
for you.

408
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,594
Agnes.

409
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,701
I don't want to start
without you.

410
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,614
Agnes.

411
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,324
Agnes, it doesn't have to be
like this. You and I,

412
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,926
- at odds.
- What did you do?

413
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,662
- I'm helping you.
- Bullshit.

414
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,830
All right, I'm helping us.

415
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,932
Please...

416
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,900
Don't.

417
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,803
- Be quiet, darling.
This doesn't concern you.

418
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,606
- Let him go.
I could
take his body.

419
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,642
I need it, but it's you I want.

420
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,644
I said let him go.

421
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,079
You're alone, Agnes,

422
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,881
in every timeline,

423
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,284
every permutation, in every
reality of this universe.

424
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,254
You are utterly alone.

425
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,356
Stop talking.

426
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,158
That is your fate.

427
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,360
Forever invisible.

428
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,030
But I could change all that.

429
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,067
Imagine,

430
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,602
being loved,

431
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,938
completely,

432
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,374
every thought and whisper

433
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,111
cherished, shared.

434
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,748
With our minds joined as one,

435
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,884
we could be more.

436
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:04,055
I am the only one
in the entire universe

437
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,392
that has ever truly seen you.

438
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,798
This has to end.

439
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,736
Have it your way, Agnes.

440
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,774
I'm getting out of here.

441
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,710
If not with you, then with him.

442
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,861
It can't be.

443
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,397
It's stable.

444
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,301
How did... How did he do this?

445
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,124
- What's in it?
- Food coloring,

446
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,994
water, a genetic stabilizer.

447
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,896
How did you find a breakthrough?

448
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,832
A colleague of mine

449
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,401
inspired me to try
something new.

450
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,437
I've injected myself already.

451
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,905
It's perfectly harmless.

452
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:27,939
Dad.

453
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,875
I trust you.

454
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,055
Go slowly.

455
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,157
Obviously.

456
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,914
♪ ♪

457
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,290
I almost got the hang of it.

458
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,061
It's just floating in motion.

459
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,399
Was my mother a good swimmer?

460
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,235
Like a duck.

461
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,538
Like a mermaid.

462
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,242
I think you'll find there's
any number of things

463
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,013
for which you're a-a decade
or two behind the ball.

464
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,481
Just be patient with yourself.

465
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,484
Patience implies time.

466
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,488
Can we just not think
for an afternoon?

467
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,291
That doesn't sound
like you at all.

468
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,993
I thought you'd be
running around the lab by now,

469
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,828
having me help you
dissect and analyze

470
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,363
every step that went into this.

471
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,034
Don't be silly. I just want
to take the win for once.

472
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,471
Dad, who is this colleague?

473
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,541
Kore?

474
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,444
Kore? Oh, no.

475
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,080
- No, no, no, no.

476
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,201
- Agnes.
- No, it's-it's not my blood.

477
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,937
But...

478
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,540
I think I just killed
our only way home.

479
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,021
I had to do it.

480
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,090
She was killing him.

481
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,659
He's all right now. I repaired
most of the internal organs.

482
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,294
Most?

483
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,996
Yeah, his spleen's in a box
over there.

484
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,070
I hated shooting her.

485
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,439
Organic tissue at the base
of the cerebellum.

486
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,275
That's all it took.

487
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,143
She's as vulnerable as we are.

488
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,178
There are a few billion
souls who might

489
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,546
disagree with you there.

490
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,186
I gave him something
to erase the memory,

491
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,422
but we need to get him
to his car.

492
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,061
Tell me about the others.

493
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,596
Can they be trusted?

494
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,197
Oh, no question.

495
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,999
We've been through
thick and thin together.

496
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,201
There is no better bunch of...

497
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,237
Rios, you're twisting his back.
It's okay.

498
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,372
Is that your crew?

499
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:25,109
The people carrying a dead cop
out the door.

500
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,313
Oh, I-I'm sure he's not dead.

501
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,381
There's got to be
some explanation.

502
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,350
Come.

503
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,328
Do you have the cure?

504
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,363
The real cure?

505
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,466
Not something that wears off.

506
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:53,204
Because if you do,
I am a hostage to you, sir.

507
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,973
We're all hostages
to what we love.

508
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,310
The only way to truly be free
is to love nothing.

509
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,180
How meaningless would that be?

510
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,115
I have what she needs.

511
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,089
What do you need?

512
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,226
I have discovered of late

513
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,096
that I have certain limitations.

514
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:23,701
So I want you to remove
an obstacle for us.

515
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:27,372
Does the name "Picard"
mean anything to you?

516
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,211
I-I know you said
it was complicated,

517
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,012
- but are we gonna talk
about your new...
- Not now.

518
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,148
- No, but she looks
exactly like...
- I'm aware.

519
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,450
- Well, doesn't that make you
feel a little, kind of creep...
- Yes.

520
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,419
Good talk.

521
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,655
What would it look like if you
were to leave the mission?

522
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,593
Let's visualize.

523
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,728
What is Q playing at?

524
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,231
Well, there is now

525
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,700
a very real danger
of Renee Picard

526
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,035
backing out of this mission.

527
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:02,340
And I think
what we experienced firsthand

528
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,809
was the consequences of that.

529
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,377
The other timeline.

530
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,279
So no Europa mission,

531
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,815
no Renee, no hope.

532
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,717
Everyone hates everyone.

533
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,785
You're saying
this great aunt of yours

534
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,286
is single-handedly responsible

535
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,654
for preventing our future

536
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,124
from becoming
a xenophobic tyranny?

537
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,260
- How?
- I don't know.

538
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,595
The history of this time period

539
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,598
is wildly incomplete.

540
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,601
Uh, the century leading up
to first contact

541
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,571
was just rife with chaos.

542
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,107
All that's known about Renee
is she discovered

543
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:39,577
a microorganism on Io
that she believed was sentient

544
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,112
and convinced
the mission commander

545
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,413
to bring it back to Earth.

546
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,215
And none of that would matter

547
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,084
if Q was able to get to Renee
and break the timeline.

548
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,653
Okay, so, we just
need to make sure

549
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,155
Renee gets on that ship.

550
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,690
We are going to monitor

551
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:57,261
her every single move
at this gala,

552
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,730
assess the threats
and guide her.

553
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,399
With an invisible hand.

554
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,336
We don't reveal ourselves
or make contact.

555
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:10,541
It might feel like Q
is playing with us,

556
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,378
but he is unpredictable,
and a threat.

557
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,883
Renee will be out in the open.

558
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,520
We have another problem.

559
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:24,789
We weren't invited.

560
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,457
Can't we transport in?

561
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,825
Well, it's not that simple.

562
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,496
This is a maximum
security function.

563
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,664
Each guest is issued
a radio frequency invite...

564
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,766
- Hi, there.

565
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,635
...that corresponds
to a database

566
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,138
of their entire life history.

567
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,175
My technology can force
one person through,

568
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,244
but only temporarily.

569
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,746
Once inside,
facial recognition takes over.

570
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,851
So even if we could
materialize six people

571
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,553
in the middle
of the dance floor,

572
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,688
we'd be busted immediately.

573
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,792
We can't transport in
if we're not in the database.

574
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,195
So we hack the database.
It'll take me two seconds.

575
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,863
I took Intro to Antique Coding
in school.

576
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,299
- I'll finally get to use it.
- You can't reach it remotely.

577
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,835
They've physically isolated
the database from the network.

578
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,237
Yes, yeah. Air gapping.

579
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,906
It's primitive but effective.
That was in my class.

580
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,408
So we can't hack it
until we get inside.

581
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,776
Precisely.

582
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,179
Jurati will go in first,
infiltrate security

583

and inject our I.D.s
into the system.

Yeah, all right, we get it.

Jurati has
