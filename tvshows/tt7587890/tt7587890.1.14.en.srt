1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:01,744
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:01,781 --> 00:00:03,014
Detectives Wolfe and Vestri,

3
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:05,338
this has the potential of being
a very dangerous operation.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,668
Multiple gunmen, officers down.

5
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:12,134
Vestri?

6
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:13,937
You got the <i>Tap.</i>

7
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:15,894
You're gonna be one kick-ass detective.

8
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,148
I'm not ready to give up patrol yet.

9
00:00:19,797 --> 00:00:22,266
He swooped in like a bat out of
hell and crashed into my car.

10
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:24,335
- You hit me.
- Whoa, whoa.

11
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,537
Let's just start at the
beginning, starting with you.

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,078
I had engine trouble.

13
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,439
And if I wasn't such a good
pilot, I would've crashed

14
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,570
instead of making a controlled
emergency landing,

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,946
so I deserve a little more
gratitude than attitude.

16
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,323
Sir, can you step over here, please?

17
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,285
- Those look like bullet holes.
- What?

18
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,453
No, those are, uh...
those are bird strikes.

19
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:46,323
Oh, let me guess... the elusive
brass-jacketed hollow point?

20
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:48,325
Is that why you
had engine trouble, sir?

21
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,260
Because someone was shooting at you?

22
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:52,097
Why would anyone do that?

23
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:01,838
Control, 7-Adam-15,

24
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:03,707
check in with OCPD

25
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:06,543
and see if they have a 211 at
Orange County Savings and Loan.

26
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:08,414
<i>7-Adam-15, be advised</i>

27
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,835
<i>the bank was robbed an hour ago.</i>

28
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:12,173
<i>Suspect escaped in a blue helicopter.</i>

29
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,414
- So, hands behind my head, then?
- Yep.

30
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,609
Hands behind your head.

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,540
100 shifts.

32
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,551
Listen, not a lot of
rookies make it to this point

33
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,789
in their probationary year.

34
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:30,096
It's a reason to celebrate.

35
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,415
But not too much.

36
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:33,158
For your first 100 shifts,
your training officers

37
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,313
have been there to guide the way.

38
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,648
Not today.

39
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:37,194
Plain Clothes Day.

40
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:38,852
That's right, Officer West. Very good.

41
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:41,297
I'm sorry, what is Plain Clothes Day?

42
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:43,222
Your T.O.s will be out of uniform,

43
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:45,925
riding with you in a strictly
observational capacity.

44
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,135
They will not advise, assist,

45
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,595
or help you in any way.

46
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,131
Every decision will be yours to make.

47
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:53,774
Does this mean I finally get

48
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:54,940
to choose where we eat for lunch?

49
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,302
Yes, Officer Nolan.

50
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:59,969
For all intents and purposes,
today... you are alone.

51
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:02,475
And that should
scare the hell out of you.

52
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:04,310
This will be a true measure

53
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:06,179
of where you are
in the learning process.

54
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,534
And your performance today
could have a profound impact

55
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,516
on your career path in this department.

56
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:13,501
So, any questions?

57
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:14,883
Uh, yes, sir.

58
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,423
What happens if we
get into real trouble?

59
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,325
Deal with it.

60
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:21,427
And if you can't,
your T.O. will step in.

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,149
But make no mistake...

62
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,954
If that happens, you will be judged.

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,847
That's it.

64
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:29,335
Good luck out there.

65
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,266
Are you guys as excited
about this as I am?

66
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,821
We finally get to call the shots.

67
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,974
- I know, right.
- Whoa, slow down.

68
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,443
You two realize that 20%
of probationary officers

69
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:38,823
that wash out of the program

70
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,446
do it during Plain Clothes Day.

71
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:41,969
Don't tell us that!

72
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,816
- Why would you tell us that?
- Motivation.

73
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,645
They grow up so fast, don't they?

74
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:47,790
Please, they're just as green
as they were yesterday.

75
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,323
What are you looking at, Boot?
I'm not even here.

76
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:52,633
Let's go get our gear.

77
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,527
My wash out number's three.
What about you?

78
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,797
Same. I bet Tim's is up
in double digits by now.

79
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:57,964
Damn straight.

80
00:02:57,998 --> 00:02:59,589
I've had 11 rookies
bounced from the program

81
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,916
during Plain Clothes Day.

82
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,535
Looking to make it an even dozen today.

83
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:03,869
Do not listen.

84
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:05,371
They're just trying to psych us out.

85
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:06,739
Already making a mistake.

86
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:09,242
If we're not here,
why get two kit bags?

87
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,032
We're supposed to have two bags,

88
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:12,878
just in case they have to take action.

89
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,647
First mistake avoided.

90
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,467
So many left to make.

91
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,048
This is going to be a very long day.

92
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,558
Hey.

93
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:27,031
I didn't know you were back.

94
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,284
Restricted duty.

95
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,635
I'm on my house mouse,

96
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:31,597
pushing papers,
catching calls, you know.

97
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,433
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to be seen.

98
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:36,227
What are you doing wearing civvies?

99
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,903
Mm, Plain Clothes Day.

100
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:40,234
Right.

101
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,741
I remember mine.

102
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:44,610
I got in a fist fight
with a 300-pound woman.

103
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,657
Who won?

104
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:48,714
The orthopedic surgeon
who had to fix my shoulder,

105
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:50,069
that's who won.

106
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,610
I heard you put
a pin in that detective's exam.

107
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,170
What happened?

108
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:58,591
Realized I still had few things
to accomplish as a P3...

109
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,235
especially after what happened
to you... and Vestri.

110
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,518
It was a nice funeral.

111
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:10,596
Yeah...

112
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:14,774
So, uh, how long before you're
cleared for regular duty?

113
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:16,609
I'm not rushing it.

114
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:19,899
No shame in taking a beat when
something like that happens.

115
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,416
None at all.

116
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,172
Bishop.

117
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,407
Thank you.

118
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,460
I wouldn't be here without you.

119
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,462
Any time.

120
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:44,637
What are you doing?

121
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:46,508
Filled out your evaluation.

122
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:47,973
But we haven't even left yet.

123
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:49,672
Yeah.

124
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:51,276
I already know how today's gonna go.

125
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:52,645
No, you don't.

126
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:54,298
You're just trying to get in my head.

127
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,937
But it won't work.

128
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,324
Right...

129
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,129
Thank you.

130
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,283
Don't open it until end of shift.

131
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:33,878
Whatever you wrote in here,
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

132
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:38,073
I knew you'd say that. It's in there.

133
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:43,106
Is it true Plain Clothes Day determines

134
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,730
the track of our career?

135
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,363
Oh. That's right. I get it. Sorry.

136
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,036
You're not here.

137
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:52,806
It's not that I'm worried or anything.

138
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:55,810
Just... I don't want to be stuck
with some lame assignment like...

139
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,128
front desk.

140
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:58,293
Oh, you think front desk

141
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,650
would be a perfect fit for
me, don't you?

142
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,247
Lots of people to talk to
about their problems.

143
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,581
No, thank you.

144
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:05,466
I did not join the force
to be a receptionist.

145
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:07,240
Matter of fact, I've spent
the last few months

146
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:10,723
figuring out exactly where
I want to be assigned...

147
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:13,253
robbery-homicide.

148
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:15,800
Ambitious, I know.

149
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:17,372
Making detective in five years...

150
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,898
that's unheard of... and I'd be 50,

151
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,000
so that just means I'm gonna
have to buck the odds.

152
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,136
Pedal to the metal.

153
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,292
And when I do it...

154
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,883
you're gonna eat your words.

155
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,255
Come on...

156
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,749
We're the last ones out.

157
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,083
I needed reading materials.

158
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:39,286
Okay. You should know,

159
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,214
I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,667
Wow, that's sad.

161
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:44,691
Did you know that my dad had
an epic Plain Clothes Day?

162
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,092
- I don't care.
- Made four felony arrests,

163
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,474
wrote seven traffic violations,

164
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:49,851
and talked a woman off a ledge.

165
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,022
So you see, I can't just...

166
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,560
So you're gonna break
your father's records

167
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:53,966
like you broke his Academy records

168
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,468
because you have daddy issues,

169
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,597
and the cat's in the cradle,
and all that crap.

170
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,900
I don't have daddy issues.

171
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,408
No.

172
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,837
Oh, this can't be happening.

173
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,224
Oh, come on, come on.

174
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:21,060
First time you've let me drive.

175
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:22,939
- I'm not here, Boot.
- Right.

176
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,800
Of course. Sorry.

177
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:32,137
Why would a guy from the power
company need a video camera?

178
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:50,122
That sick bastard.

179
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,857
He's filming her.

180
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:02,801
LAPD, stop!

181
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,666
Hands behind your back.

182
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:14,141
Easy.

183
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,714
I didn't do anything!

184
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,183
Yeah, well, your camera says otherwise.

185
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,443
Do you even work at the power company?

186
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,791
- Lawyer.
- Yeah, you're gonna need one.

187
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,555
7-Adam-19, show us one in
custody, 3rd and Arden.

188
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:26,959
Did you include this arrest

189
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:30,181
in your evaluation, Officer Bradford?

190
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:31,915
Watch your head.

191
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:33,088
Get in.

192
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,869
<i>7-Adam-15, RP heard sounds</i>

193
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:39,941
<i>of an assault at 7944 Serrano Avenue.</i>

194
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:44,236
Control, show me Code 6.

195
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:49,081
Stop, please.

196
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:51,617
Start me up another unit...
944 Serrano.

197
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:56,978
I'll pay you back!

198
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:58,580
Think you're gonna rip off my stash,

199
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:00,384
and I'm just gonna take an IOU?!

200
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,066
Hey! Police! Let him go!

201
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,767
Aah! Aah!

202
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,314
All right, watch him.

203
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:05,653
Facedown! Drop the pipe!

204
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,088
Hands behind your back.

205
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:14,635
Control, show me with two in custody.

206
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,136
Where did he go?

207
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,738
- Who?
- My second suspect.

208
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:21,807
Oh, him? Well, he ran off.

209
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,456
Well, hobbled, really.

210
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,809
I told you to watch him.

211
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,675
I'm not here to watch suspects,
Officer Nolan... just you.

212
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,682
- So you let him get away?
- Of course not.

213
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,443
I would never leave
a suspect unattended,

214
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,448
allowing ample time for his escape.

215
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:35,679
But you did.

216
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:42,616
I can't believe you did
this just to have a teachable moment.

217
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:43,803
That's right, Officer Nolan.

218
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,264
Keep blaming me for your lack
of situational awareness.

219
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:48,571
- I had to go after him.
- Yes, but not before

220
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:50,983
you secured your first suspect
to something immobile.

221
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,819
Instead of dreaming about
becoming detective,

222
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,823
how about you try and just
get through today?

223
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,209
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:59,249
Damn it, this guy could be anywhere.

225
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:01,882
Relax, from the crunch
your suspect's knee made

226
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,018
when you whacked him,

227
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:05,189
I doubt he got very f...

228
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,283
- Uh-oh.
- Ah.

229
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,287
Looks like you cracked
the case, Detective.

230
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,816
Just got off the phone with dispatch.

231
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:25,879
My suspect, Todd Collins,
is on parole for a 261.

232
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:29,750
He's a tier 3 sex offender
and a 290... violent-habitual.

233
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:31,552
That's a pretty good arrest, huh?

234
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:36,126
Okay.

235
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,666
Uh, let's see, I've got
my victim's statement,

236
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:43,380
seized my suspect's phone,
canvassed for witnesses...

237
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,065
Ch-ch ch-ch ch-ch ch-ch.

238
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:47,425
Yep, we're good to go.

239
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:48,936
What?

240
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,063
Didn't say anything.

241
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,065
But you're giving me the look.

242
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,445
- What look?
- That look.

243
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:55,164
Am I missing something?
Wait, don't answer that.

244
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:56,593
- Wasn't going to.
- Good.

245
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,899
Because...

246
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:00,593
I made a solid pinch here.

247
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,245
All right. Let's go.

248
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,684
This is ridiculous.

249
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,689
Two hours to change a dead battery.

250
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,702
I could've been on
my second arrest by now.

251
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,800
Look on the bright side...
I bet your dad doesn't hold

252
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:22,195
the record for longest
automotive delay.

253
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,413
- Okay, West, good to go.
- Oh, finally. Back in business.

254
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:28,072
Lopez, I need your Boot
for a work detail.

255
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:29,943
- Sure thing.
- What? No.

256
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:32,317
Sir, it's... it's my Plain Clothes Day.

257
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:34,163
Oh, I didn't know.

258
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:38,128
In that case, I need you
for a work detail.

259
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:41,692
Evidence from a homicide.
Catalog every single piece.

260
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,887
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

261
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:47,695
You got to get me out of this, please.

262
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,789
No, I don't. The job's the job.

263
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:51,527
Nothing in the rules says
you have to spend

264
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:53,364
Plain Clothes Day out on patrol.

265
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:54,985
Hey.

266
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:58,132
You think I'd look cute in this?

267
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:05,379
I bet you're wondering what I am doing.

268
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:06,813
You're running
all the plates in the lot,

269
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:09,183
hoping to find one registered
to a felon with a warrant.

270
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:10,851
Am I detecting a tone?

271
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,085
No tone.

272
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,246
- What's wrong with running plates?
- Nothing.

273
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:15,752
It's one way to do the job...

274
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:18,158
make it all about you,
beef up your felony arrests.

275
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,060
Okay, definitely detecting a tone.

276
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,057
No, not at all. I'm not even here.

277
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:23,964
If there's a call from dispatch,
I'll take it.

278
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,270
But all's quiet on the western
front, so why not see

279
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,822
if there's a felon I
can get off the streets.

280
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:30,594
That's <i>self-initiated</i> policing.
And it's pretty effective.

281
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:33,006
Or you could patrol your beat,
engage the community,

282
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,875
which deters crime from
happening in the first place.

283
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,738
That's proactive policing.

284
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:38,588
Less felony arrests on your score card

285
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,354
- but far more effective.
- Well, it's a good thing

286
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,775
I'm making the decisions today.

287
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:43,780
I just got a hit on
that red Expedition.

288
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,043
Control, 7-Adam-15, send backup

289
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,360
for an ATL on a Marcus Quincannon,

290
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,705
felony arrest for arms trafficking.

291
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:52,541
<i>Copy that.</i>

292
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,971
Inside. Yeah.

293
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,425
I know everything
you're gonna do, Boot.

294
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,700
Just like I knew you wouldn't process

295
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:14,228
all your suspect's property.

296
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,796
What are you talking about?

297
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:18,232
I took everything Todd Collins had...

298
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,412
wallet, camera, phone, keys.

299
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:23,093
Mm-hmm.

300
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:26,540
So tell me, how did Peeping Todd
get to where you arrested him?

301
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:28,038
He drove.

302
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,243
Like I said, I have his car keys.

303
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:31,109
But not his car.

304
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,114
Most child sex offenders have
a network with other offenders.

305
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:36,450
They share videos
of their sick desires,

306
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:38,552
which leads to other victims.
Other suspects.

307
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:40,963
Where do you think they keep
this cornucopia of evidence?

308
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:42,737
- In their cars...
- That's right.

309
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:45,326
...in case parole officers
search their houses.

310
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,828
His car is a treasure trove
of evidence.

311
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:49,885
Other crimes, more victims, DNA...

312
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,565
evidence we may never have
obtained otherwise.

313
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,404
And you just left it in the street.

314
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:55,070
W... Um...

315
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:59,102
He was fiddling with his phone
the entire time he was running.

316
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:08,816
"Cops got me. Get my van."

317
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:11,061
You recall seeing a van, Boot?

318
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:13,587
There was that blue van.

319
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:15,920
That work van. It was right there!

320
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,559
Control, we need a reverse
directory on a vehicle

321
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:35,478
registered to Todd Collins.

322
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:40,020
<i>7-Adam-19, subject
owns a blue '98 Econoline</i>

323
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,395
<i>E-350 van with California plates,</i>

324
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:45,349
<i>Six-Paul-Charlie-Ida-zero-niner-three.</i>

325
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,036
<i>It shows the vehicle was impounded</i>

326
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,952
<i>from your location an hour ago.</i>

327
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,528
What?

328
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,835
You had the van impounded?

329
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:57,673
Once it was clear
you overlooked that detail.

330
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,677
But then why did we race over here?

331
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:01,217
So you could discover your own mistake.

332
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,582
That's what today's all about, Boot.

333
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,793
W... A-And it's just a bonus
that you get to humiliate me?

334
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,482
Don't blame me for the fact
that you let yourself

335
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,553
get rattled by one dubious look.

336
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:11,014
You make it out here and find
yourself riding solo,

337
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:13,419
these streets will test you in
ways you didn't think possible.

338
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,006
The only way to survive

339
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:17,367
is to control your environment
at all times.

340
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,206
You're pretty talkative
for a silent observer.

341
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:27,348
All right, boys, listen up.

342
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:30,526
The felon we are after
is one Marcus Quincannon.

343
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:33,501
Intel has led me to believe
he's currently in room 104.

344
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:36,954
Here, I've drawn a detailed
layout of the motel room.

345
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:38,387
As you can see, there are...

346
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:39,995
Four walls and a toilet.

347
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,200
Like every other motel room
in the world.

348
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:43,969
We really gotta take orders
from your Boot?

349
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,420
He's in charge today, Smitty.

350
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:47,148
Trust me. I've got this all worked out.

351
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:48,326
I'm going in first.

352
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:50,660
Janssen, you're gonna be
covering C-side containment.

353
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,768
Smitty, you'll be breaching.

354
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,096
I'll come in straight.

355
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,734
I want you to come swing around
the open side.

356
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:57,596
If I call "Trailer, trailer",
you come from C-side

357
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,186
to A-side and trail in behind us.

358
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:00,961
Textbook dynamic entry.

359
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,646
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right. I'm green, and go. Smitty?

360
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,548
Yeah. Green and go.

361
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,149
LAPD, open up.

362
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:17,666
Go away!

363
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:18,756
Breach, breach.

364
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,755
- Show me your hands!
- Oh, my God! What are you doing?!

365
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:25,788
- Bathroom clear.
- Room clear.

366
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,505
Where's Marcus Quincannon?

367
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:29,061
Who?

368
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,501
The owner of the red Expedition
outside.

369
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:33,032
The motel manager said it belonged

370
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,170
to the person in this room.

371
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,940
Yeah. Me.

372
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:39,106
I bought it from some guy on
Craigslist like three days ago.

373
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,906
I was just filling out
the DMV change of title.

374
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,144
She's telling the truth, Officer Nolan.

375
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:46,146
Your gun-runner was never even here.

376
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,103
Uh...

377
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,098
Uh, ma'am, I'm terribly sorry.

378
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,369
Obviously, there's been a mistake.

379
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:55,420
Do you know how long it
took me to get Liza down?

380
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,479
You woke her up.

381
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,265
You can put her back to bed.

382
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,542
Hello?

383
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,680
LAPD. Anyone home?

384
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:22,616
Hey, girl. It's okay.

385
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,972
Not exactly what I meant by
control your environment.

386
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:27,927
That dog barks all the time.

387
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,242
Ma'am, do you know if
the dog's owner is home?

388
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,192
- Mm-hmm.
- Shut up!

389
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:34,028
Shut up, Missy!

390
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,530
Hey, whoa. There's no need for that.

391
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:41,201
Honey, she's my dog.

392
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:44,038
I can treat her however
the hell I want.

393
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:46,674
Sir, we've received a complaint
about your dog.

394
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:49,043
And I wonder who made it!

395
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:51,352
Emma, you called the damn cops?!

396
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,680
Your dog's a menace.

397
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,987
It's just bark, bark, bark...
all day long.

398
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:57,051
It's a dog. It's kind of their thing.

399
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,653
Uh, ma'am, just step aside.
I'll handle this.

400
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:04,158
Sir, you need to try to keep
your dog from barking.

401
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:05,932
No problem.

402
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,970
I'm good at making bitches
shut their mouths.

403
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,830
Have a nice day, sir.

404
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:17,825
Shut the hell up.

405
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:20,074
Hey, stop kicking dirt
at the dog, or else.

406
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:24,752
Whoa, whoa, whoa... or else what?

407
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,414
If I have to come back here,

408
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:31,418
or even get a whiff that
you're abusing this animal,

409
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:34,254
I will make you my personal project.

410
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,123
Do you understand?

411
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:44,658
I'd say I controlled that environment.

412
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:49,207
This is a complete waste of time.

413
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,395
It's part of the job, Boot.

414
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:52,839
I did not become a police
officer to do clerical work.

415
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:55,609
Yeah, well, if you don't,
then whoever murdered...

416
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:58,612
Richard Ochoa might get off
on a technicality at trial.

417
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:01,548
Yeah, I get all of that, but
I should be out on the street.

418
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,856
We only have one Plain Clothes Day.

419
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,271
The only thing certain about this job

420
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:07,276
is that it's unpredictable.

421
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,932
You're not helping.

422
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,108
Hi, Officer? Hi.

423
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:22,041
Do you have a moment?

424
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,270
A quick one, yes.

425
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,778
- What is it?
- Uh, so,

426
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:26,139
this might be a silly question,

427
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:29,076
but I was wondering...
How hard is it for, um,

428
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,145
someone to track your
credit card purchases?

429
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:32,779
You mean like identity theft?

430
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,592
No, not... not like that.
Like a-a regular person...

431
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:37,651
but for a card that's in another name.

432
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:40,287
Like d-do the charges post
immediately or...

433
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,826
Tell you what,
on the bottom of that card

434
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,277
is the non-emergency number

435
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:45,516
for the Mid-Wilshire Police
Station. You give them a call.

436
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,153
They'll have time to answer
all your questions.

437
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:49,311
- Who should I ask for?
- Ah... front desk,

438
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,129
which is where I'm gonna
wind up if I don't get moving.

439
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,133
You have a nice day.

440
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,512
So, good news,

441
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,498
I taught the mother a swaddling method.

442
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:59,339
Baby Liza is sleeping soundly.

443
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,862
I'm glad something positive
came out of your time here.

444
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,316
Well, hang on. I wouldn't call

445
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:04,820
what happened here today
a total failure.

446
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:06,357
You told us we can't predict outcome,

447
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:08,195
only do our best to control it.

448
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,700
I developed a strong, credible lead,

449
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,505
and I commanded a flawless
dynamic entry.

450
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:16,043
Where you terrorized a mother
and a newborn child.

451
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,047
Now, if she was terrorized,

452
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,931
would she have given me
the address in Simi Valley

453
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:21,441
where she purchased the car?

454
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,361
Simi Valley PD is sending a unit
to arrest our gun-runner.

455
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,699
They told me they'd give me a
call as soon as he's in custody.

456
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:30,064
Lunch?

457
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,641
Sir. Dispatch says you
wanted to see us.

458
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:34,176
Yeah, shut the door.

459
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:38,816
You know, I remember
my Plain Clothes Day.

460
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:41,829
It was a long time ago,
but I remember it.

461
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:43,729
Desperate to make an impression.

462
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,368
My T.O. watching me like a hawk.

463
00:21:46,563 --> 00:21:48,863
But the pressure got to me,

464
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,129
and I made all kinds of mistakes...

465
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:52,930
stupid ones, too.

466
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:54,999
And completely out of character.

467
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,432
Which is why, Officer Chen,

468
00:21:57,469 --> 00:21:59,470
I sympathize with your situation.

469
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,381
Sir?

470
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:04,235
We got a rude conduct complaint
against you

471
00:22:04,313 --> 00:22:05,749
from, um...

472
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:10,225
a Rodney Acker.

473
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:12,540
He said you verbally threatened him

474
00:22:12,585 --> 00:22:14,853
to get his dog in line, or else.

475
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:16,888
Any way to cool this guy off, sir?

476
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:18,823
I tried, but he's pretty dug in.

477
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:20,858
He wants to make it formal,

478
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:23,694
so Internal Affairs has been notified.

479
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,063
Captain Anderson
is in meetings all day,

480
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,010
but she wants to talk to you
at the end of shift.

481
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:30,535
Uh... sir, what kind of
disciplinary action

482
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:31,869
am I looking at?

483
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:33,171
Don't get ahead of yourself.

484
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:34,810
She should know.

485
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:38,393
Threatening a civilian is a
serious offense for any officer,

486
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:41,048
but to do it as a
probationary employee?

487
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:44,513
Even a minor infraction
can have a serious impact.

488
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,899
How serious?

489
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,641
Worst case scenario,
you'll be my 12th rookie

490
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:49,438
to wash out on Plain Clothes Day.

491
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,509
Obviously they're not gonna kick you

492
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:58,845
out of the program over this.

493
00:22:58,882 --> 00:22:59,847
I don't know.

494
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:01,564
I mean, you should have seen
Sergeant Grey's face.

495
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,615
It was utter disappointment.

496
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:06,229
He gives me that look every day,
and I'm still here.

497
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:08,612
If Chen threatened the guy,

498
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,361
why didn't you step in and sort it out?

499
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,355
It's Plain Clothes Day.
That'd be cheating.

500
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,811
You know I'm a man of principles.

501
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:15,213
Yeah, but they could terminate her.

502
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:16,579
Come on, I'm not gonna let that happen.

503
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:18,001
Thought you were a man of principles?

504
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:19,615
And contradictions.

505
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:23,054
You think he's back too soon?

506
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,456
No such thing as too soon.

507
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:27,258
Tim, drop the macho act.

508
00:23:27,432 --> 00:23:29,524
The guy lost his partner in the line.

509
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:31,732
Some cops never recover from that.

510
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll be back.

511
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:41,239
- Is this seat taken?
- Hey. No.

512
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:42,744
Sit down.

513
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,742
How's Plain Clothes Day going?

514
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,197
So far so good.

515
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:48,612
- How are you doing?
- So far so good.

516
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:53,202
- You're not buying that.
- Nope.

517
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,575
We're trained to be vigilant, you know?

518
00:23:57,612 --> 00:23:59,947
Cop eyes...
always scanning for trouble.

519
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:02,083
But we never saw it coming.

520
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:03,792
One second we're riding the elevator,

521
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:05,949
the next we're shot to hell.

522
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,900
There's nothing you could've
done differently.

523
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,942
We should grab a drink sometime.

524
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,142
Are you asking me out on a date?

525
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:20,611
No. No. No!

526
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,947
Ah, that's not what I meant.

527
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:24,816
I would never date you.

528
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:26,704
I mean, I would... date you...

529
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:27,952
- Hmm.
- ...but...

530
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,660
- you know what I mean.
- Right.

531
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:32,932
Uh, so I'm gonna get back to work.

532
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:35,029
Sure, uh, thanks for checking on me.

533
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:36,776
Uh-huh.

534
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:40,412
All right, enough of this pity party.

535
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:42,099
This morning was a disaster,
which means

536
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:43,857
the rest of this day
can only get better.

537
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,421
- Did I just jinx us?
- Little bit, yes.

538
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,597
Listen, Lucy, a cop as good as you,

539
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,074
they're not gonna let you
go down over this.

540
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,704
You know what really pisses me off?

541
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,745
It's not that I might lose my job.

542
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,180
It's that dog.

543
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:59,250
She's just stuck with that monster.

544
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:01,135
I know.

545
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:03,792
Anyway... see you.

546
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:06,958
Detective Wolfe.

547
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:08,426
Nice to see you back.

548
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,127
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

549
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:11,429
You're Talia's Boot, right?

550
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:12,980
Yeah.

551
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:14,796
How's your Plain Clothes Day going?

552
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,337
I won one, and I lost one.

553
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:19,637
How'd you like to win another one?

554
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:23,171
You know what, losing half the day

555
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,875
presents an interesting challenge.

556
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:27,325
- I'm not following.
- What if I can match

557
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:30,379
my father's record in half the time?

558
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,870
Come on, Lopez, let's roll.

559
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,699
You did not just say that.

560
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:36,546
You two on the Richard Ochoa murder?

561
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,067
No, he just cataloged some evidence.

562
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,973
Well, the widow of the victim
is at the front desk,

563
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,318
and she wants to talk to someone.

564
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:43,067
- Ask Wolfe.
- I can't find him.

565
00:25:43,104 --> 00:25:45,754
But I found you.
So take care of it, all right?

566
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,764
Oh, my gosh.

567
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,468
You're moving with purpose.

568
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:51,702
I got a hot lead.

569
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,310
Let me guess, a methadone clinic

570
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:54,581
to look for drug addicts.

571
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,623
A little hotter than that.

572
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,291
This is a warrant for a 211 suspect.

573
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:00,520
How'd you get this?

574
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:01,879
Detective Wolfe gave it to me.

575
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:03,653
Detectives hip pocket
these type of warrants.

576
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,099
They don't give them away.

577
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:06,736
He said he had to make amends.

578
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,979
What did he do?

579
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:11,499
<i>7-Adam-15, suspicious circumstance</i>

580
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,110
<i>at Pico Arms Motel.</i>

581
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,282
Pico Arms, that's your favorite motel.

582
00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:17,395
Control, is there
a room number on that?

583
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:19,430
<i>103.</i>

584
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,203
The mother and baby were in 104.

585
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:25,574
<i>7-Adam-15, are you accepting the call?</i>

586
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:27,960
We've got a felony warrant to serve.

587
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:29,798
We take that over this, right?

588
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:31,896
Your call. I'm not here.

589
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,016
Control, show me attached
to the Pico Arms Motel.

590
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,439
<i>Copy that.</i>

591
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:47,838
Mrs. Ochoa?

592
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:49,961
I'm sorry, but the detective

593
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:51,865
covering your husband's case
isn't available.

594
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:53,589
I can have him call you.

595
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,066
Can't you help me?

596
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:56,652
With what, ma'am?

597
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:59,437
I'm forgetting him.

598
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:01,136
Ma'am?

599
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:03,168
My husband, Richard,

600
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:06,023
he was murdered in our bedroom
by home invaders.

601
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:09,396
I was... out of town.

602
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:12,817
The detectives came
and took everything...

603
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,086
his Bible, jewelry, clothes.

604
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,753
They left me nothing.

605
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:18,816
That's procedure, ma'am.

606
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,838
Everything inside of the room
is evidence.

607
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:23,127
It's not just evidence.

608
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,988
They're memories.

609
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:27,636
And that's all I have left of him now.

610
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:29,770
I beg of you.

611
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:31,746
Give them back to me.

612
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:41,316
I'm... I'm sorry, Mrs. Ochoa.

613
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:44,115
Your husband's property must be
held until after the trial.

614
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:46,238
There's nothing I can do.

615
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,800
- That was awful.
- Yeah.

616
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:02,457
Making a few arrests ought
to cheer you up, right?

617
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:05,514
Let's go.

618
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:07,363
Is there a problem, Boot?

619
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,558
I'm making the decisions today.

620
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:13,177
Okay.

621
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,863
So what do you have in mind?

622
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:20,861
When housekeeping
came to service the room,

623
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:22,526
they found this.

624
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,001
Control, notify the sergeant

625
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,469
and Missing Persons on a possible 207.

626
00:28:38,503 --> 00:28:39,670
<i>Copy that.</i>

627
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:41,607
Why are you calling in Sergeant Grey?

628
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:44,652
I met that woman.

629
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,229
She's the one who asked me for help.

630
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,084
She was asking about tracking
creditcards or something.

631
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:57,955
I'm not sure. It was a very
quick conversation.

632
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,957
The victim's name is Lynn McDaniels.

633
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:01,957
She lives in Van Nuys
with her husband, Chris...

634
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:04,582
a trucker with a serious history
of domestic violence.

635
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,222
There's a BOLO out for him now.

636
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:08,132
Detectives are reaching out
to friends and family.

637
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:09,734
You should probably
get back on the street.

638
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:11,043
Sergeant, if it's all the same,

639
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,880
- I'd like to stay attached to this.
- I know.

640
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,984
But standing here, crossing
fingers, helps no one.

641
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,242
When I hear something,
you'll hear something.

642
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,267
This man filed a complaint against me.

643
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:31,943
- We shouldn't be back here.
- You're right.

644
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,091
You shouldn't be here. I'm fine.

645
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,566
Aren't I supposed to be making
all the decisions today?

646
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:37,762
You are.

647
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:40,003
And right now, you decided
to let me save your job.

648
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:42,131
Sir, it means a lot that you care about

649
00:29:42,168 --> 00:29:43,974
my future as an officer, but this is...

650
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:45,136
Relax, Boot.

651
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,770
I simply believe that if
you're gonna get fired,

652
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:47,816
it'll be because of me,

653
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:50,035
not some asshat's
rude conduct complaint.

654
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,087
Stay here.

655
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:55,872
LAPD.

656
00:29:58,535 --> 00:29:59,649
What do you want?

657
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:01,654
Here's the thing, Mr. Acker.

658
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:04,121
Officer Chen got a little overzealous.

659
00:30:04,383 --> 00:30:05,823
You call it overzealous,

660
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:07,918
I call it a threat under
the color of authority.

661
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,682
We'll see what a jury decides.

662
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:12,136
Hey, look, you're upset.
That's understandable.

663
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:14,365
So, perhaps we can work this out.

664
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:15,638
Go on, keep talking.

665
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:17,075
Look, if there's anything
I can do for you,

666
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:19,317
anything you might need a police
officer's assistance with,

667
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:20,956
- you just let me...
- Hello?

668
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,974
Watch commander, please.

669
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:24,654
Why are you calling my boss?

670
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,251
Because I'm gonna make
a harassment complaint

671
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:28,006
against you, too, pal.

672
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,148
Have a good night, sir.

673
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,817
I will.

674
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:35,286
You, I'm not so sure!

675
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,294
- How'd it go?
- Drive.

676
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:45,796
Uh, hold on.

677
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,537
Is that blood?

678
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:03,981
Could be blood.
Could be something else.

679
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:06,384
But it could be blood.
Which gives me PC.

680
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,935
I can search that garage.

681
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:09,146
Look, if you're wrong,

682
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,703
he'll claim you're retaliating
against him.

683
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:12,889
You'll definitely be fired,
and he'll just add another zero

684
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,485
to his settlement check with the city.

685
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,023
Smart move here is to walk away.

686
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,996
So what's it gonna be, Boot?

687
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,686
It's your call.

688
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,373
Missy, what's going on in there?

689
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,889
No, don't open that!

690
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:51,395
It was an accident.
She... She got in my face.

691
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,930
She just wouldn't shut up!

692
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:54,265
You're under arrest.

693
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:55,566
Hey!

694
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,011
Get on the ground. Get on the ground!

695
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:59,270
All right.

696
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:02,194
Hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

697
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:07,576
Shut up, Missy!

698
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:08,979
That's a good dog.

699
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,865
<i>7-Adam-15, possible GPS hit</i>

700
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:12,583
<i>on motel suspect's cellphone.</i>

701
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:16,084
<i>Alley, adjacent to
7419 Hayworth Avenue.</i>

702
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:20,410
Control, show me Code 6.

703
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,742
Clear.

704
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,144
Nolan.

705
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:42,076
Okay, I know you're not here,

706
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:43,334
and I'm supposed to wait for backup.

707
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:45,316
Screw that. Let's go.

708
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,347
You like that?!

709
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:08,047
Shut up!

710
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,462
Chris... please, don't...

711
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:16,055
Police! Drop it!

712
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:21,886
You good?

713
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,083
Please.

714
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:25,863
Stay back!

715
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,753
Don't do that again.

716
00:33:27,844 --> 00:33:29,386
7-Adam-15, shots fired.

717
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:31,223
Requesting backup. Code 3.

718
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,832
Lynn, you're gonna be okay.

719
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:34,491
No, she's not.

720
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:40,566
Just wait outside.

721
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,886
Me and the missus
got some things to sort out.

722
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:44,418
Then I'll turn myself in.

723
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:46,415
We wait, he kills her.

724
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:48,333
If we expose ourselves, he'll shoot us.

725
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:50,566
Can you drive a rig?

726
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,237
That's a bad idea.

727
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:54,883
Then I'm going now.
He shoots me, you shoot him.

728
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,941
Channel nine.

729
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,605
Please...

730
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:06,015
Hey, Chris, how about we talk?

731
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:07,108
You and me.

732
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,668
What's there to talk about?

733
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,644
You letting your wife go.

734
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,488
No.

735
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,519
In position. Standing by.

736
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:18,058
She promised forever, then left.

737
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,957
Chris, I know how you feel, man.

738
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:24,035
I was married, too... 20 years.

739
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,695
One day I come home,
there's a note on the table,

740
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,433
tells me it's over.

741
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,121
It hurts.

742
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,862
Don't patronize me.

743
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,699
You don't know me.

744
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:35,721
What she's done to me.

745
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:37,277
You've never been in my shoes.

746
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:38,527
You're right.

747
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:40,480
- Start the countdown.
- Three...

748
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:42,324
You're right, I haven't
been in your shoes, Chris.

749
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:45,642
My marriage ended
because we drifted apart.

750
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,935
- ...two...
- Your marriage failed because

751
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:49,943
- you're a low-life domestic abuser.
<i>- ...one.</i>

752
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,161
Brace.

753
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:03,776
Get off of me!

754
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,178
Oh, God...

755
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:09,658
I thought this was it.

756
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:11,295
I thought he was finally gonna kill me.

757
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,611
It's okay. You're safe now.

758
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:15,273
- Come on. I got you. I got you.
- Okay.

759
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,524
Control, one in custody.

760
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:22,025
Send an R/A unit.

761
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,360
Show us Code 4.

762
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:27,230
Thanks for coming back in.

763
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:29,499
While cataloging
your husband's effects,

764
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:33,570
I, uh, discovered one item
not in the actual crime scene.

765
00:35:33,744 --> 00:35:35,895
It was in the hallway,
so you can have it back.

766
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,374
What is it?

767
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:40,549
Unfortunately,
it's just a broken watch.

768
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:44,181
It's not broken.

769
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,650
Just cheap.

770
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:48,351
See?

771
00:35:50,002 --> 00:35:53,690
When we got married, we were broke.

772
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:55,762
I scraped together a few dollars

773
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,695
and bought Richard this
for our first anniversary.

774
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:01,598
He wore it every day.

775
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:04,416
Later, in better times,
I bought new watches,

776
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:06,135
expensive watches,

777
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:09,827
but no... he only wore this.

778
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:16,541
Officer, thank you for
getting it back to me.

779
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:24,377
Shift's over, Boot.

780
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:26,846
No arrests. Not even a parking ticket.

781
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,426
What's your daddy gonna think?

782
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:32,596
Honestly, I don't care.

783
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:34,355
Oh, really?

784
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,282
Yeah.

785
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,205
Today was a good day.

786
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,552
End of shift, Boot.

787
00:36:55,768 --> 00:36:57,932
Don't you want to open your evaluation?

788
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,489
Why?

789
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:01,157
Captain is probably gonna fire me,

790
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:03,326
so what does it even matter now?

791
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:05,182
Just do it.

792
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:19,682
"Officer Chen second-guessed
every decision she made."

793
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:23,713
The whole point of me doing
this was to get under your skin.

794
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,160
Clearly you did, sir.

795
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:26,650
Yeah, until the end.

796
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:29,152
Because when it really counted,
you didn't hesitate.

797
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:31,788
You put it all on the line,
and you made the right call.

798
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:33,785
Which really pisses me off

799
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:35,861
because now I got to rewrite
the damn thing.

800
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,564
Tim, what's gonna happen to me?

801
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:44,237
Officer Chen, step inside.

802
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,175
You told Mr. Acker, and I quote,

803
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:55,478
"I will make you my personal project."

804
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,347
Nice. Kind of retro.

805
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:59,516
Very 1990s Rampart scandal.

806
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:02,166
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- In today's LAPD...

807
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:05,121
especially in my house...
we don't threaten people.

808
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:07,457
- Not even the murderers.
- Yes, ma'am.

809
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,226
Those words do not reflect
the officer I am

810
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:11,930
or the one I wish to be.

811
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:16,366
Fine.

812
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:18,234
You may go.

813
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:19,803
Ma'am?

814
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,405
So, I'm... still in the program?

815
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,541
Internal Affairs reached out.

816
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:26,781
They wanted my take on this complaint.

817
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:28,440
I'll recommend that they close it out

818
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:30,484
based on the circumstances.

819
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:32,461
- Thank you, ma'am...
- Don't.

820
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,417
Because if you ever
let this job down again,

821
00:38:34,452 --> 00:38:36,486
I will not hesitate to
put you on a career path

822
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,388
far away from the LAPD.

823
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,203
Do you understand?

824
00:38:42,273 --> 00:38:43,860
Dismissed.

825
00:38:44,117 --> 00:38:45,562
Officer Bradford!

826
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,204
Your turn.

827
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,869
Yeah, three more, thank you. Perfect.

828
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:54,537
Can I get two drafts, Mickey?

829
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:56,049
You got it, Talia.

830
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,361
- Thanks.
- Hey.

831
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:58,594
Hey.

832
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,820
- Hell of a day.
- Yes.

833
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,531
And I really should've stopped
and talked to that woman

834
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:06,569
instead of brushing her off
with a business card.

835
00:39:06,606 --> 00:39:09,775
I-I was just so focused on
being seen as a man of action

836
00:39:09,812 --> 00:39:12,614
rather than some cop
halfway out to pasture.

837
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:15,773
- You want my advice?
- Please.

838
00:39:15,914 --> 00:39:18,570
Stop trying to be like the other
rookies, 'cause you're not.

839
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:22,023
Jackson is 20 years from
having his first colonoscopy,

840
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,891
and Lucy has never even owned
a pet, let alone raised a kid.

841
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,438
You're a grown man, fully formed.

842
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:29,406
So stop treating it
like it's a liability

843
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:32,344
and treat it like what it is...
a strength.

844
00:39:32,485 --> 00:39:36,388
Sure, you can be annoying,
and you talk way too damn much.

845
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,617
But you also listen.

846
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,863
To people's troubles,
to their complaints,

847
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,868
and that type of empathy
can't be taught.

848
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,844
Only earned.

849
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,031
So if you really want
to make detective,

850
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:53,039
the only way to do it is to be you.

851
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:57,016
So, what you're saying is,

852
00:39:57,364 --> 00:39:59,742
I've got a shot at being detective.

853
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:01,884
Good night, Officer Nolan.

854
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:02,996
Good night, Officer Bishop.

855
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,516
Order's up.

856
00:40:05,756 --> 00:40:08,180
- Hey.
- Hey.

857
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:09,832
I messed up at lunch.

858
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,761
- Sure did.
- Yeah.

859
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,570
You were just being kind, and I
hit on you, and I apologize.

860
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:18,183
It's just... you were there
when Vestri died.

861
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,321
The guy had three bullets in
him, and all he cared about

862
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:22,594
was helping you drag my ass to cover.

863
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:25,322
And I'll never know if
the stress of him doing that

864
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,542
is what pushed that bullet

865
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:28,477
the last quarter-inch into his heart.

866
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,180
He did that because
you were in trouble,

867
00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:33,234
and he was your partner.

868
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:36,127
And it's only natural for you
to need to connect

869
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:39,055
with someone who shared
a tragedy like that.

870
00:40:40,025 --> 00:40:41,793
So you forgive me?

871
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:46,100
I mean, I don't blame you
for being attracted to me.

872
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:51,906
Okay. So it's like that?

873
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:56,438
If you ever need to talk, I'm here.

874
00:40:57,016 --> 00:40:59,000
No strings attached.

875
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:01,216
- Look at you...
- Order's up.

876
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,273
...saving my ass one more time.

877
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:06,003
What can I say? I'm a giver.

878
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:12,445
Sucks you didn't get
a crack at your father's record.

879
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:13,983
Well, it doesn't matter.

880
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,500
Yeah, breaking records
and making the most arrests...

881
00:41:16,563 --> 00:41:18,430
not why I became a cop.

882
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,061
You?

883
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,969
Me? I'm in it for the wool pants.

884
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:23,305
Okay.

885
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:25,977
Now it is time for our "to me" toast.

886
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:29,742
To me, no longer being crushed
by my father's shadow.

887
00:41:30,273 --> 00:41:34,070
To me, not having to apply to be
a mall cop in the morning.

888
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:36,258
To me...

889
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:38,247
Honestly, guys, I got nothing.

890
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:39,938
Unlike you, I had a perfect day.

891
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,717
Cheers.

892
00:41:44,154 --> 00:41:45,921
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

893
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:47,313
All right, now, if you'll excuse me,

894
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,317
I got something I gotta do.

895
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:52,023
Before I leave, Officer Bradford,

896
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,629
I just wanted to give you this.

897
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:56,265
It's my evaluation of you.

898
00:41:56,477 --> 00:41:58,023
That's not how it works, Boot.

899
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,659
Yeah, well, if you don't want
to read it, don't.

900
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,242
You gonna open it?

901
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,568
Hey, uh, get your stuff
together. We got to go.

902
00:42:09,641 --> 00:42:10,961
- We got to go. Let's go, let's go.
- What?

903
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:12,314
Come on.

904
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,817
What is it?

905
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:16,152
Their bar tab.

906
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,922
That little...

907
