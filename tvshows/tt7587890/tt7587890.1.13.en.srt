1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,007
You didn't nap, did you?

2
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:11,376
I didn't have time.

3
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:13,265
I've got to find a new place to live.

4
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,484
No excuse, Boot.

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:16,487
Napping is the key to Midnight Shift.

6
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,008
No shorter than 20 minutes.
No longer than 40.

7
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:20,555
But, hey, if you're
comfortable ignoring

8
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,773
my institutional wisdom...

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,143
I'm getting evicted.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,313
- And whose fault is that?
- Not mine.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,426
They're turning my building
into condos.

12
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:28,828
That's what happens when you gentrify

13
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:30,735
a working-class neighborhood.

14
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:42,274
What the hell is that?

15
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:43,743
What?

16
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:45,304
That.

17
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,621
There was a guy standing there
with a mask on.

18
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:54,186
He was like seven feet tall.

19
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,435
Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:59,835
I saw him. He was right there.

21
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,188
Boot, if you make me

22
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:02,568
get out of this car

23
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,872
for a hallucination...

24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,679
What...

25
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,817
God, he was right here.

26
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,548
Make-believe time is over.

27
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,536
Stop! Police!

28
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,970
Tim?

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,150
Step out.

30
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,804
Step out!

31
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,978
Hands where I can see them.

32
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,413
Peel the mask off slowly.

33
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:31,337
Slowly.

34
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:43,060
Welcome to Midnight, Officer Chen.

35
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,062
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:51,935
No. No.

37
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,337
Hey. Happy to be back on days?

38
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:06,611
God, yes.

39
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,486
I don't know if you heard,
but it was...

40
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,935
- Tim had shirts made.
- Of course he did.

41
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,425
Well, you know, just wait
until it's your turn,

42
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,970
Officer<i> In Bed By Ten.</i>

43
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,940
What can I say: I'm a morning person.

44
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:20,531
Mm-hmm.

45
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,636
- Good morning.
- You're here bright and early.

46
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:26,220
Hey, if you're not early, you're late.

47
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:27,571
That's a stupid saying.

48
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,272
- What's her problem?
- Uh...

49
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:30,597
I wore mine in too!

50
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:31,900
It's not the t-shirt...

51
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,069
although, it is annoying.

52
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,564
I can't find a place to live.

53
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,931
You could always move back home.

54
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,446
No, I really can't.

55
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,657
Or you can bunk up with Nolan.

56
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,481
- He lives in a mansion.
- Hey, it's not a mansion.

57
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:43,064
It's a guest house of a mansion.

58
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,490
But you're welcome to crash
on the couch if you need to.

59
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:48,626
Yeah, thanks. But I am
determined to find a nice,

60
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:51,572
clean, affordable place to live,
even if it kills me.

61
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,363
It's not a mansion.

62
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:03,915
Oh, no, Officer Nolan.

63
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:06,314
You will be leading
roll call this morning.

64
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,883
Sir?

65
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,579
I didn't stutter. Get up there.

66
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:23,124
- What now?
- The clipboard.

67
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,375
Uh, "Memo to all divisions
from the Chief of Police."

68
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:30,551
"Complaints about police officer
entitlement have risen sharply"

69
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:33,895
"during the last few months..." Sir?

70
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:37,120
Do you know what that means?
Police officer entitlement?

71
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:40,067
I assume it has to do with
unauthorized perks.

72
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:41,754
Free food, things of that nature.

73
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,629
And what is LAPD's policy
on gratuities?

74
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:51,676
No officer shall receive
any gratuity, gift, favor,

75
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:54,067
or promise thereof,
as it may result in,

76
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:57,224
or be perceived as, payment
in exchange for influence,

77
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,897
bias, or direction of
an investigation or enforcement

78
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,562
of punishable offenses.

79
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:04,871
Nicely done.

80
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:10,004
Chen, West, will you please join
Officer Nolan up front?

81
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:19,168
Have your training officers
discussed this policy with you?

82
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:21,331
- Yes, sir.
- And what was your takeaway?

83
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:25,290
- Sir, if I may?
- Oh, sounds like a little CYA.

84
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:27,203
No, sir. Boot and I walk

85
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
the straight and narrow.

86
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,507
But businesses like having cops around.

87
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,259
A half-priced meal
every once in a while

88
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,732
is just community relations.

89
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,595
It doesn't mean we show them
favoritism.

90
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,271
You agree with this, Officer Bishop?

91
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,163
I'm not saying I've never
accepted a free cup of coffee,

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,850
but it's usually the exception,
not the norm.

93
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:45,391
What about you, Officer Nolan?

94
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,225
I got into this job to help people,

95
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:49,240
not to help myself to free stuff.

96
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:51,744
Cute line. It's a bunch of bull, but...

97
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,233
- It's not.
- Really?

98
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,552
Do you pay fair market value for
that beach house you live in?

99
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:00,539
No, sir. But I act as caretaker

100
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,176
for the main house when Ben is away,

101
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:04,801
so technically I am exchanging
services for my rent.

102
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:07,940
And what happens when that
exchange isn't enough?

103
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:10,934
And your buddy gets a ticket,
or... or worse?

104
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,571
Then he'll have to pay for his actions.

105
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,294
Okay.

106
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,403
Favors are a slippery slope, people.

107
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:17,910
And so are freebies.

108
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,312
Look, I like to keep it real in here.

109
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,381
There is the <i>letter</i> of the law
and there is the <i>spirit.</i>

110
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,991
It is your jobs to know the difference.

111
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,647
But make no mistake...

112
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:32,184
as police officers, you have power.

113
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,208
Usually we like to focus on the kind

114
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,199
that you holster on your side,

115
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,194
but the power that lives
within your badge

116
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,327
can be equally as dangerous.

117
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:45,227
That's it. All right, guys.
Be safe out there.

118
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:51,232
<i>7-Adam-19, break-in
at Westside Fertility Clinic.</i>

119
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:53,042
We haven't received a single freebie

120
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,707
since I've been with you, so why
did you defend that to Grey?

121
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:57,487
Because hard rules
like that are stupid.

122
00:06:57,573 --> 00:06:59,415
What we do doesn't exist in a vacuum.

123
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,330
Circumstances dictate actions.

124
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:03,108
Not the other way around.

125
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:06,051
Police. Anyone here?

126
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,883
Yes. We had a break-in.

127
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,132
I can see that.

128
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,457
There's been a rash of burglaries
in the neighborhood recently.

129
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,848
Mostly addicts looking
for stuff to sell.

130
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:17,778
This wasn't an addict.
They took embryos.

131
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,161
That's a new one on me.

132
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,669
Do I write this up as a
burglary or an abduction?

133
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,736
You want to put out 50 Amber alerts?

134
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,433
- It's a burglary.
- Officer,

135
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:28,673
there's a crucial time element here.

136
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,288
Without proper temperature control,

137
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,991
those embryos will be compromised.

138
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,358
Any idea who took them?

139
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,741
They're part of an
ugly custody dispute.

140
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:37,282
A lesbian couple.

141
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,432
The eggs we harvested were
from only one of the women...

142
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:40,753
Marilyn Tenni.

143
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,011
Her ex is suing for custody rights

144
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,462
even though she doesn't have
a biological connection.

145
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,632
Okay, we're gonna need names
and addresses for both women.

146
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,878
Of course. But you should know...

147
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:54,164
when I called Marilyn to tell
her, she got very upset...

148
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,241
said she was gonna kill her.

149
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,355
License and registration, please.

150
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:03,152
- Look, I don't have time for this.
- Look, no one does.

151
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,590
But you blew through
that stop sign, so...

152
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:06,590
Because Prince Charles is going to die.

153
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,578
- Excuse me?
- My dog.

154
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,366
He's a King Charles Cavalier

155
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,108
and he just ate a whole bag
of macadamia nuts.

156
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:13,750
Look, I'm sorry, but I still
have to write you up.

157
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,225
You're kidding.
I'm racing him to the vet.

158
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,621
They have to pump his stomach...
those nuts are toxic for dogs.

159
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,417
Look, I understand, but this
will only take a minute.

160
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,118
- License and registration, please.
- Oh.

161
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,704
If he dies...

162
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:33,499
I hope your dog's okay.
Have a nice day.

163
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,152
Go to hell.

164
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,047
Do you think a ticket was the
best resolution, Officer West?

165
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,813
You heard Sergeant Grey this morning.

166
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,711
We have to remain vigilant.

167
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:48,669
If we let everyone who's in
a rush off the hook,

168
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:51,033
- the city would be undrivable.
- Her dog is dying.

169
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,350
A warning would have been sufficient.

170
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:53,916
Okay, a dog that size would have to eat

171
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:55,713
a pound of nuts to induce Ataxia.

172
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:57,625
She drove through the stop sign
in a school zone.

173
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:58,927
That's a pretty serious infraction.

174
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:00,589
We blow stop signs all the time.

175
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:03,074
And park on lawns. And drive on
the wrong side of the road.

176
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:04,914
Okay, that... that's different.
We're cops.

177
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:06,550
- We only do it when necessary.
- Exactly.

178
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,371
Discretion is an important
part of this job.

179
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:09,918
Even if the outcome is different

180
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,364
than following the letter of the law.

181
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,902
With all due respect,
I was raised differently.

182
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:15,762
A law is a law.

183
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:17,694
I can't believe you took...

184
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,890
Those are mine!

185
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,408
They are not yours! They're mine, too!

186
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:22,374
Give them to me!
Give them to me right now!

187
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,628
Don't you dare hit me again.

188
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,338
- Listen, I said give them to me!
- I'll break these before I give them to you.

189
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:26,669
LAPD. We're coming in.

190
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,471
- Give them to me.
- They're mine too.

191
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,026
- They are not.
- Hey, hey. Put down the weapon.

192
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,373
Those are my embryos. She...
She stole them from the clinic.

193
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,116
No, they are your eggs,

194
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,659
and we had them fertilized by
a sperm donor together.

195
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:38,597
- You remember?
- Yeah, and the judge ruled

196
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,117
that I get to use them.
Do you remember that?

197
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:41,706
Not if they're gone!

198
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:43,956
Officer Chen, secure her.

199
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:46,562
Ma'am, give me the tubes.

200
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,066
- No.
- Please.

201
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:54,257
Those... Those are my last
chance to carry my own baby.

202
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:59,183
Please, don't take that from me.

203
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:01,349
Please.

204
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,351
We were supposed to have kids together.

205
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:09,118
I saw you through
your whole cancer treatment.

206
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:12,155
And then you dump me
for a yoga instructor?

207
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,609
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey.

208
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,228
Listen to me.

209
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:18,720
You're angry, okay?
You have every right to be.

210
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:20,492
But doing this?

211
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,093
It won't put your marriage
back together, okay?

212
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:25,679
Nothing will.

213
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:28,924
But you will come to hate yourself

214
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,266
if you go through with this.

215
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,969
So put the tubes
back in that container.

216
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:47,115
<i>7-Adam-15, respond
to single-car accident.</i>

217
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,617
<i>Fourth Street Overpass.</i>

218
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:50,450
Do you think I'm compromised
living at Ben's house?

219
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,815
Probably.

220
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:53,455
You asked.

221
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,524
Yeah, but I meant what I said
to Sergeant Grey.

222
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,349
If he asked me for a favor, I'd say no.

223
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:59,178
Okay, but why even put yourself
in that position?

224
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:01,458
I-If it were me,
I'd have to pay my own way.

225
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,760
Like a grown-up.

226
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:04,695
Driver okay?

227
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,300
He's been stabbed. Left side.

228
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:08,357
Looks like he passed out, then
hit his head in the crash.

229
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:10,094
- Any ID?
- Not that I can find.

230
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:12,016
Control, I need you to run
the following plates...

231
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:14,607
Five Frank Victor Alpha two seven.

232
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:16,623
<i>Car registered to Matthew Rodriguez.</i>

233
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,219
<i>- Date of birth... 7/7/1990.</i>
- Copy that.

234
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:22,656
Send another unit to our
location for an accident report.

235
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:25,303
It appears Mr. Rodriguez has
been the victim of an assault.

236
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,920
We're accompanying RA to the hospital.

237
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,951
- We'll follow you.
- Got it.

238
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:31,146
That guy didn't get stabbed
driving alone.

239
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,484
So either it happened
before he got in the car,

240
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:36,178
or his attacker bolted
after the accident.

241
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,240
I've got to admit...

242
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,881
I thought there'd be more
mysteries on this job.

243
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,252
Be happy there aren't.

244
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:43,622
The unknown is a pain in the butt.

245
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,271
Sure, but still, every once in a while

246
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,107
you want a puzzle to solve.

247
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:53,513
- Aah!
- 7-Adam-15, suspect...

248
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,267
uh, victim... on foot.

249
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:57,571
Fourth and Cesar Chavez. Southbound.

250
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:09,461
Okay... now I really want
to know what happened.

251
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:16,868
So our vehicle is registered
to Matthew Rodriguez,

252
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,974
but our stabbing victim is <i>not</i>

253
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:21,017
- Matthew Rodriguez.
- Hmm.

254
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:24,501
Looks like Mr. Rodriguez has
a rap sheet with gang orders.

255
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,716
- You know what those are?
- It means a judge ordered him

256
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,827
not to associate with gang
members, wear their colors,

257
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:29,864
or go to their neighborhood.

258
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,406
Odds are a guy like that is connected

259
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:32,849
to our John Doe stabbing.

260
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,411
I thought officers
were supposed to avoid

261
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:36,279
- making assumptions.
- There's a big difference

262
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:38,727
between making an assumption
and a likely scenario.

263
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,318
Which is? Oh, let me guess.

264
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,519
When it comes from you,
it's a likely scenario.

265
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:44,831
There's hope for you yet,
Officer Nolan.

266
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:47,390
Now let's pay Mr. Rodriguez a visit,

267
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:50,259
and see if he can shine some
light on our stabbing victim.

268
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:53,071
<i>7-Adam-07, respond to
a false-imprisonment call.</i>

269
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:54,641
<i>974 Ocampo Street.</i>

270
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,030
Hi. Are you the manager?

271
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,327
- Hey, get me out of here!
- Yes. Hi.

272
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:59,280
Sir, we received a call
that one of your customers

273
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,537
is being held against their will.

274
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:02,472
He's not a customer.
He's a scam artist.

275
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:03,815
- Excuse me?
- This guy,

276
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,710
sets up first dates with women,

277
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:08,172
runs up the bill, and then
sneaks out the back door.

278
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,250
He's been doing it at restaurants
all over the neighborhood.

279
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:11,819
He tried to do it to
that poor woman over there,

280
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:13,314
but one of our kitchen staff caught him

281
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:15,176
and locked his ass
in the walk-in fridge.

282
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,425
Give us a minute.

283
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,178
Seems like you're having
a pretty bad day.

284
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:26,758
Tinder is like the clearance
rack at an outlet store.

285
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,405
Dating apps are all bad.

286
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:31,571
He ordered a $500 bottle
of wine for lunch.

287
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,806
And then the charcuterie board.

288
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:36,743
And a cheese plate.
And that steak Au poivre.

289
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:40,847
And the bill is $680.

290
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,403
I don't know how I'm
gonna cover my rent this month.

291
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:45,712
Did you already order dessert?

292
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,306
- No.
- Go ahead and get something.

293
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,491
- Maybe two things.
- Why?

294
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:53,567
Look, I know what you're doing.

295
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:55,493
She bumps up the bill to $700,

296
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,798
we can charge her date with a felony.

297
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,055
Very good, Officer West.

298
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,769
It's not our job to put
our thumb on the scale

299
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:00,860
and change the outcome here.

300
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:03,229
Are you lecturing me
on police work, Boot?

301
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,471
- No. But it's still s...
- But nothing.

302
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:07,417
Go hook up our dine-and-dasher.

303
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,179
Definitely get the crème brûlée.

304
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,120
Best crème brûlée in the city.

305
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:21,006
Seriously?
You're totally fine with this?

306
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,521
Susan isn't stuck paying the bill

307
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,390
since the owners
can write it off as theft.

308
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:25,858
The only person paying for the crime

309
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:27,313
is this jerk who committed it.

310
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,802
That's the spirit of law.
Now take a bite.

311
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,167
No, I don't... I don't want it.

312
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,965
Come on, get off your high horse
and try a little.

313
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,335
No. Uh... I think it's...

314
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,636
- Just...
- Mnh-mnh.

315
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,338
Just a little bite.

316
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:45,602
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm. Told you.

317
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:49,331
Matthew Rodriguez, police. Open up.

318
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,115
Nolan.

319
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,069
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,894
Well, I guess now we know
who stabbed our John Doe.

321
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,996
- You sound disappointed.
- No, I just thought

322
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:07,359
it might be a little less...
cut and dry.

323
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,046
Well, believe me... cut and dry
is a lot less paperwork.

324
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,218
7-Adam-15, we need a homicide
unit at 4495 Barrington.

325
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:16,891
Our John Doe is now a murder suspect.

326
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,504
You're not done yet?

327
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,461
At this stage in training,
you should've knocked that out

328
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:27,184
in two minutes. What's the problem?

329
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:29,446
I'm... I'm not sure how to write it.

330
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,548
It's a simple grand-theft report.

331
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,651
It's not simple, all right?
We made that case a felony.

332
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,444
Something that should've
been a citation,

333
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,413
we turned into a weekend in jail.

334
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,105
And you want me to lie on the report.

335
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,062
I seem to remember writing
a report about you...

336
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,364
second day on the job...

337
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:50,800
"bent the truth" about your
cowardice in the line of fire.

338
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,763
Ringing a bell?

339
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:55,705
Yeah. And I'm grateful.

340
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,509
- You know that. But I'm not...
- But what, Boot?

341
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,932
More than any other rookie,
you should know the difference

342
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:02,803
between the spirit and the letter.

343
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:05,181
Unless you don't think
it applies to you.

344
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,383
Are you the exception, Officer West?

345
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,597
No, ma'am.

346
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,555
Yet, here you are,
acting holier than thou.

347
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:15,058
Tell me something...
do you carry a push knife?

348
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,748
One of those fight-for-your-life,

349
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,913
"last-resort,"
do-or-die kind of knives?

350
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,174
You know that I do. I mean,
my... my dad gave it to me.

351
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,646
Oh, right. Your father.

352
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:29,439
Who all but walks on water...
only this knife is illegal.

353
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:31,575
Yeah, right. I mean, half
the department carry these.

354
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:35,078
Penal Code section 12-0-20.
At the very bottom.

355
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:37,580
Technically it's a dagger.

356
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:39,974
Look it up if you don't believe me.

357
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:45,521
Look, if it's true, then
I just won't carry one anymore.

358
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,257
That is the wrong lesson to learn here.

359
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,516
You're in for a hard fall if
you can't see the difference

360
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:52,394
between righteous and rigid.

361
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:55,743
And if that wasn't the first
thing your father taught you,

362
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:57,437
he failed you.

363
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:02,634
Now fill out the damn report,
we've got to get back out there.

364
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,376
It doesn't seem right
to lock up Marilyn, too.

365
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:08,964
She was only trying
to protect her embryos.

366
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,613
Nothing we can do.
She committed assault.

367
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,482
Domestic-violence laws
are strict for a reason.

368
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:16,384
What happened to
"circumstances dictate actions"?

369
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,920
Trust me, this is one rule I'm all for.

370
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,322
Cemeteries are filled with
women who'd still be alive

371
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,124
if cops had been forced
to hook up their spouses

372
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:23,659
the second he or she laid hands.

373
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:26,895
That is a very enlightened attitude.

374
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:28,466
You seem surprised.

375
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,469
Sir, you surprise me every day.

376
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:32,761
Uh-huh. Go gas up the shop.

377
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,639
- Hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

378
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:38,849
Yeah, it's been an interesting
morning. How about you?

379
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,554
Same. I found a dead body
at the Langston on Wilshire.

380
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:43,521
- How was it?
- Uh, gruesome.

381
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:45,147
Guy took a bullet right to his, uh...

382
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:46,948
Oh, wait. Not the body. The apartment.

383
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:49,558
Oh... uh, it was nice.

384
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,957
Surprisingly upscale for a gang member.

385
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:53,921
Are you asking for you?

386
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:56,358
Well, the building needs to
disclose if someone was killed

387
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:59,308
in the apartment, so it might
mean a break in rent.

388
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:01,238
Yeah, just a bit of a questionable way

389
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,747
to find a place to live, no?

390
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah, well, traditional clearly
isn't working out, so...

391
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,050
Let's go, Boot.
Captain wants to see us.

392
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:13,207
That should hold you
until you get to the hospital.

393
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,509
- Captain.
- What's going on?

394
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,106
That's our murder suspect.

395
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:20,691
He's not a suspect, Officer Nolan.

396
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,349
He's an undercover narcotics detective.

397
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:23,947
Robert Ortiz.

398
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:26,132
I'm sorry about the ambulance thing.

399
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:33,765
I've been undercover inside
La Eme for almost a year.

400
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,015
Working my way closer to
the offshoot in Boyle Heights

401
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:37,218
called<i> Ocampo Loco.</i>

402
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:39,622
They control the cash flow
and then bundle the drug money

403
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:40,943
and ship it back to Mexico.

404
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,292
How much money are we talking?

405
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:44,363
Right now, at least a million.

406
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,278
The word is they're gonna
ship it tonight.

407
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:48,224
I was about to report it
when my cover was blown

408
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,565
by, uh, Matthew Rodriguez,
who tried to kill me,

409
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:52,468
so I shot him in self-defense.

410
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,061
Uh, you know the rest.

411
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,841
Officer Ortiz has bravely
volunteered to go back in

412
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,516
to protect his cover and set up
our tactical operation.

413
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:02,354
Last time I was at the house,
it was four<i> halcones</i>

414
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,391
guarding the money. Heavy-hitters.

415
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:05,727
We're gonna gear up heavy,

416
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:07,485
position ourselves down the street,

417
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:09,631
be ready to initiate a full-blown raid

418
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:11,702
on the house once Ortiz
gives us the signal.

419
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:15,561
Rookies, this is your first
high-level tactical operation.

420
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,534
Let's be prepared.

421
00:19:18,053 --> 00:19:19,428
Did you read the search warrant?

422
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,851
Yes, ma'am. 8531 Winchester Boulevard.

423
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,429
Residence is a 1800s Victorian

424
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,021
with five bedrooms and two bathrooms.

425
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:26,747
- And a guest house.
- Front door?

426
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:29,238
Solid oak with a copper handle
on the right side.

427
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,142
You know the specs of this
equipment, Officer Chen?

428
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:35,968
That's a Blackhawk Dynamic
Entry Special Op Ram.

429
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,148
- How much does it weigh?
- 60 pounds, sir.

430
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:40,917
Hold it tight. You'll be the breacher.

431
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:42,506
You'll buy a round
for every swing it takes

432
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:44,288
to knock that door down.

433
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:46,440
Walk me through a tactical-gear check.

434
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:48,969
Stock zip ties in
the loops of the tac vest.

435
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,577
- And then?
- Secure any loose gear...

436
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:53,559
tac vest, helmet, et cetera.

437
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,408
Finally, secure firearm to thigh rig.

438
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,997
Very good. Any questions?

439
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:00,316
What if I have to pee?

440
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,971
I'll hold it. I'm good.

441
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,218
All units, we're 30 seconds out.

442
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,054
Get ready. Be safe.

443
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:21,307
Officer West, you do the 844.
Stand by to initiate.

444
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:24,504
Ortiz is in.

445
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:25,998
<i>Where the hell you been?</i>

446
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:27,435
<i>Rodriguez was talkin' to the cops.</i>

447
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,131
<i>He tried to stick me
when I called him out.</i>

448
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,453
<i>So I put a bullet in his head.</i>

449
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,593
<i>We got to get out of here.</i>

450
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,870
<i>- He could've given this place up.
- How the hell are we gonna do that?</i>

451
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:35,550
<i>We've got a million in cash
waiting for pick-up.</i>

452
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:37,338
<i>- Pack it up.
- It's too hot to stay here.</i>

453
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:39,225
That's the signal. Initiate.

454
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,434
Police! Open the door!

455
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,005
We have a search warrant.

456
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,703
- Suspect ran into the back.
- Open door to the right.

457
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,440
LAPD!

458
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:14,023
Open door. Get away from that window.

459
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:15,725
Show me your hands.

460
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,315
Step back or I'll shoot.

461
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:20,665
Get down on your knees<i> now.</i>

462
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:22,127
Clear!

463
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,557
- You good?
- Yeah.

464
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,580
Hands up. Fingers behind your head.

465
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:27,987
Do it now. Back up.

466
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:32,219
Hands up! Interlace your
fingertips behind your head.

467
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,118
- You okay?
- Yeah. Barely.

468
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,966
We'll divert to the hospital
on the way out.

469
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,724
Clear! Coming out!

470
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:46,597
Rookies... special assignment.

471
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:47,953
Follow me.

472
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,899
Sorry. Here's what happens now.

473
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,125
You see, the money
counters and the videographer

474
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,475
are on their way.

475
00:21:58,537 --> 00:22:00,910
In the meantime, you three
get to watch the money.

476
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,912
Two people with it at all times.

477
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,280
No selfies.

478
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,537
Enjoy.

479
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,077
Where does all this money go?

480
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,580
Cash seized during drug raids
goes back to Narcotics,

481
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:18,924
where it's used again
for undercover ops.

482
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,931
That's more money than I've
ever seen in one place.

483
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:24,018
Can you imagine?

484
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:28,721
I'd buy a car... no, a helicopter.

485
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:31,306
And learn to fly it so I could
avoid all the traffic.

486
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:34,195
Yeah, that first big purchase
is always tricky, right?

487
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:35,932
The barber in Foxburg?

488
00:22:35,994 --> 00:22:38,428
He won the lottery.
Bought a big, fancy boat.

489
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:41,683
Ran it aground in Freeport,
coked to the gills.

490
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:43,190
I don't think a boat is a good idea.

491
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,193
What about you?
What would you spend it on?

492
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,944
I'm not playing that game.
This is drug money.

493
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:49,405
Come on. We're just talking.

494
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:52,209
A million dollars
lands on your doorstep.

495
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,575
What do you do? Go.

496
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:56,213
And don't say you'd set aside
30% for taxes.

497
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,233
Um... A new car, I guess.

498
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,906
Um, or maybe a trip.

499
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:03,592
Been wanting to do a little traveling.

500
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:05,030
Let me guess.

501
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,676
You'd visit police departments
all around the world.

502
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,457
Learn their techniques.

503
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:10,895
No.

504
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:18,396
I'd pay all of Henry's
tuition with the money.

505
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:19,933
Just so he didn't have
those student loans

506
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,338
- hanging over his head.
- Yeah, they're no fun.

507
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:25,894
I'll be paying mine off until I'm 60.

508
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:28,566
Yeah, well, with this money,
you could pay them all off

509
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:31,517
and still rent an amazing place
by the ocean.

510
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:33,603
Meanwhile, I couldn't afford
to buy the room

511
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,931
in the house I'm living in.

512
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,528
Bet it would have got you
something pretty nice

513
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,032
- back in Foxburg, though.
- Hmm.

514
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,791
Biggest house in town and then some.

515
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:43,134
Still can't get used to the cost
of living in Los Angeles.

516
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,473
It's like you have to add
an extra zero to everything.

517
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,585
You know, I never really thought
about money growing up.

518
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,717
We always just had enough, you know?

519
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:52,363
Yeah. That's what I thought

520
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:55,923
until my parents went bankrupt
when I was nine.

521
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:57,758
It took a couple of really bad years

522
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:59,426
before we got back up on our feet.

523
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:01,049
Ah, been there.

524
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:02,878
Definitely been days

525
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:04,748
where I would have killed
to be sitting across

526
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:07,753
from this much money,
there for the taking.

527
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:09,848
Hey, don't even joke about that.

528
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:11,939
I've heard too many stories
from my dad about cops

529
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:13,420
who started filling their pockets,

530
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:15,634
convincing themselves that
it was a victimless crime,

531
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,242
that they were entitled to a little

532
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,117
extra compensation for their troubles.

533
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:20,660
Okay. Well, relax.

534
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:21,802
That's not us.

535
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,359
Yeah, that's what they
thought at first, too.

536
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,062
But then you take a bite
of the crème brûlée,

537
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:27,212
and the next thing you know,
you're doing three to five

538
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:28,500
for felony theft.

539
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:30,815
I'm sorry. Crème brûlée?

540
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,354
- Never mind.
- Oh, man.

541
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:34,959
- What?
- I just...

542
00:24:34,996 --> 00:24:37,235
I still have to pee, but all this...

543
00:24:38,466 --> 00:24:40,890
I'll be right back.

544
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:45,497
- All done?
- Just finished.

545
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:46,605
Bad guys on the way to jail,

546
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:47,958
Ortiz on his way to the hospital.

547
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:49,667
- So we're headed out.
- You're not waiting for us?

548
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:51,669
Nope. But we're leaving a shop behind.

549
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:54,040
Remember... shift starts
tomorrow at noon,

550
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:55,908
but you want to get in early
to do tonight's paperwork.

551
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,884
Copy that. Are the money
counters gonna get here soon?

552
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,538
I'd get comfortable if I were you.

553
00:25:00,602 --> 00:25:02,754
Those guys work at their own pace.

554
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,778
Copy that. Oh, where's the...

555
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:15,294
I'd still do the job.

556
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:18,163
Even if I came into money.

557
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,491
That's not a shock.

558
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:23,974
You know, I would, too.

559
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,197
You've known what you
wanted to do since birth,

560
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,301
but I just figured out.

561
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,973
There's no way I would bail now.

562
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:33,030
What about you?

563
00:25:33,718 --> 00:25:36,775
Having money makes things
easier, not better.

564
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:38,840
That's not an answer.

565
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:40,627
Would you quit the job?

566
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,431
And pass up on being hazed
on a daily basis

567
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:45,201
by training officers
ten years my junior?

568
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:46,831
Come on.

569
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:56,619
All right.

570
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:59,267
Officers Graser and Williams
arriving on the scene.

571
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,670
13:17 a.m. relieving three
uniformed officers.

572
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:04,385
- What are your names?
- Nolan, Chen, West.

573
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:05,908
Anyone else that's come in or out?

574
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:07,512
- No, ma'am.
- Great.

575
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:10,787
Hit the road. We got it from here.

576
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,663
You coming?

577
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:19,998
We might never see
this much money again.

578
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:23,069
If there's ever another raid
and they need someone to sit

579
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:26,542
and wait until the wee hours,
I have a feeling it will be us.

580
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:34,252
Nolan, wake up!

581
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,043
Nolan!

582
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:37,858
Nolan!

583
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:48,924
Did I oversleep? Shift starts at noon.

584
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,351
Captain called me
to bring you in early.

585
00:26:50,388 --> 00:26:51,754
- Why?
- She didn't say.

586
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,538
- That sounds bad.
- It's not good.

587
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:55,648
- Do I have time to...
- Get dressed.

588
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,281
What's going on?

589
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:02,568
They told us to gather
our Boots, same as you.

590
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,023
We have a situation.

591
00:27:05,356 --> 00:27:08,671
Money counters are telling us
that we're missing $250,000.

592
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,531
And you three were the only ones
left alone with the money.

593
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:20,096
Well, the money counters
must have made a mistake.

594
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:23,015
There's video of them entering
the garage and relieving you.

595
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,783
And then they counted the money

596
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,202
and got $750,000, and not a million.

597
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,420
Let me remind you, an officer
was recently convicted

598
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:31,190
of third-degree official misconduct

599
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:33,101
for taking $70 from a crime scene.

600
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,070
He's serving two years behind bars.

601
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,433
What do you think would happen to a cop

602
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:37,847
who steals a quarter-million dollars?

603
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:39,056
But we didn't take it.

604
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:41,657
Uh, maybe the assumption was wrong.

605
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,026
Maybe it was always $750,000.

606
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,608
That's not what the Intel shows.

607
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:46,210
Guy's on the wire
saying it's a million.

608
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:48,312
Okay, well, we can all
vouch for each other.

609
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:49,822
- I mean...
- Not good enough.

610
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,316
The only thing that will clear
you is passing a polygraph.

611
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,618
Now, I can't, by law,
make you take one.

612
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,420
It would have to be strictly voluntary.

613
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,614
- What if we decline?
- It's grounds for suspension,

614
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:00,151
pending an investigation,

615
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:02,151
and possibly could lead
to your termination.

616
00:28:02,188 --> 00:28:06,671
Well, that's...
not much of a choice, but...

617
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,980
- Yeah, we'll do it.
- Okay. Let's go.

618
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:13,214
- What, now?
- Now.

619
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:22,723
You think one of them
really could have done it?

620
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,843
Not by themselves.

621
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,356
Nolan came back into the
house to use the bathroom.

622
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:29,170
One of the other two could have
hidden some of the money then.

623
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,085
Came back, picked it up later.

624
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:32,513
There's no way West participated.

625
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,622
- That kid is squeaky clean.
- Well, if it was Chen,

626
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,326
- she wouldn't get caught like this.
- Sounds like a compliment.

627
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,162
I'm just saying
she's smarter than that.

628
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:40,800
It doesn't matter if
they did it or not.

629
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:42,873
If they don't walk out of there
with a flawless polygraph,

630
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,471
they're done.

631
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:50,338
What am I sitting on?

632
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:53,026
A pressure pad that registers

633
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:54,977
if you attempt to try
to cheat the polygraph

634
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:56,979
by clenching your buttocks.

635
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,499
Well, that can't be a real thing.

636
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:02,851
- You just clenched.
- Really?

637
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:04,679
What am I doing now?

638
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,791
Officer West,
you seem... uncomfortable.

639
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:10,717
Is there something you'd
like to get off your chest

640
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:13,976
- before we begin?
- Yes.

641
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:17,399
I, um... I had a bite
of crème brûlée, okay?

642
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,215
And, yes, it was delicious.

643
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,865
Like, I-I-I know it was wrong,

644
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:22,683
but now that taste is in my mouth.

645
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,873
That sweet flavor
of corruption is just...

646
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:29,376
but I want to let you guys know
that I've learned my lesson.

647
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:31,382
And it will never happen again.

648
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:36,348
Okay. Let's begin with a few
control questions.

649
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:38,385
Answer with a simple yes or no.

650
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:41,081
- Is your name Jonathan Nolan?
- Yes.

651
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:45,727
Do you live at 7214 and 1/2
Alvarado Street, apartment F?

652
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,362
- For the moment.
- A simple yes or no, Officer.

653
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:50,264
Sorry. Um, yes.

654
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:51,733
Are your eyes brown?

655
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:54,119
Um, well, m-my mom always says

656
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:56,957
they're more of a dark chestnut, but...

657
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,574
- Brown is fine.
- Did you witness anyone taking money?

658
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,543
- No.
- Were you ever alone with the money?

659
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:06,747
Yes, sir. N-No... No, sir. No.

660
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,382
Look, I'm sorry.

661
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,551
These... These wires make me
really nervous, like...

662
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,711
Have you ever lied to
protect another officer?

663
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,296
No.

664
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,794
Let's try that again.

665
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,700
Have you ever
lied to protect a fellow officer?

666
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:26,967
Yes.

667
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:28,568
Regarding the missing money?

668
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,200
No, ma'am.

669
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,797
Why did you tell them
about crème brûlée?

670
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:36,273
I don't know. It came up naturally.

671
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:37,680
They were yes or no questions.

672
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:39,851
How does crème brûlée
come up naturally?

673
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:43,330
Boots, you've all passed
your polygraphs.

674
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,980
But this is far from over. Go home.

675
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:48,642
Detectives will contact you soon
about follow-up interviews.

676
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:50,213
We got to find out what
happened to that money

677
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:51,809
- before you hit the street again.
- Yes, ma'am.

678
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:53,221
Thank you.

679
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,148
Hey.

680
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:57,812
You know what I like to do after
I've been suspected of a felony?

681
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,945
- Uh, drink?
- Damn straight. I got a stocked fridge.

682
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,352
- Anyone want to join?
- I'm down.

683
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:03,062
- Lucy?
- Yeah, it's barely lunch,

684
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:04,742
and I should make use of the time off

685
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,152
and go apartment hunting.

686
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:07,454
You okay?

687
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:09,790
Why would I be?

688
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,077
Hey.

689
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,553
- We all got cleared.
- You're cops.

690
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,598
We supposed to be impressed
you're not criminals?

691
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:22,183
- No... No, sir.
- Part of the job description, really.

692
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:24,583
And you won't be cleared
until the money's found,

693
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,975
but we'll do our best
to try and find it.

694
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,749
You know, Talia's right.

695
00:31:31,812 --> 00:31:33,350
They don't catch who stole that money,

696
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:34,764
cops are gonna think we did it,

697
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:36,186
no matter what the polygraph said.

698
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:37,484
We'll never be trusted again.

699
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,918
Yeah, you're not wrong.

700
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:40,316
So what do we do?

701
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,311
Hey, Lucy.
You're on with me and Jackson.

702
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:47,160
You know, if they don't find
the money, we're screwed.

703
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:48,779
<i>We were just talking about that.</i>

704
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:50,404
<i>I keep going over it in my mind.</i>

705
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,090
The only thing I can think of
is that money was gone

706
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:55,340
long before we ever got to the garage.

707
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:59,148
- What the hell is this guy doing?
<i>- Wait. What?</i>

708
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,709
This black SUV... he's riding my ass.

709
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:05,759
He just hit me!

710
00:32:05,796 --> 00:32:07,940
<i>He looks like he's trying
to run me off the road!</i>

711
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,082
- Where are you?
- Uh,

712
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,878
driving south on Griffith Park Drive.

713
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:13,249
I just passed Mineral Wells Trail.

714
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:19,822
Lucy?

715
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,070
Bishop, Lucy's in trouble.

716
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:43,663
Someone tried to drive her off
the road, Griffith Park Drive.

717
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,475
Jackson and I are on our way there now.

718
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:55,985
Okay, two left.

719
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,862
Clear.

720
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,640
Phone's in the car.

721
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:24,015
Officer needs help,
requesting backup and airship.

722
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:25,787
- Van's clear.
- Griffith Park Drive.

723
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:28,024
Be advised... plain-clothed
officers in pursuit,

724
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,584
heading northwest into the woods.

725
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,337
<i>7-Adam-19, we're five minutes out.</i>

726
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:32,920
<i>Hold until we get there.</i>

727
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:50,866
Which way?

728
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,302
I don't know.

729
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,519
You seeing that?

730
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:57,004
Yeah.

731
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:02,224
- That way.
- You sure?

732
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:03,708
No.

733
00:34:20,002 --> 00:34:22,263
Drop the gun.

734
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:28,809
What do you want?

735
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:30,629
The money you stole.

736
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:34,412
Wait. You're with La Eme?

737
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:36,115
And you're with the LAPD,

738
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:37,596
Officer Lucy Chen,

739
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:41,596
who lives at 7214 and 1/2
Alvarado Street, apartment F.

740
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,855
- How do you know all that?
- Public records.

741
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,237
Addresses, police reports.

742
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:47,885
Damn near everything's on the net.

743
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,722
So I already know that you were
guarding our money.

744
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,877
And 250 G's went missing.

745
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:54,251
And I know you're the cop that took it.

746
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,336
- I-I didn't steal anything.
- No.

747
00:34:57,373 --> 00:34:59,472
Please. We've seen your place.

748
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:01,146
Ran your credit.

749
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:03,489
You need a serious cash infusion.

750
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:07,429
So where's our money?

751
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:10,217
I already told you, I don't have it.

752
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:12,187
Tough girl, huh?

753
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:15,388
Well, everybody's tough at
first, until they're not.

754
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,286
Andres.

755
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:19,905
Cut her up a little.

756
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:29,337
This isn't about the money, chica.

757
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,118
A quarter million is a rounding
error on our gas budget.

758
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:34,436
This is about sending a message.

759
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,035
You can't steal from us.

760
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,776
Even if you carry a badge.

761
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,333
- I saw you.
- What?

762
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,703
Outside the house,
right before we raided it.

763
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,008
You were wearing those boots
and carrying that duffel bag

764
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,477
with the red stripe.

765
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,814
Somebody tipped you off about the raid.

766
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,559
You took the money.

767
00:35:52,676 --> 00:35:54,040
You got in before we hit the place.

768
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:55,723
You thought no one would notice.

769
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,811
Shots fired northwest
from our previous.

770
00:36:06,356 --> 00:36:08,990
Damn it! Aah!

771
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:14,139
You messed it all up.

772
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:22,098
Hey!

773
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,305
Police! Don't move!

774
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:27,734
Aah!

775
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:31,764
Do not move!

776
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,124
Stay on the ground!

777
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:36,883
You got this?

778
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:38,184
I'm going after Lucy.

779
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:43,156
Aah!

780
00:36:50,716 --> 00:36:52,165
- Nice.
- Do you have cuffs?

781
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,282
Yeah. Last pair.

782
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:57,237
What took you so long?

783
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:15,798
Paramedics are taking our
other suspect to Shaw Memorial.

784
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:17,933
Homicide's working
the <i>halcón</i> this one killed.

785
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,533
And the missing $250,000?

786
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,470
Einstein here had it stacked
on his coffee table.

787
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,111
West and Lopez are bringing it in now.

788
00:37:23,148 --> 00:37:24,700
All right. Good work.

789
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,844
- And how are you doing?
- Oh, good. Thank you.

790
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:30,202
I think I might
have twisted my ankle...

791
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:31,960
I meant Officer Chen, Nolan.

792
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:35,525
- That was good work out there.
- Thank you, sir.

793
00:37:35,562 --> 00:37:37,421
I'm just relieved that
we found the missing money.

794
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,557
So I take it we're off
the hook about the cash?

795
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,141
You are.

796
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:42,638
But to be clear,

797
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,507
at no point did anyone actually believe

798
00:37:44,544 --> 00:37:47,695
that three rookies knew how to
smuggle a quarter mil in cash

799
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,165
out of a crime scene.

800
00:37:49,654 --> 00:37:51,587
But good work.

801
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,878
- Hey.
- Hey.

802
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:02,650
Um, look. In case I haven't
said this enough,

803
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:06,255
I, uh... I've been training
to be a cop my whole life.

804
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,116
I walked in here thinking I knew
everything about everything,

805
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,155
and I can only imagine
how annoying that's been.

806
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:13,517
I wouldn't call it annoying.

807
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:16,486
I'd call it... yeah, no,
annoying's about right.

808
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:19,023
Well, I'm sorry.

809
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,631
You're my T.O., not my dad.

810
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,699
I should let you let teach me
how to be a cop.

811
00:38:24,007 --> 00:38:25,735
Even if some of your methods
contradict the things

812
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,689
that he showed me, but...

813
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,345
look, I just hope
that you'll understand

814
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:31,707
if I need to take a moment to adjust.

815
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:33,909
I guess I can give you that.

816
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:35,681
Thank you.

817
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,630
And thanks for not giving up on me.

818
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,040
I wouldn't be here without you, and...

819
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:42,883
I'll never forget that again.

820
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:51,438
This a good time?

821
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,228
Of course. Come in, Captain.

822
00:38:53,454 --> 00:38:55,373
I wanted to see how you were doing.

823
00:38:56,204 --> 00:38:57,728
All-you-can-eat pudding.

824
00:38:57,849 --> 00:38:59,515
The only highlight of
being in a hospital.

825
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,070
Do you want one?

826
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:04,371
Oh, no, no. You enjoy.

827
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:08,109
Hey, uh, I thought you'd like to know.

828
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,564
We recovered the missing
quarter million.

829
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,825
Wow.

830
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,631
That's really good news.

831
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:16,648
Turns out it was gone
before we even showed up.

832
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,954
Gang member Franco DeSantis
took it just before our raid.

833
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:21,890
We pulled his cell records.

834
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:23,586
Turns out there was an incoming call

835
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,956
just before he grabbed the cash
and walked it out the door.

836
00:39:26,628 --> 00:39:28,930
Do you know where that call came from?

837
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:30,819
Mnh-mnh.

838
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:32,321
I have no idea.

839
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,868
The station.

840
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:40,742
And you think I-I-I-I made it.

841
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:42,362
Oh, I know you did.

842
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:45,714
You see, Franco admitted as much.

843
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,481
Tch, tch, tch. Don't.

844
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:51,786
You should enjoy your pudding.

845
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,640
The stuff they give you in prison?

846
00:39:54,677 --> 00:39:56,442
Whew. Not nearly as good.

847
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:04,726
Hey.

848
00:40:04,763 --> 00:40:06,483
- Hey.
- Come in, come in, come in.

849
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,731
Ah!

850
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:11,956
So, this is my new place.
It's great, right?

851
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:15,640
Oh, um, there's a giant
bloodstain on the rug.

852
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:18,961
Which is how I'm getting 25% off
for the first year.

853
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:21,444
Are you sure that's
not because you're a cop?

854
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:24,360
Yeah. He didn't even know
before he cut me the break.

855
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:27,082
Landlord was super eager
to get it all done,

856
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,605
especially because I said
I would take it as is.

857
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,048
As is?

858
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:32,494
Uh, you mean that...

859
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:35,845
Oh, yeah. Which is why you're here.

860
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:38,038
You see, friends...

861
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,356
help friends clean up crime scenes.

862
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:46,326
We'll get<i> Poke</i> after.

863
00:40:46,564 --> 00:40:48,972
- Okay.
- Thank you.

864
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:52,967
So what should we drink to?

865
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,077
To paying your own way.

866
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:57,053
That's strangely specific.

867
00:40:57,116 --> 00:41:00,317
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

868
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:02,639
You really helped me
get back on my feet.

869
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,020
But I'm back on them now,

870
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:07,324
and I can't just keep
living here for free.

871
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:10,591
- I don't need you to pay rent.
<i>- I</i> need me to pay rent,

872
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,363
so what would you list this place for?

873
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,700
Oh. Oof. I don't know. Twelve.

874
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:18,368
Maybe eleven?

875
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:19,968
How about we'll just
call it $10,000 even?

876
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:22,971
A month? I-I-I can't afford that.

877
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:24,309
I'll tell you what.

878
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:26,375
Why don't you pay what you can afford,

879
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:27,998
and we'll call it even?

880
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,845
Thank you. Deal.

881
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:36,385
And I have to tell you...
oh, my God, that's good.

882
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:39,254
But I have to be clear.

883
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:43,325
As a cop, I can't do you any favors.

884
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:45,237
I can't fix a ticket for you.

885
00:41:45,274 --> 00:41:47,896
I-I can't help you out
of any legal jeopardy.

886
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:50,833
I-I just hope you understand.

887
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,602
Totally. And you know what?

888
00:41:52,664 --> 00:41:55,060
I would never come to you
for anything like that.

889
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:57,974
Okay? I'm super tight with
the District Attorney.

890
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,442
- That's not better.
- So...

891
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:03,244
You know this rent that you're
gonna be paying...

892
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:06,113
is it retroactive from
when you moved in?

893
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:08,516
Um. Yes?

894
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:10,794
That's great.

895
