1
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:13,534
Two firearms for two gift cards.

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,620
Thanks for making our
streets a little safer.

3
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,573
So, we're just gonna destroy these?

4
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:19,789
What if one was used in a crime?

5
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:22,392
Hey, "no questions
asked" means just that.

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,738
And it's the best way to get people

7
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,130
to turn in their unregistered weapons.

8
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:26,959
That and the $100 gift cards.

9
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:32,594
Oh. Hang on a second. Sorry.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,934
Let me help you with those.

11
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,427
Oh. Thank you... Officer Nolan.

12
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,129
- Yeah. And you are?
- I'm Alma.

13
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:39,310
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:40,707
Are all these yours?

15
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,201
Oh, no, no. They...
They were my father's.

16
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,618
He was a paratrooper
back in World War II.

17
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:48,968
And when he came back from the war,

18
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:50,636
he brought all this with him.

19
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,295
I've been carrying it with me

20
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,251
since he passed in '74.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,971
Oh, Alma...

22
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:58,650
this is in good condition.

23
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,142
You could get real money for this.

24
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,092
Oh, no. I wouldn't know where to start.

25
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:04,822
Besides, I'm moving in
with my son's family.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,838
I don't want these around my grandkids.

27
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:08,677
Well, we are here to help.

28
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:11,335
Oh, those were his pistols.

29
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:14,746
He brought them from
Germany to San Francisco.

30
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,539
And that one there is Ginny.

31
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,791
Alma, is that a land mine?

32
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:24,370
Yes, a claymore, I think.

33
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,110
From his time in Vietnam.

34
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:28,644
Uh, can we get a bomb squad
to the front lobby? Now.

35
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:30,050
Well, I'm so glad you brought this in,

36
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:31,670
because these are extremely unstable.

37
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,724
Tell you what. I'm gonna
stay here to dispose of this.

38
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:35,754
Officer Chen is gonna get
you to a safe distance,

39
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:37,903
and then we'll get you those
gift cards we talked about.

40
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:40,952
Oh, uh, what about the ones in my trunk?

41
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,334
No, no, no, I'm not upset.

42
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,090
I'm just surprised at
how fast it happened.

43
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:02,940
All right, text me when
you get back to campus.

44
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,814
Love you, too. Bye.

45
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:06,397
- Hey.
- Hey!

46
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:07,942
Oh... oh, I know

47
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,177
I said Sedona had some easy hikes,

48
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,736
but you should at least put on shoes.

49
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:13,198
Sarah just accepted
an offer on the house.

50
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:15,858
That's my girl. Well,
it's a seller's market.

51
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,773
Besides, it's not like
you're going back to Foxburg.

52
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:22,246
Unless the house was your safety net

53
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:24,279
- in case this didn't pan out.
- No.

54
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:25,932
- Okay.
- I just always imagined

55
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:27,986
Henry raising his own
kids there, you know?

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,666
Mark their height on the same doorjamb

57
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,723
and camping in the backyard like we did.

58
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:33,856
Aww. That's sweet, Mr. Cleaver.

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,147
But Henry's 18.

60
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:37,514
Like, the last thing he's thinking about

61
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:38,863
is inheriting your house.

62
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:42,141
He's out there starting a new life.

63
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,858
As are you.

64
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,171
So go get dressed.

65
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,563
We have quite an adventure ahead.

66
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,553
Yes, we do.

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,478
"Mandatory Emergency
Callback for all patrol."

68
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,038
Huh. What does that mean?

69
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,818
It means we're having
<i>different </i>adventures today.

70
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,618
Thank you for
coming in on your day off.

71
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:05,314
The Vice President is making an
unscheduled visit to our city.

72
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,752
So it's all hands on deck.

73
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:09,445
- Agent Danvers.
- Thank you, Captain.

74
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,214
As always, the Secret Service

75
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:12,882
appreciates the LAPD's assistance

76
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,667
in clearing and securing
"Redwood's" route.

77
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,564
These are your Operation Plan Manuals.

78
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,403
Each officer's name has been listed

79
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:22,701
under a specific Quadrant and Zone,

80
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:24,477
along with your responsibilities.

81
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:26,597
Your watch commander
will liaison with me

82
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,598
throughout the day as issues arise.

83
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:30,233
Come on...

84
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:32,591
I'm sorry. Officer West.

85
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,218
Is there something you want
to share with the group?

86
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:37,061
Um, no, sir. Uh...

87
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,441
I'm sorry. I just, uh...

88
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,459
I had plans I needed to cancel.

89
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:43,433
So did everyone here, yet
they're paying attention.

90
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,385
Yes, sir.

91
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,245
These assignments are
your sole priority today.

92
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,359
You will not field calls from dispatch.

93
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,455
Let the day shift deal with that.

94
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,245
Captain?

95
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,571
Most of you know the drill.

96
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:59,365
For our rookies... Today
is going to be ugly.

97
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,101
Everything we do to ensure
the safety of Redwood

98
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,745
will create gridlock.

99
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,623
It's important to be
patient and vigilant.

100
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:08,593
That's all. You're dismissed.

101
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:11,093
Bishop and Nolan.

102
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,459
Agent Danvers has a
special assignment for you.

103
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:18,915
We've got a Class 2 threat
we need chased down.

104
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,267
Class 2?

105
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,765
Class 1 is someone

106
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,426
who's made overt threatening statements

107
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,892
but made no overt action.

108
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,026
Class 2 are individuals

109
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,824
who have a history of
assaultive behaviors

110
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,101
toward authority figures.

111
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,242
And Class 3?

112
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,661
Had agents on their doorsteps

113
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,362
the second we learned of this visit.

114
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,503
Stanley Knott.

115
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,341
Guy's made repeated
threats against the VP

116
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,549
over the last few years.

117
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:38,711
Nothing actionable,

118
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:40,303
but he's got previous assault charges

119
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,171
against a host of supervisors.

120
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,440
I need you to make sure
he's not planning anything.

121
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,401
- Happy to do it, ma'am.
- Great.

122
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:49,923
Call me if you need any assistance.

123
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,695
- "Happy to do it"?
- What?

124
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:54,526
Nothing. I've just never heard
you use that word before.

125
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,352
I don't get all the fuss.

126
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:57,797
It seems like we're
getting a day of overtime

127
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:00,145
just to close roads and hang signs.

128
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:03,002
That's like saying being drawn and
quartered is fun time with horses.

129
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,660
We're literally creating traffic jams

130
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,559
during rush hour on purpose.

131
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,805
Everything we do today is
gonna piss someone off.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,505
- Quadrant One.
- Quadrant Two.

133
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,703
I mean, we deal with
angry people every shift,

134
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:16,379
but a day of OT means I can finally fix

135
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,474
the air-conditioning on my car.

136
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,008
What?

137
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,672
Air-conditioning makes you soft.

138
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,599
You gotta get comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

139
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,736
- That's the job.
- Is he serious?

140
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,014
As a heart attack, Boot. Which...
I gotta say...

141
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,206
you almost gave the watch
commander back there.

142
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,565
Seriously, playing with your phone

143
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,989
during a briefing is a cardinal sin.

144
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:34,724
I-I lost focus.

145
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:36,465
I only hope you were
canceling something important,

146
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,490
because Grey won't
forget that for a while.

147
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,296
Just, uh, breakfast with my mom.

148
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:44,841
- Is that all for us?
- Yep.

149
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,834
Extra road flares for
the uptick in accidents.

150
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,660
Extra ticket books for
the increase in idiots.

151
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:50,866
Extra crime-scene tape
for blocking sidewalks.

152
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:53,493
- And cones for closing roads.
- Okay, okay, I get it.

153
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:55,219
Oh, we're not done yet. Hats and Bats.

154
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,000
Tactical helmets and 42-inch
batons for riot control,

155
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:00,124
along with heavy-duty
vests if things get ugly.

156
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,044
And my personal favorite,

157
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:03,656
the 40-millimeter tear-gas launcher

158
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,285
for when democracy gets real.

159
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,596
But, hey, at least you'll
be able to ride in comfort.

160
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:29,358
Do you think our Class
2 threat is actually a threat?

161
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,180
Maybe.

162
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,717
Maybe writing hate-letters to the Veep

163
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:35,042
is just his way of blowing off steam.

164
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:38,654
Did you just "glass
half-full" our suspect?

165
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,827
Who are you and what have
you done with my T.O.?

166
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,859
Look, I'm trying a much
more positive approach.

167
00:06:44,232 --> 00:06:46,629
But if you'd rather I go back
to yesterday's attitude...

168
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:48,005
Oh, no, no, no, no.

169
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,412
Uh, no one's a bigger
fan of positive than me.

170
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,299
That cannot be right.

171
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,841
- Problem?
- No. Sorry.

172
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,509
My ex is selling our house.

173
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:02,779
I largely stayed out of it

174
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,271
because, honestly, I didn't want her to.

175
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,758
But I just saw the price she's getting.

176
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:07,135
The place has doubled in value.

177
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,255
Mm, that sounds like

178
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,963
a good thing to me, Officer Positive.

179
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,488
N-No, it is. Yes.

180
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,657
I was just thinking about
trying to buy her out, you know,

181
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:15,659
keep it in the family, but...

182
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:17,416
I can't match that price.

183
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,884
There's our guy.

184
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,263
Hey, Stanley.

185
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,918
Can we talk to you for a minute?

186
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,150
- What do you want?
- Haven't you heard?

187
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:25,402
Your friend's in town.

188
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:27,364
What friend? I don't have a friend.

189
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,642
Vice President.

190
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:29,789
So what?

191
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,315
So what's in the bag, Stanley?

192
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,560
- Nothing.
- Show us.

193
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,119
- No.
- We're not asking.

194
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:38,344
We have probable cause
based on your prior actions

195
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,636
and a clear distress.

196
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:50,624
Come on. Hands. Let's go.

197
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,764
- Weapon.
- It's just a flare gun.

198
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,693
I don't need a license.
I looked it up online.

199
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,055
Were you planning on
pointing that flare gun

200
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,781
at the Vice President today, Stanley?

201
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,301
- He needs to be stopped.
- Sounds like a "yes" to me.

202
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,480
You're under arrest, Stanley.

203
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:07,669
Did we just foil a real-life
assassination attempt?

204
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,528
He's a nut with a flare
gun wrapped in underpants.

205
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:10,720
Not Jason Bourne.

206
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,234
But we just might have
prevented a tragedy.

207
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:15,475
Was that so hard?

208
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,793
Whose streets?

209
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:18,528
- Our streets!
- Whose streets?

210
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:19,937
One, two, three!

211
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:21,162
Our streets!

212
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:22,289
No justice.

213
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:23,647
No peace!

214
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:26,903
- No justice.
- No peace!

215
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,064
- No justice.
- No peace!

216
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,294
Officer West, we're about to
walk into a volatile crowd,

217
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,140
- and you're answering your phone?
- Um, no, ma'am.

218
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,107
No, I'm sorry. It's just my mom.

219
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,402
- I never got to call her back earlier.
- Now is not the time

220
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:37,685
for personal calls.

221
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,207
- Of course.
- Okay, folks, you can't be here.

222
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:42,605
There's a designated protest
area across the street,

223
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,929
- behind the barriers.
- We have a right to free speech.

224
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,656
- This is public property.
- It's not.

225
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:47,924
This is the hotel's property,

226
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,575
and blocking the entrance
is a fire hazard.

227
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,407
- No justice!
- No peace!

228
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,565
- No justice.
- No peace!

229
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,895
- You got a dispersal card?
- Yes, ma'am.

230
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,074
- No justice!
- No peace!

231
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:57,363
I am Officer Jackson West.

232
00:08:57,434 --> 00:09:00,212
I hereby declare this to
be an unlawful assembly,

233
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:02,821
and, in the name of the People
of the State of California,

234
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,647
command all those assembled
to <i>immediately </i>disperse.

235
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:08,250
You heard him. Break
it up or go to jail.

236
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,523
Who has a key for the handcuffs?

237
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:14,289
Notify the mobile field force.

238
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:17,339
- Arnold?! What's wrong?
- He's choking.

239
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,981
- Oh, my God, Arnold...
- Miss, give Officer Lopez some space.

240
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,942
All right, listen up.

241
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,187
Until tomorrow at 3:00
p.m., the stretch of Vine

242
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:41,514
between Melrose and
Franklin will be off limits.

243
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,956
Sanitation services will
be arriving in 20 minutes.

244
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:46,058
You'll have until then to pack up.

245
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:48,051
Rope off the block.

246
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:50,251
Make sure everyone moves off.

247
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,094
Sir? Sir?

248
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,364
Sorry to wake you,

249
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,613
but I'm gonna need you to
start packing up, all right?

250
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:06,048
- Bitch, those are my sneakers!
- Get out!

251
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:08,414
Oh, hey! Hey, hey!

252
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,032
Hey! Stop it!

253
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,540
Just stop.

254
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,579
That's enough! Hey. That's enough.

255
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:17,925
- Ow. Ow.
- Hands behind your back.

256
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,137
Don't move.

257
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:21,997
All right. Stand up.

258
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:23,366
Here we go.

259
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,344
- Chen.
- What?

260
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,539
Stop. Don't move.

261
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,870
Chen.

262
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,426
Chen.

263
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,055
Chen.

264
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:49,185
I didn't see it. I mean, it was...

265
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,868
- it was on the ground, and...
- It's okay,

266
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,219
but I need to pull the needle out.

267
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,081
What's the procedure when
an officer is exposed on duty?

268
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:11,794
- What?
- Focus.

269
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:13,829
What do we do now?

270
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,172
Um...

271
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,810
"Collect the evidence."

272
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:20,629
Bring the officer and the
item to the nearest hospital

273
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:24,008
to test for infections and diseases

274
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,501
"that may have been transmitted."

275
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:27,252
And where's the nearest hospital?

276
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,603
Shaw Memorial.

277
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,749
Make sure an officer posts up here

278
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,941
until Veep passes through.

279
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:34,901
- Got it.
- Come on. Let's go.

280
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,007
Hey, Mom, it's me.

281
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:43,699
Um, sorry about this morning.

282
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:46,266
Uh, just call me back, okay? I need t...

283
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,761
Um, just... just call me back, okay?

284
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:52,548
You gonna tell me what's going on?

285
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,853
Nothing. Just family stuff.

286
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,281
I can't believe I have to
wear this bulky vest all day.

287
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:59,972
That's why you always carry an
extra uniform on days like today.

288
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:01,861
Yeah, I know. I, uh... I just...

289
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:03,308
Forgot?

290
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:04,784
Get it together, Officer West.

291
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,956
You can't afford to lose focus out here.

292
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,765
Which side of the
building faces the street?

293
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,279
To the right.

294
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,082
Should we really be penalizing these
people for their civic engagement?

295
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,424
Supreme Court ruled that displaying
anatomically impossible pictures

296
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:24,713
qualifies as obscene,

297
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,876
so hanging erotic banners of the V.P.

298
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:28,525
in 10 windows of an apartment building

299
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,408
definitely isn't protected
by the First Amendment.

300
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:31,964
I'm just saying, the
guy should be flattered.

301
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,599
Police. Open up.

302
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:40,268
What's up?

303
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:41,929
You have an obscene banner
hanging in your window.

304
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,086
It needs to come down.

305
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,501
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

306
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:46,727
My neighbor offered me 100
bucks to put that there.

307
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,102
Well, it's illegal.

308
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,232
No problem.

309
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:50,744
I'll make sure to take care of it.

310
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:53,556
Sir, is there something inside
you don't want us to see?

311
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,146
No.

312
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,596
Step back. Hands where I can see them.

313
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,146
What the hell is this?

314
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:02,788
Sir, how many people live here?

315
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:05,100
- Um... not many.
- Pat him down.

316
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,409
<i>Polícia! Polícia!</i>

317
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,762
So much for the element of surprise.

318
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,253
It's okay. We're not here for them.

319
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:30,789
Go get the banner.

320
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,938
What do you charge these people?

321
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:35,991
$500 a month times 20?

322
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:37,271
That's taking advantage of people

323
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,796
too afraid to call the
police on your ass.

324
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:40,957
Got it. Do we have to call ICE?

325
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:42,424
No, L.A.'s a sanctuary city.

326
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:43,783
Our job is to police the streets,

327
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:44,975
not check status.

328
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:46,885
But we're not letting this go.

329
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,086
Get his driver's license and do an F.I.

330
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,960
We'll be back tomorrow
with code enforcement.

331
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:01,144
Hi. Um, I need to get my blood tested.

332
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:03,178
I got stuck with a
used hypodermic needle.

333
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:06,845
Oh. Uh, yeah, one sec.

334
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:09,639
Um, where did that...

335
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:12,623
If you could fill this out.

336
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:14,691
Have a seat in the waiting room,
and we'll be right with you.

337
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,004
You must be new,

338
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:17,361
because no experienced nurse

339
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,093
lets an armed cop sit with civilians.

340
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,213
What do you think happens if somebody

341
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,333
attempts to grab her weapon?

342
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,277
- I-I-I...
- The hospital protocol dictates

343
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:25,137
that an armed officer
be seen immediately.

344
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:28,231
So set her up in a room
right now and find a doctor.

345
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,503
Yes, sir.

346
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:33,644
Right this way.

347
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:40,046
When do rookies get
a step increase in pay?

348
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,872
Not until you're off probation.

349
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:43,858
- This about the house?
- Yeah.

350
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,266
I'm thinking about buying
it as an investment.

351
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,520
I'm sure Sarah will sell it to me

352
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,368
if I can just... match the offer.

353
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:50,561
It's not an investment
if you can't afford it.

354
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,496
Well, I have some savings.

355
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,470
Maybe Ben will give me a loan.

356
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,233
The only thing worse
than going into debt

357
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:57,893
- is doing it with a friend.
- I get it.

358
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:01,474
It's just I built that
house from the ground up.

359
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:02,806
You know, everything...

360
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:04,836
The tree house in the backyard.

361
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:07,918
My son's whole life was at that place.

362
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,526
Sounds nice.

363
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:12,213
It was.

364
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,510
We never really talk
about where <i>you're </i>from.

365
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,132
Let's just say it didn't
have a tree house.

366
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:20,219
It's a good job on the Class 2.

367
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:22,887
As a reward, you get another assignment.

368
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,312
Look, it's not so special.

369
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,638
Every job is an opportunity, sir.

370
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:29,413
- Is she feeling okay?
- Being positive.

371
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,469
Positive? Good.

372
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:33,304
'Cause I'm assigning
you both to rover duty.

373
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,904
- What's that?
- LAPD version of a Gofer.

374
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:37,234
You'll spend the rest of your shift

375
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:38,825
assisting officers all over the city...

376
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,987
Bringing them food and water,

377
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:41,564
giving them bathroom breaks.

378
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:44,281
Here's a backlog of requests.

379
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:45,748
Get to it.

380
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,926
Well, it's an opportunity

381
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,451
to support our fellow officers.

382
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,133
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

383
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,826
It's starting to freak me out.

384
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,054
Can I help you, officers?

385
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,047
Ma'am, there's an obscene
banner hanging in your window.

386
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:04,639
We need you to remove it.

387
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:06,647
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

388
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:08,205
We know your neighbor paid you.

389
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:11,188
But it's a violation
of Penal Code 415.5.

390
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,817
We can arrest you for having it up.

391
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:15,329
- I need that money.
- Ma'am, it's only $100.

392
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:16,767
Only?!

393
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:20,080
Have you ever been broke, Officer?

394
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:22,286
Because I'm on the edge
of living on the street.

395
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,880
And that $100 is the difference

396
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,665
between me being able to
pay my rent this month

397
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,793
and getting evicted.

398
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:28,341
Look, ma'am, I'm very
sorry to hear that,

399
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,367
but, um, you have to
take the banner down.

400
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,989
But we just became aware
of major code violations

401
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:38,604
in one of these apartments.

402
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,791
I see no reason why forgiving
your rent for a few months

403
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,982
couldn't be part of the
building owner's penalty.

404
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:44,781
Really?

405
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:46,035
Really.

406
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:47,885
Now go take down that banner.

407
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,440
Officers.

408
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,156
Let us know if you need anything else.

409
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:02,159
So, what's with the positive attitude?

410
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,804
- Do I need a reason?
- No.

411
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:05,510
It's just after four months together,

412
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,880
it's the first day
you've rolled in with it.

413
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:08,571
I figured something must be up.

414
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,807
That can't be good.

415
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:14,034
- How the hell did you not see me?!
- You cut in front of me!

416
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:15,274
You wouldn't let me in!

417
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,414
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

418
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,568
Learn how to drive, man!

419
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:18,695
Whoa. Hey, man, I...

420
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,996
Gun!

421
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:21,170
I'm sorry.

422
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:23,612
Drop the gun!

423
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:25,805
Put the gun on the ground right now.

424
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:28,999
Hands behind your head.
Interlace your fingers.

425
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:30,702
Do not move.

426
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:33,036
I-I was just trying to scare him.

427
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,788
- Nolan!
- Over here. With me. Come on.

428
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,310
Control, 7-Adam-15. We
have a gunshot victim...

429
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:44,177
female, adult, shotgun
wound to the chest.

430
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:45,870
We need fire and ambulance. ETA?

431
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:47,611
<i>7-Adam-15, at least 10 minutes.</i>

432
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,270
Okay, help me get her out of the car.

433
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:50,517
We need to stop the bleeding.

434
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,511
Come on. I got you. I got you. Come on.

435
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:55,446
- Got that?
- Uh-huh.

436
00:17:57,548 --> 00:17:58,723
I didn't mean to hurt her!

437
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,550
Shut up! Look away.

438
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,475
All right, stay with us.

439
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,903
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

440
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:05,001
It's a chest wound.

441
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:06,130
It sounds like her lung's collapsed.

442
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:07,501
Put pressure on it.

443
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:08,769
We're gonna need to put
something in the wound...

444
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,247
keep her alive till EMTs get here.

445
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:13,401
- Officer Bishop.
- Get the kit bag...

446
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,621
There's gotta be something
in there we can use.

447
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:15,913
Talia.

448
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,195
She's gone.

449
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,669
- You okay?
- What do you think?

450
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,966
Sorry. It was a dumb question.

451
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:51,195
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.

452
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,931
My therapist is trying to
get me to be more positive.

453
00:18:57,214 --> 00:18:59,081
You asked why I was
acting differently today.

454
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,983
No, I just... I didn't know you went.

455
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:04,353
- No reason you should.
- 'Cause the job frowns on it?

456
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,697
'Cause it's nobody's business.

457
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:08,936
But, yeah...

458
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,094
it is looked at as a weakness
amongst the boys in blue.

459
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,889
Well, that's stupid.

460
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,098
Lot of stressful stuff we deal with,

461
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,465
what we just went through,

462
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,648
it's unhealthy not to talk about it.

463
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:22,595
Does that mean you see someone?

464
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,041
Sarah and I used to go
to couples' counseling.

465
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,376
And I used to look down on it...

466
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:28,988
thought it was like paying
someone to be your friend,

467
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:30,138
but I was wrong.

468
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,999
It was helpful.

469
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,502
Just, in our case, not helpful enough.

470
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,610
So, what, you think less of me now?

471
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,628
No. The opposite.

472
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:46,364
I think anyone brave enough to
confront their problems head-on

473
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:47,820
deserves respect.

474
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:58,196
She's all set.

475
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,858
We're gonna put a rush on the tests.

476
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:02,360
We should have results in a few hours.

477
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,360
I'm sorry about earlier. I...

478
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:06,789
I didn't know.

479
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:08,259
It's okay.

480
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,802
Thanks.

481
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,026
Falling down the WebMD rabbit hole

482
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:24,534
isn't gonna change your results.

483
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:27,069
HIV is three times more prevalent

484
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,289
in the homeless community

485
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,976
than it is in the general population.

486
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:31,729
Hepatitis is five
times more prevalent...

487
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,476
And cows kill more people
a year than sharks.

488
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:35,302
- The facts are whatever you make them.
- What...

489
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,179
What if I get hep C from this needle,

490
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:38,442
and one day I get shot,

491
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:39,948
and you're trying to stop the bleeding

492
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,600
and you forget that,
you know, you have a...

493
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,259
you have a cut on your hand? Or worse...

494
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,085
a kid gets shot and <i>I</i>
the one with the cut?

495
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,348
- And it's just...
- Then you'll be a cop

496
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:48,155
with hep C and a cut.

497
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:51,580
You signed up to put
your life on the line.

498
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:53,424
That means your health, too.

499
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,546
Focusing on fear

500
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:57,233
isn't gonna change the outcome.

501
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,819
Lab results are gonna take hours.

502
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:06,050
Do you want to hang out in the
worst-case-scenario panic room,

503
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,843
or you want to get back to work?

504
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,328
Get that air-conditioning fixed?

505
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,506
I thought air-conditioning made me soft.

506
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,427
Well, it does, but I can't
solve all your problems today.

507
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:21,600
Go splash some water on your face.

508
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:23,554
Let's get back out there.

509
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:25,561
Okay.

510
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,586
Just this apartment and we're done.

511
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:46,716
Can we kick it down?

512
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:48,781
We have legal right.

513
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:50,359
Let's check with the neighbor first.

514
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:02,865
Guess we're kicking it.

515
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:05,466
Wait. Do you hear that?

516
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:08,171
Ma'am?

517
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:11,427
Ma'am, I'm Officer Angela Lopez.
I'm with the LAPD.

518
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:12,972
Can you open the front door?

519
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:16,363
I can't. I can't.

520
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:19,473
Please, ma'am. It would
really help us out.

521
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,652
Oh, I can't. The knots...

522
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:24,287
Kick it down.

523
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,091
Take care of her.
I'll clear the apartment.

524
00:22:33,474 --> 00:22:34,966
Okay. I'm Officer Jackson West.

525
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:36,334
Can you tell me your name, please?

526
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,154
R-Ruth.

527
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:39,978
Ruth. Okay, Ruth, I'm
gonna get you out of these.

528
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:41,651
- If you could just stay calm for me.
- Oh. No, no.

529
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,773
- Clear.
- Please, no. No.

530
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,308
Luke said I had to stay here...

531
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:50,373
- Who's Luke, ma'am?
- He's my son.

532
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:53,157
- Where is he?
- Okay...

533
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:55,853
What's going on? What
happened to my door?

534
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:57,879
- Ohh.
- Are you Luke?

535
00:22:57,904 --> 00:22:59,738
- Yeah.
- You did this to your mother?

536
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,223
So she won't hurt herself.

537
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,442
She's in the early stages of dementia.

538
00:23:03,704 --> 00:23:06,020
I had a job interview.
I couldn't take her with me.

539
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,150
I got stuck in traffic getting back.

540
00:23:08,183 --> 00:23:10,174
- The damn V.P....
- If your mother has health issues,

541
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,743
then you need to get her a caretaker.

542
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:13,268
Or a neighbor to watch her.

543
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:15,324
You know how much that costs?

544
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,312
I do the best I can with what I got.

545
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:19,212
This is your mother. What kind
of garbage treats his mom like...

546
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:21,303
- Officer West!
- Oh...

547
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:23,245
You're under arrest for elder abuse.

548
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,594
Hook him up.

549
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:28,714
Oh, no, no! Don't do that!

550
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,317
Oh, ma'am. It's okay.
It's all right, ma'am.

551
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:33,610
- No, oh, my God.
- It's okay, ma'am.

552
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:44,429
You're gonna be fine.

553
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:54,688
Sorry, I didn't realize
someone else was in here.

554
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:06,722
Thanks.

555
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,492
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:11,130
It's just...

557
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:14,988
my brother, he was...

558
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:17,829
He was in a car accident.

559
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:19,897
I'm sorry.

560
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,271
Is he gonna be okay?

561
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:26,368
No.

562
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:02,538
Hey!

563
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:04,547
What are you doing?

564
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:06,261
This is what he wants.

565
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,931
Stop.

566
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,977
7-Adam-19 A to B, Tim
I need you, room 113

567
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,817
Hey. Hey. Look, just put
down the needle, okay?

568
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,413
- You don't need to do this.
- Yes, I do.

569
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:19,848
My brother wouldn't want this.

570
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,683
He ran triathlons.

571
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:23,965
Being stuck in bed, brain-dead,

572
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,092
hooked up to machines forever,

573
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:26,539
that's his idea of Hell.

574
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:28,944
Okay. Listen to me. Look,
I know you're in pain,

575
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:30,917
but this is not your decision to make.

576
00:25:31,004 --> 00:25:32,951
Page a trauma surgeon and get an O.R.
on standby.

577
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,877
Incoming gunshot wound.

578
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,534
Please. Please.

579
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,193
Mike never had a chance to sign a DNR.

580
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:41,431
He and my sister-in-law
got married six months ago.

581
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,001
She's his medical proxy,
but she can't let him go.

582
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:45,927
She doesn't see that she's hurting him.

583
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:48,853
And you think that injecting
him with bleach is better?

584
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:51,554
Listen, you have no right to decide

585
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:53,433
if he lives or dies.

586
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:55,257
What you're talking about is murder.

587
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,749
He's already dead.

588
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,946
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
put the needle down.

589
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:00,828
Put it down.

590
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,887
Hey. Look at me. Right here.
Right here.

591
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:05,074
- Put the needle down, okay?
- No.

592
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:17,286
- Did she push the plunger?
- No.

593
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,166
Can't leave you alone for a minute.

594
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:33,173
<i>7-Adam-15, I'm reattaching
you to the motorcade detail.</i>

595
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,476
7-Adam-15, copy.

596
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:38,726
Turn around.

597
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:40,241
We've got to go to Wilshire and Western.

598
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:42,142
They're changing the
Vice President's route.

599
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:43,698
So what does that mean we have to do?

600
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,900
Put out cones, block off streets,

601
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:48,123
check the area for any
suspicious activity.

602
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:50,259
Isn't that what the
department's been doing all day?

603
00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:52,418
Yeah, but this is what happens
when the Vice President

604
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:55,378
decides to stop at Philippe's
for a French Dip and a photo op.

605
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:57,011
So basically, you're saying

606
00:26:57,046 --> 00:26:58,980
we have to clear out a
whole new section of town

607
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,582
because he wants to stop for a sandwich?

608
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:01,926
Yep.

609
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,420
You know, I've always liked
it when politicians stop

610
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:07,055
at these little mom-and-pop shops.

611
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:09,189
It makes them seem more human.

612
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:10,714
But now...

613
00:27:11,406 --> 00:27:12,961
Not so much.

614
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:18,666
Last one.

615
00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:21,084
Do we need to track down the guy
that paid to have them put up?

616
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:24,312
No. Situation's been remedied.
Detectives will follow up.

617
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,775
You want to really tell
me what's going on?

618
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:30,249
You've been distracted all day.
Losing control.

619
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,996
That's not like you.

620
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:34,916
My mom and I haven't spoken

621
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,562
since before I, uh, started the Academy.

622
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,344
Breakfast was gonna be
my chance to change that.

623
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:43,518
I, um, was up all
night worrying about it

624
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:45,035
and finally got in the right head space,

625
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,414
only to get called in to work.

626
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:48,233
She's been married to
a cop for 30 years.

627
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:49,698
She should know how the job works.

628
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:52,599
She does... but, um, this is different.

629
00:27:52,907 --> 00:27:54,234
How so?

630
00:27:55,664 --> 00:27:57,305
It just is.

631
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:00,640
Look, I know what it's
like to have family drama.

632
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,966
But you have to keep it in
check when you're at work.

633
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:04,448
In some ways, it's even harder

634
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:06,841
than not bringing this mess
home with you after shift.

635
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:09,715
But being distracted on the
job will get you killed.

636
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:14,682
I understand. It won't happen again.

637
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,366
- Officers Lopez, West?
- Yes?

638
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,794
You're being reassigned
to counter-assault detail.

639
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,062
Redwood has decided to make a stop

640
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:22,417
at the restaurant across the street,

641
00:28:22,442 --> 00:28:24,810
so we have to clear every
apartment with a view.

642
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,385
Grey's calling me back to the station.

643
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:33,023
Okay. Should I come with you?

644
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,909
No. You stay here,
wait for your results.

645
00:28:35,037 --> 00:28:36,801
I'll be back when I'm done.

646
00:28:37,778 --> 00:28:39,245
Tim?

647
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:42,843
Thanks.

648
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,497
For what?

649
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:48,789
Doing my job?

650
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:01,669
How much time till the
motorcade passes through?

651
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,211
20 minutes.

652
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:06,007
7-Adam-15, new route
appears to be clear.

653
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,675
Stand by for final confirmation.

654
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:17,619
Nolan, take a glance to your right,

655
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:19,374
tell me what you see.

656
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,556
Car, single male occupant
sitting behind the wheel.

657
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,402
- Engine running.
- What else?

658
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,604
He's behind the weed dispensary.

659
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:28,040
And was that dispensary open or closed

660
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,530
when we drove past it a minute ago?

661
00:29:29,565 --> 00:29:31,177
- Closed.
- Good.

662
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,298
So why is a lone male
sitting in a running vehicle

663
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:35,836
behind a closed business
that deals in cash?

664
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:38,706
The store's being robbed.

665
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:46,055
7-Adam-15, We have a
possible 4-5-9 in progress

666
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,741
behind the Ganja Garden dispensary.

667
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,283
Requesting backup.

668
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:50,768
<i>Copy, be advised</i>

669
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:52,844
<i>backup is delayed due
to the road closures.</i>

670
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,668
What a surprise.

671
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,282
The driver's gonna be
checking his mirror,

672
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,769
so stay low in the blind spot.

673
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:03,075
We need to get to him before
he can alert his friends.

674
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:07,529
Let's get behind the dumpster.

675
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:28,650
I'll get the driver. Cover me.

676
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:38,941
Police. Give me your cellphone.

677
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,271
Turn off the car. Give me your keys.

678
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,569
- What's your name?
- Freddy.

679
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:49,438
You trying to rob this place, Freddy?

680
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:50,944
You got friends inside?

681
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,932
I'm about to pull you out of this car.

682
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:56,624
Do not attempt to warn them.

683
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:06,340
Hands up.

684
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:11,750
Gun.

685
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,638
How many are inside?

686
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:20,225
Your best shot at leniency
is to help us right now.

687
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:24,486
- There's three people inside.
- Are they hardened felons

688
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:25,978
or are they just a bunch of stoners?

689
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:27,576
Don and Tyreek have done time.

690
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,046
- How long have they been in there?
- Five minutes?

691
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,126
They said they'd be fast. You know,

692
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,300
just grab the cash and go.

693
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:32,921
- Let's get out of here.
- Here we go.

694
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:34,182
Police!

695
00:31:40,754 --> 00:31:42,008
Freddy!

696
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:43,431
- Freddy's down.
- Get him.

697
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:48,550
Come on.

698
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:51,298
They got him in the neck.
Freddy looks bad.

699
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,512
There's first aid in the shop.

700
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,012
Ready?

701
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,949
7-Adam-15, we have shots fired.

702
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:04,455
<i>Need backup and ambulance. Code 3.</i>

703
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,587
Copy. Be advised
nearest backup I s<i> 8 minutes away.</i>

704
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:10,211
8 minutes is a lifetime.
They're right around the corner.

705
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,264
Agent Danvers? We're getting a
distress call from one of our units.

706
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:15,205
- Do you have anyone that can cover us?
- No.

707
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,297
The Vice President's motorcade
is passing through soon.

708
00:32:17,322 --> 00:32:19,189
You've got every window
in this building secured.

709
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:21,148
We're redundant standing
around in a hallway.

710
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,031
Our people are in a gunfight.
They need help.

711
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:24,148
I don't care.

712
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,494
I need you to stay at your post.

713
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:41,718
Remind me to never do that again.

714
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:44,486
- How is he?
- Not good.

715
00:32:58,348 --> 00:32:59,834
You okay?!

716
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:01,069
I'm good! I'm good!

717
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,237
He's bleeding out.

718
00:33:02,262 --> 00:33:03,348
We're need to get him to a hospital!

719
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,339
We'll take him! Backup's
only a few minutes out!

720
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,718
Go!

721
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:12,497
Keep them pinned down!

722
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,848
Cover me.

723
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,966
Come on! Get in here!

724
00:33:30,963 --> 00:33:32,306
Move! Move! Shoot!

725
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:36,349
They've gone back inside.
We go in after them?

726
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,389
No. We make them come to us.

727
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:41,054
7-Adam-07, let Shaw Memorial know

728
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,880
that we are five minutes
away with a juvenile male,

729
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:44,272
gunshot to the neck.

730
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:45,887
<i>7-Adam-07, copy.</i>

731
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:47,312
<i>They've been advised and are ready.</i>

732
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,986
- We're still five out?
- At least.

733
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,007
- You ready?
- Yep.

734
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:54,975
- Hey! Get out of here!
- Hit 'em again.

735
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:00,727
- Come on!
- Let's move!

736
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,407
Get on the ground.

737
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:03,935
Crawl toward the sound of my voice.

738
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,353
Keep your hands where I can see them.

739
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,888
Nice and easy.

740
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,332
Okay! Okay.

741
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,615
- How's he doing?
- He's losing consciousness.

742
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:18,869
Pulse is increasing.

743
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:20,704
Eyes already dilated.

744
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,031
Elevate his legs, monitor his breathing.

745
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:25,477
Yo, what's going on?

746
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,156
The traffic stopped for the motorcade.
I can't get through.

747
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,416
We can't move.

748
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,098
I'm gonna reverse and
loop around Cahuenga.

749
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,544
That's the opposite direction.
There's no time.

750
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,618
Look, he's bleeding out.
We're just a block away.

751
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:51,037
Hang on.

752
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,015
He went into shock a minute ago.
Pulse is weak but steady.

753
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:22,606
Hey, what are you doing here?

754
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:25,184
I got stuck with a hypodermic
needle this morning,

755
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:27,768
so now I'm just...

756
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:29,964
I'm waiting.

757
00:35:33,736 --> 00:35:35,167
I, um...

758
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:36,927
I can wait with you.

759
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,379
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

760
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:52,206
Sergeant Grey, a word?

761
00:35:52,494 --> 00:35:53,794
Of course.

762
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:55,276
Is Redwood wheels up?

763
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,111
Yeah, heading back to D.C. now.

764
00:35:57,145 --> 00:35:59,852
Look, earlier today,
I gave a direct order

765
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:02,292
to two of your officers
that was disregarded.

766
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:03,987
I'm aware.

767
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:06,052
And I support their decision.

768
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,449
They abandoned a post

769
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:10,746
that had a direct line of
fire on the Vice President.

770
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:14,057
And you had snipers with
long guns set on that post.

771
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:16,950
See, I train my people to
make educated decisions

772
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,375
regarding threat assessment.

773
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,039
My guys were under fire.

774
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:22,923
Your guy? Was going for a sandwich.

775
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:24,656
It's a no-brainer.

776
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:40,488
I've been here before.

777
00:36:40,728 --> 00:36:42,295
Waiting for news.

778
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,315
Uh, before we started the Academy,

779
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,847
my, uh, brother, Marshall,

780
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,007
was diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy.

781
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:52,166
It's a kidney disease.

782
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,136
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

783
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,896
Yeah. Now.

784
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:58,283
But at the time,

785
00:36:58,308 --> 00:37:00,416
it looked like he needed
a kidney transplant,

786
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:04,716
and I was the only one in
my family that was a match.

787
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:07,381
That is <i>a lot</i> to carry.

788
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,751
- Man, I was not ready for it.
- Mm-hmm.

789
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:12,198
I'd been counting the days

790
00:37:12,223 --> 00:37:13,689
until I could start the Academy,

791
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:15,785
and suddenly, I was facing the idea

792
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,478
of putting it all on hold.

793
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,196
I agonized over it.

794
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,121
But Marshall said that he could wait.

795
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:27,068
That it really wasn't that serious.

796
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:30,400
So... I took the out.

797
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:33,340
He was looking out for you.

798
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:37,345
He suffered acute renal failure

799
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:39,610
two months after we started.

800
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:41,636
He almost died.

801
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:43,838
Whoa, why didn't you tell us?

802
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:46,837
I was ashamed. I mean, it was my fault.

803
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,231
I...

804
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:50,659
Luckily, the hospital
found another donor

805
00:37:50,684 --> 00:37:53,104
and he got the transplant,

806
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:55,748
but my mom still hasn't forgiven me.

807
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:58,992
Which is why missing
brunch was such a big deal.

808
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:00,611
Yeah.

809
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:02,115
And in her mind,

810
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,374
I chose the job before family.

811
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:06,205
Again.

812
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:08,634
It's not the same.

813
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,267
It's not.

814
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:14,882
Deep down she knows it's true.

815
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:18,789
Have you told her how
heartbroken you are

816
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,214
about all of this?

817
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,019
She hasn't really given me the chance.

818
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,453
Well, then take it.

819
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:31,165
Trust me, as unpleasant
as it's gonna be,

820
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:34,833
the waiting is so much worse.

821
00:38:37,038 --> 00:38:40,007
- Officer Chen?
- Yeah, that's... that's me.

822
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:42,143
I have the results of your test.

823
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,735
So if you come with me, we
can set you up in a room.

824
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:44,938
Uh, no. Sorry. No.

825
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:47,486
Uh, can you just tell me, like, now?

826
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,209
Okay.

827
00:38:58,382 --> 00:39:00,562
So, your initial test

828
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:03,273
came back negative for
any viral infections,

829
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:05,399
like HIV or hepatitis.

830
00:39:09,337 --> 00:39:10,670
But...

831
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:12,980
your blood work indicated

832
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:14,469
the presence of a staph infection.

833
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:17,059
- What does that mean?
- We need to get you started

834
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,409
on intravenous antibiotics immediately.

835
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:22,550
Some strains of staph
are drug-resistant,

836
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,050
so we'll monitor the wound

837
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:26,043
for any abscesses or cellulitis.

838
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,629
- Okay?
- Okay...

839
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:31,071
Um, go. I'll, uh... I'll call Tim.

840
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:32,670
He'll be here for you when you come out.

841
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:35,188
Thank you for staying with me.

842
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:36,497
Of course.

843
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,068
Dispatch is sending another
unit to watch our suspect

844
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:49,878
when he gets out of surgery.

845
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:52,301
Looks like getting puked
on saved your life.

846
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,307
You don't put on that tactical vest,

847
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:56,587
that shot to the shoulder
goes through your heart.

848
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:01,135
You've come a long way, Officer West.

849
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:05,526
I guess I have. Thanks to you.

850
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,023
Hey. Good job today.

851
00:40:13,048 --> 00:40:15,245
Are you being for real, or
are you just being positive?

852
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,486
- For real.
- Thanks.

853
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:19,617
What did you decide about the
loan from your rich friend?

854
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,312
Oh. That you were right.

855
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:24,329
Money and friendships just don't mix.

856
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:27,029
Look, your son is never
gonna forget that house.

857
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:28,475
I moved around so much,

858
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,635
I never had a place that
was special like that.

859
00:40:30,852 --> 00:40:32,623
But it's not about the place,

860
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:34,327
it's about what happened there.

861
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,370
You own those memories.

862
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:39,737
That's actually... an
excellent perspective.

863
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:41,762
Hmm. I'll send you a bill.

864
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:52,984
- All done?
- All done.

865
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,471
The house is now in the hands
of a lovely young couple,

866
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,179
their kids, and a French bulldog.

867
00:40:58,204 --> 00:41:00,472
Well, I'm sure they'll
take good care of it.

868
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:01,956
Yeah.

869
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:05,236
Wow. What a day.

870
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:07,554
Wait till the President comes.

871
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:10,449
- I hear it's twice as bad.
- That's not possible.

872
00:41:10,474 --> 00:41:13,109
Well, <i>you</i> missed all
the drama altogether.

873
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:15,455
I got stuck with a dirty needle.

874
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,012
Yes, that's right, I forgot.

875
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:18,809
Tell me, is it too soon
to make jokes about that?

876
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,161
- A little.
- Of course. That's my bad.

877
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:22,703
How about now?

878
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,002
Will you stop that?

879
00:41:24,027 --> 00:41:25,582
- Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

880
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:26,874
Just got off the flight from Sedona.

881
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:28,309
You know, I found this outside the gate.

882
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:29,777
I think it's for you.

883
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:31,578
It's from Henry.

884
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:33,374
- If you would?
- Mm-hmm.

885
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:42,307
It's the doorjamb... from his room

886
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,140
where I marked his height every year.

887
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:46,794
This is... This is the best.

888
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:49,254
Oh, my God, I can tear a
doorjamb down right here

889
00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:50,370
and I can install this.

890
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:51,725
Um, did I mention that this house

891
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,634
is featured in Architectural Digest?

892
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:55,900
- Master bedroom.
- John. No.

893
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:58,620
How about just a shadow box?

894
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:00,604
To put it in?

895
