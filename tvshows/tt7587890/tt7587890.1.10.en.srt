1
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:10,784
Yeah. All right.
I am just parking right now,

2
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:13,539
and I will meet you
at the baggage claim.

3
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:15,541
Nonsense. Come on. I want to come in.

4
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:17,876
Yeah, get ready for
a big, embarrassing hug.

5
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,012
Okay, see you in a minute.

6
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:22,214
Oh.

7
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:25,283
Yes.

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,422
No! Shoot.

9
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:43,202
Come on.

10
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:45,004
Come on, buddy.

11
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,208
Police.

12
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,543
Step away from the vehicle.
Show me your hands.

13
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:53,446
Oh, actually, this is my truck.

14
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,697
Get on your knees.

15
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:56,048
Lock your fingers behind your head.

16
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:57,383
Yeah, okay. A little embarrassing.

17
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:59,018
I'm... I'm actually a cop, too.

18
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,252
Uh, three months on the force.

19
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:02,221
Just... My I.D. is locked in the cab.

20
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:03,956
- You're a rookie?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,724
Now I know you're lying.
Get on your knees.

22
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,873
Do it.

23
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:15,005
Dad?

24
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,104
Welcome to L.A.

25
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:21,040
Ow!

26
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,541
That's tight. That's tight.

27
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:31,093
Oh. It's a good thing I still had

28
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,774
your spare key, or you'd be in jail.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,953
Airport jail.

30
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,289
So, you sure you're okay
Ubering home from here?

31
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:40,004
Yeah, of course. I mean, you
can't be late for your shift.

32
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:41,813
But I'm not leaving
until I see you in uniform.

33
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,250
Yeah, this isn't the kind of job

34
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,348
where we can hang out a lot, you know?

35
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,741
Oh, I know, uh...

36
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:48,567
if you don't want me here, I can go.

37
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,279
Not at all. I'm just
a little under the microscope.

38
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:52,404
They literally evaluate me
at the end of every shift.

39
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,709
Are you worried I'll make you look bad?

40
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,074
No, that's...

41
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:57,309
Okay, let me, um,
get a fresh start here.

42
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,907
Obviously, the threat of airport jail

43
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,412
has me a little off my game.

44
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,459
I am thrilled to have you here, okay?

45
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:05,073
- Okay.
- Just maybe don't tell any

46
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:06,318
embarrassing stories about me.

47
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:08,009
Mm, that's gonna be hard.
There are so many.

48
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:09,331
- Really, there's not, though.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:11,623
My sixth birthday. Easter 2009.

50
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:13,492
- The turducken.
- Do <i>not</i> tell that story.

51
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:14,912
- Oh.
- What story?

52
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:17,196
Hey! Jackson and Lucy, this is...

53
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,365
- Henry. What's up, bro?
- Hey! Nice to see you.

54
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,006
- You guys know my son?
- Yeah, on, uh, social media.

55
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,380
Yeah, I-I followed them after you guys

56
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,205
started hanging out together
at the Academy.

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,539
They followed me back.

58
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,051
You know what?
That photo that you posted

59
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,343
earlier from the plane was horrifying.

60
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:32,788
- Dude, I literally almost puked.
- Thanks for that.

61
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,219
Okay, the guy in the next aisle over

62
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:36,630
straight up cleaned his dentures
on the tray table.

63
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,122
- Gross.
- It was bad.

64
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:39,651
Wait, how come you didn't tell me

65
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,687
you were friends with my son
on the Insta thing?

66
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,655
Well, it didn't seem like a big deal.

67
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,191
Yeah. It's 2019, Dad.
Get with the times.

68
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:47,805
Yeah. Dad.

69
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:51,536
- That was a good one.
- Yeah, thank you.

70
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:52,891
Yeah.

71
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:54,666
All right. Look alive, look alive.

72
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,535
Officer Nolan, you ready?

73
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,610
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Now, answer me this.

74
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:00,539
What is your favorite part
about the job?

75
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:02,174
And don't say "To make a difference."

76
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,042
I wasn't going to.

77
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,744
But it is.

78
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,561
- What's your least favorite?
- Oh, that's easy.

79
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:08,681
Paperwork.

80
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,048
Imagine how I feel.

81
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,246
All right.

82
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:14,720
Most of what
a captain does is paperwork.

83
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:17,322
'Cause of that,
I feel like I've lost touch

84
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:19,091
with what being a cop is really about.

85
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,425
People.

86
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,676
Captain Andersen:
It's not only the citizens

87
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,967
that we serve and protect.

88
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:25,564
It's every single
one of you in this room.

89
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:27,243
So, to remedy that,

90
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,735
I've decided Sergeant Grey and I
are gonna ride patrol today.

91
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,570
Together?

92
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:33,430
No. We're each gonna
ride with a rookie,

93
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,183
and their respective T.O.s
will pair up.

94
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,915
Ma'am, I'd be honored
if you'd ride with me.

95
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:40,441
That is sweet, Officer West,

96
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:42,939
but today I'm riding with Officer Chen.

97
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,584
Sergeant Grey, I'd be honored

98
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:47,753
if you rode with Officer West today.

99
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,974
That's cute, Officer Nolan.

100
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,423
But you know my heart belongs to you.

101
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:55,527
Lucky me.

102
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:58,240
Lot of weight on
your shoulders today, Boot.

103
00:03:58,264 --> 00:03:59,598
Why? What do you mean?

104
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,945
Riding with the captain
is a huge responsibility.

105
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,702
If anything happens to her, well...

106
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:05,496
I don't even know how
to finish that sentence.

107
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,306
I do. Andersen gets a scratch,

108
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,774
and you'll be working
motor pool in Sylmar

109
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,557
till you die of carbon
monoxide poisoning.

110
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,414
Why do you think Lucy
and Nolan got picked over me?

111
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,264
Two words... body odor.

112
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,709
I'm serious.

113
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,652
It means something, doesn't it?

114
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:22,119
Andersen's clearly playing favorites

115
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:23,789
- riding with Lucy.
- Maybe.

116
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:26,725
But do you really think Nolan
is Grey's favorite?

117
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,890
- No.
- Then stop worrying so much.

118
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,629
Leave me alone!

119
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:31,990
- Okay. Dropping it.
- Not you.

120
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,418
My phone.

121
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,290
- Or, rather, my mom.
- What'd she do?

122
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,685
She wants to know
if I'm bringing a date

123
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,064
to my brother's wedding.

124
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,804
That sounds...

125
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,173
reasonable.

126
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,136
Not when there's extras on it.

127
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:44,770
- Meaning?
- If I don't bring a date,

128
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:46,255
she'll spend the whole night
trying to set me up

129
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,780
- with the best man, Hugo.
- Mm.

130
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,542
I'm guessing Hugo's not your type.

131
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:51,650
He smells like kitty litter.

132
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:53,059
And I don't even think he owns a cat.

133
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,419
Spent my niece's baptism

134
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:55,824
bragging about how much he squats.

135
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,656
Maybe he squats kitty litter.

136
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,491
You're not helping.

137
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:07,366
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:09,144
- What do you think?
- Awesome.

139
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,245
Oh.

140
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,814
That belt looks
super uncomfortable, though.

141
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,199
Yeah, I have a bruise where
the gun digs into my hip.

142
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:15,741
- You made a friend.
- Yeah.

143
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,609
Dominique was just giving me
the scoop on this place.

144
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:19,444
- Her dad works here.
- Oh, really?

145
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,480
Yeah. He's the watch commander.

146
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,121
Your dad is Sergeant Grey?

147
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:26,318
Officer Nolan.
Why aren't you getting our gear?

148
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:28,620
I was just getting my son squared away.

149
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:30,289
He just flew in this morning
from college.

150
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:31,956
- Dominique?
- Hey, Dad.

151
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:35,159
You forgot I was interning
here today, didn't you?

152
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:36,633
No.

153
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,597
I intern at different
divisions on Saturdays.

154
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,332
- Oh, for college.
- High school.

155
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,039
My daughter's a senior in high school.

156
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,980
Wait, why did you tell
Henry's dad to get your gear?

157
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,339
Are you riding patrol?

158
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:48,786
Captain's orders.

159
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:50,083
Really?

160
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:52,630
- Does Mom know?
- Haven't told her yet.

161
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:55,205
Well, I'm happy not to tell her, too.

162
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:58,691
Long as you don't tell her about
that "C" I got in Macrobiology.

163
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:02,965
You know that's not the way
we do things in our house.

164
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,215
- So that's a "No"?
- We'll talk about it later.

165
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,826
- Officer Nolan, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,820
It's a 12-hour shift,
so I'll probably be late.

167
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,434
- Okay.
- Oh, he can stay here with me,

168
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,664
if he wants.

169
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,632
That way, you two can
have lunch together.

170
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,834
That's okay, right, Dad?

171
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:21,439
- Sure.
- Great.

172
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,804
Yeah. You can tell me all the
things my dad doesn't want

173
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,491
me to know about his new job.

174
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:29,708
- Great.
- Here. Give me some of these.

175
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,717
I'll help you.

176
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,408
I would say there's a lot of stuff.

177
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,972
Give me a little bit.

178
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,991
- So, you didn't get the gear?
- Neither did you.

179
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,392
Do I look like your boot?

180
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,903
- You were once.
- For two weeks.

181
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,428
A long time ago.

182
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:44,758
So unless you have a time machine,

183
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:46,468
it looks like we're at an impasse.

184
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:52,336
I have an idea.

185
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:00,779
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

186
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,415
Oh, um, Officer Bradford told me

187
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,317
to set up their shop,
as well, so I'm just...

188
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:07,886
Bradford, Bishop!

189
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,123
Yes, Captain?

190
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,526
Officer Chen is my boot today.

191
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,106
Is that perfectly clear?

192
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:18,030
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get your gear.

193
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:28,874
Thanks.

194
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,751
You want to quiz me on procedure?

195
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:42,387
Do I look like a game show host to you?

196
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,755
Go find some crime.

197
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,070
Make a difference
in our community today.

198
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:55,434
Maybe we should head for
a rougher part of town.

199
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:56,668
Are you saying only crime happens

200
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,637
in low-income neighborhoods,
Officer Nolan?

201
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,248
No, sir.

202
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:03,975
Oh, all right.

203
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,111
Here we go. Vehicle code violation.

204
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:07,946
Ooh. What's your PC?

205
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,899
Uh, well, take your pick.

206
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,984
We have, uh, broken taillight,
obstructed view...

207
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,986
...driving all over the place.

208
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,621
Pull her over?

209
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,728
Are you asking me or telling me?

210
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:22,828
Control, this is 7-Adam-15.

211
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:25,664
We are on a car stop,
Toluca Lake and Ponca.

212
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,865
California plate Tom-Union-Frank.

213
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,935
George-Robert-Adam-Nora-Yellow.

214
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:31,369
How close are you supposed to park

215
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,004
to a suspect vehicle, Officer Nolan?

216
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,474
Oh. Uh, one car length, more or less.

217
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:36,862
Sorry.

218
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:40,524
Is this a felony stop now?

219
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,186
No, sir. Sorry.

220
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,118
Still probably a little too...

221
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,022
That's it.

222
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,897
- This is embarrassing.
- I'm feeling a little nervous.

223
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,529
- Are you happy with your positioning?
- I'm...

224
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,532
Shouldn't I be?

225
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,134
It's non-tactical.

226
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,869
The engine block should be
positioned at an angle

227
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:05,504
just in case we have
to take cover behind it.

228
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,506
Sir, she's an elderly woman.

229
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:11,334
- You don't agree?
- I think you should plan for the worst.

230
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,845
- Right.
- But if you're happy with it, fine.

231
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:25,670
Hello, there, ma'am.

232
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,112
Uh, looks like you were
swerving around the street a little bit,

233
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,263
and I noticed you have
a broken taillight.

234
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,570
Can we talk on the sidewalk?

235
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,766
I don't like you standing out there

236
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,276
in the street like that.
It's so dangerous.

237
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:39,436
- Of course. Give you a hand?
- Yeah.

238
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,083
Careful.

239
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,843
All right. Nice and easy,

240
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:45,597
- nice and slow.
- Yeah.

241
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:49,484
You know, I haven't had
a ticket in 25 years.

242
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:52,342
You seem like a nice man.

243
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:55,716
Can you just let me off with a warning?

244
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,175
Just this once?

245
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:58,909
Make a decision, Boot.

246
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,928
I don't see why not.

247
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,796
Just do me a favor...
get that brake light fixed,

248
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,074
and if you're gonna
pick a side of the road,

249
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:07,429
make sure it's the right side.

250
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:08,867
Officer Nolan.

251
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,802
Have you identified
everyone in the vehicle?

252
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:15,499
Oh, that's just my son. He's sleeping.

253
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:18,577
Sir, can you step out of the car?

254
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:19,811
He wasn't even driving.

255
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:21,479
W-Why do you need to talk to him?

256
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:23,058
I just need to identify
everyone in the vehicle.

257
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,116
Sir.

258
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,019
Step out of the car for me, would you?

259
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:28,696
Thanks.

260
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:32,090
Oh. W-Whoa.

261
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:34,274
Labor must have been hell.

262
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:37,229
Sir, I, uh, need your name
and date of birth, please.

263
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,081
Don't tell him a damn thing.

264
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,132
Ma'am, he's required by law
to give me that information.

265
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:42,801
Run, Bryce!

266
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,803
Don't even think about it.

267
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,639
- -Sgt.
- Hands over your head.

268
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:48,312
You, too, Grandma.

269
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,677
<i>- Officer Nolan.
- Uh-huh?</i>

270
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:55,113
- How you doing?
- Good.

271
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:10,796
Hello?

272
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:12,717
Police!

273
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:20,715
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

274
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,605
Hey! Hey, enough!

275
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,209
I'll call for an interpreter.

276
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:28,076
_

277
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,100
_

278
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,760
_

279
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,514
Yes.

280
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,126
Our marriage is over.

281
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:43,194
I made a mistake of telling him

282
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:45,196
he could come by and get a few things.

283
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:47,908
Then he starts destroying
the whole house!

284
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:50,894
Nothing we shared matters
to her anymore.

285
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,453
I love you, Mehrnaz.
Why are you throwing us away?

286
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,940
I cannot keep doing this
with you, Dariush.

287
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,713
Sir, clearly, you're in a lot of pain,

288
00:12:01,747 --> 00:12:03,882
but what you need to do
is get a lawyer, see a judge,

289
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,650
and they will help you
to divide your property.

290
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,627
Lawyers? Judges?

291
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,761
Strangers!

292
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:11,556
My wife is leaving me.

293
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,258
My life is over.

294
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,893
Ma'am, do you want to press charges?

295
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,195
No. I just want him out.

296
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:20,008
Officer Chen, can you
escort Mr. Ghorbani outside, please?

297
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,127
Come on.

298
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:31,743
Hey!

299
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:32,888
He's got a gun in the master bedroom.

300
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,517
Officer Chen, there's a gun upstairs!

301
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,747
Stay right there.

302
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,375
- What do we do?
- Straddle the door.

303
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:43,922
Talk him out of there.
Try not to get shot.

304
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,521
Mr. Ghorbani, I need
you to come out now.

305
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:58,799
_

306
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,795
Uh, so, it's just

307
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,889
all the way up these
stairs and straight back

308
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,268
Thank you.

309
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,270
All units, be advised,
we're Code 4 here.

310
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,186
Situation's under control.

311
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:32,311
Is this my fault?

312
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:35,817
Should I have given him another chance?

313
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:39,672
You couldn't have known that
he was gonna react like that.

314
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,631
There's no way.

315
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:45,334
My mother is still in Iran.

316
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:48,254
She told me to work things out,

317
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,608
that marriage is sacred.

318
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,386
But we were so unhappy.

319
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,578
It's just...

320
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:59,586
You know, my mother
said the same thing to me

321
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,528
when my marriage ended.

322
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:03,528
She lives in La Cañada.

323
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,214
You can't control how
people are gonna react.

324
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:10,036
I wish we could.

325
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,841
Captain? Reinforcements just showed up.

326
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,640
Captain. Anything we can do to help?

327
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,742
Yeah. You can get your ass
back out on the street

328
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,187
and handle some calls.

329
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,965
We heard there were shots fired.

330
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:41,303
Did you also hear Officer Chen
put out the all-clear?

331
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,913
Did you think you were gonna pop
by for a little moral support?

332
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:46,293
Did you want to come inside,
maybe check the fridge?

333
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,228
No, ma'am. I-I just figured...

334
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,491
The woman inside just watched
her husband take his own life.

335
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,292
I don't think she's in the mood
to host a party.

336
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,514
What do you think?

337
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,290
Understood.

338
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:59,953
We'll go back out on patrol. Sorry.

339
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:02,963
I think they were just trying to help.

340
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,419
- We didn't need it.
- Yeah. I...

341
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:07,007
I let the guy get upstairs.

342
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,493
Yes, you did.

343
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,148
He's not dead because of that.

344
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:19,449
That lady is crazy strong.

345
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,451
And who'd have thought she'd
have more outstanding warrants

346
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:22,775
than her Sasquatch kid?

347
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,772
By the way you're walking,

348
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,672
I'd say she could kick
field goals for the Rams.

349
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:28,281
Don't remind me.

350
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:38,691
She does this on purpose.

351
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,126
Just to push my buttons.

352
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,961
Well, that's what kids do.

353
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,682
So, why wouldn't your wife be
happy with you riding patrol?

354
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:46,693
My wife is not your concern.

355
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,614
And after your performance
this morning,

356
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,673
I'd say you need to focus on the job.

357
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:53,336
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

358
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,383
I mean, how could we not respond?

359
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,173
It was a shots-fired call.

360
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,786
Did the captain ask for backup?

361
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,437
- No. But...
- But nothing.

362
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,330
She's not a damsel in distress.

363
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:05,695
If that were Grey,
would you have insisted

364
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,584
we ride in like the cavalry?

365
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,199
And now you created a real problem,

366
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:10,867
instead of the fake one
you made up in your head.

367
00:16:12,144 --> 00:16:14,001
Stop that guy! He's getting away!

368
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:15,695
Hey, stop!

369
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,566
- Let go of me.
- Calm down.

370
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,672
Calm down? I was just chasing
the guy that stole my briefcase,

371
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:20,754
but you let him get away.

372
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,014
And, by the way, you're supposed
to identify yourself

373
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:24,483
<i>before</i> you engage a suspect.

374
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:25,671
"A," I had no way of knowing

375
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:26,811
you were the victim here, and "B,"

376
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,265
I didn't have time to identify myself

377
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,857
due to the immediacy of the situation.

378
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,398
Try that on someone who isn't a lawyer.

379
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,219
Do you want to file a report
on your briefcase

380
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:34,510
or keep telling me how to do my job?

381
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,702
Well, I don't have all day,

382
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,082
so I guess I'll file a report.

383
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:39,185
How about I take care of the report

384
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,457
and you go enjoy your coffee?

385
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,623
I have a locator in my briefcase.

386
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:42,700
If we go now, I can track it.

387
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:43,856
Yeah, we can't just wander around

388
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:45,293
on a scavenger hunt.

389
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:46,973
Okay, can you give us a second, please?

390
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:48,442
Yeah.

391
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,864
Look, maybe we should help him.

392
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,244
Otherwise, I bet
he'll file a complaint.

393
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,079
Fine. But if he gives me
any more attitude,

394
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:57,368
he's gonna taste pepper spray.

395
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:59,442
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

396
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:02,141
Yeah. This is gonna go great.

397
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,872
All right. I'll be contact,
you be cover.

398
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,697
You don't trust me to be contact?

399
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,449
Fine. You be contact, I'll be cover.

400
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,001
Don't do me any favors.

401
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,507
- What's going on?
- You called 911...

402
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:15,622
- But you said...
- Said I was gonna be con...

403
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:16,984
Never mind.

404
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:18,730
- Go ahead.
- Okay. What's the problem?

405
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:20,455
We've had some recent break-ins.

406
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,787
We had one last night.

407
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,386
I went to do laundry just now,

408
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:25,519
and someone's hiding in the basement.

409
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,128
- Are you sure it's not a tenant?
- Yes.

410
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:29,287
I shouted, and he didn't say anything.

411
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:31,268
But I know he is still down there.

412
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,940
Okay. We'll check it out.
Go wait in your apartment.

413
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:44,551
- Downward-facing stairway...
- Stairway, downward facing...

414
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:45,962
- I'm calling this.
- Of course you are.

415
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:47,137
I do have more experience.

416
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:49,131
You take point, Officer Bishop.
I'll hook left.

417
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:50,723
Oh, so now it's "Officer Bishop," huh?

418
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:53,013
Mm. Fine. After you.

419
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:55,104
- LAP...
- Police.

420
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,596
- LAPD!
- Police!

421
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:02,887
Looks clear so far.
You just keep holding point.

422
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:04,769
It's a box, Tim. There's no one here.

423
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,639
Stick to the S.O.P.s,
just like I taught you.

424
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,119
"Standard Operating Procedures"
also means use common sense.

425
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,151
My T.O. after you
was big on common sense.

426
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,400
Officer Belgrave's safety
tactics are for crap.

427
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,625
Oh, here we go. The great SWAT debate.

428
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,616
There's no debate. There's
a right way and a wrong way.

429
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,103
He's in there.

430
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:22,746
You breach the door.
I'll take point from here.

431
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,667
Dynamic entry. Remember to get
clear of the fatal funnel.

432
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,532
You breach the door.
I breached the last one.

433
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:28,466
And we should use the "wedge
and slow search" technique.

434
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:38,037
Behind the panel.

435
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,010
Suspect.

436
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,000
LAPD. We hear you in there.

437
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:48,187
Slowly open the door
and show us your hands.

438
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,849
Control, 7-Adam-15,

439
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:52,109
we have a possible 459 suspect
at our location.

440
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,746
Send us another unit.

441
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:55,397
Why'd you call for backup?

442
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:57,420
If we can't handle one mope,
we shouldn't be doing this job.

443
00:18:57,444 --> 00:18:59,122
- What if it's not just a mope?
- If it's not a mope,

444
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:00,214
he wouldn't be hiding in there.

445
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,059
- Now, breach that door.
- What for?

446
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,857
He's not going anywhere.
Time's on our side.

447
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,491
Officer Bishop, do I need to remind you

448
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:06,917
I'm senior officer on scene?

449
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,382
Which means I'm in charge.

450
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,319
Now, breach that door.

451
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:20,660
Aah! Aah!

452
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,215
- What? What?
- Aah!

453
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,033
Skunk, skunk!

454
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,918
Oh, hell no!

455
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:32,371
You don't even have a
parking permit. Move your car.

456
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:33,661
Well, what are you gonna do, make me?

457
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:34,974
I got to make you?
What, are you 12 years old?

458
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,143
Look how you parked the car, my man!

459
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,628
Take my keys and do it for me.

460
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:38,730
- Gentlemen.
- Oh, you gonna walk because

461
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:39,828
the police is here now?

462
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:42,403
Gentlemen!! Hey, hey, hey.

463
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,528
- What seems to be the problem?
- This is my spot.

464
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,841
Screw that. He stole it from me.

465
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,908
Man, the hell I did. I got here first,

466
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,200
and he cut me off.

467
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,562
Okay. Okay. I-I don't understand.

468
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,221
It's a parking spot.
Just get another one.

469
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,359
My daughter is having a party.

470
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:56,966
I have the cake in the trunk.

471
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,660
All right. The game's about to
start. I got the beer all ready.

472
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:01,380
- Screw your daughter.
- Hey, hey, hey!

473
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:03,570
- Hey, hey! Whoa!
- Get on the ground.

474
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:05,878
Get on the ground right now.
Hands behind your back.

475
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,656
Stay.

476
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,306
I got him.

477
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:19,256
Roll. Left foot under right knee.

478
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:22,772
Let's go.

479
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:24,961
How was I supposed to
know there was a skunk in there?

480
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,107
Oh. If we had done a
wedge and a slow search,

481
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:28,671
you would've seen from a safe distance.

482
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:29,784
Give me the keys. Let me drive.

483
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:31,244
- I'll get us there faster.
- Forget that.

484
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:33,972
There's no way I'm letting you
in my shop smelling like that.

485
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,322
Then what the hell am I supposed to do?

486
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:36,747
Oh, now you want my advice.

487
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:39,091
Well, here it is. Call a cab.

488
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:45,426
So, what's in the
briefcase that's so important?

489
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,918
Handwritten depositions.

490
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,425
If I lose them,
my client could go to jail.

491
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:50,303
Maybe your client belongs in jail.

492
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:53,042
- Why handwritten?
- Protects my clients' privacy.

493
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:54,382
I don't trust the cloud
with anything important.

494
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:56,086
Wait, wait.

495
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,879
He should be right around the corner.

496
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:02,486
Hey.

497
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,141
Police! Stop!

498
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,712
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

499
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:10,647
- What?
- You don't have to be so rough.

500
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:12,380
You're criticizing my arrest?

501
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,854
'Cause I was expecting a thank-you

502
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:15,282
for getting your briefcase back.

503
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,430
The law defines excessive force
as a use of force

504
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,089
greater than that
which a reasonable officer

505
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,115
would use under the circumstances.

506
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,393
- He makes a good point.
- Nobody's talking to you.

507
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:24,630
Are you gonna read him his rig...

508
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:26,122
I will if you shut up for a minute.

509
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,141
I'll do it.

510
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,466
What the hell is your problem?

511
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,842
For starters, your blatant disregard

512
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,713
- for the man's civil rights.
- That man is a criminal

513
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:34,371
I apprehended based
on your description.

514
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:35,469
You're a police officer.

515
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,300
Why am I describing due process to you?

516
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:38,863
You don't need to
describe anything to me.

517
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,330
Mm-hmm. Three words...
protect and serve.

518
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:42,083
- Two words... shut up.
- I'm not gonna shut up.

519
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:43,557
- You do something dumb...
- Oh, wow.

520
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:45,946
They really dig each other, huh?

521
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:47,727
- Are you crazy?
- No, no.

522
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:49,481
Look how close they're standing.

523
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,063
- I want to slap you in the face.
- Yeah, you...

524
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:54,123
My ex and I used to scream
at each other just like that.

525
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,106
- It was hot.
- Go ahead. I can take it.

526
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,161
- Huh.
- I'm a witness to that.

527
00:21:58,196 --> 00:22:00,379
<i>Wilshire units, 415 possible assault</i>

528
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,605
<i>at 7293 Citrus, apartment 601.</i>

529
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,468
How much of the job
do you share with your family?

530
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,214
Only because
the social aspect of being a cop

531
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,984
is a vital part of my education.

532
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:11,548
I share what I can.

533
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:14,003
It's a lot easier now that
I'm anchored at the station.

534
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:16,473
What do you mean, what you can?

535
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:18,677
What we do isn't normal, Officer Nolan.

536
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,212
Situations we find ourselves in...

537
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,353
Sharing too much can be
counterproductive.

538
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,255
- For them or for you?
- Both.

539
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,090
Here we go.

540
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,474
Oh, it's about time.

541
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:30,522
It's like World War III next door.

542
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,629
The arguing, the fighting.

543
00:22:32,904 --> 00:22:34,334
Ma'am, I don't hear anything.

544
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:36,606
Oh, not now.
Probably killed each other.

545
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,212
Okay. We'll check it out, ma'am.

546
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:40,411
If you don't mind going
to your apartment, please?

547
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:42,725
Thank you.

548
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:50,566
Open up. Police.

549
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,586
You want me to kick it in?

550
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,511
- Are you saying I can't?
- No.

551
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:00,170
I mean yes. I...

552
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,840
Step aside.

553
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,114
Wow.

554
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:27,727
Neighbor wasn't kidding.

555
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,412
- Check his pulse.
- Right.

556
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,485
Nolan!

557
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:02,847
Give me your hands! Hands!

558
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:04,203
Relax.

559
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:07,108
What the hell was that?

560
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,887
That's my baby brother, man!

561
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,468
The classes are the
easiest part of college.

562
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,109
It's the other stuff
that's hard to get used to.

563
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,096
Like the fact there's
nobody to do your laundry.

564
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:22,851
Exactly.

565
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,788
Oh. Independence is
a double-edged sword.

566
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,573
Seriously, though, if you
have any more questions,

567
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,960
I'm happy to give you
the scoop anytime.

568
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:32,996
I just might take you up on that.

569
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,591
So, why is it such a big deal

570
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:41,354
that your dad's out riding patrol?

571
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:46,815
He got shot when
I was in middle school.

572
00:24:48,107 --> 00:24:49,732
Almost died.

573
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:54,251
Took him a few months
to get back on his feet,

574
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:57,099
even longer than that
to feel like Dad again.

575
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:01,841
So, I'm assuming having
our kids see us like this

576
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,454
- would be counterproductive?
- Very.

577
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,649
So, we'll just hit the locker
room and get cleaned up first.

578
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:11,965
Too late.

579
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:16,344
If I hadn't seen you like this, would
you have told me about the fight?

580
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,028
Yeah.

581
00:25:19,504 --> 00:25:21,184
No.

582
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:23,297
Look. It's not a big deal.

583
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:24,855
It was a little scuffle.

584
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,627
And my job is to protect you
from the bad things,

585
00:25:27,813 --> 00:25:29,680
which includes some of
what I do on the job.

586
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:32,136
I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

587
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,837
I'm going to college in a few months.

588
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:35,129
Are you gonna shadow me across campus?

589
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:36,998
Don't think I haven't considered it.

590
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,037
Look, I'm trying. Okay?

591
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:42,586
But to me, you're still my baby girl.

592
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:44,949
No, I'm not, Dad.

593
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,286
That's just how you want to see me.

594
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:53,582
Well, you wanted to see me in uniform.

595
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,927
Don't. It's not funny.

596
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:57,532
You were literally covered in blood.

597
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,552
Yeah, but somebody else's blood.

598
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:03,008
Uh, t-this job, Henry,
I-it's hard to talk about. It...

599
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:06,059
Harder even than that "birds
and the bees" conversation.

600
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,790
I'm on the outside of your new life.

601
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,061
Part of it is
because I went to college.

602
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:13,644
But you're the one
who changed everything.

603
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:14,915
My whole life growing up,

604
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,572
You got up and you went to work

605
00:26:16,597 --> 00:26:18,012
and you came home every night,

606
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,938
and I never had to worry
that you wouldn't.

607
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:24,494
But now you're a cop,
and every time the phone rings,

608
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:26,088
I panic

609
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:28,360
and think something's happened.

610
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,195
Henry, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

611
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:33,297
Because I haven't said anything.

612
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,066
Because you're happy

613
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,477
for the first time in a long time.

614
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,238
Hey, that's not true. I was happy.

615
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:41,754
No, you weren't.

616
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:43,309
The last few years with Mom,

617
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:45,411
you both thought
you were protecting me,

618
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:47,814
but I could feel it.

619
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,048
I hated that I was the one responsible

620
00:26:50,082 --> 00:26:52,216
for you both being so miserable.

621
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:54,979
Hey, now. Your mom and I had
our share of problems,

622
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,197
but we were always on
the same page about you.

623
00:26:57,222 --> 00:26:59,771
You were the one thing we did right.

624
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:01,259
Mostly.

625
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,725
Look, h-how about I change uniforms

626
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:10,052
- and we go get something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

627
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:20,431
I shouldn't have ducked.

628
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:22,360
Relax. It was instinct.

629
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:23,748
I should've been the one to duck.

630
00:27:23,782 --> 00:27:25,452
Guess I'm a little rusty.

631
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:26,798
Well, it's understandable.

632
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:29,759
I mean, you're stuck in
your office most of the day.

633
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,223
Actually, um, I didn't
always push a desk.

634
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:35,346
You know, I was in Marine Corps...
MOS 5803.

635
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:36,868
Military police.

636
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:38,836
That's where I learned
how to speak Farsi.

637
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:41,899
Well, I didn't know
you were in the Marines.

638
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:43,433
I-I thought that you were just

639
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,146
from another department
back east somewhere.

640
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:46,747
Did a year as Pentagon Police,

641
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,414
Criminal Investigation Directorate.

642
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:50,762
Then I moved back home...
joined the LAPD.

643
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:52,471
Moved up quickly because
of my experience,

644
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:54,509
but that means I didn't move
through the ranks with these guys,

645
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,767
so they don't see me as a cop,
only as a boss.

646
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:59,377
You should tell people about that.

647
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,872
You sure as hell wouldn't have
cops flying in to rescue you.

648
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:04,802
You don't tell people that
you're a badass, Officer Chen.

649
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:07,231
Just got to show 'em.

650
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:08,690
Hey, not for nothing, lady,

651
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:10,878
- that shiner's pretty badass.
- Shut your mouth.

652
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:13,531
Don't say anything
- without your lawyer present.

653
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,353
You're doing this
to mess with us, right?

654
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:21,614
The guy robbed you.

655
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:23,243
Look, the theft of my briefcase

656
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,969
and the use of force
you used to apprehend him

657
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,479
are two separate events.

658
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,506
The wonderful thing about
our legal system is...

659
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:30,291
we both have rights.

660
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,151
Whoa.

661
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:34,443
What?

662
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,271
Captain took a shot to the face.

663
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:37,989
All right, all right. Show's over.

664
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:39,423
Everybody get back to work.

665
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,958
Thank you.

666
00:28:43,362 --> 00:28:44,608
Bad news?

667
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:47,618
Uh, no, I just got to get
these stats to the Chief.

668
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:50,518
You know, actually, um, do you
mind processing our friend

669
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:52,546
till I get this done,
and then we'll head back out?

670
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:54,859
Well, I'm fine if you need
to stay here, ma'am.

671
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:57,207
I've got plenty of paperwork
to do, so...

672
00:28:57,232 --> 00:28:58,887
I appreciate that, but...

673
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:01,045
I've made a practice of
finishing what I've started.

674
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:04,888
You need to go wait out in the bullpen.

675
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:07,818
- What happened?
- I ducked.

676
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,108
Oh, so he's your client now?

677
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:10,854
Until his regular
counsel shows up, yeah.

678
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:12,123
Is that a problem?

679
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:14,125
What's going on with
Lopez and that guy?

680
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:15,893
- Are you okay?
- It's been a weird day.

681
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:18,422
- You seem very stressed.
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:20,965
How you doing, Miller?

683
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:22,827
Can I get your walk-in reports?

684
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:24,574
I got to update the stat sheets.

685
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:27,291
I got a question.

686
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:28,855
Somebody will be with you
in just a minute.

687
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,296
I need some information
regarding prison sentencing.

688
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,672
What's your question?

689
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:36,488
How much prison time for a bar fight?

690
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,540
Depends on the severity
of the, uh, injuries

691
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,439
and your previous record.
Why are you asking?

692
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,966
Is murder really the only
guarantee for a life sentence?

693
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:48,426
Just get out?

694
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,858
Yeah, a couple weeks ago.

695
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,290
Let me guess.
You were in there a long time.

696
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,452
You having trouble, uh,
adjusting on the outside?

697
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:58,690
Nah.

698
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,639
I'm good. I'm good.

699
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:04,094
You walk into a police station
asking questions about murder,

700
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,609
you most certainly are not good.

701
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:07,424
I strongly advise you
not to do anything stupid.

702
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:09,160
Don't worry about it.

703
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:10,414
I know exactly what I'm doing.

704
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:11,947
Let me see your hands!

705
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:16,020
I kill her,

706
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:18,127
I go back inside forever.

707
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,667
He's got a gun!

708
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:22,980
- I'll kill her.
- All right.

709
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:25,047
Look at me. Hey, hey!

710
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,500
You don't want to do this.
You don't have to do this.

711
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:28,987
I told you.

712
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:30,972
I'll do anything to go back inside.

713
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,515
Trust me, you're going back in.

714
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:34,386
I'm not looking to do a short fall.

715
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:37,486
I can't handle it out here.

716
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,770
Okay. I get that, I get that.

717
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,485
You got a little too much freedom.

718
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,432
I felt the exact same way
after I left the Corps.

719
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,983
Used to being told where to go,

720
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:47,496
what to do, when to eat,
when to sleep. Come on.

721
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,199
She shouldn't have to suffer 'cause
you're going through a crisis.

722
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,597
She didn't sign up for that.
Put the gun down.

723
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:52,755
Bitch, I don't care
what she signed up for.

724
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:55,504
You pull that trigger, I got half a
dozen cops who are gonna light you up,

725
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,514
- and I know you don't want that.
- Shut up!

726
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:00,163
Okay. Okay.

727
00:31:01,155 --> 00:31:03,641
I just... I have one more...
one more question.

728
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,198
In your previous crimes, did you...

729
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:09,274
...use a gun?

730
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,632
What? Why?

731
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:14,462
You got your safety on.

732
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,449
- Get her!
- Come on, come on.

733
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:20,749
Get the gun.

734
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:22,132
I got it, Captain.

735
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:24,994
Turn him over!

736
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,969
- Holy crap.
- What?

737
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:29,371
It's a Glock.
There's no external safety.

738
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:31,573
You charged a live weapon.

739
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,499
Told you Captain could
take care of herself.

740
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:36,861
What the hell happened here?

741
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,112
Oh, my...

742
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,550
Um, did you get skunked?

743
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:45,827
I don't know what to do.

744
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:48,129
You should've seen
the look on his face.

745
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:50,940
Trust me. I saw a version
of it in my office.

746
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:53,326
At least your daughter has
lived with this her whole life.

747
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:56,461
I mean, I just threw Henry
into the deep end. I had no...

748
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,659
I never thought once about how
my choice was gonna affect him.

749
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:02,744
It was so much easier
when she was younger.

750
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:05,355
Tell me about it.

751
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:08,950
Let this be our one and only

752
00:32:08,984 --> 00:32:11,463
heart-to-heart moment, Officer Nolan.

753
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:12,923
John.

754
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:16,290
Officer Nolan is fine.

755
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,192
Yeah.

756
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,973
What the hell was that?

757
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,277
7-Adam-15, explosion on Walton

758
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:25,746
between 29th and 30th.

759
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:28,274
Need backup, airship, RA, LAFD.

760
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:29,502
Send the works.

761
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:42,850
- That's gas.
- Looks like the main's blown.

762
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:44,751
Probably venting into that house.

763
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,413
You all right?

764
00:32:46,454 --> 00:32:47,955
Is there anybody left inside?

765
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:50,761
- Yeah.
- Sir.

766
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,803
Hey, Nolan, without a mask,

767
00:32:52,828 --> 00:32:54,498
you won't make it 10 steps.

768
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:56,964
You okay? You got him? Thank you.

769
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,326
- Give me one.
- What would your wife say?

770
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:07,975
Man, give me the damn rag!

771
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:17,244
Check upstairs.

772
00:33:21,014 --> 00:33:22,702
Is anyone here?

773
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:42,677
I got her. I got her.

774
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,282
- Is that everyone?
- I don't think so.

775
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:48,544
I saw two backpacks in there.
Wait here.

776
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:52,331
Let's go.

777
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:28,158
Here you go.

778
00:34:36,431 --> 00:34:38,132
The other police officer,
did he come out?

779
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,300
No.

780
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:40,684
- No, he didn't.
- No, Officer.

781
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:51,028
Grey?

782
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:58,382
Grey. Grey!

783
00:34:58,468 --> 00:35:00,688
Come on, man. You've got to wake up.

784
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:10,514
Come on, Grey.

785
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:12,104
Grey!

786
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,473
It got real important
that you get up, buddy!

787
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:15,839
Grey!

788
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:22,054
Come on.

789
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:23,789
Come on.

790
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:27,626
Come on. Come on.

791
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:45,239
Oh, man.

792
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:53,506
Let me guess. You have another
complaint you'd like to file.

793
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:56,255
No more complaints. I promise.

794
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:58,535
Look, I graduated
from Whittier Law School.

795
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:01,037
Night classes, paid my own way.

796
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,995
Needless to say,
there was never gonna be

797
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:05,535
a-a fancy downtown firm
at the end of that rainbow.

798
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:07,577
This feels like another thing
you're trying to blame on me.

799
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,768
Not at all.
No, I like renting an office

800
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:11,756
above an Ethiopian restaurant.

801
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,576
Look, I'm scrappy, okay?

802
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,808
I really love representing
the little guy.

803
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,676
But...

804
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,845
today, my tenacity...

805
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:22,480
- it clouded my judgment.
- Are you trying to argue an apology?

806
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:23,996
No. I'm sorry.

807
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:25,276
You were trying to help me,

808
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:26,723
even though you really didn't want to,

809
00:36:26,763 --> 00:36:29,021
and I appreciate that.

810
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,008
So thank you for getting
my briefcase back.

811
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:34,994
You're welcome.

812
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,196
And I'd like to take you to dinner.

813
00:36:37,337 --> 00:36:38,765
Let me guess... Ethiopian?

814
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:40,465
God, no, that place is a dump.

815
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,792
Do you own a nice suit?

816
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,208
No, a <i>nice</i> suit.

817
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,346
Yeah. Why?

818
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:54,628
I need a date for my brother's
wedding next Saturday.

819
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,165
It's bold for a first date.

820
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,751
Yeah.

821
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,893
Maybe it should be our second.

822
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,154
Buy me a drink?

823
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,603
- I would love to.
- All right.

824
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:08,069
You sure you're feeling okay?

825
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:09,750
Yeah, yeah.

826
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:11,997
But maybe you can help me explain

827
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:14,199
- what happened to your mother.
- Yeah.

828
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,361
But we should probably stop
for flowers on the way home.

829
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:17,876
I'm driving.

830
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,526
And your Macrobiology grade?

831
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:24,441
Definitely should save that
conversation for another day.

832
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:37,551
- Hey.
- I'm not talking to you.

833
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:39,471
I shouldn't have left you.

834
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:44,482
Yeah. You should have.

835
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:47,626
- I was an ass.
- Yeah, you were.

836
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:51,355
Go on.

837
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:57,440
I-I still see you as
the rookie I trained.

838
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:59,712
But you're not that anymore.

839
00:37:59,922 --> 00:38:02,363
You're gonna be one kick-ass detective.

840
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,022
Thanks.

841
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,795
But I'm gonna take a beat
on that last part.

842
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,889
Since when? You... You got the <i>Tap.</i>

843
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,842
Yeah, I know. I just... I...

844
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:13,457
I'm not ready to give up patrol yet.

845
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:16,862
And I still have things
I want to accomplish as a P3.

846
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:20,108
- And a rookie to train.
- And you'll miss the streets.

847
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,668
Yeah, maybe I will.

848
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:26,905
Don't tell me I just passed

849
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,108
some ridiculous Tim Bradford test.

850
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,710
I won't.

851
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:33,441
But you did.

852
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:35,567
Hey.

853
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,922
Tomato juice.

854
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:39,785
You still smell really, really bad.

855
00:38:57,856 --> 00:38:59,972
Hey. Is this a bad time?

856
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,554
No. Come in.

857
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,145
I just wanted to say I really enjoyed

858
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,846
riding patrol with you today.

859
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:09,336
I learned a lot,

860
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,890
And it wasn't just about police work.

861
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:15,710
Um, I'm really sorry if I let you down.

862
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,456
Officer Chen,

863
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,458
you know why I chose
to ride with you today?

864
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,160
No, ma'am.

865
00:39:23,323 --> 00:39:25,598
Because you impress me.

866
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,366
Don't get me wrong.

867
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,363
You've got a lot to learn.

868
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:32,304
But I'm proud to have you
under my command.

869
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:34,006
And I'd ride with you any day.

870
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,761
I love my job.

871
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,354
I mean, I truly love my job,

872
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:53,822
and I believe in what I'm doing.

873
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:57,839
Henry, I love you more, and
if you can't handle my job...

874
00:39:57,864 --> 00:39:59,779
Dad, stop.

875
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:03,035
I would never ask you
to walk away from this.

876
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:06,081
I'm not asking for specifics, but...

877
00:40:06,388 --> 00:40:09,076
I need to know you're okay.

878
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:12,233
And the son becomes the father.

879
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,039
We're like a real-life
Cat Stevens song.

880
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,016
Before your time.

881
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:20,018
How 'bout this?

882
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:21,553
At the end of every shift,

883
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,189
I send you a text
to let you know I'm okay.

884
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:26,291
So like a-a safe word.

885
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:27,433
Exactly.

886
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,528
No. Wait.

887
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,965
How do you know about safe words?

888
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,264
Hm. You really want to know?

889
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:34,800
No. Abort.

890
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:37,306
All right, then, what's
our word gonna be?

891
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,123
Turducken.

892
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,903
Perfect.

893
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:46,338
Oh, man.

894
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,939
That poor cat.

895
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:51,940
