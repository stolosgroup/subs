<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

3
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:07,494
It's time to play the
Training Officer match game.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,678
Officer Bradford, you get Lucy Chen.

5

Officer Lopez, Jackson West.

6
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:14,683
Officer Bishop, you get John Nolan...

7
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:16,157
...the 40-year-old rookie.

8
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:17,886
I've been trying to find you.

9
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:19,360
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

10
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,518
That was my wife.

11
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,190
I haven't seen her in almost a year.

12
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:24,327
Show me those hands. Now!

13
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:27,281
You're a pain in my ass.

14
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:28,416
That's my job.

15
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,984
Get out your gun and cover me!

16
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,323
Officer West,
you didn't fire a single shot.

17
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:34,414
It won't happen again.

18
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:35,606

Yeah, sure it is. Just not to you.

35
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:00,226
Honestly, who steals stolen
money right in front of a cop?

36
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,747
Somebody stupid or desperate.

37
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:04,869
- I thought we were here to run.
- Oh, yes, we are.

We just need a little
more warm-up than you do.

- You look great, though.
- Yeah.

- Okay, you think you're cute...
- Mm-hmm.

...but the job's a marathon.

I should have prepared myself
somehow for the abuse to come.

You saved the guy's life.

He's got to cut you some slack.

51

Does Talia ever cut you slack

52
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:33,946
or Sergeant Grey?

53
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,629
- It's been good knowing you.
- Uh-huh.

54
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,917
It's time to run, Officer Nolan.

55
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,130
- Let's go.
- Oh!

56
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,425
Be right there. I'm just
gonna stretch a little more.

57
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,766
So, how you feeling?

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,987
Good.

59
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,487
Everything okay with my green slip?

60
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:53,876
Yeah. Yeah, you're medically
cleared to return to duty.

61
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:57,470
Which means it's time for the
"so you got shot" speech.

62
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:00,473
I only give it to officers
wounded on the job.

63
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:02,044
Lucky me.

64
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:03,335
Yeah, lucky you.

65
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,178
So, you came in this morning

66
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,580
thinking everything goes
back to normal now,

67
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,349
you can just flip a switch,

68
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:14,153
and the trauma you
suffered will go away.

69
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,513
It won't.

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,256
But you're trying to
muscle your way through.

71
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,970
That's what I did.

72
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,106
Trust me, it didn't go well.

73
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,930
I didn't know you got shot.

74
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:26,098
My last year on patrol.

75
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,101
Spent two weeks in the ICU.

76
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:31,603
Rushed back thinking I could
put it all behind me,

77
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,432
but it doesn't work that way.

78
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:36,509
I understand.

79
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,011
I promise I'll... I'll take it slow.

80
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,846
Okay.

81
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:03,569
All right, all right, all right.

82
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,538
Settle down. Settle down.

83
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:07,473
Let's get to it.

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,242
You ready, Officer Nolan?

85
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:11,377
'Cause once again, we start with you.

86
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,604
I'm flattered?

87
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,034
Don't be.

88
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:18,413
Yesterday, a four-man
crew disguised as zombies

89
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:22,648
knocked over a cash advance
near Pico and Robertson.

90
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,874
So, Officers Bishop and Nolan
were able to apprehend

91
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,227
two of the criminals, while
the other two escaped.

92
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,487
Somehow, Officer Nolan managed to let

93
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:32,999
a civilian steal 10 grand
in already stolen cash.

94
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,794
Luckily, CCTV captured our thief.

95
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,409
Still waiting on an I.D.

96
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,238
Uh, he plays guitar, if that helps.

97
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,473
Absolutely.

98
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:43,576
'Cause they always list special
talents on your rap sheet.

99
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,581
Captain. How can we help you?

100
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,050
First off, I wanted to
welcome Tim Bradford back.

101
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,478
If you need anything, you let me know.

102
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:53,558
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,528
Secondly, we just got some
new intel on our zombies.

104
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:57,967
Turns out that they're responsible

105
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,059
for a rash of armed robberies
in the last six months,

106
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,594
always disguised differently.

107
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,375
Detectives
want to get the two in custody

108
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,792
to flip on their partners at large,

109
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:08,429
but there is no guarantee,
so don't stop hunting.

110
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,652
Finally, we got a request
for a civil standby.

111
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:14,140
Turns out somebody's getting
fired from a tech job.

112
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,469
Supervisor's
worried things may not go right.

113
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,944
Babysitting a termination...

114
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,448
a patrol officer's favorite assignment.

115
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,542
So, who shall I bless with it?

116
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,541
Officer Nolan, are you volunteering?

117
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,457
Just embracing the inevitable, sir.

118
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,861
Smart man.

119
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:34,527
Get the address from dispatch.

120
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,975
That's it.

121
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,427
You sure you don't want me to drive?

122
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:43,769
Why would I want that, Boot?

123
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,316
You think I'd go back on duty

124
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,348
- before I'm 100 percent?
- No, sir.

125
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,475
Or do you think simply doing
your job during a firefight

126
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,344
- means you get special treatment?
- No, sir.

127
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,779
You'll drive when you've earned it.

128
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,227
Yes, sir.

129
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,092
It's good to have you back.

130
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,898
Damn straight.

131
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,068
How could you possibly know
he was gonna take the money?

132
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,575
Because everyone's an opportunist.

133
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:07,026
A guy who plays the guitar for change...

134
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,699
he sees a bag of money,
he's gonna steal it

135
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:09,995
10 times out of 10.

136
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,507
See, your problem is that
you think that people

137
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,198
are inherently good, but you're wrong.

138
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:15,752
People are good when it's easy.

139
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:18,604
When push comes to shove,
everyone crosses the line.

140
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:19,952
Wow.

141
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:22,006
I must have missed that chapter
in Gandhi's biography.

142
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,165
Yeah, well, until Gandhi
shows up on Western Avenue,

143
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,621
assume that everyone you
meet is one bad day away

144
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:27,712
from committing a crime.

145
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,348
Understood.

146
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:31,758
But, you know, Gandhi is dead.

147
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,182
- Good morning.
- Morning.

148
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:39,711
Doing some renovating?

149
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:42,044
I just took my kitchen
down to the studs.

150
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,355
Big job.

151
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:44,981
What did your contractor estimate...
two months?

152
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,298
Uh, four.

153
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,566
He's lying.

154
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,535
Longest it ever took me was three,

155
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,570
and that was because the
appliances were on back order.

156
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,739
You tell him he doesn't
beat his estimate,

157
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:55,641
he's gonna get a call from the LAPD.

158
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,430
I will.

159
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,545
- Thank you.
- You bet.

160
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,537
Officers. I thought you'd
be here 20 minutes ago.

161
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,053
And Nancy's with you.
We'll make this quick.

162
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,756
Wait. What's going on?

163
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,779
I think you're getting fired.

164
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,365
Oh, thank God you guys are here.

165
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,897
He's trapped in there.

166
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:22,332
In where? The bank?

167
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,588
No. In the wall.

168
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,739
Mike went inside to fix an ATM
last night before we closed,

169
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,842
and we forgot he was in there and left.

170
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:32,178
The lock must have broke when
he tried to come back out,

171
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:34,493
and he's been inside all night.

172
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,245
Pushed this
note through the receipt slot

173
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,736
when he heard us come in.

174
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,665
Control, 7-Adam-19 requesting LAFD

175
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:50,106
to 3301 Ditmer. for a
guy trapped in a wall.

176
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:53,275
Sir, we're gonna get you out of there.

177
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,402
Sir, can you hear me?

178
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:03,442
What's that supposed to mean?

179
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:05,261
Hypoxia. Go grab the
halligan out of the trunk.

180
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,735
We can't wait for the fire department.

181
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:09,243
Sir, I need you to get low
so I can open this wall up.

182
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,666
How tall is the space behind the ATM?

183
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,677
Oh, I don't know. It's
pretty cramped in there.

184
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:14,413
About five feet.

185
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:28,887
Why am I doing this?

186
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,722
Boot, get in there.

187
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,816
Sir, are you all right?

188
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,660
Just to be clear, Mrs. Wu,
you are not under arrest.

189
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:56,574
But your former employer has indicated

190
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,294
that you are no longer
welcome back on premise.

191
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,895
Why the hell would I
want to come back here?

192
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,426
Look, I've been where you are.

193
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:03,662
I know how this feels. It's horrible.

194
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,180
But it can actually be an opportunity...

195
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:06,607
All right, save the friendly act

196
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,779
for the next person you strong-arm.

197
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:13,712
You do know that you're a
cop, not a moving company.

198
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,234
We were going the same way. I
had an extra pair of hands.

199
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,854
Exactly... hands you would have needed

200
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,114
if the situation went south.

201
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,742
There's a reason her
boss wanted us here.

202
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:22,143
Yeah, but I'm not seeing it.

203
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,795
There's no harm in just giving someone

204
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,217
the benefit of the doubt.

205
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,295
How does that feel, Chad?!

206
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:30,986
Stupid idiot!

207
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,982
Or...

208
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:34,150
Hey! Ma'am!

209
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,365
- Ms. Wu! Ms. Wu!
- Stupid...

210
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:38,404
<i>7-Adam-07, silent
alarm tripped at Chili John's.</i>

211
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,347
You think it's actually
a crime in progress?

212
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,813
9 times out of 10, a silent
alarm is tripped accidentally,

213
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,670
but you always treat it like it's real.

214
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,215
Put the money in the damn bag!

215
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:51,584
Put the money in the damn bag!

216
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:53,689
Are you crazy?! Hurry up! Hurry up!

217
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:54,784
- Put the money in the damn bag!
- 7-Adam-7,

218
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:55,965
we have a 2-11 in
progress at our location.

219
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,044
Requesting backup.

220
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,152
- Do we go in?
- Put it in the bag!

221
00:09:58,176 --> 00:09:59,354
No. That'll just escalate things.

222
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,946
- Come on!
- We'll grab her on the way out.

223
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,735
Police! Drop your weapon!

224
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:05,930
Stop! Stop!

225
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,644
It's plastic.

226
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,033
Stop!

227
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,785
Aah!

228
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:21,105
Sue Cliffords?

229
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,664
- Do I know you?
- You know her?

230
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:24,235
She played ball for the Trojans.

231
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,445
Best 3-point shooter in the NCAA.

232
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,692
Nice to meet a fan.

233
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,935
Let me guess. You're
waiting for the perfect moment

234
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,033
to say "I told you so."

235
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,530
I get no pleasure in being
right, Officer Nolan.

236
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,902
Okay. I get a little.

237
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,070
But were you right? I mean, just because

238
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,190
she snapped in the moment,

239
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:41,490
that doesn't make her a bad person.

240
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,649
The "why" doesn't matter.

241
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,710
Our job is not to
weigh a citizen's morality.

242
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:46,987
It's to enforce the law.

243
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,113
And when push came to
shove, she broke it.

244
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,193
<i>7-Adam-15, we have an I.D.</i>

245
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,715
<i>on your guitar-playing train thief.</i>

246
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,674
<i>Suspect identified as Roman Ealy.</i>

247
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:56,425
<i>617 South Cleaver Avenue.</i>

248
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,018
7-Adam-15. Reattach us to 2-11.

249
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:01,395
Show us en route.

250
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,895
Wow. 20 points a game, huh?

251
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:05,921
You were no joke.

252
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:07,382
So, what happened?

253
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,841
I thought you got an offer
to play for the WNBA.

254
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,737
Blew out my knee senior
year, lost my scholarship.

255
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:14,593
And now you commit armed robbery?

256
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,636
What else am I qualified to do?

257
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:19,668
You know, I met you
once at a party at USC.

258
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,385
You were so passionate
about playing ball,

259
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,712
and I was so not about
majoring in engineering.

260
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,346
Got me thinking about
going a different way,

261
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,673
and, well, here I am.

262
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,239
How nice for you.

263
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,331
You ever think about
doing something else?

264
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,651
Hell, no.

265
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,784
Being a cop is the only
thing I ever wanted.

266
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,681
Sure. But things don't
always go your way.

267
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,812
You got to have a Plan "B" just in case.

268
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,552
One out of three rookies washes out,

269
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,322
so odds are either you, Chen, or Nolan

270
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,128
won't be here in a year.

271
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:47,372
I thought you were a sure
bet to succeed at first,

272
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:49,804
but those other two are rocking it,

273
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,095
and you stumbled out the gate.

274
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:54,830
That was a one-time thing.

275
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,314
I have a long career ahead of me.

276
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,071
Yeah, that's what I thought.

277
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:01,807
7-Adam-15, Code 6 on our train thief.

278
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,326
LAPD! Open up!

279
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,014
Sir, I can see you in there!

280
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,583
Do not make me break this door down!

281
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,809
Yeah. I-I'm sorry.

282
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,625
I'm so sorry.

283
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:16,295
Now, put your hands
where I can see them.

284
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,015
Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

285
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:23,294
Sir, where is the money?

286
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:25,254
I swear I was gonna return it.

287
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:27,372
It... I... It, um...

288
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,113
Did you spend any of it?

289
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,430
I-I-I bought some groceries,

290
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:41,257
and I had the water turned back on.

291
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,528
I-I'm sorry. I-I'll pay it back.

292
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:47,095
I just... It's been so hard.

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,801
My wife died last year...

294
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:51,166
Sir, put your hands behind your back.

295
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,246
No, pl... please.

296
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,038
I-I've never even gotten
a parking ticket before.

297
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:56,676
- Can't I do something? I'll...
- Daddy?

298
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:58,582
Jacob, go back to your room, buddy.

299
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,582
It's okay. He can come out.

300
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,543
Okay, come here.

301
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,147
Well, what's gonna happen to him?

302
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,216
Child Protective Services will take him.

303
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,596
If you have any family in the area,

304
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,138
then they can pick him up later.

305
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:13,535
Uh, yeah, my... my wife's sister,

306
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,893
she lives in Chatsworth.

307
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:18,410
We'll take her info, make
sure CPS gets in touch.

308
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:21,793
But for now you're gonna
need to come with me.

309
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:25,299
Best I can do is make sure your
son doesn't see you in cuffs.

310
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:27,011
- Please...
- I'm sorry,

311
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,646
but you need to say goodbye.

312
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:31,783
Okay. All right.

313
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,970
Hey, hey, bud,

314
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,945
I got to leave for a little bit, okay?

315
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,131
You're gonna stay with Aunt Judy.

316
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:41,141
I'm gonna see you real soon, okay?

317
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,713
I promise.

318
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:44,893
I love you.

319
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,522
Sir, you need to come with me now.

320
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,295
- Daddy!
- Oh, okay.

321
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,613
- Daddy!
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

322
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,144
- Daddy!
- No, no, it's o... it's okay.

323
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:06,712
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

324
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,064
Daddy!

325
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,456
- Daddy!
- What did I do? I've ruined everything.

326
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,459
Daddy!

327
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,983
You okay?

328
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,313
Of course.

329
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:25,853
Does that ever get any easier...

330
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,779
taking a parent away from their kid?

331
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:29,341
No.

332
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,054
But feeling bad for the guy
doesn't change what he did.

333
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:35,003
Still, poor kid.

334
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,850
Call your insurance
company about your property.

335
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,092
We'll file the report, but the fact is,

336
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,276
most cold burglaries stay cold.

337
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,051
You think of anything else,
my number's right there.

338
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,939
Hey, I'm just gonna hit the restroom.

339
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:54,523
Make it fast, Boot.

340
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:18,280
No, no, no, no!

341
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,759
Hey, did anyone run out here?

342
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,431
What?

343
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,064
Someone took my belt and gun.

344
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,270
I hung it on the hook, and I
secured the bathroom beforehand.

345
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,417
There was no one else in there.

346
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,589
Did the walls of the stall
reach top to bottom?

347
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,132
- No, sir.
- Then it wasn't secure, was it, Boot?

348
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,014
Now your weapon is on the street

349
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,319
because you couldn't hold your water.

350
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,609
Bradford.

351
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:50,612
When?

352
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,189
I-I'll be right there.

353
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:55,351
Get in.

354
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,678
What about my belt?

355
00:15:58,695 --> 00:15:59,983
Get in.

356
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,911
What... What's happening?
Where are we going?

357
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,862
Emergency room.

358
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:14,790
Oh, that was awesome! Dude, do it again!

359
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,245
Whoo!

360
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,705
These fools are the last thing
I want to deal with right now.

361
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,783
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

362
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,091
We're filming stunts for
our YouTube channel.

363
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:29,991
Logan's brother did
it and made hella cash.

364
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,260
That's not illegal, right?

365
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,949
Making hella cash? No.
But reckless driving is.

366
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:35,891
<i>- Yo!
- How the hell...</i>

367
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,710
<i>Yo, this is Officer PootyPoot
sending a special shout-out</i>

368
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:40,185
to all the single ladies out...

369
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,044
Hey! Get out the car now!

370
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:44,279
Step out!

371
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,453
Hands on the hood!

372
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:51,713
How did you get in there?
The doors were locked.

373
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,434
The passenger side wasn't.

374
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:03,198
Stay here.

375
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,608
Yeah, I'm looking for my
wife, Isabel Bradford.

376
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:08,161
Ugh.

377
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,036
Isabel.

378
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:11,724
I'm fine, all right? They
shouldn't have called you.

379
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,651
Where the hell are you going?
You just O.D.'d.

380
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:15,506
I'm fine. They can't hold me.

381
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,012
- Let go.
- Stop.

382
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:18,546
Stop.

383
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,480
Do you know how many dead
junkies I've rolled up on

384
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:23,746
in the last month?

385
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,820
Seized up, blue-lipped, all alone

386
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,552
because their buddies
didn't want to get caught

387
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:30,045
- when the cops showed up?
- I said I'm fine.

388
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,772
You don't want to come home!

389
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,840
Okay. I understand.

390
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,601
But if you keep doing this,
you are going to die!

391
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,914
Save the tough love for someone else.

392
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:40,992
I am not your responsibility anymore,

393
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,751
so you do not get to have an opinion

394
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,275
about how I live my life.

395
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,336
So please stop trying
to be my white knight,

396
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,211
and leave me alone!

397
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:56,619
Aah.

398
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:02,354
Are you okay?

399
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:10,229
It's a tragedy.

400
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,868
See, I was at the game where
Cliffords blew out her knee.

401
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,017
You could see it in her face.
She knew her career was over.

402
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,842
And she didn't have a Plan "B."

403
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,040
Always got to have a
Plan "B" starting out.

404
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:21,964
- That's what I told the Boot.
- Yeah.

405
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:24,179
Sir, with all due respect,

406
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,708
this has been my Plan "A"
since I was in diapers.

407
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,710
There's no way I don't see it through.

408
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,189
It's not always about you, Officer West.

409
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,903
This is a job where anything
can happen at any moment.

410
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,258
If that bullet hits Officer Bradford

411
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,234
six inches to the right,
he's paralyzed or worse.

412
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,511
Having a Plan "B" doesn't
mean you're not committed.

413
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,566
It means you're a realist.

414
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,919
7-Adam-19,

415
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,351
<i>report of a biker gang,</i>

416
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,111
<i>drunk and disorderly
at The Hard Road bar.</i>

417
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:56,391
Are you okay to do this?

418
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,294
We can ask for another
unit to be assigned.

419
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,048
No. I'm fine.

420
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,669
How do you identify a
motorcycle club, Boot?

421
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:07,822
Uh, the three rockers on the
back of their jackets...

422
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,957
they show gang name, logo,
and state of origin.

423
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,894
"Dead Bastards MC."

424
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:15,282
And which one of these guys
is the most dangerous?

425
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,394
See them? Those are Prospects.

426
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:19,804
They haven't earned
their top rocker yet,

427
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,028
and there's only one way to get it...

428
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,986
commit a felony in view
of another gang member,

429
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,311
which means what?

430
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,799
Somebody's gonna fight us
when we get out of this car.

431
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,042
Exactly.

432
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,484
Shouldn't we call for backup, then?

433
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,253
Where's the fun in that?

434
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,818
Now, that's just sad.

435
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,063
Either you're man enough
to come at me or you're not.

436
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,625
Now, who needs a felony?

437
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:44,780
What are you doing?

438
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:46,073
Look, I'm not gonna repeat myself.

439
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,581
This is a one-time offer,
and it's about to expire.

440
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,782
You beat me, I won't even book you.

441
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:54,369
I beat you, you go to jail, and
your buddies hit the road.

442
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,592
Come on, Jordan. You got this.

443
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:06,928
Come on!

444
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,324
♪ Ooh ohh ohh

445
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:21,717
Ohh!

446
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,218
Let's go!

447
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,349
- Let's go!
- You lost!

448
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,296
Let him go! Yeah, pig.

449
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:35,731
- Let's go.
- Come on, man!

450
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,301
It was a fair fight!

451
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:42,223
7-Adam-19, type change this
event to a felony assault,

452
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,649
one in custody.

453
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,885
- What the hell was that?
- Good work, Jordy!

454
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,521
Patrol work, Boot.

455
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,217
You planning on saying otherwise?

456
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,636
No, sir.

457
00:20:58,567 --> 00:20:59,634
Heard you were looking for me.

458
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:01,127
Yeah.

459
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,352
Buddy in Beverly Hills PD just called.

460
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:05,102
The other two
members of that heist crew

461
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:07,227
knocked over a jewelers
on Cannon at lunchtime

462
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:09,353
dressed as werewolves, shot a guard,

463
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:10,519
made off with eight grand.

464
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, I've got news
on the two we have in custody.

465
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,937
Detectives executed a search warrant

466
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:16,296
on the zombies' apartment.

467
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,219
They found souvenirs from
robberies they committed

468
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,211
with the crew last year
in Dallas and Phoenix.

469
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:21,885
- So they move around.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,858
And with their partners on ice here,

471
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:26,052
I bet you they are ready
to get out of Dodge.

472
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:27,428
I'll alert patrol units.

473
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:28,898
We got to find these guys.

474
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:30,698
Mm-hmm. Do that.

475
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,991
So, how do you want
to write this one up?

476
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,275
Carefully.

477
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:41,448
Grey's a stickler for proper procedure.

478
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,884
Well, if it isn't Officer PootyPoot.

479
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:49,677
Please come in.

480
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:52,958
Put them on the bench. You, with me.

481
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:56,855
Officer Nolan,

482
00:21:57,553 --> 00:21:59,687
leaving a police vehicle unlocked

483
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:02,440
so that your suspect
can give a shout-out

484
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:04,463
over the shop radio

485
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,600
is cause for discipline.

486
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,860
Carelessness like that will
not be tolerated here.

487
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:11,141
- Do you understand me?
- Understood, sir.

488
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,975
Now, what's gonna happen next...

489
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,335
Sir...

490
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,997
I left my door unlocked.

491
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,652
It wasn't Nolan.

492
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:22,912
My office. Now.

493
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,426
Get him processed.

494
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,074
W-What about the booking approval?

495
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:35,930
You made this arrest.

496
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,932
You saw what happened.

497
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,234
Write it up, Boot.

498
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:42,397
I'm gonna take any jewelry you have,

499
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,523
any piercings, anything in your pockets,

500
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,296
your socks, your shoes,
you're gonna give them to me.

501
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:50,938
Can I talk to you?

502
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,676
- I'm worried about Tim.
- Why?

503
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:58,830
He instigated a fight with a biker,

504
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,063
wouldn't let me call for backup,

505
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,029
could have gotten both of us killed.

506
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,533
I think he's spinning
out, trying to prove himself.

507
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:07,171
You think he came back too soon?

508
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:08,505
Maybe.

509
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:09,767
He got hit with a lot of

510
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,477
personal stuff on top of it, too,

511
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,158
and he's not handling it well.

512
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,514
Clearly you have to do something.

513
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,580
Yeah, but what? Tim is my T.O.

514
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,300
I'm not gonna narc on him.

515
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,147
Then you're gonna have to talk to him.

516
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,467
Oh...

517
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:29,517
It's not gonna go well.

518
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,251
What other choice do you have?

519
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:36,224
Six doses of NARCAN.

520
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:37,752
Throwing quite a party, huh?

521
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,534
Hey. Biker's processed.

522
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,571
Do we really need all that?

523
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,539
Look, there's a bad batch of fentanyl

524
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:46,103
making the rounds out there.

525
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:48,457
Miller went through his entire
overdose kit in two days.

526
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:52,789
You gonna tell me. how it
went with Sergeant Grey?

527
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:55,031
He put me on undocumented
oral counseling.

528
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:57,888
- For leaving a door unlocked?
- I deserve it. I lost focus.

529
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,552
But at least it's not on my record.

530
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,800
Look, I appreciate you
trying to cover for me.

531
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:02,839
No problem.

532
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,064
But it doesn't mean you're right
about how you see people, though.

533
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:07,161
You think I did that to
try and prove a point?

534
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:09,406
Trust me, I'm no Gandhi.

535
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:10,776
I just don't think someone's
life should be ruined

536
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,160
because of one bad day.

537
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:15,695
You're my partner...
my training officer...

538
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,792
and I've got your back,
even if you think

539
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:20,590
I'm one bad lunch order
away from a life of crime.

540
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:23,318
I saw you rolling your eyes.

541
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,346
7-Adam-19, show us Code 6,

542
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,325
Florence and Central Avenue.

543
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,200
Stay here.

544
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:46,854
You deaf, Boot? I said stay in the car.

545
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,930
You're not helping her.
You're enabling her.

546
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,104
You know this because
you're some shrink's kid?

547
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:54,221
She's gonna shoot up, okay?
That's the reality.

548
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,595
This will save her life.

549
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:57,531
Addiction doesn't just
destroy the addict.

550
00:24:57,556 --> 00:24:58,780
It destroys the family, too.

551
00:24:58,804 --> 00:24:59,877
Who the hell are you to tell me this?

552
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:02,498
- You think I don't know?
- I'm your rookie.

553
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:04,721
And I need you to train
me, not put me in danger

554
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:06,747
because you can't handle
losing your wife.

555
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,852
Look, at least let me go up.

556
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:18,671
If you do, it'll just
confirm your worst fears.

557
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,871
Do you really want to
see how she's living

558
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,782
or who she's living with?

559
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:29,426
Paramedics said it's apartment 510.

560
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,753
Isabel, just...

561
00:25:45,787 --> 00:25:46,988
- Wait. Wait.
- Go away.

562
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:48,856
Y-You can't come in without a warrant.

563
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,992
My name is Officer Lucy Chen.

564
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,960
Tim Bradford's my T.O.

565
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,427
He's downstairs.

566
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:55,640
If you don't give me five minutes,

567
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,931
he's gonna come up here
and break this door down.

568
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:09,477
So, what do you want?

569
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:12,503
Do you know

570
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,044
your husband was shot recently?

571
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,789
We got ambushed.

572
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:18,119
He took a bullet while returning fire.

573
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:19,360
That's what you're doing here?

574
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:20,752
'Cause he seems fine.

575
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,594
Um... it's NARCAN.

576
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:28,175
It won't get you clean,

577
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,305
just reverse the effects of an O.D.

578
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,240
I know what NARCAN is.

579
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:35,600
Spent a decade bringing junkies
back from the dead with it.

580
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:38,135
- You were a nurse?
- No. A cop.

581
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,596
Narcotics.

582
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:40,891
He didn't tell you?

583
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:47,183
He doesn't really talk about you. I...

584
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,392
That's good.

585
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,946
So, you guys were on the force together?

586
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:54,227
Different divisions.

587
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:57,024
I, uh... I worked out of the 77th,

588
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:00,094
volunteered for undercover
as soon as I could.

589
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:02,052
Tim was happy on patrol, so...

590
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:04,213
we synched our shifts as best we could.

591
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,607
It was perfect... till it wasn't.

592
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:08,930
So, anyway...

593
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,689
Uh...

594
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:18,713
Hey, um, he really got shot?

595
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:21,483
Yeah.

596
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:23,731
Yeah. It was scary.

597
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,271
Don't let him come back here.

598
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:30,824
There's no future here.

599
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,118
She was a cop.

600
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:24,237
I-I, uh, thought. she
was having an affair.

601
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:28,927
Staying out late, making excuses.

602
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,497
I didn't realize it was the drugs

603
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:34,665
until the hook was in deep.

604
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,670
Her apartment is pretty decent.

605
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:52,095
Thanks.

606
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:03,515
You could be a nurse or get into I.T.

607
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,517
There's always clown college.

608
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,193
Look, I don't need a Plan "B,"

609
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:08,949
and if I did, it wouldn't
be from some pamphlet

610
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:10,296
you grabbed off the community board.

611
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:12,698
How do you think I got
the idea for the LAPD?

612
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,756
Lopez, West, the zombie robbers

613
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:15,881
just flipped on their partners.

614
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,169
SWAT's hitting the house.

615
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:18,638
We're providing tactical support.

616
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,717
Meet in the bullpen in five.

617
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,837
All right, let's get started.

618
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,212
Our targets
are Steve Bower, Kai De Vera.

619
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:27,793
Bit of an odd couple.

620
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:30,748
Bower's known for
at least six hard-core 2-11s,

621
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:33,052
a lot of collateral damage in his wake.

622
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,470
De Vera did two tours as a
door gunner on a Black Hawk,

623
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:37,960
was under the radar till she hooked up

624
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,360
with Bower about a year ago.

625
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:41,953
Remember, if anything,
she's far more dangerous than he is.

626
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,170
Sergeant Laubacher will be
giving you the briefing.

627
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:46,499
He's in charge of tonight's
operation, so listen up.

628
00:29:46,803 --> 00:29:48,401
Thank you, Captain.

629
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,404
Targets are at a house in the
hills over the Sunset Strip.

630
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:54,241
Ingress is limited, so
we'll be coming in hot.

631
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:56,505
Team one will be primary entry,

632
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:58,444
deploying flash bangs
and breaching tools.

633
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:02,312
Team two... break and
rake the back glass door.

634
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:05,248
Tactical support.
..you're outer perimeter.

635
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:07,229
Sergeant Grey has your positions.

636
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:09,588
We'll go through detailed
assignments on the drive in.

637
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:11,757
My team, let's go.

638
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:13,144
Get to it.

639
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:15,301
All right.

640
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,300
See, we could do this whole
thing in five minutes

641
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:19,122
without flash bangs and BearCats,

642
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:21,610
but SWAT has us on guard duty,

643
00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:24,376
so make sure they take it seriously.

644
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:27,031
I don't want to be embarrassed
at the next Special Ops picnic.

645
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:29,117
- Yes, sir.
- We won't let you down, Sergeant.

646
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,167
Is there really a Special Ops picnic?

647
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,643
I didn't think so.

648
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,807
Sucks we have to be down here.

649
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,091
Yeah, well, get used to it.

650
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:54,564
Patrol is lowest on the totem pole

651
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,049
when it comes to operations like this.

652
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:58,424
Perimeter watch is a necessary
part of police work.

653
00:30:58,452 --> 00:30:59,652
It's nothing to look down on.

654
00:30:59,677 --> 00:31:00,940
- Is he for real?
- Yep.

655
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,308
Doesn't have a Plan "B," though.

656
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:04,310
What? Well, that's just crazy.

657
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,278
I've been dealing with
this crap all day.

658
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,519
Officer Nolan, this is
your Plan "B," right?

659
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,449
Uh, more like Plan "D."

660
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:12,066
First it was astronaut, then law school,

661
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:13,486
then construction, then this.

662
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,619
If this doesn't work out,
I'm thinking beauty school.

663
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:20,826
Should we go up there?

664
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:23,662
No. But we should spread out
and cover the perimeter.

665
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:32,438
<i>Shots fired.
Shots fired. Suspects at large.</i>

666
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,200
Stop!

667
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,147
Do we go after them?

668
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,918
7-Adam-15 in pursuit of
armed robbery suspects,

669
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,306
heading south towards Franklin.

670
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:22,719
<i>7-Adam-15, what street are suspects on?</i>

671
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:24,870
They're not on a street. They're
running down the side of the canyon.

672
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,098
Aren't we supposed to have an airship?

673
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:27,523
En route.

674
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:30,025
God, does it ever feel normal?

675
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,827
- What?
- Just getting shot at,

676
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:33,312
people trying to kill
you for doing your job.

677
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:34,669
- Yes.
- Really?

678
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,698
About as normal as taking a
parent away from their kid,

679
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,100
but we signed up for it all.

680
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,287
If ever you start to get numb to it,

681
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:40,619
you know it's time to
turn in your papers.

682
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:42,945
How could anyone feel
numb to any of this?

683
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:44,902
There! Just jumped the last ravine.

684
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:46,518
Control, suspects are down on the flats,

685
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,303
heading for Western.
Where's that backup?

686
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:50,572
7-Adam-19, we're inbound to assist.

687
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:52,094
There.

688
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,437
7-Adam-19, we'll
take Bower, you take her.

689
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,247
7-Adam-15, we are
Code 6 at Saint Gregory's.

690
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:14,062
We have suspect at
large in the hospital.

691
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,381
Did a woman in a green
Army jacket run through here?

692
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:21,336
Down that hallway.

693
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,154
Get the elevators. and
first floor in lockdown.

694
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:25,088
We have an armed suspect on the loose.

695
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,850
We have a code grey, code grey.

696
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:34,590
Flashlights on, Boot.

697
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,959
Eyes right. I got
the left side covered.

698
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:48,980
7-Adam-19, shots fired at our location.

699
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:50,623
Requesting backup and airship.

700
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:56,979
The good news is he's trapped.

701
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:02,563
If I go over this trailer,
I'll come up on top of him.

702
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:04,546
With all due respect, I should go.

703
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:05,993
Forget it.

704
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,693
Improvisation is a useful
tool for a rookie to learn.

705
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,436
Good. All right. You
passed tonight's test.

706
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:21,396
Get your ass up there.

707
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,000
Police!

708
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,328
Drop your weapon!

709
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:48,120
Do it now!

710
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,052
Get down on your stomach!

711
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:57,675
Hands behind your back.

712
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,210
What do you want... applause?

713
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,084
Get down here.

714
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:05,214
7-Adam-19, Code 4.

715
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:07,175
One in custody, one outstanding.

716
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:10,266
Careful. This girl was a door gunner

717
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,780
for a Black Hawk helicopter,

718
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:13,581
not some crackhead with a 9-mil.

719
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,996
<i>7-Adam-08 is in place on east entrance.</i>

720
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:18,691
<i>Additional units en
route to assist in search.</i>

721
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,534
All right, every exit's secure.

722
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,923
We just need to flush her out.

723
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:24,266
No.

724
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:25,446
No what?

725
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:27,610
Every exit is not secure.

726
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,593
7-Adam-15 to air support.

727
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:00,028
Armed suspect has stolen
medevac helicopter

728
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:01,567
from the roof. of Saint
Gregory Hospital.

729
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:03,578
Request you respond and intercept.

730
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,218
Drop your gun.

731
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,738
No. But I-I'll put it away.

732
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:26,229
Okay, okay, um...

733
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:27,958
now what?

734
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:30,480
I shoot you and take my
chances in the hospital

735
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:33,278
after the cops clear out
chasing the helicopter.

736
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:35,438
Can I offer an alternate suggestion?

737
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,579
- No.
- Look...

738
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:39,656
I don't know you, okay?

739
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,160
Just... Just what was on your BOLO.

740
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,996
Two tours, wounded in action.

741
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,540
Y-You're an honest-to-God American hero.

742
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,529
Who's about to put a hollow
point through your skull.

743
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:53,124
- Still think I'm a hero?
- Yes.

744
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:57,171
Yes, because you're not gonna do that.

745
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:03,085
My training offer says that
people are inherently flawed,

746
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:07,228
that they're only good when it's easy.

747
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,003
And when things get challenging,
they make a bad call

748
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,455
and then another, and then pretty soon

749
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,057
you can't see good in
your rearview mirror.

750
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:18,191
- She says that once you
cross that line, you can't go back,

751
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:20,630
but I-I don't... I don't believe that.

752
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,903
I-I think you can.

753
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:27,822
I think that good people
will make the right choice

754
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,799
when it really matters.

755
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:34,376
Look, if I... if I'm wrong...

756
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:38,207
...then you kill me.

757
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:42,831
But if I'm right...

758
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:47,847
then you just give up because
this is a line you won't cross.

759
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,141
Aah!

760
00:37:57,962 --> 00:38:00,130
Remind me not to get on your bad side.

761
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:03,523
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yep.

762
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:08,545
Guess now we'll never know...

763
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:11,563
...what choice she was gonna make.

764
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:14,497
You're the only one still in
doubt here, Officer Nolan.

765
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,052
I just saved your life.

766
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:19,922
Well, in that case...

767
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:21,882
thank you.

768
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:30,967
Officer Nolan,

769
00:38:31,114 --> 00:38:32,769
did you bail out your train thief?

770
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,704
No.

771
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:36,606
I did.

772
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:38,074
He made a mistake.

773
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,210
He's got a kid, and he
deserves to be at home,

774
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,548
not in some prison because
he can't make bail.

775
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,462
Officer Bishop, I didn't
take you for a softie.

776
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:46,149
I'm not.

777
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:49,047
But one bad day. shouldn't
ruin a man's life.

778
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:50,640
Okay.

779
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:53,957
What?

780
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:55,125
I want to give you a hug.

781
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,426
Do you want to get Tased?

782
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,927
No. It passed.

783
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,156
Let's ask the captain.

784
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:02,280
Ask me what?

785
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,638
What was your Plan "B"?

786
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:05,939
I didn't have one. I was all-in.

787
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,274
Nothing was
gonna stop me from being a cop.

788
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:09,906
Turned out pretty well.

789
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:12,108
- I agree, Captain.
- Whatever.

790
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:35,725
Hard day?

791
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,645
Yeah.

792
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,960
You didn't tell me your partner
got shot along with you.

793
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,385
I might have done some poking around.

794
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:54,164
Dennis Rowland. Bad temper, good heart.

795
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:56,353
We were together two years.

796
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:58,688
Bullet went through him, hit me.

797
00:39:58,775 --> 00:39:59,956
I walked away. He didn't.

798
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,498
I'm sorry.

799
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,466
Thanks.

800
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:10,540
Now, are you ready for
the "So you got shot"

801
00:40:10,935 --> 00:40:13,730
and didn't listen to me and
pushed yourself too hard,

802
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:16,306
"but now you know I'm right" speech?

803
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:17,657
Sounds like a long one.

804
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:18,991
Oh, it is.

805
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,892
Come on. I'll give it
to you over a beer.

806
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:27,484
Ah. How's that Plan "B" coming?

807
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:29,419
Captain says I don't need one.

808
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,634
But I was thinking

809
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,302
it might not be a bad idea

810
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,128
for me to find a hobby,

811
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:38,261
something outside of the
job I can look forward to.

812
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:41,498
Mm. What about, uh, pole dancing?

813
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,870
Okay, clearly, I shouldn't
have brought you

814
00:40:43,895 --> 00:40:45,021
into the circle of trust.

815
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,858
What?

816
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:49,475
You know, you were, uh,
pretty cavalier earlier

817
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:51,508
about not making it as a cop.

818
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,142
Is that how you really feel?

819
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:57,384
I'm seeing this thing
through no matter what,

820
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:00,597
no matter what obstacles
are thrown in my way.

821
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:06,869
You know, one out
of three rookies washes out

822
00:41:06,894 --> 00:41:09,001
during their first year.

823
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:11,561
And there's three of us.

824
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:14,029
Odds are, one of us isn't gonna make it.

825
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,040
Screw the odds.

826
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:19,035
If I believed in odds...

827
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:20,470
...I wouldn't even be here.

828
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:23,894
You know what? We're all
gonna make it because

829
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,884
we're gonna have each other's
backs no matter what.

830
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:28,396
Deal?

831
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:29,555
Deal.

832
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:30,853
- Yeah.
- Deal.

833
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:33,798
Okay, I'm going on a night run.

834
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,118
Who's with me?

835
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,419
Me. Totally.

836
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,555
Yeah. We're right behind you.

837
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,293
♪ Bye-bye, baby
