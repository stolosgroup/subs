1
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:06,946
Should we be flattered
that Sergeant Grey

2
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:08,706
selected us to represent the department

3
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:10,156
at this block party?

4
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,782
I think you're forgetting
four key words...

5
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:13,719
On our day off.

6
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,003
I'll take it as a vote of confidence.

7
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:20,137
This is some great swag.

8
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:21,396
Did you get this from Grey?

9
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,911
I think Officer Above and Beyond

10
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:24,003
bought those himself.

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:26,396
Hey. I got a guy at Kinko's, okay?

12
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,268
- Mm-hmm.
- All right,

13
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:30,423
you guys make yourself useful

14
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:32,475
and, uh, fill these up with water.

15
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:34,838
I saw a hose in that side yard.

16
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:44,228
How you doing?

17
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:45,995
Fine.

18
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:47,785
You want to talk about it?

19
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,833
There's nothing to talk about.

20
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:52,346
So let's just focus on the work.

21
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,998
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't still mad.

22
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:56,808
Do I look mad?

23
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,089
No.

24
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:05,140
Look, you're on the rebound
from a 20-year marriage.

25
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,855
This was never gonna be long-term.

26
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:08,552
So let's just move on.

27
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:15,328
Is that your girlfriend?

28
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:17,588
Hey, kids. Ever been tased?

29
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,480
Nice pins.

30
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:21,682
Thank you, sir.

31
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,787
This might be your only hope

32
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,485
to lure those kids from LAFD.

33
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:27,064
All due respect, sir,
they have a fire engine.

34
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,126
To a 6-year-old, that's crack.

35
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,598
I am not gonna be shown
up by some department

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,061
that publishes shirtless calendars.

37
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:41,565
West, Chen, let's get in the game.

38
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:51,916
Hey, Antonio. Here's a button.

39
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:53,056
Okay.

40
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,138
Um, I guess I have stickers.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,947
Hey.

42
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:59,096
Hypothetically,

43
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,590
if a neighborhood cat has been killed

44
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:02,382
and the owners contact the authorities,

45
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,131
will you investigate?

46
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:05,685
Did you kill a cat?

47
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:08,065
I told you the cat's hypothetical.

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,748
Did you kill anything non-hypothetical?

49
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:13,791
Hey! They're free!

50
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:15,466
You don't have to r-run.

51
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:25,415
Hey, guys. Where's your friend?

52
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,617
He ran out of ammo.

53
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:38,357
Help!

54
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,168
Help! He's not breathing!
I need a CPR mask.

55
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:55,925
Clear out! Grab that gurney!

56
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:18,701
Good job, Antonio.

57
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,409
Thank you.

58
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:23,801
Good job.

59
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,788
Lucy?

60
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:15,650
Oh!

61
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,466
- Ben?
- Whoa. Hey.

62
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:23,468
Well, is that how you greet

63
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:25,121
your best friend turned landlord?

64
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,863
I wasn't expecting you for another week.

65
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:28,416
Well, I got homesick.

66
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,684
I mean, I was also worried that I

67
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,897
abandoned you in your time of need.

68
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,383
Yeah, it's been really
tough living here.

69
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:33,543
- You know what I mean?
- Right.

70
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,835
Come here.

71
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,573
- Good to see you.
- You too.

72
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:38,265
Oh, man. You look good.

73
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:39,677
Thank you.

74
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:40,924
Coffee machine?

75
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:42,785
- Yeah.
- Hot off the factory floor.

76
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:44,626
It's from my foundation in Guatemala

77
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,879
that empowers young mothers

78
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:47,474
by helping them to start
their own business.

79
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:49,800
- Making hot beverages.
- Among other things.

80
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,568
I didn't think you'd want
the lactation device.

81
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,143
- Good call.
- Yeah.

82
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:55,171
So, when did you start carrying a gun?

83
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,605
When I became a cop.

84
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:59,390
Oh. You didn't think I was
gonna see it through.

85
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,913
No. Well, maybe a little.

86
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,814
Yeah, I just assumed that
you'd get distracted

87
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,911
by the sunshine and yoga instructors.

88
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:08,439
Not that anyone would blame you.

89
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:11,338
But, uh, being a cop
seems really dangerous.

90
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:14,793
It is, but it's also very fulfilling.

91
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:17,370
That's great. You needed a purpose.

92
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:20,085
So, no yoga instructors?

93
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:23,464
I-I did have a thing with
one of my fellow rookies.

94
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:24,808
- That was dumb.
- Why?

95
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,246
We're both responsible adults.

96
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,156
How old is she?

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,775
28.

98
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:33,858
You've been 40
since you were 20, right?

99
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:35,886
Not everybody's like you.

100
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,567
Was it serious?

101
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,884
Yeah.

102
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,734
Then it's good that I'm home.

103
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,513
All right, settle down. Settle down.

104
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:54,346
Listen. Everyone knows what today is,

105
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,025
and I just want to say
that Team Bradford

106
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:58,485
is gonna dominate once again.

107
00:05:58,549 --> 00:05:59,938
Yeah, not this year, Blondie.

108
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:02,132
- You're going down, man.
- Yeah!

109
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,807
Dominate what?

110
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:05,189
The Roundup.

111
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:06,330
Happens every year when the rookies

112
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:07,614
are a month into the job.

113
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:08,925
The T.O.s sponsor a competition

114
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,693
for the most felony
arrests in one shift.

115
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,322
Sounds like fun.

116
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:13,585
What?

117
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,141
We were both there when pub trivia

118
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,508
- almost got violent.
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:19,001
I like a little healthy competition.

120
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:20,528
- Mm.
- Are you kidding?

121
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,057
You're cutthroat and relentless.

122
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:23,676
Which I respect.

123
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:25,396
All right, settle down.

124
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:27,791
Don't think I didn't see you
up in my spot, Bradford.

125
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,147
So, I am aware that today is the day.

126
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,900
Where our T.O. units
compete for most arrests.

127
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:38,723
Under no circumstance does
the department endorse this.

128
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,505
Meaning...

129
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:44,997
I don't want to hear about
your points or strategy.

130
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,914
Am I clear, Officer Bradford?

131
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,934
Yes, sir. This job isn't about winning.

132
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,175
It's about good policing and teamwork.

133
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:53,977
We win at any cost.

134
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:55,700
Oh. But Sergeant Grey just said...

135
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:56,928
He said he doesn't
want to hear about it,

136
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:58,553
which is different than
saying don't do it.

137
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,395
Now, the scoring is like football.

138
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:02,091
7 points for a felony arrest.

139
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:03,630
3 points for a misdemeanor.

140
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:05,663
And we focus on quality over quantity.

141
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,017
Okay. So what's our strategy?

142
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:09,176
So, slow and steady or shock and awe?

143
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:10,887
Neither. We're not playing.

144
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:12,672
But Jackson said all the T.O.s compete.

145
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:15,245
- Well, he was misinformed.
- But if we were to win...

146
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,914
Officer Nolan, if you make it to T.O.,

147
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:18,531
then you can choose to play.

148
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,426
But right now, the decision is mine.

149
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:21,979
And we will not be participating.

150
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:23,447
Is that clear?

151
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,735
Understood.

152
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,553
Hold up, Boot.

153
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:38,371
What?

154
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,794
- What is that?
- Insurance.

155
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:53,403
- Nell.
- Hey.

156
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,051
Look at you.

157
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,878
You are positively glowing.
What's your secret?

158
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:02,218
Um... I hiked Malibu Creek yesterday.

159
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,705
You should try it. Good for the soul.

160
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,120
I bet.

161
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,897
Listen, I saw this. at
the bookstore yesterday,

162
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,932
thought of you.

163
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,315
That is so sweet.

164
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:17,018
Oh, my gosh. Kilimanjaro... I
have been dying to go someday.

165
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,175
You will.

166
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:21,279
Hey. So, listen, as calls come in

167
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:24,106
that sound like felony arrests,
can you send them to us?

168
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,651
And not over the radio?

169
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:29,566
Um, that would qualify
as favoritism. So...

170
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:32,235
But I am your favorite.

171
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,384
Come on. For me?

172
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,778
Isn't that cheating?

173
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,318
I'm celebrating. the
unsung heroes of the LAPD.

174
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,450
In exchange for hot calls.

175
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:45,663
Isn't our job to respond to any crime,

176
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,257
no matter. the anticipated outcome?

177
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:49,389
Of course.

178
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,432
But if you're gonna be some
Pollyanna on my shoulder all day,

179
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:53,790
I'll be happy to loan you out
to clean the drunk tank.

180
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,716
Heard there were some heavy
pukers there last night.

181
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,931
Clearly, I misspoke when
I said cheating. I...

182
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:03,994
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

183
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,315
Oh, hey! Look what we found

184
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,741
just two blocks away.

185
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:08,974
A burglary and a conspiracy lookout.

186
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,162
- Are you here booking someone?
- No.

187
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,083
Oh. Then I guess. we're
first on the boards.

188
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,530
- 14 points.
- Hey!

189
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,080
Aah!

190
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,982
<i>7-Adam-15, property damage.</i>

191
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:19,183
<i>Washington at Carson.</i>

192
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,857
<i>Multiple callers report
man on scaffolding</i>

193
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:23,250
<i>causing a 4-15. LAFD on scene.</i>

194
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,056
Come on down, okay?!

195
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,291
Is this a Banksy thing?

196
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,050
Don't care. It's a crime thing.

197
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:30,732
So is there a reason we can't
compete in The Roundup?

198
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:32,724
"Because I said so" should
be all the reason you need.

199
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:34,100
If you're worried I can't be impartial

200
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,508
because of Lucy, don't be.

201
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:37,147
- 'Cause that's over now.
- Really.

202
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,274
How're you handling it?

203
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,290
See a little blame in your eyes.

204
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,386
No, ma'am. It's the right thing to do.

205
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,570
And do not worry. It
will not affect my work.

206
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:48,338
Glad to hear that.

207
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:49,841
I'm gonna go check
in with the fire captain.

208
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:51,399
- Keep an eye on our vandal.
- Right.

209
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:53,401
Hey, come on down!

210
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,600
<i>7-Adam-07, wellness check, 552 Oakwood.</i>

211
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,637
<i>ER nurse reports patient
with suspected stroke</i>

212
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:00,432
<i>disappeared from the hospital.</i>

213
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:03,589
7-Adam-7, show us Code 6
on the wellness check.

214
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,770
14 points out the gate. You
ever done that before?

215
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,398
No, but we got to keep the pressure on.

216
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,520
Bradford's always got a
trick or two up his sleeve.

217
00:10:10,595 --> 00:10:12,729
I hope our patient. didn't
come home and croak,

218
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,084
or we'll get stuck here all day.

219
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,962
Wow, less than an hour
into the competition

220
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:18,668
and you're already exhibiting
a visible lack of compassion.

221
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:20,388
I'm sorry. You're right.

222
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,108
That was extremely insensitive of me.

223
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,234
Police.

224
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:28,538
- Mr. Walker?
- Yeah?

225
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,920
Sir, are you okay?

226
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,357
Your ER nurse said you left the hospital

227
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,793
before you were discharged.

228
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,338
She tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

229
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,566
Oh. Uh.

230
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:38,620
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

231
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,512
I was feeling better,
and that hospital food,

232
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:42,337
you know, it's just...
it's just so awful.

233
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,807
So I came home for some leftovers.

234
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,877
Can you please tell her

235
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,430
thank you from me

236
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:49,259
for... for checking up on me?

237
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:51,452
Yeah. Sure thing. Hope
you feel better, sir.

238
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:53,531
Thank you.

239
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:56,781
Okay, sweet. He's fine.

240
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,761
And we can get back out there.

241
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,136
What?

242
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,641
- He was lying to us.
- About what?

243
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,421
I don't know. But he
was clearly nervous.

244
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,426
You were so ready to
move on, you missed it.

245
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:35,895
Stealing opioids from the hospital

246
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,183
is a felony, Mr. Walker.

247
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,891
I'm just making ends meet.

248
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,044
You know how hard it is to
live on a fixed income?

249
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,274
My grandparents moved into a townhouse.

250
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:47,250
Just saying. There's options.

251
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:56,179
Any way we can speed things up?

252
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:57,729
I've blown up pool rafts faster.

253
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:59,563
Ah, we almost there, bro.

254
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,198
Meanwhile, got to stay hydrated.

255
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:02,735
Thanks.

256
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,043
Hey, good job with that kid yesterday.

257
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,556
I mean, my part gets all the attention,

258
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,238
but you were the real hero.

259
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,659
Well, my son was a
daredevil since birth.

260
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,151
Had to keep an eye on him 24/7.

261
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:14,456
You sound like my dad, man.

262
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:19,628
Hey, that rookie cop,
Lucy, is she single?

263
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,943
'Cause I picked up on a vibe yesterday.

264
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,053
I think so.

265
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:25,328
Cool.

266
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,985
Thanks, bro.

267
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,431
Hey, there.

268
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,137
You got something against Ganja Garden

269
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,963
or just signs in general?

270
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:10,883
You think that's funny?

271
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,984
You know, five years
ago, I got pulled over

272
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,844
with an ounce of weed in my car.

273
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,313
An ounce.

274
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:17,988
I couldn't afford no lawyer,

275
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:20,281
so the public defender
made me take a deal.

276
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,411
Five years I sat in that box, man.

277
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,509
And you mean to tell me

278
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,552
all these little Silver
Lake hipster kids,

279
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:26,675
they can just walk around,

280
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,227
vaping like it's nothing?

281
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:29,517
I can see why you're frustrated.

282
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,504
Don't patronize me, man.

283
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,256
Because it was a cop just like you

284
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:35,338
that put me in that box.

285
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:39,248
You know, my mom died
while I was inside, man.

286
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:43,642
And now every time I fill
out a job application,

287
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,684
I gotta put down "felon."

288
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:49,054
Okay, look, what... what
happened to you was wrong.

289
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,153
Okay, this... this is just
gonna make it worse. Right?

290
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:57,101
Come on. Let's... Let's
get down from here.

291
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:02,431
Okay.

292
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,903
Nolan!

293
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,284
Aah!

294
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:15,751
Ow!

295
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:22,665
Aa.

296
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:25,091
Officer Nolan, is there a reason

297
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:26,544
you're walking with an OG lean?

298
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:27,793
Oh, no. I just, uh...

299
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:30,745
My right shoulder's
just a little tingly.

300
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:32,101
Huh. 'Cause I don't remember telling you

301
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,060
to climb up there and
remove the suspect.

302
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,780
And you don't put yourself
in a high-risk situation

303
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:37,248
- without my say-so.
- Right.

304
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:39,837
I just had. a slight miscommunication

305
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,069
with that firefighter.

306
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,210
Is that right?

307
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,419
Is that the same guy who asked me

308
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:45,601
about a hot rookie named Lucy?

309
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:48,439
You too? God, that
guy's a piece of work.

310
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:55,887
Is that why you ignored proper protocol

311
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,090
and climbed up there?

312
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,641
Or was it the competition?

313
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,474
Uh... okay, look,

314
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,567
you told me to stop
dating Lucy, and I did.

315
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,642
And you told me I couldn't compete.

316
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,701
Haven't I earned a slightly
longer leash with you?

317
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,460
No. And after what happened out there,

318
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:09,819
it's clear you don't deserve one.

319
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,003
Nolan and Talia are on the board.

320
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:26,209
Damn it. Call Nell. Put her on speaker.

321
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,567
Hello?

322
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:33,887
Hey, it's Officer Bradford.

323
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,515
You haven't forgotten
about me, have you?

324
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,818
<i>No. Of course not.</i>

325
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:40,708
Um, we've actually just...
we've been a little slow.

326
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:44,858
Oh, um, we just got a 911 call...

327
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,202
DUI hit-and-run, teenage
pedestrian injured.

328
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:50,462
Black 528i. Last seen
eastbound on Melrose.

329
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:52,272
Perfect. Attach us to that, please.

330
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,054
- And, Nell...
- Mm-hmm?

331
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:55,658
...you're the best.

332
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,609
7-Adam-15, we have a noise complaint

333
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,635
at the Eaton Company Lofts, number 501.

334
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:08,629
We're gonna shut this down.

335
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,574
- No cowboy stuff. Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

336
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,914
- You've been very clear.
- Really?

337
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,174
Is that why you're on a
group text about the score?

338
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,575
You can't keep secrets
from me, Officer Nolan.

339
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:18,498
I thought we established that.
So stop trying.

340
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,013
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:23,861
LAPD. Open up, Mr. Askari.

342
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:25,774
Whoo. Uh, coming.

343
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,869
Just give me a second.

344
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:30,058
Open up!

345
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:33,370
Ah. Can I help you?

346
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,704
We got a noise complaint.

347
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:36,830
You've been playing
loud music for hours.

348
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:38,229
Hmm. Sorry.

349
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,574
Just blowing off a little steam.

350
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,876
My office is next door.

351
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,633
I stay here when I work late.

352
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:47,624
We were just having a little fun.

353
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,186
No harm in that, right?

354
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:51,245
Depends on what kind
of fun you're having.

355
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:53,562
Uh, just give us a moment.

356
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,166
I do believe he's paying these ladies.

357
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:57,279
What's the point?

358
00:16:57,304 --> 00:16:58,503
Well, shouldn't we arrest
them for prostitution?

359
00:16:58,527 --> 00:16:59,621
With what evidence?

360
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,385
Cite the guy for noise,
identify the girls.

361
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,237
We'll pass it on to Vice.

362
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,874
Hey, Mr. Askari, I'm
just gonna need, uh,

363
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,772
- a little bit of information.
- Sure.

364
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,951
Hello.

365
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:14,139
Officer Bishop, we have a gun.

366
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,131
Hmm.

367
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:18,371
Do you have a permit
for this weapon, sir?

368
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:20,286
A friend gave it to me.

369
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,663
That's a felony weapon possession.

370
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,957
Everybody get dressed.

371
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,143
We're taking Peter for a ride.

372
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:29,823
You all paid up with the girls?

373
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,643
- Nice try.
- Almost had him.

374
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:34,935
Yeah.

375
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,758
Nell seems nice.

376
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,666
Yeah.

377
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:41,430
What's your point?

378
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,761
She likes you.

379
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:46,449
She's doing me a favor. That's all.

380
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,193
I'm married, Officer Chen,

381
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:50,085
and this isn't something
you and I talk about.

382
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,633
Keep your eyes peeled for our DUI.

383
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:54,464
Yes, sir.

384
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:58,949
- There.
- 7-Adam-19,

385
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:01,506
DUI suspect sighted
heading east on Melrose.

386
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,108
7-Adam-19, turning north onto Serrano.

387
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,296
Let's go, Boot. He might try and run.

388
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:17,288
LAPD. Hands.

389
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:19,177
Don't move. Show us your hands.

390
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:22,247
Whoa.

391
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,000
This is a first.

392
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:32,707
Don't worry. I'm not going a-anywhere.

393
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,761
7-Adam-19, DUI suspect crashed
at Melrose and Serrano.

394
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,256
We need ambulance and fire, Code 3.

395
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:48,779
Okay, sir, just hang in there.

396
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:49,876
The ambulance is here now.

397
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:50,969
Should I pull it out?

398
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,663
No, no, no. Don't move, don't move.

399
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:55,429
Stay still. I'm gonna cut this pipe.

400
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,152
Three... two...

401
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,183
You have the right to remain silent.

402
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,027
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

403
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,152
in a court of law.

404
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:13,056
You have the right to an attorney
present during questioning.

405
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,481
If you cannot afford an attorney,

406
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,661
One will be appointed to represent you.

407
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,048
Do you understand each of these rights?

408
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,202
Yes, sir.

409
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:19,898
Now, you're required to
provide a chemical sample

410
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,361
if suspected of driving while impaled...

411
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:22,694
sorry, impaired.

412
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:24,986
You can choose between
blood, breath, or urine.

413
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,631
A refusal will result
in the immediate suspension.

414
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:28,355
Of your license for
a minimum of a year.

415
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,723
Yes.

416
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:31,006
We need to get him to surgery!

417
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,209
No, not before I get my blood draw.

418
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,901
21-gauge vial.
- Can't this wait?

419
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:36,361
- He's obviously...
- Wait, what? Huh?

420
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,105
He's what? He's dying?

421
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,188
This guy got drunk. and
hit a kid with his car,

422
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,321
maybe killed him.

423
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,301
If we wait, his blood alcohol
will return to normal,

424
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:44,605
and we'll lose a crucial
piece of evidence.

425
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:45,864
And you sure this has nothing to do

426
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,486
with the 7-point felony arrest?

427
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:49,766
Boot, criminals get hurt all
the time during a crime.

428
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,610
They don't get special treatment
if they get a boo-boo.

429
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:53,301
Understood?

430
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:54,889
Yes, sir.

431
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:00,360
Now call in our 7 points.

432
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,474
There must be some way
we can work this out.

433
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:10,335
Are you offering us a bribe?

434
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,794
Everyone knows that cops are underpaid.

435
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:14,283
Yeah, don't look at me.

436
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,242
I don't pay rent, and I
live right by the ocean.

437
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,068
Mr. Askari, you're already
facing one felony.

438
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,327
You want to add to those charges?

439
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,186
No. Let's just get this over with.

440
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:22,443
Officer Bishop.

441
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:23,944
Captain wants to see you in the bullpen.

442
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,870
Start processing him. I'll be back.

443
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,319
Okay.

444
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:31,159
All right, I'm gonna need
your shoes and your socks.

445
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:33,120
There.

446
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,928
I know that look.

447
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:37,317
I mean, I've never been caught in a room

448
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:38,780
full of hookers with a gun before,

449
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,524
but I can clearly see

450
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:42,992
you're not looking forward to
the phone call to your wife.

451
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,065
My wife's. the least of my problems.

452
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,278
What does that mean?

453
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:48,371
News travels quick in my line of work.

454
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:49,898
And what line of work is that?

455
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:51,224
Banking.

456
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:59,176
You know that guy?

457
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:00,643
Yeah.

458
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,866
He's the lawyer.

459
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,385
I mean, my lawyer.

460
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,721
Article 849B authorizes peace officers

461
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:13,503
to release arrested persons from custody

462
00:21:13,528 --> 00:21:15,652
due to insufficient grounds
to file a complaint

463
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:16,776
against said person.

464
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,135
Conceal and carry permit.

465
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,841
Signed by Judge Sather.

466
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:21,555
How'd you even know he was arrested?

467
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,847
Did one of his hookers call you?

468
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:24,526
Who called me is not your concern.

469
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:26,053
You have no right to hold my client,

470
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,578
so release him immediately.

471
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,500
You can stop printing him.

472
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,169
Suspect's attorney has provided
a permit for the weapon.

473
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:36,619
He has?

474
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,632
Is that a problem?

475
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:41,202
Do you not want to go?

476
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:42,837
No.

477
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:45,020
I mean yes, yes.

478
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:46,947
Can you take him to his lawyer?

479
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,206
Mm-hmm.

480
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,416
I don't get it.

481
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:57,090
If he had a permit for the gun,

482
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,609
why not just tell us
back at the apartment?

483
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,658
I doubt he had one an hour ago.

484
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,504
Can you get a permit that fast?

485
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,053
If you know the right people.

486
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:05,548
Usually when a fancy lawyer shows up

487
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:06,908
with a same-day permit,

488
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:09,041
There's usually
a link to organized crime.

489
00:22:09,065 --> 00:22:10,906
You had the "big fish, little
fish" conversation yet?

490
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:12,633
- No.
- Only big fish, little fish

491
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:14,922
I'm familiar with are Dr. Seuss-related.

492
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:16,317
This is not that.

493
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:17,698
There is a hierarchy on the street,

494
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,033
just like there is in here.

495
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:21,093
- Patrol are the foot soldiers.
- Little fish.

496
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,061
Dealing with
the other guy's foot soldiers.

497
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:24,162
The bigger their fish,

498
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:25,529
the higher up the ladder you have to go.

499
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:28,510
Mr. Askari is clearly
connected to a big fish

500
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:30,569
who has the juice. to get
that kind of permit.

501
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,826
The numbers are black and white.

502
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:35,563
We have 28, while each
of you only has 7.

503
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,117
There's still a whole
second half of our shift.

504
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:38,241
And you know I'm a closer.

505
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:39,510
You know we're not playing.

506
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,711
Oh, right, you're above all this.

507
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,577
Mm. When you're chief,

508
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:44,536
we promise not to divulge
you had any fun on the job.

509
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:45,711
It's not fun.

510
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,404
It's a relic of a time
when the department

511
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,472
drove a wedge between the
cops and the community.

512
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:51,944
I get it. You think it promotes
an "us versus them" mentality.

513
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,058
And you're right.

514
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,582
But the "them" isn't the community.

515
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:55,853
It's the criminals.

516
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:57,946
I just arrested a guy for
putting a teenager in a coma.

517
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:59,304
And I'm not gonna apologize for hustling

518
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,445
to get that guy off the street.

519
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,051
I'm not asking you to.

520
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:04,206
All I'm asking you to
do is take a hard look

521
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,426
as to whether this contest

522
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,256
teaches those rookies the right lesson.

523
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,192
I just don't think septuagenarians
should even count.

524
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:11,577
I don't know. why we're
arguing about it.

525
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,422
'Cause you're a bad loser.

526
00:23:13,482 --> 00:23:15,283
A felony drug bust is
a felony drug bust.

527
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:16,747
He does this with Monopoly.

528
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,413
Changes the rules mid-game.

529
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,114
When did we play Monopoly?

530
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,796
That time you were out with
your parents, I think.

531
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,462
You weren't there. It was, um...

532
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,492
No.

533
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,063
When was this?

534
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:30,844
Time to go, Boot.

535
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:32,771
Okay. All right.

536
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:41,075
You okay?

537
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:43,984
Fine. I'm just focusing on the job.

538
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,948
I meant your arm.

539
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,190
- You're clearly in pain.
- No.

540
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,896
If I was in pain, could I do this?

541
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:56,628
That firefighter, Antonio,
said you did a high dive.

542
00:23:57,572 --> 00:23:59,924
- When did you talk to Antonio?
- He called.

543
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:02,383
- That was fast.
- Is that a problem?

544
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:04,433
Not at all. No.

545
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,980
We're moving on, right?

546
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,618
Yeah.

547
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,534
Right.

548
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,440
Do I need to be worried that your mood

549
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,233
is gonna affect our chances
in this competition?

550
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,539
I'm fine.

551
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:28,046
Because I've won this
five years and counting.

552
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,337
Yeah, I get it.

553
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,985
I won't let you down.

554
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:37,089
You're clear what happened
earlier with our DUI, right?

555
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:38,729
That wasn't about score.

556
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:39,898
It was about making sure that guy

557
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:41,371
sees the inside of a cell.

558
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,170
Yeah. It's just...

559
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:46,422
It's hard when he's the one

560
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,181
that's bleeding out in front of you.

561
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:50,044
Understood.

562
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:52,500
But it's our job to always
maintain perspective.

563
00:24:57,532 --> 00:25:00,868
Hey, so we just got a call
about an armored car robbery.

564
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:02,790
Suspects were seen wearing ski masks

565
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,249
on Wilshire and Robertson.

566
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,056
Hot damn. We're back in it.

567
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,195
Get down, Boot.

568
00:25:33,883 --> 00:25:34,989
What happened?

569
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:36,404
There's a safety feature in armored cars

570
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:38,663
that allows drivers to escape
to the back under fire.

571
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:40,543
They're now locked. in a
bulletproof fortress,

572
00:25:40,568 --> 00:25:42,945
and we're gonna be here all
day trying to get them out.

573
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,245
7-Adam-19, shots fired.

574
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,530
Suspects barricaded, requesting SWAT.

575
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,117
I'll call the armored car company.

576
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:52,238
They should have a master key.

577
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:53,838
It'll take them hours to get here.

578
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:56,924
Hours where Lopez and Talia are
running up the score on us.

579
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,396
You seem more interested in that

580
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:01,213
than in us getting lit up
by the guys in the truck.

581
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,519
What happened. to
maintaining perspective?

582
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:04,878
You know, save the psychoanalysis

583
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:06,331
for Christmas dinner
with the folks, okay?

584
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:07,989
My perspective is spot-on.

585
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:09,919
I want to win. and put
these guys behind bars.

586
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:10,947
Yeah, I do, too.

587
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:12,144
But they're not going
down without a fight.

588
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:14,340
- We need backup.
- And I called for it.

589
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,288
Which is what they expect us to do.

590
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,648
They think...

591
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:22,684
They think we'll stay here
all day and wait for them.

592
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,838
Which means their guard will be down.

593
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,329
It's bulletproof. You're not
gonna get in with that.

594
00:26:37,353 --> 00:26:39,661
I don't need to get in. I
need them to come out.

595
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:41,924
If they're armed and barricaded,
we should wait for SWAT.

596
00:26:41,985 --> 00:26:43,616
The weapons won't matter if
they can't see anything.

597
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,141
Cover the back.

598
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,133
Just add pepper spray and...

599
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,795
Drop your weapon! Down on the ground!

600
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:14,279
Down on the ground and on your stomachs!

601
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,612
- Hands behind your head!
- Put your hands behind your back.

602
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:20,237
Felony carjacking, armed robbery,

603
00:27:20,262 --> 00:27:21,364
attempted murder.

604
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,181
That's 14 more points, Boot.

605
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,364
I know who the banker's big fish is.

606
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:27,545
Viggo Petrov.

607
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,586
High-ranking member of the Odessa Mafia.

608
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:31,050
The Russian mob?

609
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,276
They're responsible for heroin,

610
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,811
money laundering, prostitution.

611
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,429
How does Peter connect?

612
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,689
DEA suspects that he's
Petrov's money launderer.

613
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:40,939
Explains why they sent
the lawyer so quickly.

614
00:27:40,964 --> 00:27:42,644
Petrov can't risk Peter getting chatty

615
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:44,242
- when faced with jail time.
- Mm-hmm.

616
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:46,527
DEA was actually pissed that
we let him go so quickly.

617
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,036
They thought I should
be holding on to him

618
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:49,920
for the full 24 hours the law allows.

619
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,473
I told him I don't do business that way.

620
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,857
How'd that go over?

621
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,597
As well as you can imagine.

622
00:27:56,954 --> 00:28:00,490
Hey. Tim and Lucy just
got 14 more points.

623
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:02,170
We need to get back out there.

624
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:05,227
Do I feel like salty or sweet?

625
00:28:05,305 --> 00:28:06,888
Did you hear what I said?

626
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:08,774
Relax. We're still in the lead.

627
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,733
There's only a few more
hours left in our shift.

628
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:12,140
Teams lose when they play it safe.

629
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,377
They also lose when they
abandon the fundamentals.

630
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,055
I rushed through a few arrests
when I played as a rookie,

631
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,210
and they got bounced.

632
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,727
I learned the hard way that guns blazing

633
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:20,686
isn't a good mode for this line of work.

634
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:22,575
Does that mean we're not gonna
try and win this thing?

635
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,141
It means we need to
win it the right way.

636
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:26,867
Is that a problem?

637
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:29,818
- No, ma'am.
- Good answer.

638
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:33,836
Salty.

639
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:38,413
Uh, where... where are you going?

640
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:40,506
Uh, my shift's over.

641
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,242
Mine's not. Uh...

642
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:43,676
any way you can stick
around and be a part

643
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,434
of the Bradford team a little longer?

644
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:48,518
- How much longer?
- Three hours?

645
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:50,902
Well, that will cost you.

646
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:53,304
A drink.

647
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,487
I mean, later. After.
When you're off-duty.

648
00:28:58,248 --> 00:29:01,117
- Deal.
- Deal.

649
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:03,078
- Okay, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

650
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,768
7-Adam-15, mother and child
causing a disturbance

651
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,494
at Southland Sanctuary Shelter.

652
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,161
69302 Western.

653
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:17,473
It's not right!

654
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,133
Where the hell are we supposed to go?!

655
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,159
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
you to calm down a bit.

656
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:22,524
Ma'am, what's going on?

657
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:24,219
We need beds.

658
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:25,537
We slept on the street last night,

659
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:27,243
- but it's not safe.
- I'm sorry.

660
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,335
I wish we could help,

661
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,560
but we have no empty beds.

662
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:32,354
And state law prohibits us from
accepting any more people.

663
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:35,016
Hi, there, little guy. I'm John.

664
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:37,131
You look cold. Are you feeling cold?

665
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,086
Okay. Hang on a second.

666
00:29:39,263 --> 00:29:40,930
I'll be right back.

667
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:44,520
Did you tell her about other
shelters in the area?

668
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:47,002
Yes, but they've already been
turned away at the ones nearby.

669
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,231
All right.

670
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:54,417
Here you go. This'll help a little.

671
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:56,079
That'll warm you up.

672
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,745
- You can keep that.
- Thanks.

673
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:04,233
Officer Nolan, a word?

674
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,696
They can't sleep in the lobby.

675
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,356
We're gonna have to escort them out.

676
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:11,458
That's not right. We can't
just kick them out.

677
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:13,918
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
this city has 60,000 homeless.

678
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:15,235
We can't find beds for all of them.

679
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:17,625
No, but we can find beds for these two.

680
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:20,236
Even if it takes the rest of our shift

681
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:22,664
and you lose the competition?

682
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,120
Well, we're not playing. Remember?

683
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:29,825
Okay.

684
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:35,397
Can you give us a list of
all the city shelters?

685
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,056
We're gonna start making some calls.

686
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,720
Okay.

687
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,730
Yeah, no, thank you for double-checking.

688
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:49,604
No, I get it.

689
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:51,795
Yes. Thank you.

690
00:30:52,276 --> 00:30:53,859
Those are the last ones.

691
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,578
What about taking them out of the city?

692
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,277
- We could give them a ride.
- No, we can't.

693
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,283
Sadly, there's... there's
nothing more we can do.

694
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:08,631
I'm sorry, but we, uh...

695
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:10,479
we couldn't find you a
place to sleep tonight.

696
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,094
I'm so sorry.

697
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:14,703
Thank you for trying.

698
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:23,037
This is why I don't play.

699
00:31:23,894 --> 00:31:25,554
'Cause it's not a game.

700
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:42,946
I'm sorry.

701
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,546
Go on.

702
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:49,373
I did blame you for Lucy,

703
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:52,400
even though I know. you
were looking out for her.

704
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,368
And then you barred me
from the competition,

705
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,960
and I...

706
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:58,471
Well, let's just say

707
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:00,597
it has not been. my
finest day on the job.

708
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,536
We're not robots, Officer Nolan.

709
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,734
We all have bad days.

710
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,394
But our bad days pale in comparison

711
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:09,072
to the people we meet.

712
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:10,839
They need us at our best.

713
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,924
You ever struggle with that?

714
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,439
Every day.

715
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:19,542
I just don't show it.

716
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,801
<i>7-Adam-15, homeowner called</i>

717
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:23,016
<i>about a possible intruder.</i>

718
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,287
<i>71 Holmby Avenue.</i>

719
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:26,063
7-Adam-15, copy.

720
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:30,132
- Huh.
- What?

721
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,694
Our banker... Peter Askari...
he's the homeowner.

722
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:35,471
<i>7-Adam-15, be advised. That
call was just canceled.</i>

723
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,430
<i>Homeowner reporting it was a raccoon.</i>

724
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,008
7-Adam-15, copy.

725
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,972
- You buying that?
- What?

726
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:42,929
Our mob banker,

727
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:45,489
who was clearly freaked
out over being arrested,

728
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:48,322
calls 911 about an
intruder the same night.

729
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:51,217
I'm just saying, what
if it wasn't a raccoon?

730
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,423
You think he called again under duress?

731
00:32:53,448 --> 00:32:57,217
I think it's worth taking a look.

732
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:59,297
Big fish, little fish, Officer Nolan.

733
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:01,890
If it turns out to be something,
we'll call in the big fish.

734
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:04,318
- Which is who again, exactly?
- SWAT.

735
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:18,254
Seems quiet.

736
00:33:21,472 --> 00:33:23,244
Heard you attached to a false alarm.

737
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,600
Figured something big might be up.

738
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:26,652
How'd you hear that? Did
you bribe dispatch again?

739
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,338
Again?

740
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,046
I just thought you might
need some backup.

741
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,190
Unless you're too focused on getting

742
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:32,281
all the points for yourself.

743
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:33,576
We're not playing.

744
00:33:33,601 --> 00:33:35,569
Well, then, you won't
mind us tagging along.

745
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:43,667
I got a body.

746
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:52,873
They slit her throat.

747
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:56,265
7Adam-15, requesting
SWAT for a hostage situation,

748
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,605
one dead, Code 3.

749
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:01,043
No, no!

750
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,506
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

751
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,011
Guys, we can't wait.

752
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:07,902
If they've already killed
one, they can kill the banker

753
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:09,727
and his wife at any moment.
We need to go in now.

754
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:11,187
So, what, we go in stealth?

755
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:13,630
Yeah. Upstairs or downstairs?

756
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:15,164
We'll take upstairs.

757
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:27,073
"I don't know. I don't know."

758
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:28,573
Stop lying!

759
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:31,499
Stop! Stop, please!

760
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:36,106
No. No!

761
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,144
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait. No.
- What? No, no!

762
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:41,503
You have to believe me!
Wait. Wait! Wait!

763
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:43,995
- We've got to get in there.
- We will.

764
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:45,688
We just need Tim and
Lucy to get into place.

765
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:01,005
Is somebody else in the house?

766
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:02,918
- I checked it.
- Go check again.

767
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:21,939
Aah!

768
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,471
Aah! Aah!

769
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,375
- Clear!
- Clear!

770
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,569
Clear!

771
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:46,361
Okay, how do we split up the points?

772
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:47,649
I told you.

773
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:49,842
I know, I know. You're not playing.

774
00:35:49,912 --> 00:35:51,866
But we need to figure out
how to split them up right.

775
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:54,439
It's not tricky, just give him more.

776
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:59,754
Wait, uh, are you guys trying
to rig it so Tim wins?

777
00:36:00,168 --> 00:36:02,069
N... Why would we do that?

778
00:36:02,184 --> 00:36:04,247
I don't know. This...

779
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:06,738
This competition is clearly
an emotional thing for him.

780
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:08,192
I just...

781
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:11,292
It's personal. From
when he was a rookie.

782
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:12,876
Oh.

783
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:15,886
Is it Isabel?

784
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:17,370
I-I met her once.

785
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:18,862
I know that they were rookies together

786
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,331
before they got married.

787
00:36:22,718 --> 00:36:26,429
Yeah. Yeah, and they loved The Roundup.

788
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,842
They had an epic competition.

789
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:31,232
Do you really think holding on to this

790
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:33,239
is what he needs?

791
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,764
Maybe it's better for him to lose.

792
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,067
This contest is the one day a year

793
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:40,626
he feels connected to her.

794
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,452
Do you really want to take that away?

795
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:48,189
After some complicated math,

796
00:36:48,236 --> 00:36:50,698
the winner is...

797
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:55,616
...Bradford and Chen!

798
00:36:58,144 --> 00:37:00,455
Which means their drinks are also free.

799
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,165
- Hey!
- Congrats, man.

800
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,794
- Hey, how you doing, man?
- How's it going?

801
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:04,979
- Eh.
- Yeah?

802
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:07,102
- I'll give you a hug.
- Thank you.

803
00:37:11,828 --> 00:37:13,197
Hey.

804
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:15,616
When's the last time you lost something?

805
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,052
What?

806
00:37:17,077 --> 00:37:18,743
You broke all your dad's
records at the Academy.

807
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:20,520
You were the first in your class.

808
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,726
When's the last time you
lost at a competition?

809
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:27,123
I don't know. I can't remember.

810
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:29,913
Sounds exhausting.

811
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:33,361
Yeah. It is, okay?

812
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:36,696
Look, I just need to prove
that I belong here,

813
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,147
that I didn't just inherit this spot,

814
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:41,035
that I earned it.

815
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,528
Can I give you some advice?

816
00:37:42,618 --> 00:37:44,198
Sure.

817
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:46,930
Nobody cares how you got
here if you can do the job.

818
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,784
So give yourself a break
every now and then.

819
00:37:55,744 --> 00:37:57,156
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:37:57,386 --> 00:37:59,153
Thanks for looking out for me today.

821
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:01,759
Oh, um, it was... it was my pleasure.

822
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:03,418
I'm glad you won.

823
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:04,947
You were right.

824
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:07,483
You are my favorite.

825
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,265
Look, Nell, I-I should tell you,

826
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:14,542
I'm married.

827
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:16,826
Huh. I didn't know that.

828
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,870
Yeah. It's complicated.

829
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:22,517
But I-I can still buy you
a drink to say thanks.

830
00:38:23,688 --> 00:38:26,135
Yeah, sorry.

831
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,749
I don't do complicated.

832
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:30,937
But, um, thanks for the book.

833
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:35,276
Yeah.

834
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,070
Hey.

835
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,909
Hey. Sorry you lost.

836
00:38:41,934 --> 00:38:44,067
No. I'm... I'm happy you won.

837
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,148
Uh, look, I-I lied, uh, when I said

838
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:50,584
I wasn't bothered. by
Antonio hitting on you.

839
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:52,373
But it's not my place
to be jealous, so...

840
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:53,962
Of what?

841
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,159
I said no.

842
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,541
I didn't break up with you so
I could date somebody else.

843
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:01,706
I did it so I could
focus on being a cop.

844
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,983
I'm an idiot.

845
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:09,941
Yeah.

846
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:11,404
And I'm sorry.

847
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,624
Me too.

848
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:22,646
Uh... I will see you later.

849
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,266
Goodbye.

850
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:30,598
So, it turns out she's the mature one.

851
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,274
Wow, you really have changed.

852
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,898
It's not funny.

853
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,415
Give yourself a break, John.

854
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:40,542
When was the last time you were single?

855
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:42,723
Before I was married. No.

856
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,586
No, I dated Cindy Carducci
all through high school.

857
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:47,701
So... never.

858
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,103
Wow. Yeah.

859
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,535
You deserve some <i>you</i> time.

860
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:57,792
To be a little immature and
figure out who you are

861
00:39:57,817 --> 00:39:59,784
now that you're a single guy in L.A.

862
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:03,550
Make mistakes. Fall on your face, right?

863
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:05,960
Be on your own.

864
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:07,862
I don't like falling on my face.

865
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:09,623
Or being on my own.

866
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:11,726
How would you know?

867
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,437
To being on my own.

868
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:19,983
Together.
