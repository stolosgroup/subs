<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:02,453 --> 00:00:03,713
I know about you and Nolan.

3
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,501
When this gets out,
and it will get out,

4
00:00:05,526 --> 00:00:06,628
it'll brand her.

5
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:08,222
So if you care about her
like you say you do,

6
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,449
you wouldn't even put her
in this position.

7
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:10,591
Are you breaking up with me?

8
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:12,951
Yeah, Lucy, I am.

9
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:15,298
I was just notified that
detectives made a drug bust.

10
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:16,445
It's your wife.

11
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,563
Isabel isn't a dealer.

12
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:19,272
Bradford and Isabel
were rookies together.

13
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:20,515
So she's a cop?

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,017
Was. Undercover narcotics.

15
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:23,386
Who's Carson Holland?

16
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,407
Carson stashed a kilo of heroin

17
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:26,498
in my heating unit.

18
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,166
You're facing 10 to 20.

19
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,584
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:36,485
<i>7-Adam-15, burglary in progress.</i>

<i>609 Hollywood Boulevard.</i>

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,052
Police!

23
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:09,273
7-Adam-15, in foot pursuit
of a 459 suspect.

24
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:10,374
Requesting backup.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,900
Dispatch, do you copy?

26
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,386
Sometimes these old concrete buildings

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,030
can block signal.

28
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:38,561
Hey!

29
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:40,654
Show me your hands! Do it now!

30
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:42,835
Against the wall. Got me?

31
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,033
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:45,935
Backpack down.

33
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:48,803
Give me your right hand. Hold up.

34
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:50,793
Ow.

35
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,620
Where the hell are we?

36
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:56,909
Ow. This door's locked.

37
00:01:57,322 --> 00:02:00,229
No other doors, no windows.

38
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:02,925
- What's that?
- A code.

39
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,594
You've got to be kidding me.

40
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:07,063
- What?
- This is an escape room.

41
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,790
Stay.

42
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:10,093
A what?

43
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:11,274
Where hipsters pay

44
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,668
to be locked in a room
filled with puzzles

45
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:13,867
that they have to solve to get out.

46
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:15,446
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

47
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:16,592
Oh, that sounds like fun.

48
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:19,668
Yeah, maybe on a day off,
not after a long shift.

49
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,270
No signal.

50
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,243
Guess we're gonna have to solve
the puzzles now.

51
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:27,717
Oh, sorry.

52
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,414
Looks like this one requires
three or more people.

53
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,856
Forget it.

54
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:36,225
The quicker we get out of here,
the quicker I go to jail.

55
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,260
So I'm happy to spend the night.

56
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:40,262
Oh. That's okay.

57
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:41,726
You wouldn't have been much use anyway.

58
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,780
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Don't worry.

59
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,477
We can just wait till they
open up again in the morning.

60
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,753
I mean, eight hours will just fly by.

61
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:50,544
Absolutely not.

62
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:53,576
It's a cipher. Maybe a Caesar shift.

63
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:54,995
Caesar what?

64
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,016
Didn't you take Whitman's extra
credit class at the academy?

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,102
No, I was gonna but I...

66
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:00,626
"The first step towards freedom"

67
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:04,928
"lies in the last step from captivity."

68
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:06,837
What are you, some kind
of secret genius?

69
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:08,522
Oh, it's not a secret.

70
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:10,926
Captivity.

71
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,296
- Greenwich.
- Harbledown.

72
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,081
Harbledown.

73
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,997
Canterbury.

74
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,425
Canterbury.

75
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,609
"Pallida mors aequo..."

76
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:29,177
Is it another code?

77
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:30,741
It's Latin.

78
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:32,690
"Pale death knocks with the same tempo

79
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:35,678
upon the huts of the poor
and the towers of Kings."

80
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,887
Catholic school.

81
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,324
Towers of Kings.

82
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,025
Skeleton's missing a rib.

83
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,452
Yes!

84
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:09,278
Nice!

85
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:11,503
You are still under arrest.

86
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,298
You're holding back.

87
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,564
I wish I was.

88
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,065
Okay.

89
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,635
Okay. Okay.

90
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:32,405
I could watch this all day.

91
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:33,596
And now I can.

92
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,887
Are you recording this?

93
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:36,878
Uh, yeah, just for,
uh, teaching purposes.

94
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,191
All right.

95
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,678
Focus.

96
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:46,753
Ooh! There you go!
Nice takedown, Nolan.

97
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,968
Thanks.

98
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:49,222
Lucky move.

99
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,825
I don't know what to say.

100
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,371
You worked really hard for this.

101
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:55,959
- You deserve it.
- Thank you.

102
00:04:55,984 --> 00:04:58,257
I'll sign up for
the detective's exam today.

103
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,089
You should thank Wolfe and Vestri.

104
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:01,656
They're pulling for you.

105
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:07,439
I got the Tap.

106
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,319
I heard. Congrats.

107
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,486
Don't forget about us when you
get your detective's badge.

108
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:12,711
I'm sorry, do I know you?

109
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:14,780
Insufferable already.
You'll fit right in.

110
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,384
Hey, I mean, it's not a done deal yet.

111
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,783
I still have to take the exam.

112
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,303
Well, we both know that

113
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:20,830
if the detectives want you, you're in.

114
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:22,589
Hey, are we good?

115
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,625
I know you wanted it, too.

116
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,266
Of course.

117
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,592
I'm happy for you.

118
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:28,974
What's going on?

119
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,562
Talia just got the Tap.

120
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,791
No kidding. That's great.

121
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,874
What is she doing back here?

122
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:44,483
What the hell's going on?

123
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,455
They were supposed to hand her
to the D.A. for prosecution.

124
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,813
Your wife made a deal
to be a confidential informant.

125
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,393
What?

126
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:52,035
She has a lot of contacts
on the street.

127
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:54,187
- Because she's a drug addict.
- With police training.

128
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,819
Which will get her killed
if someone finds out.

129
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:57,726
They won't let that happen.

130
00:05:57,877 --> 00:05:59,577
At least this way
she stays out of prison.

131
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,937
I heard Talia got the Tap. You okay?

132
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:14,799
I'm fine. She's my friend.
I'm happy for her.

133
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,070
Whoo! Yeah, baby! Come on.

134
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,606
She's comin' round the outside,
going down...

135
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:26,191
All right, race is over. Get off.

136
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,059
- Did I win?
- Sure.

137
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,513
Have you been drinking, ma'am?

138
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:31,856
No.

139
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,490
I'm high.

140
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,658
You're under arrest.

141
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,960
What? I paid for this ride.

142
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,045
Get down.

143
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,854
Okay.

144
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,519
What the hell is that?

145
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:45,281
Looks like a foot.

146
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:47,170
The real question is, why?

147
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:49,779
- Why what?
- Why do you have a dead foot?

148
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:51,441
It fell off.

149
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:52,968
Of who?

150
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:56,062
My boyfriend. He had gangrene.

151
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,249
And you're keeping it
because it reminds you of him?

152
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:00,140
No. I thought I could sell it.

153
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:03,320
All right. Come on. Grab the foot.

154
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,420
You're not gonna puke on me,
are you, Boot?

155
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,707
No, ma'am.

156
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:15,940
I'm glad that my discomfort
is cheering you up.

157
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,620
Me too.

158
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,618
Dispatch, show us Code 6
and on location.

159
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,363
How many times has this alarm
gone off in the last month?

160
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,451
<i>Six that I see.</i>

161
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:29,140
Thanks.

162
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,453
We'll check the premises and advise.

163
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,342
You gonna miss all this
when you're a fancy detective?

164
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,171
- Not at all.
- What about me?

165
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,579
Even less.

166
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,057
Don't you move.

167
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,949
Dispatch, 7-Adam-15.

168
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,566
We have a woman with a gun.
Requesting backup.

169
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,708
Who wants to try me?

170
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:47,506
Don't move.

171
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,649
Put the gun down.

172
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,847
- They tried to rob me.
- Drop the gun now.

173
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:55,476
Take the one on the left.

174
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:01,249
Get down! There's nowhere to go.

175
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,042
Stop!

176
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:10,853
Drop the gun!

177
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,558
You're under arrest.

178
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,730
Stop!

179
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:24,364
Where are your keys? I need a car!

180
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:27,969
Drop the gun! Put it down!

181
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:33,582
Get out of the house. Get outside.

182
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:34,779
Go, go, go.

183
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,725
Drop the gun!

184
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,478
Don't move.

185
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:53,647
Drop the gun!

186
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,316
7-Adam-15, shots fired.

187
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:10,610
One suspect down.

188
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,414
Requesting R.A. and a supervisor.

189
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,583
<i>Copy. Starting
Code 3 fire and ambulance.</i>

190
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:25,884
7-Adam-15. Negative on the ambulance.

191
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:28,085
Suspect is deceased.

192
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,016
Notify the watch commander.

193
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,998
<i>- Copy.</i>
- Time of death?

194
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,634
<i>Time of death 09:55 hours.</i>

195
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,705
- He pulled a gun.
- We can't talk about this,

196
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,395
until after we're both questioned.

197
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,642
It could compromise the investigation.

198
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:46,117
Right. Of course.

199
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,019
So, what's next?

200
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:50,663
It's a homicide.

201
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,717
I'll secure the scene,
preserve the evidence.

202
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,660
Homicide, right.

203
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:58,315
What should I do?

204
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,869
Nothing.

205
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:02,066
You're the suspect.

206
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,569
Wait in the hall.

207
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,609
You did the right thing,

208
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,368
letting them find Isabel's drugs.

209
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:19,255
They weren't hers.

210
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,231
She's in this situation
because she let herself

211
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:23,011
get taken advantage of.

212
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,852
Do you really believe that?

213
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:31,864
It's an officer-involved shooting.

214
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,304
It's Nolan.

215
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,126
Officer Nolan?

216
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,583
Officer Nolan.

217
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:50,860
Yes.

218
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,944
How many shots, from which direction?

219
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,989
He was standing over there, I was here.

220
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,425
I'm only able to ask
two questions at this time...

221
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,441
"How many shots, from which direction?"

222
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,020
One.

223
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,031
Two?

224
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:10,585
One.

225
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:12,929
That way.

226
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:15,080
Your companion officer?

227
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:18,388
To guide you through the process.

228
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,216
Anyone you want. It's your choice.

229
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:23,073
Grey.

230
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,777
I-I want Grey.

231
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,241
Is that all right?

232
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:28,911
That's perfect.
He'll take you to the station.

233
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:33,203
Do I get the foot back?

234
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:34,672
- No.
- Fine.

235
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:36,752
I still have the other one.

236
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:45,822
- Hey, what's up?
- Booking's closed.

237
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:47,844
We got a bus in the garage
to take everyone to county.

238
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,939
Why? What's going on?

239
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,545
There was a shooting.

240
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:06,993
Things feel, um, really strange.

241
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:08,557
Time is all over the place.

242
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:09,882
Tachypsychia.

243
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:12,400
It's a common response
to a traumatic event.

244
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:14,722
You'll feel better after you've slept.

245
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,039
So, what now?

246
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:18,437
Now you meet with your lawyer,

247
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,223
put together your written statement.

248
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,729
Union rep is on his way.

249
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:23,322
He wants to go over a few things.

250
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:27,041
Then there's the interview,
conducted by Internal Affairs,

251
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,163
with the lead homicide detective,

252
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:30,502
district attorney,

253
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,000
and the independent
police auditor in attendance.

254
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,408
Lot of people.

255
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,984
Just tell the truth to the best
of your ability.

256
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:38,700
It'll be fine.

257
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,440
End of shift?

258
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:43,860
No.

259
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:46,553
They're here to answer some questions.

260
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,308
About you.

261
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:51,712
How would you
characterize Officer Nolan?

262
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:53,891
Officer Nolan
is one of the finest people

263
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:55,026
I've ever known.

264
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,512
Back at the academy, when everyone

265
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:58,205
was gunning for each other,

266
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,439
he'd stay up late and help you study,

267
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,656
even if that meant
bombing the test himself.

268
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:04,963
Is he on any medication?

269
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,956
Not that I know of.

270
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,513
I think he has allergies.

271
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,303
Has Officer Nolan ever talked about

272
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:13,560
wanting to use force?

273
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,802
Wanting to? No.

274
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:18,952
Is he going through anything
in his personal life?

275
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,162
I mean, isn't everyone?

276
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,050
Anything traumatic?

277
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,532
Death of a parent?

278
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:26,622
Breakup?

279
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:29,396
Interpersonal conflict?

280
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:30,796
No.

281
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:33,980
Where's my brother? Why isn't he here?

282
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,235
Your brother was involved
in a shooting.

283
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:37,910
Is he in the hospital?

284
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,432
I'm afraid that's all
I can tell you at this time.

285
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:43,322
Hey, no, no, no. Is he dead?

286
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,627
Is he dead?

287
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:45,954
Come on.

288
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,614
Bishop.

289
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,440
- You okay?
- Yeah.

290
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:57,744
How's Nolan?

291
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:59,911
Hasn't really hit him yet.

292
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:01,357
Have you ever...

293
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,715
Taken a life? No.

294
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:05,347
Me either.

295
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:08,069
Thanks for looking out for him.

296
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,548
You should go home.

297
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:11,461
And do what?

298
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,925
Watch TV? Order in?

299
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,306
I need to get to work.

300
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,212
I need to focus on something else.

301
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,759
All right, in that case,
report to Vestri and Wolfe.

302
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,419
They're working a big case,

303
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:22,622
and you need to get your feet wet

304
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,589
if you're going to take
the detective's exam.

305
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,657
Yes, sir.

306
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:32,673
Captain.

307
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,796
Commander West. Please, come in.

308
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,667
Thank you.

309
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,047
- It's good to see you again.
- You too.

310
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:41,786
Anything I should know
as the investigation begins?

311
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,160
Officer Nolan and his T.O.

312
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,385
responded to a 211
at a convenience store.

313
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,890
He pursued an armed robber
into an occupied house.

314
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:49,612
Fired one shot.

315
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:52,762
Hopefully it's as
straightforward as it sounds.

316
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,626
Is this the first officer
under your command

317
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:56,799
to take a life?

318
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:58,269
Yes.

319
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,847
But you've been through
the process yourself.

320
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:03,386
You read my file, Commander.

321
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,678
Back when my son was assigned here.

322
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,391
I understand that he and Nolan
are pretty tight.

323
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:11,708
Officer Nolan's pretty close
with both of his fellow rookies.

324
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,494
You like him?

325
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:16,693
I admire what he's trying to do.

326
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,332
Okay.

327
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,424
I'll keep you updated
about the investigation.

328
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,837
Dad.

329
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,202
When I got the call about your station,

330
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,569
I was worried it was you.

331
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,785
I'm okay.

332
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,409
If it had been me, I'd handle it.

333
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:32,969
I know.

334
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,523
You know, Nolan's a great officer.

335
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:36,051
I'm sure it's a good shoot.

336
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,070
That's what I'm here to determine.

337
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,068
You don't know who to call.

338
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:51,310
Can it wait?

339
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:56,431
The PIO will be briefing
the press soon.

340
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,912
You don't want your family to
hear about this on the news.

341
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,531
Who can handle a call like this?

342
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,134
Sarah. My ex-wife.

343
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:22,024
Sarah, it's me.

344
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,348
<i>Hey, I've been meaning to call.</i>

345
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,164
<i>Did you look at Henry's
course load next semester?</i>

346
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:26,498
Yeah, listen...

347
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,087
<i>I'm worried
he's over-extending himself.</i>

348
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:29,351
Sarah, I...

349
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:32,003
<i>It's not the number of credits.
It's the difficulty.</i>

350
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,025
Sarah, you're gonna see some
things on the news.

351
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,784
I want you to know I'm fine.

352
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:39,226
And tell Henry I'm fine.

353
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,316
<i>John, what's going on?</i>

354
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:44,057
I killed someone.

355
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:45,311
<i>What?</i>

356
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:46,794
On the job.

357
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:50,363
I killed someone.

358
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,724
Civil liability is covered
up to $2 million

359
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:54,848
under your plan.

360
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,049
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:57,609
I don't, uh...

362
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,479
I'm a little...

363
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:00,967
Who are you?

364
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,387
Simon Paige, your union rep.

365
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:06,853
What?

366
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:08,812
If you don't remember,
say you don't remember.

367
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:12,192
Under no circumstances
do you express guilt.

368
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:13,727
But I feel terrible.

369
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,535
Guilt implies you did something wrong.

370
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:17,123
Now, they're gonna tell you
your statement

371
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,810
can't be used against you
in a murder trial.

372
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:19,923
Technically true,

373
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,791
but it can and will be used against you

374
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,476
in any civil proceeding.

375
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:24,808
Right.

376
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,964
You were saying, about a civil trial?

377
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,142
- Is that likely?
- Quite.

378
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,805
If liability exceeds $2 million,

379
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:35,016
your wages will be garnished,
pursuant to...

380
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,969
To subdivision F

381
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:40,235
of California Government Code
Section 3303

382
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,785
or as otherwise required by law.

383
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,702
You're Jackson's dad.

384
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:48,161
- We met at graduation.
- Yes, we did.

385
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:49,614
But right now,

386
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,069
I'm the head of Internal Affairs,

387
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:53,061
and you're being interviewed
about a shooting

388
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:54,850
that happened earlier today.

389
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,780
Right. Yes, sir. Sorry.

390
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,409
Now, do you understand your rights

391
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,155
as I've described them?

392
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,037
No.

393
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,150
Only civilians have the right
to remain silent.

394
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,589
If you choose not to answer
any of my questions,

395
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,621
you will no longer be a cop.

396
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:12,238
- Understand?
- I understand.

397
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,569
Let's begin.

398
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:19,156
Did you have any
less-than-lethal weapons available?

399
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:21,699
- Taser? Pepper spray?
- Yes.

400
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:22,945
Did you attempt to use

401
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,470
any of these less-than-lethal weapons?

402
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:27,027
- No.
- Why not?

403
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:30,435
I'm not sure. I didn't have time.

404
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:32,860
You're not sure
or you didn't have time?

405
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,419
I-I didn't have time.

406
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:37,852
My hand was on my gun.

407
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:40,489
I couldn't reach for my Taser.

408
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:43,791
- Did you have cover or concealment?
- No.

409
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,857
- Did the suspect discharge his firearm?
- No.

410
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:49,768
- How many rounds did you fire?
- One.

411
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,318
- What were you aiming at?
- Him, his chest.

412
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,933
Center mass, like we were trained.

413
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,524
- Did you hit what you were aiming at?
- Yes.

414
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,259
Describe what he did or what you saw

415
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,847
to make you think you
struck the suspect.

416
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:08,922
There was blood. He fell.

417
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,149
Finally, appreciating that police work

418
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:13,974
involves rapidly changing

419
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:16,941
and dangerous, fluid environments,

420
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:19,175
is there anything you would
have done differently?

421
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,689
What are you doing here?

422
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm helping out the detectives today.

423
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,147
You got the Tap?

424
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:32,419
Yeah.

425
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:34,096
Congratulations.

426
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,011
I know how much you wanted it.

427
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,407
Look, I know this is weird.

428
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,923
I was at your wedding...

429
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,744
Officer Bishop, thanks for joining us.

430
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,073
Thanks for having confidence in me.

431
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,684
You're all caught up
to speed on the case?

432
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:47,373
Our C.I.'s boyfriend, Carson,
is a low-level dealer.

433
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:48,953
He gets his drugs from Marcus Vance.

434
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:50,411
We've been trying to get eyes
on him for years.

435
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:51,900
And this is our opportunity.

436
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,101
When is the next time

437
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,170
Carson plans on meeting with Vance?

438
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,742
Um, tomorrow night at some motel.

439
00:19:57,894 --> 00:19:59,233
He's gonna buy another kilo.

440
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:00,595
Can you get him to take you along?

441
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:03,343
What? You want me to wear a wire?

442
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,798
I-I-I thought you wanted information.

443
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,903
What's the best way to get information?

444
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,635
I've never gone with him
on a buy before.

445
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,030
I can't just ask out of the blue.

446
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:12,254
It'll look suspicious.

447
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,102
So be convincing.

448
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:15,468
Maybe we should start slower.

449
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:18,087
Sending her into a buy to make
her certified reliable...

450
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,145
- that's as slow as it gets.
- You don't understand.

451
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:23,210
Carson's paranoid.
H-He'll know something's up.

452
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:25,852
Then we'll have to get him to
think it was his idea.

453
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,590
I can't imagine
what Nolan's going through.

454
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,850
Can you?

455
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:34,576
Yeah.

456
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:36,447
My second year as a T.O.,

457
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:39,192
a prisoner transport went sideways.

458
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:42,149
My Boot didn't search
the suspect properly,

459
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,777
lost her gun.

460
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:45,606
The guy would've killed us both

461
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:46,964
if I hadn't pulled the trigger.

462
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:48,488
What happened to the Boot?

463
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:51,607
I don't know.
She wasn't a cop after that.

464
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:56,674
Is there anything anyone said or did

465
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:58,198
that helped you through it?

466
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,635
No, I just had to make
my peace with it.

467
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,007
Don't leave town.

468
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:08,659
You must be available for questioning

469
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,772
within an hour of notification.

470
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,002
And remember, you can talk
to your fellow officers.

471
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:14,293
But they could be called in

472
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:16,218
to testify about anything you say.

473
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:19,978
So think about whether you want
to drag them into this.

474
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:21,718
I understand, sir.

475
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:28,354
Hey, are you all right?

476
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:29,817
Yeah.

477
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:33,241
Feel like I haven't seen you in years.

478
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,695
Is there anything you need?

479
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:39,830
Ready to go?

480
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:41,916
Yeah.

481
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:52,808
Everybody will do their jobs.

482
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:54,622
I'm sure it'll be over shortly.

483
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:56,994
- Just go get some sleep.
- Thanks.

484
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:01,814
Nolan.

485
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:05,618
Why did you choose me

486
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,221
to be your companion officer?

487
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,145
The rest of them would have told me

488
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,903
I did the right thing
whether I did or not.

489
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,472
I knew if I asked you,
you'd tell me the truth.

490
00:22:17,343 --> 00:22:18,844
So, why haven't you asked me?

491
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:23,308
I don't think I'm ready
to hear the answer.

492
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:28,960
He had a gun on you.

493
00:22:29,203 --> 00:22:32,203
He refused repeated orders
to surrender.

494
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,269
I would've done exactly what you did.

495
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:55,090
<i>Get outside. Go, go, go.</i>

496
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:57,170
<i>Drop the gun! Put it down! Don't move.</i>

497
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:00,883
<i>7-Adam 15. Suspect is deceased.</i>

498
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,552
<i>- What should I do?
- You're the suspect.</i>

499
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,529
<i>Is there anything you
would have done differently?</i>

500
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,712
That's Isabel's boyfriend?

501
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,625
Our girl's fallen off a long way
since Bradford.

502
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,132
Come on.

503
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:27,680
Carson Miller.

504
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:29,917
I know you?

505
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:31,143
Nope.

506
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:33,169
But I know you.

507
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,151
Come on. Let's go.

508
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:36,881
Hands on the car.

509
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,990
- Why? I didn't do anything.
- You're on parole, Carson.

510
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:41,099
We can search you whenever we want.

511
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,507
Hmm.

512
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:46,963
Hope you didn't have plans today.

513
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,429
- Do you have a minute?
- Of course. Come in.

514
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:56,731
Get the door.

515
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:01,361
How are you doing?

516
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:02,845
Good.

517
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:04,780
No. That's, uh...

518
00:24:05,164 --> 00:24:06,471
That's not true at all.

519
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,870
There was something I was hoping
you could help me with.

520
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:10,399
Um...

521
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:15,866
I wanted to see my body-cam
footage of the event,

522
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:17,525
if that's okay.

523
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:19,728
You have a right to see it.

524
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:22,235
But honestly, I don't think you should.

525
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,020
Look, I've been where you are now.

526
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,854
It was an alley instead of a bedroom,

527
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,442
rapist instead of a robber,

528
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,796
but the results were the same.

529
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:36,951
I understand that you want answers,

530
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:39,006
but watching the body-cam footage,

531
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,581
I don't think you're ready
for how traumatic that can be.

532
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:46,686
I need to see it.

533
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:51,755
Okay.

534
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:00,293
<i>Drop the gun! Put it down!</i>

535
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,374
<i>Get out of the house.
Get outside. Go, go, go.</i>

536
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,919
<i>Drop the gun!</i>

537
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,255
<i>Don't move.</i>

538
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:22,721
<i>Drop the gun!</i>

539
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:30,323
He was scared.

540
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,985
Maybe he wasn't gonna pull the trigger.

541
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,982
Maybe I could have talked him
down another way.

542
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,735
Hey.

543
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:38,553
That's not what I saw.

544
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:42,066
You think he was gonna kill me?

545
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,179
I think you did exactly
what we trained you to do

546
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:47,505
when you saw that your life
was in jeopardy.

547
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:51,963
Thank you.

548
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:54,823
One more thing.

549
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,318
The other robber, Kyle Montgomery,

550
00:25:58,343 --> 00:25:59,925
posted bail this morning.

551
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:01,553
He gave an interview stating

552
00:26:01,578 --> 00:26:03,266
that you killed his brother
in cold blood.

553
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,163
Now, obviously,

554
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:07,681
we know that the facts
don't match his version.

555
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:10,068
John, I want you to know

556
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:13,582
that the department
has your back, 100%.

557
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,173
Thank you.

558
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:25,929
Hey, it's me. We got trouble.

559
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:27,095
<i>What happened?</i>

560
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,720
I got pinched with drugs on me.

561
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:30,573
<i>A lot?</i>

562
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,990
Enough to keep me
from meeting Vance tonight.

563
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,265
Can you reschedule?

564
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,270
<i>No. You don't reschedule
with a man like that.</i>

565
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:37,439
<i>- God, you're an idiot.</i>
- Yeah.

566
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,527
Okay, fine. I got it.

567
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:43,326
Hey, um, is there someone else
you trust to go instead?

568
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:45,241
You know, maybe... maybe Rusty?

569
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:47,656
<i>Rusty's an even bigger idiot than you.</i>

570
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,140
<i>Damn it. You're gonna have to do it.</i>

571
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,582
No way.

572
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:54,144
<i>If I don't pay Vance back, I'm dead.</i>

573
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,018
<i>So you're gonna do this.</i>

574
00:26:59,408 --> 00:27:01,518
Uh, yeah. Fine, okay.

575
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,853
I'll do it.

576
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:09,880
Good work.

577
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,799
We'll get you out of here once
we take your boyfriend

578
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:13,163
to the courthouse.

579
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,451
Hey.

580
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:23,207
Are you sure you're up for tonight?

581
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:24,753
No.

582
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:29,478
But I can't go to prison,
so guess I have to be.

583
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,409
Have you heard from Nolan?

584
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,283
Not since yesterday.

585
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,563
- You?
- No.

586
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,144
I didn't know if I should call.

587
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,218
Maybe he needs us to reach out.
I don't know.

588
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,613
He'll tell us what he needs.

589
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:48,785
- You didn't.
- That was different, okay?

590
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,505
I was ashamed.

591
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:53,631
Maybe he is, too.

592
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:55,957
The Rooks were asking
how they can help Nolan.

593
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:58,489
I found heavy drinking really
helped knock out the nightmares.

594
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,089
Maybe keep that to yourself.

595
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,325
Mm. Detective Talia graces us
with her presence.

596
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:05,670
Yeah, it breaks my heart
to see you out of uniform.

597
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:07,791
- Hmm.
- You seem... shorter.

598
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,187
I need to talk to you.

599
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,647
Come on, Boot!

600
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:23,966
- How is she?
- Not good.

601
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:25,694
I can only imagine
how you've been handling -

602
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,816
I don't need to commiserate.
I need to know what's going on.

603
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:29,209
If the detectives know

604
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:30,939
I revealed anything
about the operation...

605
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:32,192
Then don't.

606
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:35,808
They want Isabel to wear
a wire to a drug deal.

607
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:38,395
Tonight.

608
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,023
A wire?

609
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,553
Why not shoot her in the
head, and be done with it?

610
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:48,863
- Be a hell of a lot quicker.
- Excuse us.

611
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:55,060
You enter my office again
without knocking,

612
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:57,145
I will put you on admin leave
without pay.

613
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,236
Is that understood?

614
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:00,435
You can't let them do this, all right?

615
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,586
She's an ex-cop.
As if being an informant wasn't enough,

616
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:04,990
now they want her to buy a kilo
of heroin wearing a wire?

617
00:29:05,015 --> 00:29:06,128
I looked at her file.

618
00:29:06,153 --> 00:29:07,554
She took part in dozens of drug busts

619
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,031
when she was a narcotics detective.

620
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:11,222
- This is different.
- Explain to me how it is

621
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,347
that you know the details
of their operation.

622
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:15,187
You don't know her like I do, okay?

623
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:17,892
You've read her file.
You know who she was.

624
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:19,891
I know who she is now.

625
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,725
And the Isabel in that file is gone.

626
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,242
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:30,304
All I can do now is put you
on rescue detail.

628
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,379
If the deal goes south,

629
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:33,103
you will be the first in the door.

630
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,024
I'm sorry I barged in.

631
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,388
It won't happen again.

632
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,110
John.

633
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:58,770
- Hey.
- Hey.

634
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,711
Uh, how long have you been
standing here?

635
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:03,576
People are staring.

636
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:07,681
Oh.

637
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:10,301
Yeah, I get that a lot.

638
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:12,799
- Tell me what's going on.
- Ah, I can't.

639
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:15,803
If I talk to you about it,
they could call you to testify.

640
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:17,518
Uh, then I'll testify

641
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:19,549
you're one of the best people I know.

642
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:25,576
I can't stop thinking about it.

643
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,417
I was so amped up chasing that guy,

644
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:32,156
and then...

645
00:30:32,722 --> 00:30:34,946
he turned, and then he was dead.

646
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,313
What if I can't get past this, Luce?

647
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,361
What... How will I ever
do the job again?

648
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,588
Um... You know what?

649
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,903
- I'm sorry. I should go.
- Hey. No, no, no, no.

650
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,384
Um...

651
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,918
Come with me. Yeah?

652
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:04,569
Done with the investigation?

653
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:05,742
For now.

654
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,186
Don't suppose you could
tell me anything.

655
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,730
You know I can't.

656
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,480
Yeah.

657
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:14,950
Hey. Can I, um, take you to dinner?

658
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:17,574
Told your mother I'd take her.

659
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:20,260
I mean, you both can come.

660
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:25,352
I don't think she's ready for that.

661
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:31,741
Um, see you at church?

662
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:34,147
Looking forward to it.

663
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:43,674
What are we doing here?

664
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:53,785
I can't imagine what you're
going through.

665
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,443
And maybe if I was in the same place,

666
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:56,734
I'd think about quitting, too.

667
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,997
But...

668
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:01,137
they're alive because you did your job.

669
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,654
You put your own life at risk
to protect them,

670
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:07,123
and if you're ever
in that position again,

671
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:09,857
I know you'll do the same thing.

672
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:37,635
Um...

673
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:39,429
Thank you very much for the ride

674
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,089
and, uh, the therapy session.

675
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:44,871
Of course.

676
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:48,694
Um... Can I make you a drink?

677
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:51,297
I could, uh, whip you up a cappuccino.

678
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:53,830
- Really?
- No.

679
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:56,533
I don't know how to work the machine.

680
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,491
I hate it. I'm a little scared of it.

681
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:00,564
Maybe next time.

682
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:01,824
Yeah. No, of course.

683
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,478
I'm sure you have someplace to be.

684
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:06,185
Yeah. I should, um...

685
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:11,202
Um...

686
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:56,174
We'll be right here.

687
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:59,586
Anything goes wrong,
we'll be inside in a heartbeat.

688
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,096
We can call this off.

689
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:04,505
I'm fine.

690
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:06,037
No, you're not.

691
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,164
This'll help.

692
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,039
Methadone? Thank you.

693
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:15,802
Hey, um, what...
what happens after tonight?

694
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,384
They won't arrest Vance immediately.

695
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:20,137
They'll want to watch him for a while,

696
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,544
make cases against
the rest of his crew.

697
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:23,179
His lieutenant, his supplier,

698
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:24,804
the supplier's supplier.

699
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,138
Yeah.

700
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:28,927
This is never gonna end, is it?

701
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:32,661
<i>Stop! What are you doing?</i>

702
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:34,418
<i>I want to remember this.</i>

703
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:37,355
<i>Come on. This is our last day
as fun, carefree single people.</i>

704
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:40,749
<i>Only boredom and drudgery
from here on out.</i>

705
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:43,021
<i>I'm afraid so. It's in the vows.</i>

706
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:44,598
<i>- There's still time.
- Great.</i>

707
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:45,777
<i>- Yeah.
- Go.</i>

708
00:34:51,137 --> 00:34:52,770
Hey.

709
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:56,562
- What are you doing here?
- Are you kidding?

710
00:34:56,602 --> 00:34:57,795
Hanging out near the airport

711
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,953
is a normal Tuesday night for me.

712
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:03,636
You'd be right here
if the situations were reversed.

713
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,296
And I brought fries.

714
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:08,943
Thanks.

715
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:13,501
You know, you'd have to be
in an actual relationship

716
00:35:13,526 --> 00:35:15,414
for the situations to be reversed.

717
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,560
What are you, my mother?

718
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:30,731
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

719
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:37,018
<i>- Who are you?
- Carson sent me.</i>

720
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:38,374
- She's nervous.
- She's fine.

721
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:40,091
She's done stuff like this before.

722
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:41,939
<i>Get out of here, junkie.</i>

723
00:35:43,004 --> 00:35:44,103
<i>Hey.</i>

724
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:45,827
<i>I have the money
that Carson owes Vance.</i>

725
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,352
<i>Does he want it or not?</i>

726
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,752
<i>You Vance?</i>

727
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,498
<i>You got my money?</i>

728
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:59,630
<i>- Yeah.
- Count it.</i>

729
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:08,924
<i>The money's all here.</i>

730
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,394
<i>How fast can you move that?</i>

731
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,114
<i>Couple of weeks.</i>

732
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,248
<i>Good.</i>

733
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:24,307
<i>Tell Carson next time he sends
you to do his work for him,</i>

734
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:28,723
<i>I'll assume you're in
charge and put him in the ground.</i>

735
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,191
It's done.

736
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:31,775
Just take the brick and go.

737
00:36:35,391 --> 00:36:37,078
<i>Hey, wait. Um...</i>

738
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:38,952
<i>we could move more than this.</i>

739
00:36:39,348 --> 00:36:40,478
What the hell is she doing?

740
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:42,348
<i>Another kilo at least.</i>

741
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:44,038
<i>Really?</i>

742
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:47,853
<i>'Cause Carson always
said no to that much weight.</i>

743
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:49,424
What is she doing?

744
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:50,684
If he sends for another kilo,

745
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,042
we can follow his guys to their source.

746
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,655
She wants to end this.

747
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:55,787
- Ah, smart.
- No, desperate.

748
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,458
Gonna make him suspicious.

749
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:01,860
<i>Okay.</i>

750
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:04,204
<i>I'll get you another kilo.</i>

751
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:06,532
<i>But you'll have to wait.</i>

752
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,772
<i>Sure.</i>

753
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,349
<i>I got no place else to be.</i>

754
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:15,077
<i>This place got a mini-bar?</i>

755
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:17,143
We should go in now.

756
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,806
Negative. We wait for the drop.

757
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:24,077
That was...

758
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:25,874
A mistake.

759
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,297
A fun,

760
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:31,049
never-going-to-happen-again... mistake.

761
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:32,652
Right. Yeah.

762
00:37:32,785 --> 00:37:33,972
Exactly.

763
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:38,432
Agreed.

764
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:46,068
<i>I know you from someplace?</i>

765
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,201
<i>I don't think so.</i>

766
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:50,539
<i>- I do.
- You look really familiar.</i>

767
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,592
<i>I'm an addict, and you're a dealer,</i>

768
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:55,280
<i>so I'm sure we've crossed paths.</i>

769
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:57,337
He's on to her. He knows she was a cop.

770
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:59,087
It's a big city.
He could have seen her anywhere.

771
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,362
Or she busted one of his friends
back in the day.

772
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:02,549
<i>Could be.</i>

773
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:06,796
<i>Maybe you just have one of those faces.</i>

774
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:09,622
<i>Sure.</i>

775
00:38:10,312 --> 00:38:13,421
<i>Yeah. I, uh, get that all the time.</i>

776
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,658
What happened?

777
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:20,985
We lost signal.

778
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:22,668
- We lost her.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

779
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:23,761
It's probably just a glitch.

780
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:25,243
Or he's on to her. We need to go in!

781
00:38:25,355 --> 00:38:26,682
All units, hold position!

782
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,017
He's on to her. I'm going in.

783
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:29,531
No. It's just a glitch, Tim.

784
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,741
Hold position. All units, hold.

785
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,725
Damn it. Go. Go, go.

786
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,713
Police!

787
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,985
Clear!

788
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:05,377
They must have gone out the back.

789
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:10,910
- You did this!
- Hey, hey!

790
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:12,212
- You did this!
- Hey!

791
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,409
- You!
- Hey!

792
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,610
- Come here!
- Calm down!

793
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:15,853
Calm down!

794
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,767
What if it wasn't a mistake?

795
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:23,494
What?

796
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:26,578
I'm gonna make something to eat.

797
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:27,940
Do you want something?

798
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:31,135
Oh, uh, not for me. Thank you.

799
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,246
Lucy?

800
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:38,754
Hey.

801
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,225
You know who I am?

802
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:43,324
You're Kyle Montgomery.
You're Alex's brother.

803
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:44,855
No! No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,816
I don't got a brother no more.

805
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,445
You killed him.

806
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:50,584
I didn't have a choice.
He was gonna shoot me.

807
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:53,577
You're a liar!
He wouldn't have hurt anybody.

808
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:55,414
You can't know that.
You weren't in the roo...

809
