1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:02,480
Look out!

2
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:11,873
That work out the way
you planned it, Boot?

4
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:27,293
Check it out. Check it out.
I got a bullet in one hand,

5
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:29,065
cigar in the other, and
I said to the chief...

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,665
I said, "You pin that medal"

7
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,401
"right in the middle."

8
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:35,069
Right?

9
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:36,904
Hey, hey, look at that!

10
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:39,006
Officer John Nolan.

11
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:41,610
Oh! Grittiest recruit I've
ever trained right here, man.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,936
Good to see you. You too, man.

13
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:45,212
Only long-timers allowed in here, Hawke.

14
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:46,332
You know the rules.

15
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:48,039
I never met a rule I didn't break, Otto,

16
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:50,084
so go get your old ass over to the bar

17
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:52,253
and get a drink. Come on.
It's on the Hawke.

18
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,221
Whoo, sit down, man.

19
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:55,756
Fun place you got here.

20
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:58,859
It's a dump, but my credit is so good.

21
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,354
They're like, "Oh, I don't
know if I got this in me."

22
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:06,523
Long time ago, man.

23
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,058
Mm.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,061
I tell you, my talents are
being wasted at the Academy.

25
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:13,650
Seven years is too long to
keep The Hawke cooped up.

26
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,142
- Ah.
- Yeah. No, I need to get

27
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:16,696
back out there on the street, man.

28
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:18,954
Take a real door, you know,
just throw some bullets.

29
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,842
I thought you were trying to
get assigned to Mid-Wilshire.

30
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,633
Oh, I was, but your captain,

31
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,141
he blocked me.

32
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,446
So, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

33
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,715
So, tell me right now.
How's the real thing

34
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,850
- compare to the Academy?
- You were right about the job.

35
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,785
It is nothing like the Academy.

36
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,029
That's right. That's why I
never teach by the manual.

37
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:39,556
Never.

38
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:42,158
Well, I wouldn't have been
ready if it wasn't for you.

39
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,101
You were the only one who showed
me any support at the Academy.

40
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,627
It was... There's a whole
generation of cops

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,209
with the Hawke brand on them.
You should be proud.

42
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,666
Ah, don't be blowing smoke.

43
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,168
I don't need you to tell
me how pretty I am.

44
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:54,070
- Good, because I'm a terrible liar.
- Yes, you are.

45
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:55,550
You are terrible.

46
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,774
Okay, mm.

47
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,087
I got to wrap it up. I
got to get out of here.

48
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:00,338
- Mnh-mnh!
- It's a school night,

49
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:02,403
and I am not good enough at
this job to do it hung over.

50
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:04,014
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

51
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,849
You can't tap out on me tonight, no way.

52
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,418
The night is too young,
and I am in no hurry

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,120
to get back to that motel... none.

54
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,917
A motel?

55
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,317
Yeah. Well, my wife, she, uh...

56
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:15,708
Uh, she kicked me out

57
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,884
- months ago.
- No.

58
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:18,495
Yeah. It's no big deal.

59
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,432
It's no big deal. Marriages
are tough, right?

60
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,801
- You've been there.
- Yes.

61
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,636
I just... I don't know.

62
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:29,139
I just need to give her, uh
...give her a little space.

63
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,407
That's all.

64
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,383
You know, look, I got a great couch.

65
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,112
Why don't you crash at my place tonight?

66
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:40,383
No, no. I'm all paid for
the week at Travel Inn,

67
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,786
and I have got clean sheets.

68
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:45,789
I got cold pizza, premium cable.

69
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,491
Right? Hey, if that's not
living the dream, my friend...

70
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:50,610
- Yeah.
- ...then I don't know what is, right?

71
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:57,133
God. Give me this, pansy.

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,073
I've never seen him like that.

73
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:05,275
He's usually so confident,
so self-assured,

74
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,900
- so...
- Arrogant.

75
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,712
You know he's living in a motel now?

76
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,344
That's what happens when you try
to be big policeman at home.

77
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:13,003
You end up on the couch.

78
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,175
Tim rode with Hawke back in the day.

79
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,754
Damn straight. Craziest
six months of my life.

80
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:20,056
Hmm. Nolan hung out with him last night.

81
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,028
- Hawke and Nolan?
- Oh, yeah.

82
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,360
They were tight at the Academy.

83
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,261
They bonded over their
shared love of old stuff.

84
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:28,561
- The Beastie Boys isn't old.
- They formed before I was born.

85
00:03:28,654 --> 00:03:30,533
All right, everyone take a seat.

86
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:32,168
Got some catching up to do.

87
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,831
Let's go.

88
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,810
First, let's congratulate Officer Chen

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,912
for allowing her T.O.
to finish his coffee

90
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,702
<i>before</i> rolling their vehicle.

91
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:52,355
I see "training" is working out for you.

92
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:54,567
All right, more pressingly,

93
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,567
midnight shift was flooded
with calls last night,

94
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:59,474
and they left us with their mess.

95
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:01,318
Let's get started.

96
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:04,988
Our detectives are working a
homicide in Larchmont Village,

97
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:07,991
but there are witnesses that
still need to be interviewed.

98
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,860
Bishop and Nolan, you'll take that.

99
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:12,951
And Burglary has got a search warrant

100
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,904
that patrol didn't get around to.

101
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:16,545
Bradford and Chen, you'll take that.

102
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,689
Come on, why can't Burglary
serve their own damn warrants?

103
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,425
Because they don't have the
vim and vigor you have,

104
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,989
Officer Bradford.

105
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:25,418
This is yours.

106
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:27,521
All the faces. Don't worry.

107
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:29,656
I have pending calls for everybody!

108
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:31,426
All right, let's go knock 'em out

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,960
and show the late shift how
real police work is done.

110
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,828
All right, we're
serving a search warrant.

111
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:40,121
You see door hinges?

112
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,246
Uh, the door opens outwards towards us.

113
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,758
And what's a "fatal funnel"?

114
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,783
The first three feet in any doorway.

115
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:47,908
Not bad. Here's the real test.

116
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,999
Of all the things Burglary
told us about our suspect...

117
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,835
...LeShawn Halvorsen,

118
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,602
what's most important?

119
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,394
Uh, history of fighting with police.

120
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,940
Wrong. This guy's been served
seven search warrants,

121
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,331
spent half his life on parole.

122
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,971
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm not sure I follow.

123
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:07,006
He's been searched a lot.
He knows what doesn't work,

124
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:08,914
so to find his stash, you'll
have to think like a crook.

125
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,556
- Can you do that?
- Of course.

126
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,887
You don't think I can?

127
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,549
I think you were raised
to analyze bad guys,

128
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,341
not be one, and to be a great cop,

129
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,019
you got to have a little outlaw in you.

130
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,488
Hinges?

131
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,722
On the inside.

132
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,227
Police. Open up, LeShawn.

133
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,578
What's an acceptable amount of
time to wait before we bust in?

134
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,137
That had to hurt.

135
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:41,417
Why don't you like Hawke?

136
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,138
He's a throwback. He
thinks the good old days

137
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:45,088
were when the LAPD was 90% white men.

138
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:47,339
Really? Didn't strike me as that guy.

139
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,846
I'm sure he didn't.

140
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,100
Police Department!

141
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,784
- Hello?
- You called last night.

142
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,786
You said you had some
information about a homicide,

143
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,134
a stabbing that happened
around the corner.

144
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:58,346
Oh, yeah, uh.

145
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,482
I was waiting so long, I
fell asleep on the couch.

146
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:03,727
Can you tell us what you witnessed?

147
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:06,632
I'll do better than that. I'll show you.

148
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,818
Come on!

149
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:14,360
Yo, lady cop,

150
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:16,589
you can search my place all day.

151
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,558
Get up. Face the wall before I snatch

152
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,933
the other eye out of your head.

153
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,402
You need to learn some respect.

154
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:26,205
Okay, come on, Officer Chen.
Think like a crook.

155
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,833
When's the last time you hid
anything under a couch, 8th grade?

156
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,449
You know how many times I
couldn't find my phone

157
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,031
and it was under the
couch the whole time?

158
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,204
This isn't that.

159
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:34,500
You ever heard of the DEAR method?

160
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,448
- D-E-A-R?
- No.

161
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,212
There are four principles
of concealment.

162
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,381
First is deception... "D."

163
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,483
Deception shows you one thing

164
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:44,033
when it's really something else.

165
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,375
Hey, some heads talking about me like,

166
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,855
"That dude ain't true."

167
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:49,572
"E" is for "elusive."

168
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:52,964
What appears to be nothing
is actually something.

169
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:54,510
What, what does that make me?

170
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,012
What am I really, though?

171
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:58,249
"A" for "access." Things
hard to get to...

172
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,440
high places, low places.

173
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,793
Which brings us to "R."

174
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:12,328
"R" is for "repulsive."

175
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,788
Toilets, garbage, porn collection,

176
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,101
anything that makes you want to puke

177
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,445
makes a crook want to hide things there.

178
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:18,902
You've got to be kidding me.

179
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,594
Might want to glove up.

180
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:22,796
Saw a box of sex toys
in the master bedroom,

181
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,197
and don't forget the toilet.

182
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,265
- Search before you flush.
- Wait.

183
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,701
Uh, why do I have to be "R"?

184
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,143
I don't... I don't want to be "R."

185
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,369
I could be "elusive"

186
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:32,072
or "deceptive" or something.

187
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,925
I was cleaning the garage, and, uh,

188
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,384
this guy ran in, a guy I'd never met.

189
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,583
He was covered in blood. He had a knife.

190
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,473
I told him, "You're not gonna
get far dressed like that,"

191
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,840
so he wanted my shirt.

192
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,746
- Did you give it to him?
- Of course not.

193
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,243
So then what happened?

194
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:02,012
All those karate lessons paid off.

195
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,407
The knife's on the work bench.

196
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:13,791
Do I get a medal?

197
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,828
Uh, give us a second.

198
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:18,742
Sure.

199
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,732
So, do we arrest him, too?

200
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,002
I mean, he kind of kidnapped a guy.

201
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,986
He used reasonable force
for a citizen's arrest,

202
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,507
and we can log a collar on 187.

203
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,089
Day's off to a good start.

204
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:49,574
What the hell?

205
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:51,931
What?

206
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:54,160
I've been back there for 20 minutes

207
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:56,774
digging through Caligula's toy chest,

208
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,733
and you've had this the whole time?

209
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:00,015
Well, not the whole time.

210
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,373
It took me three or four minutes.

211
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,175
- Mm.
- You find anything?

212
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,952
Uh, yeah.

213
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
Horrid, filthy things.

214
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,134
What's this call again?

215
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,725
Woman called 911 last night

216
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,149
to report a domestic disturbance,

217
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:21,286
and midnight shift never got to it.

218
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,828
Good morning, Mrs. Mitchell.

219
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:27,097
Sorry about the delay
responding to your call.

220
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:28,941
Is something wrong?

221
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,146
No, honey. They're
friends of your father.

222
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:33,771
Jump in the car. We'll
head to school in a sec.

223
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,002
I'm sorry. I made a mistake calling you.

224
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:45,419
No, you didn't.

225
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:46,680
Clearly something happened last night

226
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:48,137
that made you call 911.

227
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:50,838
What was it?

228
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,897
Logan was at his grandmother's
across the street,

229
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,999
so I had a date over.

230
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:01,969
Things started heating up,

231
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,639
and that's when he stormed in... drunk.

232
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,084
<i>He</i> being your husband?

233
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:09,109
Soon-to-be ex. I just filed for divorce.

234
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,745
Usually I can keep him calm,

235
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,363
but when he saw Mike,
he pulled out a gun.

236
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:18,404
He hit him in the face. He made
him leave in his underwear.

237
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,748
Said it was called "walking the plank."

238
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:22,602
- Did your husband hurt you?
- No, never.

239
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:26,625
It's just he's been acting so
crazy since I served papers.

240
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,922
You told your son that we
were friends of his father's.

241
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,263
I'm guessing that means
your husband's a cop?

242
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,954
Last name Mitchell?

243
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,777
My maiden name is Mitchell, actually.

244
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,580
My married name is Hawke.

245
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:43,503
Your husband's Jeremy Hawke?

246
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:46,111
Yes, and that's why I
shouldn't have called.

247
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,068
He could lose his job
over this, his pension.

248
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,716
I understand, but what you
described are crimes.

249
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,242
Assault and battery,
brandishing a firearm.

250
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:57,464
Does this mean you're gonna arrest him?

251
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,494
It means we're gonna
call the watch commander

252
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,041
and ask him how he wants us to proceed.

253
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:09,935
Okay, down to two pending calls.

254
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,738
Must've been nice to have a
champion at the Academy.

255
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,506
I sure didn't.

256
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:16,394
Hawke saw something in me,

257
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,775
probably because we were closer in age

258
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,831
than most of the rookies.
Bonded over our kids.

259
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,181
Yeah, his was a little
younger than Henry,

260
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:25,229
but since I'd already

261
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:26,580
been through all the
terrible teenage years,

262
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,469
I gave him some hard-earned pointers.

263
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,298
Never took it easy on me, though.

264
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,433
If anything, he pushed me harder.

265
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,960
<i> 7-Adam-15, we have
priority dispatch for you.</i>

266
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:38,220
<i>Call Sergeant Grey, details to your box.</i>

267
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,341
<i>Not for broadcast.</i>

268
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,611
- What does that mean?
- Nothing good.

269
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:46,729
It's Bishop. What's up?

270
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:48,520
I need Nolan. Put me on speaker.

271
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:53,757
<i>I heard you were with
Jeremy Hawke last night.</i>

272
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,812
Uh, yeah, at a bar. Everything okay?

273
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:57,425
He could be in some trouble.

274
00:11:57,994 --> 00:12:00,735
No criminal charges yet, but he
had an incident with his wife.

275
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,858
- You know where he is?
- I know where he's staying.

276
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:05,114
Good. Bring him to the
captain's office immediately.

277
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,719
Yes, sir. We're en route.

278
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:08,955
I knew something was wrong.

279
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,025
There he is.

280
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:32,276
Do you mind if I do the talking?

281
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,617
He was a little upset last night.

282
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:34,922
I'd like to be the one
to break it to him.

283
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,508
Okay, but he's got a very short leash.

284
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:39,836
- Hey.
- Hey.

285
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:41,132
Got a call from the watch commander,

286
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,077
something about an incident last night.
What's going on?

287
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,896
The administration has it out for me.

288
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,287
- That's what's going on.
- All right.

289
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:48,993
Well, he said it had
something to do with Megan.

290
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:51,309
Anyway, Sarge sent us to come get you.

291
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,017
Yeah, yeah. No, I got his messages.

292
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,475
I'll get there when I get there.

293
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:58,902
Yeah, but, Hawke, he
told us to come get you.

294
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:02,139
What, I'm not under arrest, right?

295
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,023
No, it's... it's just
administrative at this point.

296
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:05,958
Enough. You have a direct order.

297
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:08,272
See the captain immediately.
That means now.

298
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:13,224
Wha... Are we... Are we
doing this, Bishop?

299
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:16,476
Ask me, tell me, make me?

300
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:17,793
You're gonna go there.

301
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,821
No, no one's going anywhere, all right?

302
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:21,922
We're just following
orders here, Jeremy.

303
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,438
And you always taught me
confront my problems head-on,

304
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:26,463
so let's just go get this taken care of.

305
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:30,821
You're right. I'm just like...
Thank you.

306
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:32,682
All right, I'm sorr... I'm...
You're right. That's all right.

307
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:33,935
Here, I'll j... Actually,
hold on a second.

308
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,488
I just got to grab my wallet.

309
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,670
Hey.

310
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,262
Hawke, what are you doing?

311
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,451
Hawke!

312
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,460
Hawke, what are you doing?! Don't do it!

313
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:51,968
Hawke! Hawke!

314
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:03,856
He knew just how to disable us.

315
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,153
Yes, sir. I understand.
IA's been notified.

316
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,410
I will let you know as
soon as he comes in.

317
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:13,884
Yes, I understand. Okay.

318
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,638
Chief is concerned. He wants
us to take care of this

319
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:18,529
quickly and quietly.

320
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,111
You still think it was a bad idea for me

321
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:22,769
to block Hawke from
getting assigned here?

322
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:24,821
He's a veteran cop who
gets the job done.

323
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,879
Hell, he's earned 46
Letters of Commendation.

324
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:28,170
And 21 civilian complaints.

325
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:30,082
When you do proactive police work,

326
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:32,180
- you're gonna get complaints.
- 21 of them?

327
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,960
Wade, look, I-I know we haven't
worked together that long,

328
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:38,818
but I know for a fact you would
never let one of your cops

329
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,023
become this reckless. Am I right?

330
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,062
No, I wouldn't.

331
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:44,584
Look, Hawke is not coming in.

332
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,428
He ran from Bishop and Nolan.
They lost him.

333
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:49,418
Try to show the guy a little dignity

334
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,504
for the good work he's done,

335
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,892
this is how he thanks us.

336
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,283
- Yes.
- Hey, we just left the hospital.

337
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,835
The man Hawke hit, Mike Gabriel,

338
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,176
has a busted nose, lost a tooth.

339
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,522
Judge signed the arrest warrant.

340
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:00,168
It's in the system now, no bail.

341
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:02,003
You put out a BOLO on
Hawke and his truck.

342
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:04,095
Notify the CHP, ping his cell,

343
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:05,330
monitor his bank cards.

344
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,249
You let patrol know that
they need to be careful.

345
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:08,814
He has clearly gone over the edge.

346
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:10,329
We'll need to interview the wife.

347
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:11,978
Yeah, and Hawk's buddy, Nolan.

348
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:13,642
Do it.

349
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,779
Dispatch pinged his phone.

350
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:20,859
Shows his location as 10
yards in front of us.

351
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:24,646
7-Adam-19, show us Code 6
at Riverside and Woodman.

352
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:27,255
No sign of suspect Hawke's vehicle.

353
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:31,126
Check Utah plate 6-Mary-Ocean-1-7-Adam.

354
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,061
I can't believe we're
hunting Jeremy Hawke.

355
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,297
Man bleeds LAPD.

356
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,136
I was first on scene when the
guy was taking .223 rounds

357
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,934
using the curb for cover.

358
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,476
Hawke?

359
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:50,716
It's Tim.

360
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:52,697
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

361
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,399
Come out. Let's talk.

362
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,168
Hey. Sorry.

363
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,103
No Hawke here.

364
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,938
We met back at the motel, though.

365
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,695
Did he do something wrong?

366
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,450
Was he ever inside your vehicle?

367
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:05,427
Nope.

368
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:31,415
He really is running.

369
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,702
He knew we'd track his cell,

370
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:35,527
so he planted it on someone
going anywhere he's not.

371
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,401
He's thinking like a criminal.

372
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,860
Worse...

373
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,750
like a criminal cop.

374
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,956
He knows how we do things
and what we expect,

375
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:44,525
so he's always a step ahead.

376
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:51,365
I can't believe Hawke is a fugitive.

377
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,699
You ever arrest a cop before?

378
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:55,636
Yeah, first year as a P2.
Officer Numsky.

379
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,444
Lifted a brick of coke
from a crime scene.

380
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,271
Sobbed like a baby when
I put the cuffs on him.

381
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:00,672
Did you feel bad, you know,

382
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,356
- hooking a fellow officer up?
- No.

383
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,153
Having a badge means you're
held to a higher standard,

384
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,395
not a lower one.

385
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:07,105
You had Hawke at the Academy, right?

386
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,383
Yeah, and between you and me,

387
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,760
he was a lousy instructor.

388
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,196
All he did was talk about his glory days

389
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,443
and give us questionable advice

390
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:14,968
that pretty much boiled
down to "be a badass."

391
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:16,812
Let's end this situation.

392
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,925
- Here they come now.
- Mr. Campbell?

393
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,962
I'm Officer Lopez. This is Officer West.

394
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,017
We understand that you were
a victim of a shooting.

395
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,238
You want to tell us what happened?

396
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:26,368
Yeah, the neighborhood's full of gangs,

397
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:29,011
and you people, you ain't
gonna do nothing about it.

398
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:30,422
That's what happened.

399
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,476
Sir, if we could just
hear from your son.

400
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,705
Nurse said detectives
handle stuff like this.

401
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,370
We come out first to assess.

402
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:38,181
Okay.

403
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:41,642
It was a drive-by.

404
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,376
Car came right at me. I got hit.
They took off.

405
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:46,828
- Just one shot?
- I think so. It...

406
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:49,344
I mean, it all happened so fast.

407
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,446
And where did the shooting take place?

408
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,027
It took place in front of the house.

409
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,313
That's where it took place at.

410
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,205
That's what happens when you
hang around the wrong people.

411
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,596
- I keep tell...
- Are you saying you know who did this?

412
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,542
No, I'm saying he need
to listen to his father.

413
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,942
- That's what I'm saying.
- Sir, I understand your anger,

414
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,047
but we need to finish
questioning your son.

415
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,791
I'd like to be able to do
that with you in the room,

416
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:07,084
but I can have Officer West
take you into the hall.

417
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,966
Will that be necessary?

418
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:13,251
- No.
- Good.

419
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:15,896
Can we see your injury, please?

420
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,691
Just feel like I could've done more.

421
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,136
Like what, fix Hawke's marriage?

422
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,381
No, just made him come with
me, talk some sense into him.

423
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:32,939
It wouldn't have made a difference.
The guy's clearly

424
00:18:32,963 --> 00:18:35,227
been on edge for a while.
Last night, he fell off.

425
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:36,729
You know it would've saved
everyone a lot of grief

426
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,683
if you'd have hooked Hawke
up back at the motel?

427
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,941
That's not helpful, Sanford.

428
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,354
We just have a few questions to ask.

429
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:42,707
You'll be back on the
street before you know it.

430
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:44,498
Sure. Who do you want to talk to first?

431
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:46,284
Who do you think?

432
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:50,604
I hate this guy.

433
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,307
Hey, get it to go.

434
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,010
Have a seat. You need
anything, some coffee?

435
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,471
No, thanks. Am I in trouble here?

436
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:07,702
- No.
- Maybe.

437
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,779
Well, that clears it up.

438
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,382
How well do you know Jeremy Hawke?

439
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:14,863
He was my TAC instructor at the Academy.

440
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:16,286
We became friends.

441
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:17,987
Went out for beers a few times.

442
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,918
I hadn't seen him in about a month.

443
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,624
- Till last night.
- Right.

444
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,186
He tell you he was gonna scare the wife

445
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,481
and assault the boyfriend?

446
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,040
Of course not.

447
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:27,951
No, he was...

448
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:29,900
He was drunk. Um...

449
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,552
I tried to convince him to
come crash on my couch.

450
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:33,142
He insisted on going back to his motel.

451
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,594
I thought he was just
having a bad night.

452
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,722
A bad night? His career
was going nowhere,

453
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,784
his marriage was over, and
he was drinking too much.

454
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:41,271
That doesn't sound like a bad night.

455
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,763
That sounds like a desperate man.

456
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,174
Yes, well, I see that now.

457
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:46,858
I wish I had last night.

458
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,649
Is that why you let him escape?

459
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:50,682
- He was feeling guilty.
- I...

460
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:01,568
Look, um, Bishop and I
went to pick him up.

461
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,045
He ran, end of story.

462
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,764
Do you have any idea
where Hawke might go?

463
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,255
No.

464
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:10,477
Would you tell us if you knew?

465
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:11,946
Yes.

466
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,562
- You okay?
- Yeah, but they better hope

467
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,053
I don't get them for Secret Santa.

468
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,332
Don't sweat it.

469
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:23,171
You did everything right.
I'll tell them that.

470
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,453
Thanks.

471
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:31,036
Megan?

472
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:33,956
Uh, John Nolan. I met you
at Hawke's birthday party.

473
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:35,718
Yes, of course.

474
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:38,034
Hawke, uh, talked about
you a lot, actually.

475
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:39,825
He said you were an inspiration.

476
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,948
Oh,

477
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,049
kind of "worst kid on the team"

478
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,677
"finally gets a chance to
play" kind of inspiration?

479
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,536
No, because you did it.

480
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,284
You changed your life.

481
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:50,518
I mean, Jeremy talked about
leaving the department,

482
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:51,604
but deep down, he knew

483
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,479
that he needed to be a legend.

484
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:54,948
Right.

485
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:57,113
I mean, my uncle offered
him a job last year.

486
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:01,050
Great money selling
security gear, but then...

487
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:02,652
Jeremy wouldn't be "The Hawke" anymore,

488
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:05,447
and, you know, he didn't know
who he was without that.

489
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,824
We're gonna bring him
back safe and sound.

490
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,644
I doubt that.

491
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,139
If I learned anything about
Hawke in 15 years of marriage,

492
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:15,756
it's that he's too stubborn
to ever say he's sorry

493
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:18,739
and too proud to ever give up.

494
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,504
How am I supposed to
tell my son about this?

495
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,915
He idolizes his dad.

496
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:27,238
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

497
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,990
I've sent a unit to pick up your son.

498
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:31,549
If you need anything, just ask.

499
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:33,446
Just a moment.

500
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:37,589
Did you speak to Paige and Motta?

501
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:39,824
Yeah, Bishop's in there
with them right now.

502
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,682
When she's done, you get back out there.

503
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,263
Find this guy. Yes, ma'am.

504
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:51,956
Don't let the detectives
get under your skin.

505
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,713
Do they really think I let him escape?

506
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:55,286
Not after I was done with them.

507
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,131
<i> 7-Adam-15, respond to an ATM hit</i>

508
00:21:58,156 --> 00:21:59,846
<i>for suspect Hawke near your location...</i>

509
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,665
<i>9455 Lankershim.</i>

510
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:03,767
He picked that ATM for a reason.

511
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:05,301
There's three freeways near here.

512
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:07,286
He could be on any one
of them and in the wind

513
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:09,239
in less than a minute, so...

514
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,074
which one do we pick? None of them.

515
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:12,870
He's trying to trick us.

516
00:22:14,145 --> 00:22:15,678
Make a right here.

517
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,080
He won't take the freeway.
He knows police tactics.

518
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:22,403
He knows we'll set up on
it so we can catch him.

519
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,124
He'll use surface streets.

520
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:27,757
There he is.

521
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,436
I'm gonna start calling you Yoda.

522
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,290
No, you're not. Light him up.

523
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,514
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

524
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,831

00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,642
<i>heading east on L.</i>

526
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:42,030
Hang on.

527
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:51,210
- Is that a grenade?
- Smoke grenade.

528
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:03,192
Where is he?

529
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:08,594
Where did he go?

530
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:10,641
Did we lose him?

531
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,694
There, right there.

532
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,322
7-Adam-15, we've got him

533
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:15,788
eastbound Morrison
approaching Riverdale.

534
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,215
<i>He's not yielding.</i>

535
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:23,477
<i>He's speeding. Speed's climbing.</i>

536
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:25,423
<i>Northbound now. He's burning lights.</i>

537
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,869
Two near misses. We have to end this.

538
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,215
Hawke is gonna get somebody killed.

539
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:39,990
He could roll if they
PIT him at this speed.

540
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,703
Yeah, we have to risk it.

541
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,994
You tell them to find the
right spot and do it.

542
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,509
Andersen.

543
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,821
PIT Hawke's car.
I'm giving you permission.

544
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:54,142
It's top-heavy. It could flip.

545
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:55,392
Hit it hard and get out of the way.

546
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:56,906
Got it.

547
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,070
Oh, no.

548
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,875
7-Adam-15, negative on any PIT.

549
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,435
Hawke's son is on board.

550
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,458
How did this happen?

551
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,570
How does he take my son?

552
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,799
He went straight to the school
after he fled the motel.

553
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:31,601
Listen to me. I am telling you,

554
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,684
I'm gonna get your son back. I promise.

555
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:38,480
Hawke was terrified that I
would get full custody.

556
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,554
As messed up as you think my husband is,

557
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,292
he loves our son.

558
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,933
He will not give him up willingly.

559
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,653
- I think they're both lying.
- Tell me why.

560
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:11,119
Okay, he said the head
wound was back to front,

561
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:12,310
but the car drove at him,

562
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,005
so the wound should be front to back.

563
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,531
Good. What else?

564
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:17,304
See the stippling around the wound?

565
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:19,995
That suggests that the
gunshot was at close range,

566
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,657
not shot from car.

567
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:23,615
You minor in forensics in college?

568
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:27,019
Nope, just looked at a bunch of
crime-scene pics with my dad.

569
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:29,822
So, what are we gonna now?

570
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,190
We're supposed to call detectives

571
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:32,848
and stand by to stand by.

572
00:25:33,142 --> 00:25:34,893
But we're not gonna do that?

573
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,129
I don't like being lied to.

574
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,182
- I hear that.
- Let's jack 'em up.

575
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,816
7-Adam-19, we are on intercept
course with Hawke's truck,

576
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,105
three blocks out and closing.

577
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:49,404
Is this safe with
Hawke's kid in the car?

578
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:51,366
Hawke thinks we've fallen
back into tracking mode.

579
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:52,922
He doesn't know we blocked the streets,

580
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,642
turned the lights green
to funnel him towards us.

581
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,282
He won't see the roadblock coming.

582
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:57,750
To him, it looks like we've fallen back.

583
00:25:57,775 --> 00:25:59,575
Yeah, but won't all the green
lights look suspicious?

584
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,850
He won't notice.

585
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:03,096
"What appears to be nothing," remember?

586
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:06,211
You're DEAR method incarnate.

587
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,327
You've got a tactic for
any situation, don't you?

588
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:09,762
Maybe.

589
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:12,356
What if you get robbed at gunpoint?

590
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,237
Easy, deception.

591
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,872
I carry an empty wallet.

592
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:17,525
If I ever got robbed, I'd drop my fake,

593
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,183
pull my piece, and good night, nurse.

594
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,934
So, where do you keep
your cards and money?

595
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:24,532
Money clip behind my belt.

596
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:28,477
Okay, you're officially weird.

597
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:30,045
Get ready. It's going down.

598
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:31,746
7-Adam-19, about to intercept.

599
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:34,877
- <i>Make sure you block him in.</i>
- 7-Adam-15, copy.

600
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:39,588
He just did a hard left turn.

601
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,405
It's like he knows what we're gonna do.

602
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,974
The SOB must still have his radio.

603
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:51,616
Hawke, I know you can hear me.

604
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:53,518
You need to pull over right now.

605
00:26:58,525 --> 00:26:59,857
Hawke?

606
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:03,674
I'm not good at calling it quits, Nolan.
You know that.

607
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:05,596
A lot of boys at Pelican
Bay can attest to that.

608
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:07,333
So, what, you gonna join them?

609
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:09,316
That is never gonna happen.

610
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:12,187
What's your end game here, Hawke?

611
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,539
You just gonna escape the pursuit

612
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:14,807
and live happily ever after?

613
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:16,703
Didn't you learn anything
in class, Nolan?

614
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:19,106
This is a tactical situation,
not a strategic one.

615
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,308
Long term isn't about the conversation.

616
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:22,738
The initial obstacle is the pursuit.

617
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:24,730
Once I lose that, just
focus on the next step.

618
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:25,935
What about Logan?

619
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,560
Are you prepared for
something to happen to him?

620
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:30,587
- Leave my son out of this.
- Don't use me against my dad!

621
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:33,113
He said you'd try that and that
you'd lie about everything.

622
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,542
<i>But it won't work. We're
in this together.</i>

623
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:38,292
Whatever happens to him, happens to me.

624
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:40,631
I'm not lying, Logan. Your father is.

625
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:42,195
He's lost control.

626
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,799
You're done.

627
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:47,493
Logan?

628
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,217
- Hawke?
- He's done talking.

629
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:55,564
What's the latest?

630
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:56,757
Hawke avoided the spike strips.

631
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:58,025
He's committed to running.

632
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,247
And his kid's a willing participant.

633
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,767
What do you want us to do?

634
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:03,097
Brass wants us to proceed with caution

635
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:04,288
now that it's all over the news.

636
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,301
The more time we give Hawke,
the more chance he'll have

637
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:08,006
to figure out a way to escape.

638
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:11,204
Can't risk that, not with
his kid in jeopardy.

639
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:13,892
First chance we get to end this,

640
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,048
take it.

641
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:25,594
Mr. Campbell, do you have a minute?

642
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,471
Shouldn't you be out
there chasing that guy?

643
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,508
I thought you wanted us here
investigating who shot your son.

644
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:34,161
You said that was the detectives' job.

645
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,811
They're a little busy, so
they asked us to stay here

646
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:40,212
and dig a little deeper.
That's not a problem, is it?

647
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,217
- No.
- Good.

648
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,671
Earlier, you acted like you
knew who shot your son...

649
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,826
said he was hanging out
with the wrong people.

650
00:28:48,035 --> 00:28:49,468
Who were you talking about?

651
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,241
No one. It was just
in general, you know.

652
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,866
No, I don't know.

653
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:56,362
He's been acting differently
for the last year or so...

654
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,536
talking back, not listening. He's...

655
00:28:58,561 --> 00:28:59,736
He's a teenager.

656
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:01,361
Are you saying he's to
blame for getting shot?

657
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,242
That's not what I said. Don't
put words in my mouth.

658
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:07,389
I don't have a clue who shot him, okay?

659
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:09,467
End of story.

660
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,018
Is it just you and your dad?

661
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:17,048
Yeah. My mom took off when I was little.

662
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,257
That's tough.

663
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:21,593
Especially with a dad like yours.

664
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:23,361
What's that supposed to mean?

665
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:24,930
Let's just say that I, uh...

666
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:29,102
I know a thing or two about
parental expectations.

667
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,587
Yeah, my father was always
pushing me to be better,

668
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:33,844
to work harder,

669
00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:36,160
take everything he said as gospel.

670
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,691
It can be a lot,

671
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,668
especially if you disappoint him.

672
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,450
It was a drive-by.

673
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,419
No it wasn't.

674
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,894
The gun was close when it went off.

675
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,774
Your ear on that side is
probably still ringing.

676
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,542
Look, let me help you.

677
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:58,230
Please.

678
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:01,365
It was a drive-by.

679
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:13,151
Why's he going this way?

680
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:16,872
What's his plan?

681
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,174
We were just trying to figure that out.

682
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:19,405
How would you get away?

683
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,206
Job number one would be
to lose air support.

684
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:23,042
No way to escape the eye in the sky.

685
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,223
What about you?

686
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:25,497
Go somewhere packed with people.

687
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:26,842
Overwhelm our resources. Switch cars.

688
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,414
Does every cop have an escape plan?

689
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:30,002
Most.

690
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,717
Hawke and I worked a car one summer.

691
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:33,737
We were a two-man wrecking crew.

692
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:35,301
Took down some heavy hitters.

693
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:37,031
<i>We talked about how
we'd run from the cops</i>

694
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,522
because it made us better hunters.

695
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,408
Covered parking, tons of people.

696
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:49,334
- He's going to the mall.
- We need to get him now.

697
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:55,904
Suspect headed for
the Fair Street Mall.

698
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,084
Need additional units. Code 3.

699
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,287
Hawke!

700
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,358
Don't do it.

701
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,259
Move. Out of the way, move!

702
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:21,627
- Back!
- Move!

703
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,129
- Out of the way.
- Back! Get back!

704
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:25,452
Don't do this!

705
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:28,887
Hawke!

706
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:31,143
I'll go get a key from
the security guard.

707
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,642
Don't do this, Hawke.

708
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:36,907
This has escalated way
out of your control.

709
00:31:36,932 --> 00:31:38,355
- You know that.
- Yeah, well, that's what happens

710
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:39,988
- when they push a man too far.
- "They"?

711
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:41,601
- Yeah, they.
- They? Who's they?

712
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,249
They didn't do anything. You...

713
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:45,257
You got drunk and you
went to your wife's house

714
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:47,384
and assaulted her boyfriend,

715
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:48,712
and then you ran away.

716
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,652
- There's nothing honorable in that.
- You go. You go.

717
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,131
- Your dad's right behind you, buddy.
- No, no, no. Let him stay.

718
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:53,737
Logan, you stay. He
has the right to know

719
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,056
what you're running away from,

720
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:56,773
what he's risking his life to protect.

721
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:58,898
God, your son idolizes you.

722
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:01,794
You are letting him down.

723
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:04,277
You told me you teach by example.

724
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,797
Tell me what you're
teaching him right now.

725
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:07,018
- Teaching him?
- Yes.

726
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,903
My wife wants sole custody of my son.

727
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,291
I went there. I'm the one
who tried to reason,

728
00:32:11,414 --> 00:32:13,081
and she's in there with a naked man

729
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:15,183
in my slippers, in my bed? Huh?

730
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:16,963
What the hell am I
supposed to do with that?

731
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:18,193
- Deal with it.
- Deal with it?

732
00:32:18,255 --> 00:32:20,155
- Like a grown-up.
- Dad, we got to go.

733
00:32:20,257 --> 00:32:21,692
Son.

734
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:23,359
Listen, Hawke.

735
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,200
Please.

736
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:28,397
You will never forgive yourself
if anything happens to him.

737
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:31,012
It's time to be a father
and do the right thing.

738
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:36,604
I'm a...

739
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:45,086
You know what? It's right. He's right.

740
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,386
He's right, son.

741
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:50,988
This is where the end of
the road is, right here.

742
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:52,961
- We're done.
- No, Dad, I don't care what you did.

743
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,121
I'm going with you.

744
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:55,679
You said we were in this together.

745
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:01,284
You know what?

746
00:33:04,604 --> 00:33:06,156
But you...

747
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:07,824
You're just gonna slow me down.

748
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:10,194
- Dad!
- I'm sorry.

749
00:33:10,414 --> 00:33:11,647
I love you.

750
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:13,773
Dad, are you kidding me?

751
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,874
Dad, stop!

752
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,019
Dad!

753
00:33:17,044 --> 00:33:18,231
Dad!

754
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:19,347
Dad!

755
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:21,880
Form a perimeter!

756
00:33:23,884 --> 00:33:25,717
He must've blocked it with something.

757
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:27,619
- Where does this door lead?
- Interior hallway.

758
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,055
From there you can go
anywhere in the mall,

759
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,478
places the public can't access.

760
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:32,244
You made him leave me behind.

761
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,081
He was safer with me.

762
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,567
Logan's safe.

763
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:48,198
We got him away from Hawke.

764
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:49,704
Thank God.

765
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:53,595
Officers are bringing him back now.

766
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:55,564
He's not hurt...

767
00:33:56,074 --> 00:33:57,440
...but he's angry.

768
00:33:57,542 --> 00:34:00,106
Your husband lied about
what was happening.

769
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,177
So Hawke blames me.

770
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:05,047
I think he blames everybody

771
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,149
except himself.

772
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:10,919
Hey.

773
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:16,629
You've done nothing wrong.

774
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,925
You have a right to be happy,

775
00:34:19,235 --> 00:34:20,941
to be in a healthy relationship,

776
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,110
to not live in fear of saying something

777
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,313
or doing something that
could set him off.

778
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,970
Sounds like hard-won knowledge.

779
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,656
My ex wasn't exactly Hawke,

780
00:34:36,431 --> 00:34:38,364
but he wasn't healthy, either.

781
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:43,397
Where's my husband now?

782
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:45,570
He's still on the loose.

783
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:49,436
But we're gonna get him.

784
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:50,937
Make sure it's secure.

785
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,576
Time element since we had a visual?

786
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,180
- Four minutes.
- Perimeter?

787
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,873
Thin, but we have units
moving in at every exit.

788
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,382
We'll have full containment
in a few minutes.

789
00:34:57,406 --> 00:34:59,332
If I were him, I'd head
back to the parking garage

790
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:01,221
and just steal a car, get lost
in the stream heading out.

791
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:02,660
I'd change clothes, pull the fire alarm,

792
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:03,942
blend in with the fleeing crowd.

793
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:05,324
Sewer system. That's the way to go.

794
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,654
Dogs can't track him, good current,

795
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,801
be in Chinatown in 15 minutes.

796
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:09,092
<i>All units, be advised,</i>

797
00:35:09,117 --> 00:35:11,117
<i>man with a gun at Lowington Financial.
Code 3.</i>

798
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,937
That's six blocks from here.

799
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,805
- Description of the gunman?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

800
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,242
<i>911 call cut off before we
could get more information.</i>

801
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,017
That's how I'd do it.
Call in a false report.

802
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,127
Pulls manpower away,
divides our resources,

803
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:24,400
it frees up an exit.

804
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:26,235
That call's not real. That's Hawke.

805
00:35:26,496 --> 00:35:28,524
And if it's not? If the call's real

806
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:30,044
and we don't divert
units over immediately,

807
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,212
what happens then?

808
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:40,574
What did you do?

809
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,099
Man, get the hell out of here.

810
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:43,775
No, I have every right to be here.

811
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,537
- You can't stop me from seeing him.
- You're the reason he's like this.

812
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,744
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, man, get out of here.

813
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,062
Enough!

814
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:50,782
Hey! Stop! Police!

815
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,803
No, Everett, don't!

816
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,191
Who the hell is he?!

817
00:35:58,244 --> 00:35:59,739
He's my boyfriend!

818
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:06,585
Breathe.

819
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:21,107
<i>7-Adam-14, 7-Adam-25,</i>

820
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:23,666
<i>respond to active shooter
at Lowington Financial.</i>

821
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:38,211
It's over, Hawke.

822
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:41,197
Unh-unh.

823
00:36:41,987 --> 00:36:43,448
You know the drill.

824
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:46,486
Slide the gun over here.
Get on the ground.

825
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:49,389
That's not gonna happen.

826
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:51,337
You already made a mistake.

827
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,080
There's no clear line of fire in here.

828
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,094
You want to shoot me?
You could shoot him,

829
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,833
but I'll tell you something.

830
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:03,202
That...

831
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,039
Ah, ah, ah.

832
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:08,134
That doesn't concern me.

833
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:09,557
Easy, Boot.

834
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,143
He's not gonna shoot you.

835
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,092
He's trying suicide by cop.

836
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:17,643
How many times did we run
this scenario in the Academy?

837
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:19,891
What do you always say about
guys who go down like this?

838
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:22,629
That they're cowards.

839
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:24,050
That's how cops are
gonna talk about you.

840
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,681
You want me to go down
without a fight? Huh?

841
00:37:26,768 --> 00:37:28,264
Nobody's saying that.

842
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,014
I was.

843
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:35,319
Oh!

844
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:40,166
Oh, this... this is... this
is gonna be good. Huh?

845
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:42,493
Oh, this is gonna be good, gentlemen.

846
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:44,104
Not really a fair fight,
but it's gonna be good

847
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,612
because I trained both of
you, one in the field,

848
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:47,289
one in the classroom,

849
00:37:47,718 --> 00:37:51,221
and I know your strengths,
and I know your weaknesses.

850
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,185
Yeah. Where's your bladed stance, huh?

851
00:37:58,225 --> 00:37:59,824
- Always come in with your head.
- Hey!

852
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:01,015
Aah!

853
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:07,884
You were supposed to arrest
him, not get in a brawl.

854
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,758
We had him.

855
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:12,790
Mm-hmm.

856
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,069
How's Everett?

857
00:38:29,645 --> 00:38:31,151
He's heading to jail.

858
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,457
You know, it's interesting
you asked about him first,

859
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,223
not your dad.

860
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:39,510
How is he?

861
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:41,101
Out of surgery.

862
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,981
He'll pull through.

863
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,730
You know, we, um... we
had his hands tested

864
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:48,217
for gunshot residue while he was under.

865
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:50,360
Found trace amounts.

866
00:38:53,138 --> 00:38:54,938
We found a lot more on you.

867
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,375
See, at first, I, uh, thought

868
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,065
you might've tried to attempt suicide.

869
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,892
Your dad was on you so
much about being gay

870
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,619
that you couldn't take it anymore.

871
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,905
He tried to stop you, and
you ended up in here.

872
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:10,538
That's not what happened, is it?

873
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,633
It was a drive-by.

874
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:14,116
I have a new theory.

875
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:16,893
See, I think that you snapped.

876
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:19,686
With all his bullying and derision,

877
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:21,622
I think that you tried to kill him.

878
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,185
You struggled for the
gun, and it went off,

879
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:25,732
and you got hit.

880
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,488
You can't prove any of that.

881
00:39:27,903 --> 00:39:29,807
That's not my job.

882
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:32,099
Detectives will be here shortly.

883
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,488
You know what? Maybe you'll walk away,

884
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,157
maybe you won't.

885
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:37,725
Either way, you need to understand

886
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,693
that his actions don't excuse yours.

887
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:44,175
You could've asked for help

888
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:46,087
or left home.

889
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:51,116
You know, instead, you might've
just destroyed three lives.

890
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:54,820
See, that's what happens when you choose

891
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:56,885
a permanent solution for
a temporary problem.

892
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:03,317
Look...

893
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,252
we can't choose our fathers...

894
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,947
...but we can choose how
we let them shape us.

895
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:26,647
Maybe buy two next time.

896
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:28,822
Oh, one second.

897
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:30,632
Hey, uh, are you headed home?

898
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:32,589
Uh, yeah, were you coming to see me?

899
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,597
No, I'm... Well, yeah. Um...

900
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:38,590
I-I-I just wanted to check
and make sure you were okay

901
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:40,281
after everything that happened.

902
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:44,731
You're thinking I may be
feeling a little responsible

903
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:46,240
for rejecting Hawke's application

904
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:48,765
- to get back out on the street.
- Yeah.

905
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:50,798
I don't.

906
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,107
Look, what Hawke needed wasn't here.

907
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,570
It's easy to let this job define you.

908
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:57,825
It's a lot more difficult to
make it only part of your life.

909
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:01,716
I'll remember that.

910
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:04,124
You have a good night.

911
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:05,828
Nolan.

912
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,283
Hawke admired you for
reinventing yourself.

913
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,512
Thing he didn't understand is

914
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,621
how much work you had to put into it.

915
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,948
The fact that you did it at the
lowest point in your life...

916
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,902
...it's something to be proud of.

917
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,182
Thank you.

918
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:25,384
Does that mean I'm off probation?

919
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:26,878
Get out of here.

920
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:30,366
Good night.

921
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:41,946
It's for you.

922
00:41:42,006 --> 00:41:43,607
Thanks, Charlie.

923
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,751
<i>Yeah, Bradford.</i>

924
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:48,343
Never tell a crook where
you hide your money.

925
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,512
- <i>Lucy?</i>
- You told me to think like a criminal,

926
00:41:51,537 --> 00:41:53,454
<i>so after you got your ass kicked,</i>

927
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,571
<i>I grabbed your money clip.</i>

928
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:58,765
I wonder how you're gonna
pay for your bill.

929
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:01,383
You are in so much trouble.

930
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:04,372
Uh-huh. You know what? Maybe
you could wash the dishes.

931
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:07,302
But you might want to glove up.

932
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:10,459
Good night.

933
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:19,300
Charlie. How's my credit here?
