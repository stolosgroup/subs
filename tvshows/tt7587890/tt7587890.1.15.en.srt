1
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:12,587
Good morning, Officer Nolan.

2
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:13,970
Ready for another exciting day

3
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:15,256
out on the streets of Los Angeles?

4
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,258
Yep. Coffee?

5
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:19,126
No, thanks, I get all the rush I need

6
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:20,658
from making this beautiful city of ours

7
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:21,914
safer every single day.

8
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:25,335
And you will too
if you join the L.A.D.P....

9
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:27,482
- I mean P.D.
- Cut! Go again.

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,853
And you will too...

11
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:31,772
Um, I'm sorry. What do I say again?

12
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:33,302
- Cut!
- L.A.P.D.

13
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:34,419
Action.

14
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:36,689
I do too. And so will you if...

15
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:39,546
as well if you join... the L.A...

16
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,747
Cut!

17
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:41,845
I need to spit out my gum.

18
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:42,937
Action.

19
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:45,408
And that's why we joined the L.A.P.D.

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,278
L.A.'s finest.

21
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:51,481
O-Okay, guys,

22
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,536
I know there were
a few stumbles in there, yes,

23
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,229
in the beginning,
but this is Hollywood, right?

24
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,810
They fix that stuff in the editing.

25
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:00,130
I think this video's gonna make
the department very proud.

26
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,890
Officer Bradford,
would you like the honor?

27
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:05,171
Actually, sir, I think
that should go to Lopez...

28
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,841
- the whole thing was her idea.
- Lopez?

29
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,676
There is no promotional video.

30
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:11,644
You got punked.

31
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,754
<i>This sucks. I... This is awful.</i>

32
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,708
<i>No, you're doing good.</i>

33
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,077
<i>Can I get more powder?</i>

34
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:27,756
<i>I'm sweating blocks.</i>

35
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,194
<i>Can I get a copy of this for my kid?</i>

36
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:38,804
We're all gonna die.

37
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,192
Right here.

38
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,473
Right now.

39
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:48,973
This bomb is packed with C4,

40
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,426
ball bearings, screws, broken glass.

41
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:51,763
When this thing goes off,

42
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:54,171
this whole room is gonna
turn into a blender.

43
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:55,411
And guess what.

44
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,005
If you don't die instantly,

45
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,176
you're gonna suffer fatal,
secondary infections

46
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:03,434
because I soaked the shrapnel
in my own filth.

47
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:07,365
Now, you've all been taught
to shoot on sight

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,216
when you see a bomber, right?

49
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:10,613
But you can't shoot me,

50
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,350
because I'm holding
a dead man's switch.

51
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,262
I let it go, it detonates.

52
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:18,286
So your only shot at survival

53
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:20,747
is to talk me into giving up.

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,548
But... you only have

55
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,661
ten words to do it.

56
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:28,887
Go.

57
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,961
U-Um, ma'am,

58
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:32,364
you... you don't want to do this.

59
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,403
Boom. It's a slaughterhouse in here.

60
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:35,613
Go.

61
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,684
Uh, my name is Lucy Chen, and...

62
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,022
Boom. They're IDing
you through dental records.

63
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,653
Boom. You just
got buried in a shoe box.

64
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:47,622
I can only imagine the pain
you're feeling right now.

65
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:52,129
You just got ten more words.

66
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,544
Okay, so what did you all do wrong?

67
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,753
Officer West started mansplaining.

68
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,124
Officer Chen wasted time
by introducing herself.

69
00:03:03,237 --> 00:03:07,038
And Officer Bradford decided
to skip words altogether.

70
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:08,973
They're overrated.
If I'd been a hair quicker,

71
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,143
you'd be singing my praises.

72
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,716
But you weren't.

73
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:14,164
So that means you fall
into the fail category

74
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,501
with everybody else... except...

75
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,153
Officer Nolan.

76
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:22,062
What did he do right?

77
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:24,972
- He expressed empathy.
- You mean he faked it.

78
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:27,020
It doesn't matter if it was real.

79
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:30,028
The only thing that matters
is how it comes across.

80
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:32,029
Active listening plus empathy

81
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,473
leads to a rapport,

82
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,630
which leads to influence

83
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,497
and ultimately behavioral change.

84
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,614
- Wow, you read my book.
- Twice.

85
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,536
Oh. Okay, well, I read your file.

86
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,573
Actually, I read all
of your files, but, um,

87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,808
nothing in your past indicates

88
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:49,481
an ability to communicate
with people like that.

89
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,731
So why do you think
that you're so good at it?

90
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:54,676
Because of the training I received

91
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:57,300
from Officer Bishop and Sergeant Grey.

92
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:01,247
Boom.

93
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:02,817
You just betrayed our trust

94
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:04,152
by giving me a political answer.

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,559
Our rapport is ruined,

96
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,697
and this room is now a horror movie.

97
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:11,731
Oh, my goodness. I am so embarrassed.

98
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:14,434
Oh, no, don't be.

99
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,973
You know, if they knew how to do it,

100
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,950
then you wouldn't have called me
to come in and train them.

101
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:19,302
I still can't believe that you're a

102
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,830
private consultant now.

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,270
I mean, you were such
a rock star in the Bureau.

104
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:24,841
Oh. How's Luna?

105
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:28,294
Great. And she's pushing me
to make a change, too.

106
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,287
Dominique's heading off
to college, and...

107
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,219
Well, you should.

108
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:34,385
I-I... Look, you know, you... you've...

109
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,387
you've done your 20,
you've got the, uh...

110
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:38,645
the scars to prove it.

111
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:42,601
- Go do something new.
- What?

112
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:45,028
What else is a guy like me gonna do?

113
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:46,830
Come work with me.

114
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,333
- Work<i> for</i> you, you mean.
- Okay, come on.

115
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:51,235
I am not like that. You know that.

116
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,770
Thanks,

117
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:56,540
but I am nowhere near ready
to have this conversation.

118
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,576
Well, when you are,

119
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:01,639
- the offer will still be there.
- All right.

120
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,514
- Okay?
- All right.

121
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,044
- She's pretty impressive, huh?
- I'll say.

122
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:18,628
Uh, why didn't you tell me

123
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,030
she wrote a book about her years

124
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,208
on the FBI's hostage rescue team?

125
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:24,208
I would've been so much better prepared.

126
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,901
How did you <i>not</i> know about it?

127
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:28,114
You know, the Academy Jackson
would've been all over that.

128
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,806
Yeah,<i> Officer</i> Jackson
is clearly slipping.

129
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:32,341
Okay, no, I'm not.

130
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:33,909
Wouldn't matter if you read it or not.

131
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:35,612
- I'm simply better than you.
- Oh, okay.

132
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,536
Look, well, I think that
she is full of crap.

133
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,750
I spent summer vacations
running hostage scenarios,

134
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:43,419
and I always beat my brother
and saved the hostage.

135
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:44,920
Dad said it was a gift.

136
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:47,716
Dad should'a sent you to camp.

137
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:49,757
- What's going on?
- Prison transport crashed,

138
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,234
loaded with convicts
from the courthouse.

139
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,163
Come on. Get that gear, Boot.

140
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,036
- Let's go!
- Yeah...

141
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,501
- Let's go!
- Yeah.

142
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,515
- Hey, what happened here?

143
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,005
A coyote ran in front of the bus.

144
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,989
Graham swerved. We went over.

145
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:24,527
- How many people on board?
- 20 prisoners, two other guards.

146
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,898
- Did any prisoners get away?
- I think so.

147
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:30,904
Whoa, whoa, hey. Hey, get down there!
Get me a head count.

148
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,893
<i>Control, this is 7-L-20</i>

149
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,365
- <i>at scene of crash.</i>
- I got this one.

150
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:35,842
<i>I'm declaring a
city-wide tactical alert.</i>

151
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:38,106
<i>I need multiple RAs, scramble airships,</i>

152
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:39,856
<i>and call additional units from Rampart</i>

153
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:41,180
- <i>and North Hollywood.</i>
- He's dead.

154
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:42,950
<i>I need a hard perimeter
set around the crash...</i>

155
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,028
<i>assume a ten minute head start.</i>

156
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,439
I got something over here, 10:00.

157
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,408
Check it out... be careful.

158
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,642
Don't move.

159
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:03,465
An ambulance is on its way.

160
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,923
Can you give me a sit rep?

161
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,905
Seven of them escaped.

162
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,970
They got my keys, my gun.

163
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,236
They went out through the windshield.

164
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,877
All units, be advised,

165
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,195
seven prisoners escaped from the bus.

166
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:17,354
At least one is armed.

167
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,447
Hang tight. We're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

168
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,158
Police. Stop!

169
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:43,171
Hey, take it easy. Easy. Easy.

170
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,814
I got you. Come on.

171
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,283
I got you. I got you. Easy.

172
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:49,815
7-Adam-15,

173
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,447
I need an RA unit immediately...

174
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:52,978
<i>60 yards east of the crash.</i>

175
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,950
50-year-old male,
life-threatening injuries.

176
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:58,173
Okay, just stop moving,
all right? Stop moving.

177
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:00,952
- I gotta get help. I gotta get help.
- Shh, shh. Help is here.

178
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,525
Help is here. I'm right here.
Hey, what's your name?

179
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,580
Uh, Graham.

180
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,095
Graham, I'm John.

181
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:10,127
- Am I gonna die?
- No! No, come on.

182
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:11,627
No, you're not gonna die. You're...

183
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:12,806
You're gonna be fine, okay?

184
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:14,392
You're gonna be okay. You just hang on.

185
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:15,806
All right? Okay?

186
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:17,305
- Hang on.
- Okay. O-Okay.

187
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:19,228
7-Adam-19, almost on site.

188
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,331
<i>Negative, we have
at least seven fugitives</i>

189
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,833
<i>at large in surrounding neighborhoods.</i>

190
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,056
<i>Start a grid search,</i>

191
00:08:24,093 --> 00:08:26,783
<i>coordinate with 7-Adam-13, 18, and 26.</i>

192
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:29,478
There!

193
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,945
7-Adam-19, in pursuit
of fugitive suspect,

194
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:34,149
heading North on Maple.

195
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:39,502
Down!

196
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,619
Get on your stomach!
Get on your stomach!

197
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,360
Let's go.

198
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:49,922
Let's go. Hands behind your back.

199
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,885
Okay, okay.

200
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:58,348
7-Adam-15, where the hell
is my ambulance?

201
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,064
Tell her... Tell her...

202
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:01,955
Tell who? Tell who?

203
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:04,986
- T-Tell her I love her.
- Tell who?

204
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:09,128
Graham, who do you want me to tell?

205
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,361
Beth.

206
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:13,787
Okay.

207
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:53,541
Where's Nolan?

208
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,142
Officer Nolan, report.

209
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,885
- Don't move!
- Nolan?

210
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,735
- You okay?
- Yes.

211
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,204
Get control of him.

212
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,650
All right, listen up.

213
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,902
This is what we know so far.

214
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:34,903
So, we have seven fugitives at large...

215
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:36,355
Six.

216
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,457
Good work. Correction...

217
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,661
we have<i> six</i> fugitives at large.

218
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,473
- Five.
- At this rate,

219
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,996
I'd say we'd be home for dinner,
but I know better.

220
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:51,737
A prisoner on foot can sustain
a pace of four miles per hour.

221
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,741
And the clock started ticking
20 minutes ago.

222
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,293
So we have a hard perimeter
set up a mile out.

223
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,968
If it was set up in time,

224
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,365
it's just a matter
of going door-to-door

225
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,447
and running these fugitives down.

226
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:04,332
If a fugitive gets past our perimeter,

227
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:08,176
this turns from a recovery
operation to a manhunt.

228
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,668
And that puts the entire city at risk.

229
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:13,347
So Bishop, Wong, Mitchell, Pileggi...

230
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,788
your shops will fall back
and man the perimeter.

231
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,795
Bradford, Lopez, Keegan, and Willis,

232
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,816
you'll join the grid search
inside the zone.

233
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,113
Command will advise you
on the identities

234
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,283
of the guys you're chasing
as soon as we get them,

235
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:30,093
but for now, assume that they
are all extremely dangerous.

236
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:31,660
Let's go get 'em.

237
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,730
<i>This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.</i>

238
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:49,059
<i>For your own safety,
we ask you to lock your doors</i>

239
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,742
<i>and stay inside
due to an ongoing emergency.</i>

240
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,387
License and registration, please.

241
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,288
Pop the trunk, please.

242
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:07,691
Officer Nolan.

243
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:16,543
All right, have a nice day.

244
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,129
Hey, you sure you're okay?

245
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,787
Before that deputy died, he asked me

246
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:27,973
to pass along a message.
Shouldn't I be doing that?

247
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,977
You're doing exactly
what you should be doing.

248
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:32,480
Hard as it sounds,
that message can wait.

249
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:34,926
That bus was full of hardcore felons.

250
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,038
Desperate men.
If we don't catch them quickly,

251
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,941
somebody else could die.

252
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:40,746
All right.

253
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:55,026
Sir, there's a shelter
in place order in effect.

254
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:56,987
- We need you in your house.
- Okay.

255
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,674
Oh. Tim.

256
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,119
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Get your hands

257
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:09,284
- where I can see them. Now!
- No, stay right there.

258
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,454
It's okay.
We got permits for the weapons,

259
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,858
and our ammo is stored
separately, so it's legal.

260
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,277
I don't care if it's legal.

261
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:16,578
No good's gonna come from you guys

262
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,221
running around here
with assault rifles.

263
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,996
We heard prisoners were on the loose.

264
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,532
We got a right to protect
our neighborhood.

265
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,036
Yeah, that's a job for law enforcement,

266
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,713
not a ragtag militia.

267
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,783
Got one! Got a fugitive!

268
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,500
Hey, get off me, man.
I didn't do anything.

269
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:30,606
- Officers, please.
- Hey, let him go.

270
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,776
That's not who we're looking for.

271
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,527
- I kept telling him that!
- You sure?

272
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,041
He looks guilty as hell to me.

273
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:36,878
- At least check his papers.
- Let him go.

274
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:39,531
Right now. Are you okay?

275
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,202
No, you should be arresting them.

276
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,877
Hey, screw that.
The law says we're allowed

277
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,634
to defend our neighborhood
"when in grave danger."

278
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:47,018
- I was trimming a hedge!
- All right, look, that's enough.

279
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:48,501
Get back.

280
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,448
Look, as bigoted as they are,

281
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:51,941
they thought they were
making a citizen's arrest,

282
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:53,229
so they haven't broken the law.

283
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,966
But their names will be in our report,

284
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:56,979
so if you'd like to sue them
for emotional damages,

285
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,419
- you can.
- Whoa, hey, now...

286
00:13:58,454 --> 00:13:59,918
How about we just all, uh,

287
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:01,755
go back and secure our home fronts.

288
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:04,057
No hard feelings.

289
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:07,479
Fine.

290
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,273
If I find out that you're
back out here again,

291
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,550
I'll have you arrested for violating

292
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,158
California Penal Codes 372 and 647b.

293
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,335
You got that?

294
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:22,508
647b is the code for prostitution.

295
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,411
They don't know that.

296
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:27,034
<i>All units, possible fugitive sighting.</i>

297
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,905
<i>Parking garage 19558 Sunset Boulevard.</i>

298
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:31,462
Guy in an orange jumpsuit
took a bunch of keys,

299
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,653
ran up the ramp.

300
00:14:39,832 --> 00:14:42,098
7-Adam-07, show us Code 6
on fugitive suspect.

301
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,432
Police! Turn off the engine

302
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,718
and get out of the car now!

303
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,166
Show me your hands.

304
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,330
Open the door from the outside.

305
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:13,963
Get down on your stomach.

306
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:17,768
- What's your name?
- Oscar Hutchinson.

307
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,932
Control, we have fugitive
Hutchinson in custody.

308
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,471
I was only running because I thought

309
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,018
the bus was gonna explode.

310
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,236
Uh-huh,
is that why you stole a car, too?

311
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,838
I always loved driving.

312
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,143
Ah, I've been locked up for decades.

313
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,932
I was kind of hoping to get
a little "me" time in

314
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:35,362
before you guys caught me.

315
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:37,040
I hope it was enough,
'cause your sentence

316
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,181
is only gonna get longer now.

317
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,184
Oh, I'm in forever, son.

318
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,119
Every moment out here is gravy.

319
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:46,950
You're free to go. Thank you.

320
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,000
License and registration, please.

321
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:03,306
Okay there, Mr... Bernstein?

322
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,336
Yeah. Yes.

323
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,278
Where you coming from today?

324
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,774
Pre-school.

325
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,000
We're looking for some men
who escaped from prison.

326
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:16,170
You haven't seen anyone
like that, have you?

327
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:17,576
No, sir.

328
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:19,489
Would you pop the trunk for me?

329
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,844
What?

330
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:30,487
I need you to pop the trunk.

331
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:58,961
Mr. Bernstein,

332
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:00,830
so sorry to take up your time today.

333
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,665
Thank you for your cooperation.

334
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:05,641
Have a nice day.

335
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,414
- You let him go?
- Only way to save that kid.

336
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,328
And what if you're wrong?

337
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,837
We're clear.

338
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,874
I did what you wanted,
now give me my daughter.

339
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:38,428
You can take my car.

340
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,506
Drop your gun!

341
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,803
So, our good news first.

342
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,472
Three more fugitives were apprehended,

343
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,476
leaving just two at large.

344
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:01,288
But those two
are gonna be hell to catch.

345
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:04,557
Which is why command asked
Jessica Russo to assist us.

346
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,560
- Jessica?
- Yeah, so at this point,

347
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,170
we're gonna have to
assume that these guys

348
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,037
have gotten past the perimeter,
which means

349
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:12,053
that we're gonna
have to get inside their heads

350
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:13,691
to figure out where they're gonna go.

351
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:15,249
Predictive analytics.

352
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,499
- You sound skeptical.
- No, ma'am.

353
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:20,003
I just found the best way
to catch a criminal

354
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,007
- is to hit the streets.
- Well, that's because you have

355
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:23,577
no experience doing it any other way.

356
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,418
Marcos Gibson. Only 24 years old,

357
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,756
but he's been a member
of the 54th street gang

358
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,061
for over a decade.

359
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:32,065
He was recently sentenced
to 12 years in Victorville

360
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,241
for aggravated assault
and attempted murder.

361
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:36,710
The five-four will do everything
they can to help him get away.

362
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,345
Including spiriting him
out of the state.

363
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,975
I've got a contact inside the five-four

364
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,412
that might be able to
give us some insight.

365
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:43,617
- Go talk to him.
- Okay, good.

366
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:46,286
Our next fugitive is Caleb Jost.

367
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,223
He is, in my opinion,
the more dangerous of the two.

368
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:52,035
He is 44 years old,
a former investment banker.

369
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,929
Sentenced five years
for securities fraud

370
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,049
and another eight
for biting off the nose

371
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:58,131
of his Deputy AG during his arrest.

372
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,947
He is testament
to the fact that psychopaths

373
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,088
can carry a briefcase
as easily as a grab bag.

374
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,871
The FBI believes Caleb
hid significant resources

375
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:07,312
- before he was arrested.
- Which he's gonna need

376
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:08,906
to avoid going back to prison.

377
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:10,809
So we have to dig into the FBI leads

378
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,545
and figure out the
location of that money

379
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,547
- before he gets there.
- That's exactly right.

380
00:19:14,582 --> 00:19:16,415
Are you up for the challenge,
Officer Nolan?

381
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:17,750
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay, great,

382
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,566
then you and Officer Bishop
can stay with me

383
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:22,237
while everybody else runs
down more obvious leads.

384
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,557
Okay? All right, here we go.

385
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:27,101
Grand theft auto? Really?

386
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:29,395
I barely made it 100 yards.

387
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,844
There isn't a distance requirement.

388
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,732
You stole a car, which means
we gotta process you

389
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,391
before we ship you back to prison.

390
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:35,934
Hey, I'm not complaining.

391
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,275
This place is like the Ritz
compared to Victorville.

392
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,451
Get him squared away while I
contact the Sheriff's Department

393
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:41,840
about procedure.

394
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,441
You know the drill.

395
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,034
Take your shoes off.

396
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:48,513
West?

397
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,035
I knew a West in my youth.

398
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,851
Percy.

399
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,320
Any relation?

400
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:57,589
Yeah. He's my dad.

401
00:19:58,014 --> 00:19:59,440
Oh, yeah?

402
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,674
Yeah, I guess I see the resemblance.

403
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:04,862
You must have got your tall gene
from your moms.

404
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,765
So what, my old man arrested you?

405
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,060
Yeah, well, it was a little bit

406
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:09,249
more complicated than that.

407
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:10,435
How so?

408
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,603
Well, this was the '90s.

409
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:13,271
The streets were different back then.

410
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:15,607
And your dad was going after
some pretty big players.

411
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:17,663
He... He didn't always
sweat the small stuff.

412
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,729
So you're saying he let you go.

413
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:21,239
Uh, yeah, depending on the day.

414
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:23,447
I'd give him a little Intel.
He'd look the other way.

415
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:24,949
But not before messing with me.

416
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:28,286
This one time,
he caught me with some dope.

417
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:31,208
He told me if I could outrun
him, he'd cut me loose.

418
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,404
- My dad's pretty fast.
- Yeah, we tied.

419
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,492
I was, like, 20 pounds
lighter back then.

420
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:36,961
And I was high on crank, you know.

421
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:39,697
I'm sorry, but this does not
sound like my dad.

422
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,999
We were all gangsters back then, son.

423
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,868
Criminals and five-oh alike.

424
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:46,810
What's predictive analytics?

425
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,947
Using data from the past
to predict the future.

426
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,674
Feds love that kind of stuff.

427
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,031
They'd rather sit
in front of a computer

428
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,844
than hit the streets
and scuff their loafers.

429
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,979
Still, if it helps solve
a crime or find a fugitive,

430
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,187
isn't it worth using?

431
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,390
Whose side are you on?

432
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:00,817
I didn't know there were sides.
But yours, definitely yours.

433
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,552
- Deacon, thanks for coming in.
- No problem.

434
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:03,907
I figured I'd be
hearing from you today.

435
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:06,723
- Hi.
- Hi. Deacon Joe.

436
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:09,559
- Lucy Chen.
- Bradford's next victim.

437
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:11,173
I remember when your T.O. was the one

438
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,563
- wearing the long sleeves.
- Oh, you got pictures?

439
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,498
I like her.

440
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:18,017
I'm thrilled.
Deacon was my first arrest.

441
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:19,669
Also one of the few to be rehabilitated

442
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:21,131
in maximum security prison.

443
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,195
Man, I swear to God,
every time I see you,

444
00:21:23,232 --> 00:21:24,674
it's like a time machine.

445
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,775
I mean, since we met,
I did six years in Chino,

446
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,100
got clean, left the life,
started up a family.

447
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,492
Only thing that changed about
you is the lines on your face.

448
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,049
What lines?

449
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:36,841
If you were expecting to hear from
me, then you know why you're here.

450
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,674
Marcos Gibson.
Look, I need to get to him

451
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,144
before he hooks up with the 5-4.

452
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,255
Yeah, Marcos was one
of my kids for a while.

453
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:45,002
I lost him to the 5-4.
But they're the last place

454
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,846
- he's gonna go right now.
- Why?

455
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:48,602
He was knocking boots
with Keon's woman.

456
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,756
- Right before the trial.
- Who's... Who's Keon?

457
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,067
Leader of the 5-4.
This kid must have a death wish.

458
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,537
Yeah, if Keon gets ahold
of Marcos before you guys do,

459
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,131
he'll kill him.

460
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:02,625
Officer Bishop,
any update on Caleb Jost?

461
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,875
Uniforms have visited
his entire extended family.

462
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:06,164
No one's seen or heard from him.

463
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,586
If we believe they
are telling the truth.

464
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:08,936
Exactly.

465
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:10,952
Um...

466
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:12,501
Just give me a sec.

467
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:15,156
Excuse me.

468
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:17,295
Did you know that deputy who died?

469
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,660
Graham? Yeah.

470
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,629
My condolences. Um...

471
00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:25,197
He asked me to pass a
message along to his wife.

472
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:26,754
I just need to know how
to get in touch with her.

473
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,469
Graham wasn't married.

474
00:22:28,642 --> 00:22:29,969
Oh, um...

475
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:32,797
Maybe a girlfriend, then.
Her name is Beth.

476
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:35,073
Graham was single.

477
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:38,000
He never even brought a date
to the Christmas party.

478
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,748
- You sure?
- Yeah.

479
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:42,750
Graham was a bit of a loner.

480
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:45,085
We, uh...

481
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,771
We, uh, used to give him
a hard time about it.

482
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,590
Okay, um...

483
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:52,325
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

484
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,279
- Did you find something?
- Oh, um, no.

485
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:00,834
That was a bit of a side project.

486
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,038
Okay, well, it's not really
an appropriate time for that.

487
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:05,169
Of course, you're right, but, um...

488
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:06,834
But what?

489
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:09,099
I-I was with the deputy when he died.

490
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:11,898
He asked me to give a message
to someone named Beth,

491
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:14,681
and now it turns out he's single.

492
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,067
Uh, well, a mom or a sister maybe?

493
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:22,462
Maybe. It... sounded romantic.

494
00:23:23,892 --> 00:23:25,841
A-Anyway, I should be
getting back to work.

495
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,695
His death must have been
traumatic for you.

496
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:31,208
I'm fine.

497
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:32,724
Boom.

498
00:23:32,857 --> 00:23:35,154
Lying destroys rapport, remember?

499
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,003
Right.

500
00:23:39,638 --> 00:23:41,674
His leg was torn off in the accident.

501
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:43,977
I wasn't expecting to see that.

502
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,803
You know, I will never forget

503
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:51,341
the first catastrophic
injury that I saw.

504
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,021
But at least you have
something positive to focus on.

505
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:59,555
If you need any help finding
her, please let me know.

506
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,560
Thank you.

507
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:02,928
I think I might've found something.

508
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,930
I ran a search of names
from Caleb's life

509
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,598
against recent dispatch calls.

510
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:08,600
Discovered a wellness check
that was called in

511
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:10,911
for the aunt of Caleb's ex-wife.

512
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,571
I guess she's a daily churchgoer,

513
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:13,906
but she didn't show up today.

514
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,741
She could have just gone to the movies

515
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:17,609
or maybe planned to go later.

516
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:20,579
Maybe, or her routine was disturbed

517
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:22,614
by a visit from our fugitive.

518
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:25,615
Good work, Officer Bishop.
Go check that out.

519
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,457
Prison transport will be here soon.

520
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:35,852
- Lucky me.

521
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,354
Hey, listen, you see your old man,

522
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:38,763
tell him I said "hi."

523
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,792
And I haven't forgotten.

524
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:43,534
Forgotten what?

525
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,046
The .45 he planted.

526
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,438
The reason I'm doin' life in prison.

527
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:48,014
You're saying that my dad framed you?

528
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,853
Well, no, we were good while
I was informing on guys.

529
00:24:51,193 --> 00:24:53,451
I think he made some
pretty heavy busts.

530
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:56,080
But when I stopped being useful,

531
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,401
cops found a murder weapon
in my apartment.

532
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:00,751
Let me guess, for a crime
that you didn't commit.

533
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:03,120
No. I killed that dude.

534
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,883
It's just there wasn't any evidence.

535
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,107
Not until your daddy
planted that gun on me.

536
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:10,783
Bet you haven't heard<i> that</i>
story at the dinner table.

537
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,838
Hey, uh, have you seen Lopez?

538
00:25:20,924 --> 00:25:22,498
Oh, uh, yeah, she's in the bullpen

539
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:24,860
talking to Tim, and I'm just
getting us some fuel

540
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:26,661
before we hit the street.

541
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:29,121
- You okay?
- Yeah.

542
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:33,401
No. Um... Look, I-I don't know.

543
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:36,001
This fugitive we grabbed
has been getting under my skin.

544
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:38,640
Basically said that my dad was
a dirty cop back in the day.

545
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:40,342
Your dad? No way.

546
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,936
That guy's just trying
to push your buttons.

547
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,612
- Right?
- Yeah. Commander West is I.A.

548
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:44,950
- This guy is...
- An ex-drug dealer

549
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:46,748
who is doing life for murder.

550
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:50,271
See? Case closed.

551
00:25:50,486 --> 00:25:52,453
Thank you. Uh,
when you put it that way,

552
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:53,800
I don't even know why I was worried.

553
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:55,418
Yeah, I mean, your grandma,
on the other hand,

554
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:57,367
I heard she'd cut a bitch
for a dollar back in the day.

555
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:58,846
Back in the day? Hell, that woman

556
00:25:58,882 --> 00:26:00,525
will cut a bitch<i> now.</i>

557
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:03,456
Hey, you, uh... you think I've
changed since you've met me?

558
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:04,932
You got more annoying.

559
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:06,934
I'm serious. Have I changed at all?

560
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:08,913
- Sure.
- How?

561
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:11,105
What do you mean? You're older.

562
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:13,606
What you went through with
Isabel certainly changed you.

563
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:15,793
Made me different,
or just made me more... me?

564
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,460
What's this about?

565
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,467
Just wondering if I've been
treading water a little...

566
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:22,404
you know, not challenging myself.

567
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:25,121
Since when does Tim Bradford
do introspection?

568
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:27,057
- Never mind.
- Hey.

569
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:28,632
We got a plan of action to find Marcos?

570
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,603
Hit the streets,
sweat some more of his people.

571
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:32,623
I'll see you later.

572
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,804
Hey, Bradford.

573
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:37,463
You've also gotten dumber.
Does that count?

574
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:41,406
What was that about?

575
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,066
Inside joke.

576
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,352
- Hot damn.
- What is it?

577
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,798
Text from Deacon. He's got Marcos.

578
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:53,012
It's number 2354.

579
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,012
What's Caleb's connection
to this place again?

580
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,765
His ex-wife's aunt lives here.

581
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:59,069
Was the ex an ex before
he went away to prison or after?

582
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:00,695
After, I think. What does it matter?

583
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:02,793
Well, if they were still
married when he went to prison,

584
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,290
there's a good chance
he hid some money here.

585
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:07,057
Which would give him
reason to come here

586
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,524
after getting through our perimeter.

587
00:27:08,602 --> 00:27:10,090
This is the house.

588
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,064
Okay, tactical recommendation.

589
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:14,066
Knock or recon?

590
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,068
Recon. This guy bites off noses.

591
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,903
I don't want to get surprised by him.

592
00:27:18,142 --> 00:27:19,417
I'll go low.

593
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:28,142
Bishop, door jamb's busted.

594
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,892
7-Adam-15,

595
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:32,081
requesting backup at 2354 Sawyer.

596
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:35,297
Location of possible fugitive
suspect Caleb Jost.

597
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,048
It's over, Caleb.

598
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,721
You know, I felt a little stupid
taping up Aunt Sallie,

599
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,354
but I'm feeling pretty good
about it now.

600
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:43,136
Hey! Stay back

601
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:45,756
or I am repainting the walls
in here crimson.

602
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,778
Come on, Caleb. You're too smart a guy

603
00:28:48,815 --> 00:28:50,388
to be pulling that trigger.

604
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:52,482
Right now, you're looking
at aggravated assault.

605
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,084
That might add a couple years
to your sentence,

606
00:28:54,163 --> 00:28:56,146
- but if you kill her...
- Stop.

607
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:59,111
Stop trying to reason with me.

608
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,156
I hate prison.

609
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,395
If I got a shot at not going back,

610
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:06,306
I'm gonna take it, so back the hell up

611
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,771
and get me someone who can make a deal,

612
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:10,179
or I am pulling this trigger.

613
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,732
Control,

614
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:24,867
show us on site at 1115 Amador Street.

615
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,964
Damn it.

616
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,971
5-4 must've heard Marcos
is at Deacon's house.

617
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:33,591
What do we do?

618
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:35,786
Keep your cool and
get ready for trouble.

619
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:44,895
Hello, Officer.

620
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:46,430
Lovely evening.

621
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:48,155
Sure is.

622
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,374
What are you guys doing out here?

623
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:51,724
Oh, you know,

624
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,271
just exercising our
constitutional right

625
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,438
to assemble.

626
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:57,285
- God bless America.
- Mm-hmm.

627
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,547
Well, I suggest you all
assemble somewhere else.

628
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:03,002
Is that an order?

629
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:05,511
Consider it a little friendly advice.

630
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,644
Well, we appreciate you
looking out for us, Officer,

631
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:11,583
but we ain't going nowhere.

632
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,726
Then maybe I'll see you later.

633
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:17,319
Count on it.

634
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,344
Control, patch me through to 7-L-20.

635
00:30:38,457 --> 00:30:40,317
7-Adam-19, report.

636
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,484
<i>Yeah, we got a bit of
a situation here, Sergeant.</i>

637
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,547
Approximately 15 gang members

638
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,154
are gearing up
to take out our fugitive,

639
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,656
Marcos Gibson.

640
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,457
Chen and I made it through their lines,

641
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:51,728
<i>but the 5-4's gonna
come after this guy soon.</i>

642
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:53,693
I just sent all available units

643
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,998
to Nolan's hostage situation
over in Culver City.

644
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:58,761
<i>But I will reorient some back to you.</i>

645
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,370
Sir, this is a family neighborhood.

646
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,107
If bullets start flying, a lot
of kids are gonna get hurt.

647
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:06,449
What are you saying, Bradford?

648
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:11,112
Have the units stage away
from our location

649
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:12,782
until overwhelming force arrives.

650
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:15,394
Anything less than that's
gonna come with a body count.

651
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:17,786
We'll do our best
with what we got until then.

652
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:31,302
What are the odds they'll
change their minds and leave?

653
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:40,474
Oh, come on.

654
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:48,484
What are we gonna do?

655
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,325
Let's start with you letting us in.

656
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:54,802
First time I've ever
been happy to see cops.

657
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,000
Hook him up, Boot.

658
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,092
What? Whoa, hang on.

659
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:58,985
No, you... I gotta keep my hands
free in case I gotta fight.

660
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,782
I hate to break it to you,
but if this gets to fighting,

661
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,258
your hands aren't gonna help.
Turn around.

662
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,342
Turn around. Now.

663
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,653
Can we escape out the back?

664
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,018
No, no, they got guys out there, too.

665
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,313
I saw them when Keon rolled up.

666
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,470
Bring him out!

667
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:14,251
We know he in there!

668
00:32:14,493 --> 00:32:15,911
We'll be here all night.

669
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:17,266
Trying to act like
this fool ain't here.

670
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,622
Yo, send that little punk on out!

671
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:19,970
Bring him out already!

672
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,717
So how does someone go from
financial crimes to this?

673
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:24,441
I'm an overachiever.

674
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,788
Where's my negotiator?

675
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,222
On the way.

676
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:29,896
You can talk to me while we wait.

677
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,642
You're a nobody.

678
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,538
I want a<i> somebody</i> with authority.

679
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,801
- How you doing?
- I'm a little stressed.

680
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:42,903
Only a little? Well, then you're fine.

681
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:46,077
- Who are you?
- Smart setup.

682
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:47,908
SWAT can't shoot you
through the windows,

683
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:49,512
and we can't rush you from the doorways

684
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:51,067
without you pulling the trigger.

685
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:53,681
- You my negotiator?
- Nope.

686
00:32:57,203 --> 00:32:58,453
You're not?

687
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,290
No, I'm only here to advise.

688
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:02,222
Besides, guys like that,

689
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:04,358
you have to keep off balance.

690
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:06,077
Well, that wasn't in your book.

691
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:07,906
Well, I can't give away all my secrets.

692
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:10,145
- So what do we do here?
- Okay, good question.

693
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:12,284
So, I re-read Caleb's file
on the way over here.

694
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:13,600
And?

695
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:19,973
You don't say much, do you?

696
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:22,486
If you kill that woman,
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

697
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,304
A lot.

698
00:33:26,155 --> 00:33:27,545
Good to know.

699
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:30,149
Okay, Caleb. Here's the thing.

700
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:32,327
After a brief discussion
with my associate,

701
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:34,298
we've come to the conclusion
that you're full of crap.

702
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,400
You're not suicidal.
You're a narcissist.

703
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:40,358
Stuck in a chimney,
with no chance for escape.

704
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,953
Hey! Hey! S-Stay back!

705
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:51,488
The only way you get out
of this room alive

706
00:33:51,672 --> 00:33:55,007
is if you give up... right now.

707
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:05,517
Get up.

708
00:34:07,397 --> 00:34:09,545
Turn around. Hands behind your head.

709
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:10,896
Interlace your fingers.

710
00:34:11,057 --> 00:34:13,386
Other one. Come on. Your other hand.

711
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,275
You're under arrest.

712
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:17,228
That took guts, Officer Nolan.

713
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:19,898
You said when push comes
to shove, he'd surrender.

714
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:21,699
Well, yeah. But I could've been wrong.

715
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,502
That's gonna be a lot
of paperwork for you, Boot.

716
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,710
Seriously? That's what
you're thinking about right now?

717
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:38,148
Hypothetically,

718
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:40,717
is there ever a scenario
where we just, you know,

719
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:42,086
g-give them what they want?

720
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,458
Where we, you know, balance one life

721
00:34:44,495 --> 00:34:47,203
against the lives of many lives and...

722
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:48,982
make that hard call?

723
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:51,895
Th-That call isn't ours to make.

724
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:53,443
Look, we're here to serve and protect.

725
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,130
We don't get to decide who
we serve or who we protect.

726
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:59,069
So you're willing to die for that guy?

727
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:01,732
I am unwilling to let fear
make me do something

728
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,853
I'll be ashamed of in the light of day.

729
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:06,375
Whoa, hey, where are you going?

730
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:08,130
I'm gonna talk.

731
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,242
Damn it.

732
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:23,124
You stay here.

733
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:25,094
No matter what happens to me,
you protect him.

734
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:26,768
I will.

735
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:32,301
Hey, leave him alone.

736
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:35,637
You want to beat someone up,
I'm right here.

737
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:37,477
Only one I want is Marcos.

738
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:39,941
You give him up, we out of here.

739
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:42,611
- I can't do that.
- Look, I got no beef with you or Joe.

740
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,513
But that fool in there...

741
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:46,133
he was creeping with my old lady.

742
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:47,883
So he gots to get dealt with!

743
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:49,240
- Yeah, that's right.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

744
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,476
Give up.

745
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:52,120
You're alone. Outnumbered.

746
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:58,116
You know, it was pointed out
to me today

747
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:01,948
that I've been doing patrol
a long time. Maybe too long.

748
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:03,952
You know, I've seen a lot
of friends move up and on.

749
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:05,697
Promotions. Other agencies...

750
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:07,867
- I don't give a damn, Cop.
- Well, you should.

751
00:36:07,994 --> 00:36:09,554
'Cause one thing I've
learned all these years

752
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,549
is that I'm never alone.

753
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:13,859
And I'm never outnumbered.

754
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:25,150
You're under arrest.

755
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,132
Turn around, get down on your knees.

756
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:29,758
Turn around!

757
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:31,387
Hands behind your head.

758
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:40,700
Call it in, Boot.

759
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,170
7-Adam-19, last fugitive in custody.

760
00:36:43,322 --> 00:36:44,588
Show us Code 4.

761
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:56,715
Tell your old man I said hi.

762
00:36:56,787 --> 00:36:58,316
Yeah, I don't think I will.

763
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:00,352
Why? You afraid of what he might say?

764
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,709
Nope, I just don't want to bother him

765
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:03,008
with a bunch of nonsense.

766
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:06,224
Oh, you don't believe me. That's cool.

767
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:08,691
Every kid should worship their dad.

768
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:11,764
But if you want to find out
the truth about him...

769
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:13,670
read my file.

770
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:17,373
What was that about?

771
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,833
Nothing... I hope.

772
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,077
Your partner's crazy.

773
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:25,943
Not my partner. She's my T.O.

774
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,389
What the hell does that mean?

775
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:29,414
Oh, you've got some time
on your hands, Caleb.

776
00:37:29,744 --> 00:37:30,975
Look it up.

777
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:32,979
- You ready for him, Elizabeth?
- Yeah.

778
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,237
Elizabeth?

779
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,125
Yeah?

780
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,927
Anyone call you "Beth"?

781
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:46,026
Why?

782
00:37:46,443 --> 00:37:47,900
Did you know Graham?

783
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:49,367
The deputy who passed away?

784
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:51,871
Well, yeah.

785
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:55,098
We... We worked together
for the last five years.

786
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,371
I was with him when he died.

787
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:00,762
He asked me to pass
a message along to Beth.

788
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,281
What message?

789
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:06,050
He told me to tell her he loved her.

790
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:13,124
- You're lying.
- No, that's... the last thing he said.

791
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,827
Is that you? Were you together?

792
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:20,238
He was, um...

793
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,137
my friend.

794
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,184
There was a time that I, um...

795
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,973
I thought he'd ask me out.

796
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,099
I wanted him to.

797
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,777
He never did.

798
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,817
Well, I think he
regretted that in the end.

799
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:44,988
I'm sorry for your loss.

800
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,459
Thanks.

801
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:56,680
You sure you still
want me to come to dinner?

802
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:59,218
I mean, it's been a bit of a day.

803
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:02,464
Wife's orders. I bring you
or I don't come home.

804
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,449
- Hey.
- Oh, sorry, I-I can come back.

805
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:08,523
No. What's on your mind?

806
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,801
I, um...

807
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,988
I was thinking about taking
the sergeant's exam.

808
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:17,675
- Really?
- You think it's a bad idea?

809
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:20,013
I think it's about time.

810
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:22,358
I hear there might be
some openings coming up.

811
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:26,475
The test is in a couple months.

812
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,524
That means you're gonna cram
a hell of a lot of studying in

813
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,447
to get ready. You up for it?

814
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:33,034
Otherwise you have to wait
two years for the next exam.

815
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:35,034
Yeah, I am.

816
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:37,323
- Thanks.
- No problem.

817
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:39,455
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

818
00:39:44,146 --> 00:39:45,445
What?

819
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:47,448
- What do you mean, "What"?
- Oh, come on.

820
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,702
Don't look at me like that.

821
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:50,173
Hanging my business
out there like that?

822
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:51,847
- Stop it.
- Whatever.

823
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:54,663
- I miss pushing your buttons.
- I don't.

824
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:56,488
Pleasure.

825
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,609
- Hey.
- Hi,

826
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,249
did you... did you ever find her?

827
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:01,702
Your Beth?

828
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:03,664
Yeah, I did.

829
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:05,322
Good.

830
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,989
Uh, y-you know, you were wrong.

831
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,419
Uh, excuse me?

832
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:12,122
You said there was nothing in my past

833
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,018
to indicate I could connect with people

834
00:40:14,055 --> 00:40:15,755
in high-stress situations.

835
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:18,100
I mean, obviously, negotiating
with a suicide bomber

836
00:40:18,137 --> 00:40:20,065
is stressful, but, honestly,

837
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:22,179
you need to try telling
a single mother of four

838
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:24,317
that her kitchen is delayed
'cause her tile's on backorder.

839
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:26,483
Or convincing a bank
to give you an extra week

840
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,052
to come up with a mortgage.

841
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:31,952
I-I guess I-I had never
thought of it that way.

842
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:33,850
- Well, now you do.
- Yes, I do.

843
00:40:37,147 --> 00:40:38,631
Um...

844
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:39,944
I'm gonna get going.

845
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,486
- Right.
- Yeah.

846
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,545
Um, sorry.

847
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:46,619
One last thing.

848
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:49,607
Could I... get you to sign my book?

849
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:51,544
I know it's nerdy, but, honestly,

850
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,079
I've... I've never actually met someone

851
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:54,518
who's written a book before.

852
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:56,455
- Sure, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

853
00:40:56,685 --> 00:40:57,933
Um...

854
00:40:58,198 --> 00:41:00,316
- I-I need a pen.
- Uh, yes.

855
00:41:02,256 --> 00:41:03,623
Okay, thank you.

856
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:09,007
Thank you for this.

857
00:41:12,796 --> 00:41:14,120
There you are.

858
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,910
All right.

859
00:41:16,264 --> 00:41:18,231
Have a good night, Officer Nolan.

860
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:19,738
And good work today.

861
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:21,482
Thanks. You too.

862
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:38,035
- Hello?
- Too soon?
