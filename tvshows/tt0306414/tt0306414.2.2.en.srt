1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Thirteen bodies, all female...

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,900
eleven White, two Asian-looking.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,100
All between the ages of maybe 20, 30.
All very dead.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,900
From Eastern Europe probably.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,200
So this is, what, an accident?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,700
Your air pipe's up top, crushed.
Probably during the off-load.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,100
So, yeah, accidental probably.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,600
But that's his call, right?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,200
-Doctor.
-Frazier.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,900
How're we doing here?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,700
-How are we doing?
-I mean, what are we doing?

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,200
What's the plan with all this?

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,500
Is this your first
death investigation, Officer?

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,500
Russell. Yeah, first and onliest.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,300
You got 13 for the price of one.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
We're gonna start cutting this afternoon.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,400
Anything you got by way of identifications
should come through my office.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,700
What identification?

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
So far, we don't have
a passport or visa in the bunch.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,900
Whatever you find in this luggage,
send it over...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,500
or they're all going to the Anatomy Board
as Jane Does.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,300
Who's the investigating agency?

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,800
If they were alive, they'd be illegals,
and that would mean lmmigration.

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,800
-But they're dead, so they're cargo.
-Cargo, but no contraband.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,200
There's nothing to be seized
as a customs violation.

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,400
They're dead
on Port Authority property, right?

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,400
-Yeah.
-That's a state thing.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,300
We'll eat it.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,600
If it's accidental, then it's just about IDs
on these stowaways, right?

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,700
Good enough for me, brother.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
No reason to open a full case folder
that I can see.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,900
Wait a minute.
You CID guys are rolling out on this?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,100
No crime, no investigation.

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,300
All you've got right here, Officer Russell,
is a lot of paperwork.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,400
And then there was one.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
-You don't have to do this.
-No?

38
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,100
Anything you're gonna say
I already said to Spiros.

39
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
You called him a Greek asshole?

40
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
You think we wanted this?

41
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,100
I don't know what the fuck
you people want and don't want.

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,800
All I know is, I got a can full of young girls
suffocating to death on my docks.

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,500
-This was a mistake.
-A mistake?

44
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
They fucking died in that can...

45
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,100
while this stupid son of a bitch sat there
with his dick in his hands.

46
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
You know nothing.

47
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,900
We understand you're upset, Frank.
We are upset, too, okay?

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,100
Sergei was supposed to wait
for our friend to come off the boat.

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,800
Our friend was supposed to tell us
that there was no problem...

50
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,600
you know, no Customs.

51
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,300
-He did not come off the boat.
-Why the fuck not?

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
This is what we're trying to find out.
We don't know.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Because you don't get the right message,
these girls are dying on my docks?

54
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
This is how it goes?
On my docks, this happened!

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
I understand how you feel...

56
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,000
but we're upset, too.
Everybody, we're all upset.

57
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Nobody here wanted this.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,100
Uncle Frank,
they're saying it wasn't on purpose.

59
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
You could've told me
there were girls in that fucking can.

60
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
You could've told me,
so I didn't just shove them back...

61
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,500
in the stacks like I did, right?

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Why didn't you tell me
what was in that motherfucking can?

63
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Now you want to know what's in the cans?

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,000
Before, you wanted to know nothing.
Now, you ask.

65
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,200
Guns, okay?

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,500
Drugs, whores, vodka, BMWs...

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,500
beluga caviar or bombs, maybe.

68
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,800
-Bad terrorists with big nuclear bombs.
-Boom.

69
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,200
I am kidding you, Frank, it's a joke.

70
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,000
But you don't ask...

71
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,900
because you don't want to know.

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
Tell the Greek that next time
he's got something breathing...

73
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,000
in one of them cans, I need to know it.

74
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Give him a couple of days, you know?

75
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,100
So Roberto been caught?

76
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,900
Yep, DEA got him in New York.

77
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
Now the shit makes some sense.

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,200
The money we sent for the last go-round
came back. All of it.

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,600
Damn, they ain't gonna touch us now?

80
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,900
Goddamn Dominicans running around
scared acting like we the problem.

81
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Roberto won't even see us.
Stringer had to go to the lawyer up there.

82
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,200
They saying they have to be sure
before they get back with us.

83
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,000
-They saying you only got seven years, so--
-So I'm a motherfucking snitch?

84
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,400
They ain't saying they think it.

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,300
They just don't know how
the Feds got to Roberto.

86
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,600
-So we on the outside.
-Yep.

87
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Look...

88
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,200
we hanging on to them projects with scraps.

89
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,900
Avon, you gotta have somebody for us.

90
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,500
A friend in Atlanta...

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,100
owns a rim shop, name of Vargus.

92
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,200
Have Stringer fly down there tomorrow
and meet him.

93
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,800
You seen D'Angelo lately?

94
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,600
He on the J-tier, you know what I mean?

95
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,100
It's very difficult for me to get over there,
you know?

96
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,900
So you ain't checking on him,
and Donette's out and about.

97
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
-I don't know what's what anymore.
-Now, what's up with Donette?

98
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
I leave messages, she ain't call back.

99
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,000
She ain't had her ass down here
regular neither.

100
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,400
We need to tighten shit up, Avon.

101
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
She should be bringing his son by
every week.

102
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
Yeah, I'm gonna put Stringer on that, too.

103
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,100
After all he has done for us...

104
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,600
Dee needs to be cared for, Avon.

105
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
-Promises were made.
-I know.

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,000
He took the 20, he ain't complaining.

107
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,400
He is carrying a lot of weight for this family.

108
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,700
And we keeping him close.
Dee being cold toward me right now.

109
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,300
He in this motherfucker trying
to make adjustments and shit.

110
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Adjustments?

111
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,600
Brianna...

112
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,800
you know damn well I ain't gonna let shit
happen to him, right?

113
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,000
-You got these off the boat?
-What, in winter?

114
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,900
In a couple of months. Fringe benefit.

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Can't catch crabs in Homicide, right?

116
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Except maybe
the occasional emergency room nurse...

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
every now and again.

118
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,400
-Need some air in here.
-Leave it.

119
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,900
I don't need the hassle if Rawls comes past.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,700
You're not the run-of-the-mill
kind of asshole, are you?

121
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,200
-You're the special kind of asshole.
-I'm special, all right.

122
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,800
How long did it take you
to figure out the tide...

123
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,700
took that girl over the county line?

124
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
-Three hours.
-Three hours...

125
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,900
with your little harbor maps...

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,300
and your tide tables
just to stick Rawls with an extra body.

127
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Never mind that you just fucked Cole
with a stone whodunit.

128
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,800
-That's collateral damage.
-Yeah.

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Are you gonna waste that crab gut?

130
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,100
You're a pussy, besides, Jimmy.

131
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,500
-We need Omar, Jimmy.
-You see this.

132
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,200
-Thirteen girls?
-Yeah, I heard about it.

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,500
-Who caught it?
-It ain't ours.

134
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,000
Port police has jurisdiction over Patapsco.

135
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,300
Ain't gonna be a murder either,
so who gives a fuck?

136
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Listen, Jimmy, I ain't got no case on Bird...

137
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,200
unless that crazy motherfucker
Omar testifies. You hear me?

138
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,700
It's time you show Bunk the love.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
-You want love, you come and sit on my lap.
-Shit.

140
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,900
This pretty motherfucker
comes over and tells me...

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,700
the customs seal got broke on the dock
and I'm responsible.

142
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
Can you fucking believe that?

143
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,500
I seen the goddamn thing on the crane,
the seal's already broke.

144
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,900
Who got to it?

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,100
The crew probably.
Some goddamn ordinary seamen.

146
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,700
-What was it?
-Vodka, I think.

147
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,100
I ain't saying
we didn't squeeze a case or two...

148
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,800
but fuck it, Frank, the can was already open.

149
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,100
I didn't come to the union hall today
on the back of no bread truck.

150
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,600
I swear, Frank,
we grabbed a couple cases at the end...

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,700
after everyone of them
sailor boys damn near raped it.

152
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,600
-A couple of cases?
-Yeah, it was four.

153
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,200
-What the fuck is up with the police?
-What?

154
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,200
They're stroking tickets
on every fucking car.

155
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,200
"Rear tag not entirely visible?"

156
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
You got the tow bar set high.

157
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,600
"Emergency access blocked."
Are you kidding me?

158
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,600
We've been parking this side of the building
since the fucking ships had sails.

159
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,800
Come on, pal, what the fuck?

160
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,100
-It ain't me, it's my boss.
-Who's your boss?

161
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,400
-Valchek, Southeast district.
-Stan Valchek?

162
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,600
The district commander, yeah.

163
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,900
That sawed-off piece of shit.
Why the hell is he fucking with us?

164
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,900
Whatever it's about,
you definitely got the man's attention...

165
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,900
'cause word comes down
this morning from my shift lieutenant...

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,200
we're to ride past your union hall
twice a day and paper cars.

167
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
-You work for a gaping asshole.
-More than one actually.

168
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,600
We're not gonna put up with this shit,
we're gonna go downtown on it.

169
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,200
Take it all the way to the mayor's office,
I can't blame you, but leave me out of it.

170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,500
It's chain of command.

171
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,300
I mean, I gotta live
with the son of a bitch, too, right?

172
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,100
-You can't tell me this place ain't clean.
-You talk when I say you can.

173
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,500
Who told you to decorate, nigger?

174
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,500
Cell look pretty fucked up to me.
What you calling clean?

175
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,900
-Man, I ain't done shit.
-Don't say that to me, motherfucker!

176
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,700
Pets, too?

177
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,600
No, you see, they plastic,
they got little motors and all, man.

178
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,300
Clean this shit before lock-down.

179
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,400
That's four in a row, bitch!

180
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,300
Wait here, this won't take long.

181
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
What do you want from me?
He's an E-rate and you're a "G."

182
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,500
He wants the ship, he gets the ship.
Seniority, Mims, seniority.

183
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,100
-There ain't no union without it, brother.
-Your sweetheart's out there.

184
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,400
Who?

185
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,200
I gotta go, Mims, I got to.

186
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,800
-Kind of empty in here.
-Everyone's working.

187
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,200
-You getting the message?
-The message?

188
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,600
I had people working on a window
for the nave up St. Casmir's since Easter...

189
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,900
you know that?

190
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
I took money from half a dozen
different people...

191
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
told them where it was gonna go.

192
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
-You tell Father Lewandowski?
-I was gonna surprise him.

193
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Yeah, you surprised everybody.
Now there's one window too many, right?

194
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Here's the thing, Father Lew says...

195
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,600
he could take another window
in the rectory on the second floor.

196
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,900
-Good for you.
-No, good for you, Frank.

197
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,600
You don't want my finger in your eye,
you better do what's right here.

198
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,100
What's right?

199
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,300
What's right would be for you
to come down here to my house...

200
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,300
Iike a decent human being
and ask a common courtesy.

201
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,000
But that's not you, it's not your way.

202
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
My old man always said
you were a half-ass punk...

203
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,500
over at Holy Redeemer as a kid.

204
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,200
My sister said you were a pain in the ass
pest at all them CYO dances...

205
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,400
where none of the girls
would even look at you.

206
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Damn near everyone at the Point said
when you got your badge...

207
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
it was too much for anybody named Valchek
to have a patrolman's drag.

208
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,400
And sure enough, you've been
an official asshole every day since.

209
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Fuck you! And your window!

210
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,300
Where are you gonna be?

211
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
I'm gonna go find some lunch
somewhere, maybe.

212
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,700
-Give me an hour, yeah?
-Yeah.

213
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,700
-What the fuck is this?
-A knot.

214
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,900
Why don't you just do bunny ears?

215
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,300
So what else we got?

216
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,000
Medics, clothes, bedrolls, that's it.

217
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,700
-Here's a letter, though.
-A letter? What language?

218
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Who knows?
Same backwards-ass writing, though.

219
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,000
That's like Russian or something,
I'm telling you.

220
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,900
Can't figure the name or the address...

221
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
but the stamp says "Magyar" on it.

222
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,000
-Where's Magyar?
-What the hell do I look like, Rand McNally?

223
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,100
Which one of your detectives caught
all the dead girls?

224
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
Detectives? They're at the bar already.

225
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,700
These yours?

226
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,700
They chalked it up as an accidental
and dumped the paperwork on us.

227
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,100
She found them, she writes on it.

228
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,000
-I'm McNulty, City Marine Unit.
-Beatrice Russell.

229
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,100
-You got any IDs yet?
-No visas or passports.

230
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,000
A few scraps of paper,
but nothing to make sense of.

231
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Russian alphabet on most of it.
You just curious?

232
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
-Yeah.
-Why?

233
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,500
Day before yesterday I fished out a Jane Doe
from near the bridge.

234
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
There's no missing person report on file.

235
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,800
We got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies.

236
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,300
-Mine was a murder.
-A murder, you're kidding me?

237
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,300
We got some photos,
if you wanna take a look.

238
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
I called the morgue this morning...

239
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,800
the only thing they can say
is the dental work isn't local.

240
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,400
Overseas, they think.

241
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Overseas, they think.

242
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,800
-Is that your girl?
-Think so.

243
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Looks better here.

244
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,700
You got her in the water,
day before yesterday, out by the bridge?

245
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
0900 hours, by the Fort Armistead dock.

246
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,500
Why would you have a murdered girl
in the water...

247
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,300
and the rest of them are suffocating
in a can at Patapsco?

248
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,500
-What went wrong?
-Air pipe up top got crushed.

249
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Happened when cargo shifted around,
most likely.

250
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,400
They had cargo up front of the container
with a false back after about 25 feet.

251
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,100
You had cartons stacked in front...

252
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,400
but a tight passage to a small door
in the false wall...

253
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,400
opens from the outside only.

254
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
-They're in here the whole trip?
-Probably not.

255
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,600
Once they're at sea,
there's usually someone in the crew...

256
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
who's in on it, you know, a shepherd.

257
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,600
He let's them out to eat, move around,
use the bathroom, whatever.

258
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,400
They were clawing at the wall for air.

259
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,000
That's what the medical examiner
said anyway.

260
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,000
-Where's the air pipe?
-That's the hole. Pipe's up top.

261
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
You get a lot of stowaways?

262
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,700
Some. Usually it's Customs
or INS that finds them.

263
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Most are Dominicans or Haitians,
or from that part of the world, anyway.

264
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,100
-Not so much from Europe?
-A bit more since 9l1 1, actually.

265
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,900
I think because people can't get in
on visas anymore...

266
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,300
Iike they used to. There you go.

267
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,200
Usually, if the shepherd is doing his job...

268
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,900
he tries to put a can like this
on bottom of the stack...

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,400
so they can pop it and the girls
just walk out on the floor of the hold.

270
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,300
Where was this one?

271
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,100
-Look.
-What?

272
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,500
-That look right to you?
-What do you mean?

273
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,600
-You said you were with the Marine Unit?
-Yeah.

274
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,300
What does the Marine Unit have to do
with a bunch of dead girls in a can?

275
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,700
Not a thing.

276
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
What do you want me to do?

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,400
You can go to Father Lew,
ask him to give Sobotka back his money.

278
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
Switch the windows, maybe.

279
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,400
You ever in your life
seen a priest give money back?

280
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,300
The guy pays for a window,
he gets a window.

281
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,900
I thought you had suction.

282
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
At City Hall, I got suction.
Down Annapolis, I got suction.

283
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,600
But who but the Pope has any drag
with the cardinal? Get over it.

284
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
How the fuck's he get
that kind of money anyway?

285
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,900
Now, that's a good question.

286
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,100
I mean, the whole l.B.S.
can't have 1,500 guys left in this town...

287
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,700
and there ain't 100 checkers.

288
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,000
They got the car ships coming in...

289
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,200
the roll-onlroll-off cargo
is keeping them afloat.

290
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,500
-That's all they got?
-Pretty much.

291
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,500
Past six months,
l.B.S. hired Bruce Dibiago's people...

292
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,700
to lobby for them down in Annapolis.

293
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,300
They've been good
with the political contributions.

294
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,100
They're throwing around a lot of cash.

295
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,100
-How can they?
-You tell me.

296
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,400
Dibiago does not come cheap.
This is real money we're talking.

297
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You know what I think?

298
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,300
I think Francis Sobotka's into some dirt.

299
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,800
You're the cop, not me.

300
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,400
The Grainery?

301
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,800
So I hear Burrell's gonna be
the next police commissioner.

302
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,700
Yeah, I've seen worse.

303
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,900
See, if it's crushed by another container,
it should've been one single movement...

304
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,600
maybe two if something shifts,
and then shifts back again.

305
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,000
This looks like someone has been pounding
on it in a bunch of spots.

306
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,200
See?

307
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,300
Before I rule it, I wanna go down
with a metallurgist to be sure.

308
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,400
But yeah, from the look of it...

309
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,300
you just bought yourself 13 homicides.
Congratulations.

310
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,700
If the commissioner
goes down to Washington, it's you, right?

311
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,600
That's for the mayor to decide.
I'd have to clear the council, too.

312
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,300
If the mayor wants you,
that's not much of a problem.

313
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,900
You been around as long as me,
you make a few enemies.

314
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
What, the First District guys?
They're not gonna start nothing.

315
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,500
-They're pushing Shipley.
-See, that's racist.

316
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,000
You know, it personally offends me
that anybody would reach down past you...

317
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,800
to elevate some colonel
just because he happens to be white.

318
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,100
You know what I'm gonna do?

319
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm gonna get on the phone
and call my friends at the Hall.

320
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,600
That'll bring the First District in line.

321
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,100
That's very kind.

322
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
And what if anything is there
that I can do for you, Maj. Valchek?

323
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,100
Funny you should ask. I need a detail.

324
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,800
CID people mostly, though I can spare
some bodies out of my district, too.

325
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
What for?

326
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,900
I got some guys in the Southeast
that are showing a lot of money.

327
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,200
-Port guys, longshoremen.
-I.B.S.?

328
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm not talking about going after
the whole union.

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,400
Just a couple of guys in one local
that look fat.

330
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
Drugs, maybe, or the usual thieving.

331
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,300
-Frank Sobotka, you heard the name?
-No.

332
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,000
And I'm not saying the problem
even goes past him.

333
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,500
-What's he to you?
-To me?

334
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,800
He's an asshole.

335
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Six men for six weeks.

336
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,600
Rawls will pick them.

337
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
You ordered more than you ate.

338
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
It's cold out here.

339
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,200
Cedric, I shouldn't have brought it up again,
I'm sorry.

340
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,800
You're right. You're always right.

341
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
I'm just saying you have to be realistic.

342
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,900
You did what you did,
and now you are where you are.

343
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,600
In the basement.

344
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,800
If they buried you any deeper,
you'd be under the damn building.

345
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,200
Burrell won't be there forever.

346
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,400
Burrell is going to be the next
police commissioner, and you know it.

347
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,800
But you've got the law degree.

348
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,300
With your police experience, half a dozen
firms would think you're a prize.

349
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,100
You've got options.

350
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,200
-Just because they don't--
-You're right.

351
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,300
I'll put in my papers.

352
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,900
-Who wants breakfast?
-Christ, it's about time.

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
Lucky's was closed.
I had to go to the metro.

354
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,800
I thought Mutt be working North Point
today. He like them Ro-ro ships.

355
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,700
No, his wife is having some kind of
operation, so he gave back his hours.

356
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,600
-Who got them?
-New Charles works for Mutt.

357
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,200
Yo, Zig. You working today?

358
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,100
No, came down here to have breakfast
with you duper-faced fucks.

359
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,900
Most important goddamn meal
of the goddamn day, right?

360
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,100
-Set them up, Dolores, Zig is thirsty.
-That's right, I'm thirsty.

361
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,100
You know what?
Bottoms up, you ugly whores.

362
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,100
-Nick.
-What's up?

363
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,600
Come here.

364
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,800
-I got a line on something.
-Oh, yeah?

365
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,700
You know White Mike
from down Curtis Bay?

366
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,200
-He's gonna stake me to a package.
-A package?

367
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Dope, Nicky, dope.

368
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,300
I got work today, Zig.

369
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,200
Yeah, and I'm gonna make as much money
not working. You see what I'm saying?

370
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,100
-So why the fuck you coming to me?
-I want you to come in on it with me.

371
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,900
You bring a little cash as money down,
my man might give us a bigger package.

372
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,900
We turn it around, we both get paid.

373
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,300
All right, ship's in, gentlemen.

374
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,300
-Fuck that shit, Zig.
-Time to work!

375
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
-Nicky, come on, man.
-Can I ride with you?

376
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,700
Will you think about it?

377
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,900
Dolores, can I get another shot?

378
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,900
-What's up?
-DWI checkpoint.

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,400
Step out of the car for a Breathalyzer.

380
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,900
It's 8:00 in the goddamn morning.

381
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,800
Who the fuck gets drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?

382
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,800
Bill, I'm not arguing
that the jurisdiction's not technically ours.

383
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,100
Patapsco's definitely Port Authority property
and the Port Police have the jurisdiction.

384
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
-That's not in dispute here.
-Good.

385
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,200
But they're not equipped
for a death investigation.

386
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,600
You dump 13 bodies on them,
you're dumping them on us.

387
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,000
MSP is gonna have to pick up that slack,
overburdened as we are.

388
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,800
Robbie, I have fought and scratched
and clawed for four months...

389
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,200
to get my clearance rate up above 50%...

390
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,300
and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%.

391
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,900
Do you happen to know
what my clearance rate will be...

392
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
if I take 13 whodunits off your hands?

393
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,300
-39.4%.
-Bill, like I told you--

394
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,800
We did not get to be colonels
by being complete fucking idiots, right?

395
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Robbie, you poor bastard,
you look like you need a cup of coffee.

396
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,300
The man is a god.

397
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,500
Big chief.

398
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,000
I gotta get him back to maximum security
by 6:00, all right?

399
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah. Come on in, man.

400
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,500
Here, sit down.
Fix yourself something to eat, man.

401
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,200
-No, man, I ain't hungry, I ate.
-What?

402
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,000
You crazy, this is good shit, man.

403
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,200
-Better get in this.
-No.

404
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Look, man...

405
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,700
if he tearing your room down, man...

406
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
we keep bringing more stuff in.

407
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,200
It's gonna get so he can't tear it down
fast enough. You feel me?

408
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,200
He fucked with my fish though, I don't....

409
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400
He ain't have to go there, man.

410
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,100
-What's up with this motherfucker?
-You remember Ladontay?

411
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,300
Burner from over the Poe Homes?

412
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,900
Caught him over at Carver parking lot
after school?

413
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,600
We did that?

414
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,600
Tilghman was Ladontay's cousin
or some such.

415
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,200
He found out I ate the charge,
he busting my chops.

416
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,500
Ladontay? I can't even remember that one.

417
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,800
You need a scorecard
to keep up with your lethal ass.

418
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,300
Avon, he fixing to stay in my shit.

419
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,600
Listen. I'm gonna talk to him, all right?

420
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,800
I'm gonna set it straight. All right?

421
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
-What's his name again?
-Tilghman, he work the dayshift on J-tier.

422
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
I seen him around.

423
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,700
Man, all these CO's are fronting and shit.

424
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,100
You got the guards bringing your meals in.

425
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,400
This punk motherfucker Tilghman
running around acting righteous...

426
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,700
but he bringing shit in here,
steady slinging on the side.

427
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,100
Don't fret. All right?

428
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,900
It's nothing. I'm gonna take care of it.

429
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,600
The city won't take it?

430
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,900
No, it's Port Authority property.
It's state jurisdiction.

431
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,900
So it's MSP out of Pikesville.

432
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,200
Case needs real murder police.

433
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,100
You don't give a shit.
Just wanna fuck Rawls, don't you?

434
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,200
Absolutely. What can you give me?

435
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,000
-This is about fucking over your boss?
-If they don't eat the cases, then you will.

436
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,000
What do you need?

437
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,800
First of all,
how big was the false compartment?

438
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,300
13 by 7 by 7.

439
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,500
Okay, we got 13 adult females,
breathing at a normal to elevated rate...

440
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,400
that's 0.25 liters of oxygen per minute...

441
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,700
per victim.

442
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
-He's a doctor?
-A State Bureau of Mines.

443
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,700
-Minds?
-Mines.

444
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Officer Tilghman,
could I parlay with you for a moment?

445
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,700
-Barksdale, right?
-Yeah.

446
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
-Listen, I want to know if you can help me--
-No.

447
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,700
-Pardon me?
-I said, no, motherfucker.

448
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,400
Off the steps.

449
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,900
What the fuck are you up to now?

450
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,900
You're deep into somebody's shit, McNulty.
I can tell.

451
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,500
This is bullshit.

452
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
Those computations were checked...

453
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,300
and confirmed by
the medical examiner's office.

454
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,400
They're accurate for time of death
to within a three-hour window.

455
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,800
Yeah, so you say.

456
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,900
Your man in the Marine Unit
did the measurements on the container.

457
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,700
I happen to know my man
in the Marine Unit intimately...

458
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,400
and he's, without a doubt,
the most swollen asshole...

459
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,700
in American law enforcement.

460
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,200
I am not eating 13 murders. No, sir.

461
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,200
If they were already dead
when the container hit the dock...

462
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,900
then they were murdered on board ship.

463
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,600
That means Baltimore County...

464
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,000
or Anne Arundel
on the other side of the bridge...

465
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,200
and if they're further down the bay, then you
fellows with the Coast Guard can take it.

466
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,400
This is not a city problem.

467
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,300
Talk amongst yourselves.
One of you is taking this case home tonight.

468
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,500
No, Bill.

469
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,300
The Atlantic Light passed the Key Bridge
at 2300 hours...

470
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,400
and laid up at anchor,
2,000 yards off Patapsco...

471
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,100
until 0600 hours, when it docked.

472
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,900
-By the map, that's Baltimore city.
-And that put the ship in your jurisdiction...

473
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,100
for the three-hour window
for the time of death.

474
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
Bill, you look like
you could use a good cup of coffee.

475
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,100
Mikey.

476
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,700
-What's up?
-No.

477
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
No, what?

478
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,300
No way, you little rat-faced piece of shit.

479
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
You fucked up the last two packages
I gave you.

480
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,000
Mikey, look man, that wasn't me.

481
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,500
You got money, Zig,
you can buy a little weight.

482
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,200
You got no money, go fuck yourself.

483
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,300
Mike, I thought we was friends.

484
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,000
Did you fuck up the last two packages?

485
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,100
-Sort of.
-Are you beat to shit?

486
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,100
-No.
-Take a walk, my friend.

487
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,200
-What's up, man?
-What's up, playboy?

488
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,600
That thing in Atlanta, settled for now.

489
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,600
So we got that, you know.

490
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,200
Good. I ain't call you down for that, man.

491
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,500
Called you down here 'cause we got a CO
in here with some bullshit.

492
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,500
-Who?
-Name is Tilghman.

493
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,200
He kin to that boy that Wee-Bey
dusted down over in that school lot.

494
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
He can't let go of that shit, neither.

495
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,900
Tilghman? Right.

496
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,600
Listen, Brianna reminded me, man.
We got promises we got to keep.

497
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,300
I know, I heard.

498
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,400
You need to get with Dee's girl.

499
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,700
Have her bring that young one
down here regular.

500
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,100
She need to step up
and do her fucking part.

501
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,500
All right.

502
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,500
How's Dee taking it?

503
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,700
I mean, he gonna do
what need to be done, man.

504
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,100
You know what I'm saying?
Dee need a little help every now and again.

505
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,500
You're not out of reach
or nothing like that, right?

506
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,700
-No, nothing like that.
-You sure?

507
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,300
-He's carrying a lot of weight for us, man.
-Stringer, he's family, man.

508
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,200
All right? He's family.

509
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Come on, Jimmy. Take it to the head, baby.

510
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,600
Come on. Tell her you were first in line.

511
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
That's it.

512
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,800
There it is.

513
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,400
-One more, baby, come on.
-There you go.

514
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
-That's enough.
-No.

515
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,300
You gotta do all 14 of them bad boys...

516
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,800
one for every member of the dear family
you gave to Cole.

517
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Here's to Ray Cole, a fine detective,
and a goodly man.

518
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,400
Jimmy, the look on Jay Landsman's face.
He nearly fucking cried.

519
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,300
And Rawls!

520
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,600
Rawls, I swear to God,
the man stayed in his office all day.

521
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,400
All afternoon.
He just stayed there with the door closed.

522
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,600
-Careful, you're giving me an erection.
-Come on now.

523
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,200
Motherfucker, you have outdone yourself
this time.

524
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,600
You ain't never coming back from this,
you know that.

525
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,700
Lester, what the fuck can they do to me
they haven't done?

526
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm riding the goddamn boat.

527
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,100
Fuck it, I don't give a shit.
Here's to Jane Doe 13.

528
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,000
All right.

529
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,700
Eleven more years of whatever bullshit
they throw at me.

530
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,300
I'm gonna put in my papers,
take the pension and walk.

531
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,600
Eleven's a long time to be on the shelf.

532
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,900
Tell me about it, Mr. 13 years.

533
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,600
And four months.

534
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,900
Fuck it.

535
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,600
Chew you up, they gotta spit you back out.

536
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,400
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

537
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,800
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

538
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Fuck.

539
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,100
Easy, motherfucker,
I ain't picking up that shit.

540
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,500
Go that way.

541
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,900
-Man, anybody still in there?
-They're keeping La-la.

542
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,500
He had an old warrant on him.

543
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,600
-For what?
-I don't know. Some traffic shit, man.

544
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,000
The bondsman's inside,
trying to get it all figured out.

545
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,000
Man, what the fuck
was this all about anyway?

546
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,800
-Jerking us around on the way to work.
-It's a beef I got with a police boss.

547
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,900
-Charlie Valchek's little pissant brother.
-You gotta get that taken care of, man.

548
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,600
-I mean, this shit is out of hand.
-I'm gonna take care of it.

549
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Yeah, y'all need a lift?

550
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,400
-I'll see you.
-All right, talk to you.

551
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,400
That runt wants a war, he's got one.

552
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,000
Not supposed to be talking anyway.

553
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,100
-Bunk, Lester.
-Yeah.

554
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,200
You two winners are on the Jane Does.

555
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
What? We're not up, Jay.

556
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,200
We caught that double in Pimlico last week.

557
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,000
Cole's gonna take the double.

558
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,400
-You two got pussy in a can.
-Jay, that ain't right.

559
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,700
You know what ain't right?

560
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,400
Our squad has a negative clearance rate
for the year. A negative rate.

561
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,100
Now, I'm not saying
Ray Cole isn't a good detective.

562
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,100
But I need those 14 cases to go black...

563
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,500
so I got my best people on it.

564
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Ray.

565
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
Lay it on them.

566
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,200
Name and number of the port cop
who processed the scene.

567
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,700
And the best of luck to you
in all your future endeavors, Detectives.

568
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,300
Motherfucker.

569
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,100
Beatrice Russell. She pretty at least?

570
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Last night, you're too drunk to fuck.
Today, you're too hung over.

571
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,400
What's the most useless thing on a woman?

572
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,100
-What?
-A drunken lrishman.

573
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,900
But you're not really lrish, are you?

574
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,300
I had 14 shots of Jameson.
How's that for green?

575
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,300
You're green, all right.

576
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,300
You're also an idiot. Who does 14 shots?

577
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
You're a child, McNulty.

578
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,600
Show up at my door at 2:00 a.m. again
without invitation...

579
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,800
-I will call the cops.
-Why would you wanna do that?

580
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,600
Jimmy.

581
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,700
Am I your girlfriend? No. Your wife? No.
Your soul mate? No.

582
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,200
What the fuck am l, Jimmy?

583
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,800
We're good together.

584
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,900
Answer the question.

585
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,600
I've been pretty honest with you.

586
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,600
My wife wants to put it back together again,
I'm gonna go for it, right?

587
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,200
You know, what with the kids and all....

588
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,100
You got any aspirin?

589
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,500
For Christ's sake, Ronnie, I'm dying in here.

590
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,900
A real police department
would have an elevator.

591
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,500
So you Russell? Bunk Moreland.

592
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,000
Lester Freamon.

593
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,100
I'm still on hold with the Coast Guard,
Delaware River Detachment.

594
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,500
What do we know?

595
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,700
Atlantic Light is in Philly,
heading for Port of Elizabeth tonight.

596
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,200
-I'm trying to get them to hold her.
-Anyone from your CID working this?

597
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,500
Nope. I heard there's a big argument
over jurisdiction...

598
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,800
and your colonel made everybody mad.

599
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,900
-All you get is me.
-Still on hold?

600
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,500
We can call this in from the road.

601
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,400
You're with City Homicide?

602
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,700
-You must know Jimmy McNulty.
-Yeah, he's dead to us.

603
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,400
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.

604
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,700
I've seen worse.

605
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,200
It's leased by the Highway Authority,
but we can use it for an off-site.

606
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,500
-Furnace work?
-It does.

607
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,100
And the phone lines.

608
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,600
You'll need window units
if you're here come summer...

609
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,200
but somehow I got a feeling...

610
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,900
that you gents will put together a case
quicker than that.

611
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,800
Now, this here...

612
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,200
is my district investigator,
Roland Pryzbylewski.

613
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,900
Kid's a prodigy.
Anything you need from me, you go to him.

614
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,900
Gentlemen, the target is Frank Sobotka...

615
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,800
and anyone Frank Sobotka
does his dirt with.

616
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,500
Roland will fill you in on the details.
Good hunting.

617
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,100
So who signs the overtime slips?

618
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,000
Son of a bitch.
You are a fucking thief, aren't you?

619
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,500
-This is where our taxes go.
-I do good work, don't l?

620
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,200
Let's get it on the fucking can now.

621
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,200
Horseface, you son of a bitch.

622
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,900
Christ, I'm gonna bust the only nut I got left.

623
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,800
Ain't no heavier than the pallets
we usually handle.

624
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,800
Finishing touch, boys.

625
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,700
Bon voyage.

626
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,200
There she goes.

627
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,600
This area's restricted. Yes, sir, no problem.

628
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,600
-Amir, why don't we sail?
-They're holding the ship.

629
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
-Who?
-Coast Guard, the Americans.

630
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Why?

631
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,100
Fuck, Sergei, you almost break my hand.

632
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,200
Bring him up!

633
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,100
-Have a good day, Officer.
-Okay, I'll see you.

634
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,500
Now get up in there.

635
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,800
Last call before lock-down.

636
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,900
Make it snappy now.

637
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,600
-How you like that?
-It's good, baby, it's beautiful.

638
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,400
Nice. Smooth.

639
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,900
Most def, man.

640
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,700
Man, watch your back, be good, baby.

641
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,400
-What up, man?
-Yeah, he left that in here.

642
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,200
It's his.

643
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,000
-So how you doing?
-All right.

644
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,600
Yeah?

645
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,100
Me and you gonna need to talk.

646
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,200
-So who's on board?
-Thirty-eight in the crew, 14 are Yemeni.

647
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,600
Eight are Sri Lankan.

648
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,600
There are five Filipinos and the rest
are from here, there, and back again.

649
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,100
-Anybody speak English?
-What you're asking them about...

650
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,100
I'll be amazed if any of them
manages a word.

651
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,400
-Where's your captain?
-At the Coast Guard office.

652
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,800
Angry as hell because we're due
on a New Jersey pier tomorrow morning.

653
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,300
You ain't gonna make it.

654
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,900
I gotta tell you, every day that you hold us
costs the shipping agent $100,000.

655
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,300
-The Atlantic Light is a huge enterprise.
-The Atlantic Light is a crime scene.

656
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,100
Don't try to play tough guy.

657
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,200
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

658
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,900
Talk to me!

659
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,100
Tell me what I need to know.

660
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,000
Get him up.

661
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,600
-Talk about the girls.
-No girls, nothing.

662
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,300
No English.

663
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,600
You no speak English,
but you know how to run?

664
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,700
Why you run from ship?

665
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,000
What the fuck that suppose to mean?

666
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,600
They got him in Philadelphia.

667
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,900
He jumped when he found out
the Coast Guard was gonna hold the ship.

668
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,900
-What is he?
-Sergei says he looks like an Arab.

669
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,400
He don't know nothing.

670
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,900
But you kept hitting him anyway.

671
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,100
Get his clothes.

672
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,400
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have one.

673
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,300
-Come on, let's talk.
-No English.

674
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,600
Tell me what happened to the girls?

675
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
No speak.

676
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,900
What then? What do you speak?

677
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,900
Come on, talk to me, friend.

678
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,300
Turkish?

679
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,100
You got that little hook on your nose.

680
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,400
Don't worry, patrioti.

681
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,400
I got nothing against the Turks.
That's the old world. This is the new.

682
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,100
Sam.

683
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,200
-I don't know nothing about--
-You know.

684
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,000
And you're going to tell me about it, too.
After that...

685
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,800
you're done, I give you my word.

686
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,300
We popped the can to let them take a bath.

687
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,700
Get some fresh air.

688
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,400
You gotta understand, my crew,
they pulling on their pootsos for weeks.

689
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,300
These girls, they looked pretty good.

690
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,200
-Katalavenis?
-Yes.

691
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,300
The men had cash to spend.

692
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,900
I admit it, I saw chance for business,
but that was all.

693
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,500
What happened?

694
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,400
One of the puttanas decided
she didn't want to be a puttana no more.

695
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,200
This one guy got rough with her.
The whore died.

696
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,200
The other ones saw.
I didn't know what to do.

697
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,200
-You kill one, then you kill them all.
-No, that was another man.

698
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,200
Another man, what man?

699
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,600
The one girl...

700
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,200
they saw, they knew.

701
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,100
Relax.

702
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,200
I gave you my word.

703
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,800
-Watch your shoes.
-Goddamn Turko.

704
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,400
Bleeds like a lamb.

705
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,300
In a year, each whore would bring
a quarter million. What is it?

706
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,200
$4 million.

707
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Gone.

708
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,600
Malaka.

709
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,500
Anyway, there will be other girls.

710
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,900
This one...

711
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,000
no fingerprints.

712
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,900
-No face.
-That's not a problem.

713
00:57:05,305 --> 00:58:05,332
