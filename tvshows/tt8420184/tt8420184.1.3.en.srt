10
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,094
No, I just think that
I created this monster.

11

We couldn't get the rebound,
we couldn't clear the boards.

It's another one of those periods
that I'm bored as hell.

63
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,242
I gotta find some way
to put a log on the fire.

64
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,247
That's a low blow down here, right?
Intentional foul.

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,581
I didn't see it that way.

66
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,251
There's a lot of things I don't see.

67
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,757
Most of the time, though,
I see the shit you do.

68
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,850
[JORDAN] Dennis hadn't accepted
the role that...

69
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,101
Scottie wasn't gonna be around
and we needed you to be more accountable.

70
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,727
I need to count on you.

71
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:35,358
So, around that time, we had a game,
and he gets kicked out for some shit.

72
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,654
And I'm livid,
because he got kicked out of the game

73
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,657
and leaves me out there by myself
'cause Scottie's not playing.

74
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,994
And Dennis knew he fucked up.
He knew he screwed up.

75
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,456
I hear someone knocking on my door
at the hotel.

76
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,334
Now, Dennis never comes in my room,

77
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,045
and he comes and says,
"Man, you got an extra cigar?"

78
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,340
I went to Michael Jordan's room,
asked for a cigar, but...

79
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,844
But I think that he knew the fact that...

80
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,887
That's probably his way...

81
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,683
Of me showing him that, you know,
"Man, my thing, my bad."

82
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,853
He didn't say an apology,
he didn't say anything,

83
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,813
but by him coming to my room,

84
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,024
it was his way of saying,
"Look, I fucked up."

85
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,236
<i>And from that point on,
Dennis was straight as an arrow.</i>

86
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,238
<i>And we started to win.</i>

87
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,032
[MAN] I'd like to ask y'all one question.

- [ALL] Game time! [GRUNT]

89

"Dennis, you wanna play for us?"

We had two other picks in the second round
that I'll give you quickly.

130
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,913
Greg Dreiling went to Indiana,
the big center,

131
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,500
and Dennis Rodman, the youngster
from Southeast Oklahoma State,

132
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,045
went to Detroit
as the 27th pick in the 1986 draft.

133
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:30,426
[THOMAS] When he first came to Detroit,
he was just an innocent, beautiful person,

134
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,888
but a little naive about, like, the world.

135

[SALLEY] He was simple at that time.

136

146
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,509
I said, "Shoot over here,
shoot over there..."

147
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,886
I'd just sit there, react, react.

148
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,391
[RODMAN] I practiced a lot about the angle
of the ball and trajectory of it.

149
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,395
You got a Larry Bird, it's gonna spin.
You got a Magic, it maybe spin.

150
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,314
When Michael shoot over here,
I position myself right there.

151
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,984
Now if it hit the rim, it's... Boom.

152
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,444
Click and go back this way.
It going here and here.

153
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,696
Click, it going that way.

154
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,822
Boom! That way.

155
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,657
Click here and go this way.

156
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,119
So, basically, I started learning how to
put myself in a position to get the ball.

157
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,663
[COMMENTATOR] <i>Rebound,</i>
<i>kept alive by Rodman, and...</i>

158
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,750
I was pretty much like that rash
on players,

159
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,003
that rash you can't
never get rid of, right?

160
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,177
Dennis Rodman was the fuck-up person.
He just fucks everything up.

161
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,057
He's a pest.
Shutting down whoever he wanted to.

162
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,059
It was always a challenge.

163
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,023
He was one of them players that had
changed the game just by his presence.

164
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,694
[DALY] You talk about coach's dreams,
there aren't many players like him.

165
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,573
Couldn't be a player I'm more proud of
and proud to be associated with.

166
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,159
He had a great relationship
with Chuck Daly.

167
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,078
<i>Chuck was the only person
that understood him.</i>

168
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,455
Let's say your guy stops side,

169
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,082
you're in here,
you're defense, lock him here.

170
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,918
[MALONE] I remember one time,
I was working with Dennis,

171
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,714
and then Chuck called me over,
and he said, "Just leave him alone."

172
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,800
You don't put a saddle on a mustang."

173
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,932
[INTERVIEWER] Were you considered
a troublemaker on the court in college?

174
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,977
- Did you have that reputation?
- No. I built that in Detroit.

175
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,646
There's no disputing that Detroit

176
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,398
is one of the most physical teams
in the NBA,

177
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,359
and it's all part of their strategy

178
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,778
to take their opponents
out of their rhythm.

179
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,740
[THORN] The Detroit Pistons
were the epitome

180
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:04,205
of the physical, tough,
hard-nosed brand of half-court basketball.

181
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:11,253
They had big strong guys in Laimbeer,
Mahorn, Rodman, Salley.

182
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,841
They had a great defensive player
in Joe Dumars, they had Isiah Thomas.

183
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,637
[INTERVIEWER] Were they threatening
the safety of the league's top players?

184
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,848
I don't think they cared. [CHUCKLES]

you could do anything you want.

189
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,451
[SCOFFS] Compared to today,
30 years ago, shit.

190
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,330
Back then, you could just sit there
and just literally beat people up

191
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,667
and get away with it
without a technical or anything.

194
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,303
[SALLEY] Rick Mahorn taught me
how to elbow and said,

195
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,305
"If you hit somebody, do it on purpose.

196
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,351
Don't get a cheap foul. That's stupid.
If you're gonna hit him, hit him."

197
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,438
They acquired the moniker "The Bad Boys."

198
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:16,277
They played a tough, intimidating style,
and a lot of people didn't like it

199
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,196
'cause it was getting away
from the beauty of basketball.

[COMMENTATOR] <i>Bird and Laimbeer go at it.</i>

201
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,244
We weren't "the league's favorite."
We weren't the...

202
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:29,915
We weren't the pretty team that had got
invited to the Lakers' and Celtics' party.

203
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,170
When we showed up, it was almost like
we were crashing their party.

204
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,214
This is the way the game of basketball
was played at the time.

205
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,301
These guys on the other side
may not be as talented,

206
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,136
but when you do come into Detroit,

207
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,513
you gonna get your ass whooped.

We started feeding into it.
Next thing you know, we starting to win.

211
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,614
[KREMER] The Pistons
had overtaken the Celtics

212
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,908
as kings of the Eastern Conference,

213
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:08,370
and they're rolling along just as
the Bulls are really starting to emerge.

214
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,709
[PAXSON] In '86-'87, when Jerry Krause
made a head coaching hire,

215
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,463
I think we all felt that
we needed something different.

216
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,007
This speaks to Jerry's strengths.

217
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,093
He identified a young Doug Collins,

218
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:28,390
who he felt would bring an energy
and enthusiasm that a young team needed.

219
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,018
This is a game
that we need to have high energy.

We have a high energy level.
We win tonight, we got tomorrow off,

[PAXSON] Doug's energy on the sideline
was unparalleled.

231
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,266
He'd walk off the floor of a game,
and he would be drenched in sweat.

I mean, he just...
He looked like he played.

we get some rest.

He was a vicious rebounder,
brought a lot of toughness.

247
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,603
John Paxson was on that team,
Dave Corzine.

we went to Madison Square Garden.

there was this little team in Detroit

[MALONE] This is what
the "Jordan Rules" were:

484
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,215
On the wings, we're going to push him
to the elbow,

485

and we're not gonna let him
drive to the baseline.

NUMBER TWO: When he's on top,
we're going to influence him to his left.

487
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,062
When he got the ball in the low post,
we were going to trap him from the top.

488

That's the "Jordan Rules,"
and it was that simple.

[INTERVIEWER] What happens
when he does make the baseline?

490
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,905
That's when Laimbeer and Mahorn would
go up and knock him down to the ground.

491
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,243
As soon as he steps in the paint...

But I felt like the structure we had, with

[RODMAN] Y'all like Chicago?

727
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,737
- Yes, it's awesome.
- [WOMAN] We love it.

728
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,364
- You need to come to Nashville sometime.
- No, hell no.

[MAN CHUCKLES]

731
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:54,303
Two months ago, Scottie Pippen said
he would never play for the Bulls again.

732
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:58,474
But he softened his stance, saying he was
looking forward to returning to the team.

733
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,893
So the question became
when would he come back?

734
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,737
[INTERVIEWER] What made you
change your mind?

735
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,441
- Change my mind about coming to play?
- [INTERVIEWER] Yeah.

736
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,362
I just... I knew that it was
probably going to come down

737
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:15,324
to me and the team
trying to play hardball,

738
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,701
and I would lose in that situation

739
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,580
because they would start to fine me,
probably, so, uh...

740
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,877
I wasn't going to let them benefit
in that way.

741
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:34,218
Bottom line is, uh, I was willing
to accept a trade if they did it.

742
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,679
And I knew they wasn't going to do it.

752
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,003
Hey, Dennis...

753
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,090
Let me know when Oakley's gonna
set a back screen on me.

754
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,610
- He set that screen right there so he...
- Yeah.

755
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,469
You want me to open up and just hold him?

756
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,681
If you have to switch out, switch out.

757
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,951
I can stop Houston right there,
Oak's gotta turn around,

758
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,615
- I can stop him as you catch up.
- When the clock is running down,

He was, "Hey, Michael, it's me and you.
We got this."

762
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,324

that's when they lost him.
