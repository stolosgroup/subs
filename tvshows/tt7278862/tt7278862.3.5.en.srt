00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:50,745
Mamma!

6
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:58,785
Mamma!

7
00:01:26,824 --> 00:01:27,865
Mamma!

8
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:29,944
MY BODY IS MINE

9
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:38,425
FROM NOW ON WE DECIDE

10
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:50,145
My brother?
I haven't seen him in two months.

11
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,944
I don't know where he is.
What do you want from me?

12
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:54,464
Mamma!

13
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:05,304
Don't ever let go of my hand,
is that clear?

14
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:24,144
EPISODE 5 - TERROR

15
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:27,144
You know when a man says:
"You're mine"?

16
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:28,625
Yeah!

17
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:31,824
You know when we reply:
"Yeah, I'm yours"?

18
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,104
Yeah!

19
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:37,745
We are both telling the absolute truth:
we are men's property.

20
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:44,465
When we dare to disobey their rules,
they beat us, they kill us!

21
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:48,225
The time has come to put an end to it.

22
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:52,025
Never again will we reply:
"Yes, I am yours."

23
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:57,225
Let's learn to be completely
and utterly our own.

24
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:03,305
Our bodies are ours, our heads are ours!

25
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,745
You are yours, shout it out!

26
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:10,424
I am mine!

27
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,984
I have the power!

28
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:16,664
I am mine and I have the power!

29
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:20,705
To the male comrades
who are here today,

30
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,945
I want to say, very politely...

31
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:25,624
Go away!

32
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,265
The square is ours!

33
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:31,184
Out! The square is ours!

34
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:32,705
Go away!

35
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,304
WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT

36
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:43,544
- Stop, it's unacceptable!
- We're here to help you.

37
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:53,385
Tremble in fear, the witches are here!

38
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,265
Tremble in fear, the witches are here!

39
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:03,585
Don't run away again!

40
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:06,225
Don't you run away again.

41
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:07,825
Sit down for a moment.

42
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,265
Hold Elsa.

43
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:23,585
Let's go.

44
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,465
You don't take two small children
to a demonstration!

45
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,705
Mariarosa was supposed to come too.

46
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:40,304
I wanted her to see Dede and Elsa
but she missed her train.

47
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,905
Forget about my sister!

48
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,945
She's the last person you can count on.

49
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,664
Anyway, there were other kids.

50
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:49,984
Everyone takes their kids
to demonstrations.

51
00:05:50,064 --> 00:05:53,984
If everyone does something stupid,
it's still stupid.

52
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:55,864
You were even sick.

53
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:00,544
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

54
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:03,225
It's very true.

55
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,145
Anyway, that's enough,

56
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:10,265
I'll go where I want
and take my daughters where I want.

57
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:13,825
I'm not your third daughter and
you're neither my father nor my boss.

58
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:16,064
But I am Dede and Elsa's father!

59
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,504
You hear me?

60
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:35,785
And I'm also your husband.

61
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,984
I worry because I care about you.

62
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:42,225
You had so many interests once.

63
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:47,104
You're not writing novels,
or for the papers, nothing.

64
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:50,304
You read,
but it's only superficial reading.

65
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:55,265
You risk losing yourself.

66
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:03,345
WE SPIT ON HEGEL - THE CLITORAL
WOMAN AND THE VAGINAL WOMAN

67
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:07,025
You don't care about
my reading and my work.

68
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:11,705
You just want me to be
an affectionate mother and a wife.

69
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:16,145
You're already boring

70
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:20,184
and now you want to teach me
what to read, what to risk.

71
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:25,265
You get it.

72
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,184
Hello?

73
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,825
Yes, she's here.

74
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:35,385
It's for you!

75
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,504
Go and check on the pasta.

76
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,785
I'm going.

77
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,785
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Lenù, it's Carmela.</i>

78
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:50,465
- Carmela, how are you?
- Not good, Lenù.

79
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,064
That's why I called. They killed Gino.

80
00:07:57,705 --> 00:07:59,504
How did it happen?

81
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:02,064
They shot him at the pharmacy.

82
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:04,864
The police came to the gas pump.

83
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:08,064
They were following leads,
they think Pasquale's involved.

84
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:10,025
But I haven't seen him in months.

85
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:13,744
<i>- Has he come to see you?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

86
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:16,744
Why?

87
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,864
A while back he asked
for your phone number and address.

88
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,705
If you know anything, tell me.

89
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,825
I don't know anything, I swear.

90
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,024
You think I wouldn't tell you?

91
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:35,585
<i>In the neighborhood it's war,</i>
<i>comrades gotta watch their backs.</i>

92
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,465
The fascists even
threatened me and my husband.

93
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:42,065
They say that Pasquale set fire
to the MSI branch office

94
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:43,705
and the Solaras' supermarket.

95
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:46,425
And what do you think?

96
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,104
I'm scared.

97
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,945
Pasquale is at the top
of the fascists' list.

98
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,585
I'm scared they'll kill him.

99
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,945
- Have you asked the police for help?
- No.

100
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:58,825
They're more fascist than the fascists.

101
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,185
If you hear anything, please call me.

102
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:04,345
Sure.

103
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,104
Say hello to your husband.

104
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,784
And give the girls a kiss from me.

105
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:11,984
Take care.

106
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:27,744
Hello?

107
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,065
It's me.

108
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,545
Lenù, what's up?

109
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:34,665
Carmela called me.

110
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:37,945
<i>- She told me they killed Gino.</i>
<i>- I heard.</i>

111
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:41,104
You know they pinned it on Pasquale?

112
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:43,825
Of course they took it out on Pasquale.

113
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:47,945
I'm sure it wasn't him,
but even if it was, I'm on his side.

114
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:50,225
What?

115
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:52,305
<i>The cops should take it out</i>
<i>on the dead guy,</i>

116
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,305
he only ever did bad things.

117
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,585
Not on a communist worker.

118
00:09:58,185 --> 00:10:00,504
Lila, Carmela's beside herself.

119
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:03,904
<i>She said the fascists</i>
<i>want to see Pasquale dead,</i>

120
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:06,705
<i>they blame him for torching</i>
<i>the Solaras' supermarket.</i>

121
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:09,585
Carmela's always beside herself.

122
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,305
But why did she call you?

123
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:15,585
Pasquale needed my advice

124
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,904
and asked for my number.

125
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,945
Anyway, let's change the subject.

126
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,305
I would have called you.

127
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,345
I wanted to ask you...

128
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:32,024
Can I leave Gennaro with you
until school starts?

129
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,624
Why?

130
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,305
I have to work.

131
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:41,864
I have to take the girls to the beach.

132
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,784
Can't you take him too?

133
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:46,425
I'm going to Viareggio.

134
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:49,665
I hardly know the boy,
only if you come too.

135
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:53,104
You promised you'd look after him.

136
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:55,784
If you were ill.

137
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,705
Who says I'm not ill?

138
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:00,144
Are you ill?

139
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:02,665
No.

140
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,784
Why not leave him
with Stefano or your mother?

141
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:07,744
Will you do me this favor or not?

142
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,104
All right.

143
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:13,744
Bring him to me.

144
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:15,864
Enzo will bring him.

145
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,504
Thank you, take care.

146
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:27,984
Are you coming to eat?

147
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,904
The Brescia bombing...

148
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:41,825
- Pietro!
- What is it?

149
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:45,665
<i>Eight people have been killed</i>
<i>and over a hundred wounded.</i>

150
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:49,825
<i>Here is a dramatic recording</i>
<i>of the moment of the attack</i>

151
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:52,904
<i>and the ensuing moments</i>
<i>in Piazza della Loggia.</i>

152
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:57,104
Stay calm!

153
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:58,425
Stay calm!

154
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:02,384
Do not leave the square!

155
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:06,305
The police are cordoning off the square.

156
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,504
Do not leave the square!

157
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:13,104
Do not leave the square!

158
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,104
Workers!

159
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:18,225
Do not leave the square!

160
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,024
The police!

161
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:37,384
Good morning.

162
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,024
Does Elena Greco live here?

163
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,705
Yes.

164
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,264
Can you tell her Pasquale
and Nadia are here?

165
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:47,104
Elena!

166
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:49,504
Pasquale and Nadia are here.

167
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,864
Come in.

168
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:18,345
Hi.

169
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,945
I nearly didn't recognize you.

170
00:13:24,024 --> 00:13:25,104
Hi, Nadia.

171
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:30,825
What are you doing here?

172
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,384
Traveling.

173
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,744
Come in.

174
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:44,144
- Nice to meet you, I'm Pietro.
- Sorry, I didn't introduce you.

175
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,504
This is Pietro.

176
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,705
- Hi, Pietro.
- Hi.

177
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,585
Have you come for the demonstration?

178
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,225
Demonstrations are just a waste of time.

179
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:20,305
Have you come from Naples?

180
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:23,784
No, we were in the area.

181
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,185
Are you going back?

182
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,945
No.

183
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:36,024
So tell me, how are you?

184
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:40,864
Good. We're...

185
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:44,624
Yes.

186
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:52,065
Dede, come here.
These are two friends of mine.

187
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:54,345
She's Nadia and he's Pasquale.

188
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,825
Pasquale and I have been friends
since we were little.

189
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:01,585
- Weren't there two?
- One's sleeping upstairs.

190
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,104
Upstairs...

191
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:07,904
<i>- In a terrorist's pocket...</i>
<i>- Leave it!</i>

192
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,825
..was found a map of the locations...

193
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,864
Turn it down.

194
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:15,024
I haven't seen you for ages
and we're going to watch TV?

195
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:18,744
The roadblocks have been reinforced.

196
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:22,545
<i>Concerning the traffic flow</i>
<i>for the summer exodus,</i>

197
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:26,384
<i>the authorities anticipate</i>
<i>traffic delays exiting the cities</i>

198
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:29,024
<i>on all major highways</i>
<i>and ask citizens...</i>

199
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,065
Turn it off.

200
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:38,024
We were about to eat.

201
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,624
Would you like to eat with us?

202
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,384
Yes?

203
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:54,104
- Shall I put on the pasta?
- Yes, please.

204
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,425
Dede, go and wash your hands.

205
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:03,784
I'll go and help Elena.

206
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:10,225
Dede!

207
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:12,784
Come here.

208
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:19,264
What kind of name is Dede?

209
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:23,784
Cat got your tongue?

210
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:26,705
Well?

211
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:29,225
Will you tell me?

212
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:31,665
Are you scared of me?

213
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:33,784
Is it my beard?

214
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:36,945
Don't be scared, I'm good.

215
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:41,504
And if anyone tells you I'm bad,

216
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:44,904
you gotta say: "No, I met him.

217
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:47,665
He's good."

218
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,665
What did you say to her?

219
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:59,825
I convinced her to wash her hands.

220
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:03,144
Is there any wine?

221
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:04,865
I'll go get it.

222
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:06,865
Is the kitchen here?

223
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:07,984
Yes.

224
00:17:11,784 --> 00:17:14,024
Nadia, do you want something to eat?

225
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:15,625
No, I don't feel like it.

226
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:16,744
Sure?

227
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:18,584
Sit down.

228
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:23,945
There was no wine, I got a beer.

229
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:33,264
- Don't you drink?
- We never drink at lunch.

230
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:45,625
Does she understand Neapolitan?

231
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,744
I couldn't get her
to tell me why you call her Dede.

232
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,665
I don't know if she understands it,
but she doesn't speak it.

233
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:56,824
Don't you mind?

234
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:58,625
No.

235
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:05,744
So why don't you
come to Naples anymore?

236
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:10,105
You don't see anyone anymore,
not even your friend.

237
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:12,385
I'll come.

238
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:16,584
Lila and I speak a lot,
we spend a fortune on phone calls.

239
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,744
Do you ever see her?

240
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:21,665
Occasionally.

241
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,064
How's Armando?

242
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:35,385
We don't speak anymore.

243
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:41,544
All I know is
his wife left with the kid.

244
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:43,865
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:45,584
Why are you sorry?

246
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:47,744
She was right to do it.

247
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:53,304
This is a beautiful house.

248
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,264
It's like a castle.

249
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:00,425
Who lives here?

250
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,064
It's a quiet house.

251
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:06,584
It's a quiet area for posh people, right?

252
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,105
Everyone who lives here works.

253
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:13,705
And what do they do?
Lawyers, architects?

254
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:15,225
Dentists?

255
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,264
Aristocrats?

256
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,784
- Is this house yours?
- No, we're renting.

257
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:22,504
Renting.

258
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,425
Anyway it's two stories.

259
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:28,225
I'm taking a rest now...

260
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,465
I've worked.

261
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:41,945
Give me your hand.

262
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,865
Feel how rough my hands are, professor.

263
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,984
If these hands weren't like this,

264
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,344
not even a chair could exist.

265
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:04,105
A car, a building.

266
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,465
Not even you.

267
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:14,304
If we workers suddenly stopped working,

268
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,584
everything would stop.

269
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:20,304
The sky would fall in,
the earth would leap into the sky,

270
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:23,465
the plants would take over the cities.

271
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:27,225
The Arno would flood your houses again

272
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:30,304
and only those who've
always worked could survive.

273
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:32,865
Whereas you,

274
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,824
with all your books,

275
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:38,905
the dogs would eat you.

276
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:43,185
That's so old!

277
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:45,984
I've heard you say
these things a thousand times.

278
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:49,425
Here's the pasta.

279
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,584
Give it to me.

280
00:21:12,225 --> 00:21:13,425
For you.

281
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,024
It's really good.

282
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,105
Thank you.

283
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:42,105
Bon appétit.

284
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:43,225
Thanks.

285
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:47,665
- What's wrong?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

286
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,264
Let's go.

287
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,625
We're going to the bathroom.

288
00:21:57,544 --> 00:21:58,945
She really loves you.

289
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:02,385
She's little.

290
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:06,425
When she grows up
she won't love you anymore.

291
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:09,824
No, I hope she will
when she's grown up, too.

292
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:12,385
Who are they?

293
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:17,385
Friends of Mamma's.

294
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,304
My mother spoke about you all the time.

295
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,865
You were her student, but you seemed
more like a daughter than me.

296
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:28,425
I hated you.

297
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:31,625
Also because you stole Nino from me.

298
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,064
He didn't leave you for me.

299
00:22:37,705 --> 00:22:39,584
Who cares,

300
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:42,064
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

301
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:49,705
When I was a girl
I wanted to be like you.

302
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,625
Why?

303
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:56,905
You think it's nice
being born with everything set out?

304
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:03,264
Well, you don't have to work as hard.

305
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:05,705
You're wrong.

306
00:23:07,784 --> 00:23:09,984
It seems like it's all been done for you

307
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:12,465
and you don't have
a good reason to work.

308
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,504
You feel guilty for what you are,
that you don't deserve it.

309
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,705
Better than feeling guilty
because you failed.

310
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:22,425
Is that what Lila says?

311
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,385
No.

312
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,385
I prefer her to you.

313
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,344
You're two pieces of shit
and will always be.

314
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:36,905
But you act friendly,

315
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,625
Lila doesn't.

316
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:40,344
- Let's go take a shower.
- I don't want to.

317
00:23:40,824 --> 00:23:42,264
You don't want to?

318
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:51,064
Let's go.

319
00:23:58,665 --> 00:23:59,784
Is it this way?

320
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:08,225
Now you'll explain who those two are.

321
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:13,984
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

322
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,145
You don't know?

323
00:24:17,344 --> 00:24:18,784
You don't know...

324
00:24:32,865 --> 00:24:35,304
<i>Even though Nadia</i>
<i>had mortally offended me,</i>

325
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:38,824
<i>I felt Pasquale was fond of me</i>
<i>but he wasn't able to express it.</i>

326
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,625
In fact, he was odious.

327
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:45,225
<i>The fear Pietro might snap</i>
<i>and they'd fight, muzzled me.</i>

328
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:50,225
<i>So, as everything precipitated,</i>
<i>Pietro and I remained silent.</i>

329
00:24:56,784 --> 00:24:58,105
Remember this song?

330
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:24,945
Professor, you need to face facts.

331
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,625
You're all dead and you don't know it.

332
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,584
Everything about you is dead.

333
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:33,465
The way you live, how you speak.

334
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:38,544
Your conviction that you're intelligent,
democratic and on the left.

335
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,905
But how can I explain this
to someone who's dead?

336
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:49,784
Pity, it's cold.

337
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,185
Folks, we'll get out of your hair.

338
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:16,625
Take care, Signora Airota.

339
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,105
I wanted a chat with Lenù,

340
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:24,185
but maybe Lenù wasn't at home.

341
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:27,945
Or time's passed and people change.

342
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,784
And we had nothing to say
to each other anymore.

343
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:34,304
See you.

344
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:36,504
Bye, Dede.

345
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:37,865
Professor...

346
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:53,465
I never want those two
in my house again.

347
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:57,465
Someone who talks like that
about intellectual work

348
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:00,024
is a fascist, even if he doesn't know it.

349
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:04,304
She's a type I know all too well.

350
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:06,784
There's nothing in her head.

351
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:09,625
What are you saying?

352
00:27:11,705 --> 00:27:14,865
You're talking about people
and things you don't know.

353
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:20,705
Everything you are
you owe to your parents.

354
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:25,705
It's easy, you just say Airota
and all the doors open to you.

355
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:34,665
You need to shut up.

356
00:27:41,544 --> 00:27:45,425
<i>I wasn't hurt by that slap,</i>
<i>I'd already had so many.</i>

357
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,705
<i>I wasn't that different</i>
<i>from the neighborhood women,</i>

358
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:53,425
<i>but Pietro had never slapped anyone</i>
<i>or been slapped.</i>

359
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:06,544
Meanwhile, the hot weather arrived,

360
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,945
and the news of terrorist acts

361
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:12,665
<i>and the alarm that spread throughout</i>
<i>the country really affected me.</i>

362
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:16,465
Is this any time to go away?

363
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:17,465
Yes.

364
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,385
What changes?

365
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:27,625
With everything that's going on,
it's like we're at war.

366
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,945
And we go to Viareggio?

367
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:32,984
If we stay in Florence, what can we do?

368
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:35,984
Here they are, they've arrived.

369
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:37,784
Come, Dede.

370
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,705
Gennarino, now remember
what Mamma said.

371
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:45,105
What is this, the woods?

372
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:49,705
- Hi!
- Lenù!

373
00:29:50,865 --> 00:29:52,465
- How are you?
- Well, you?

374
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:53,865
Everything's fine.

375
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:56,185
- Hi!
- You're not going to greet Aunty Lenù?

376
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:57,385
Good morning.

377
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,665
He wants to shake hands!

378
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,504
It's normal, he doesn't remember.

379
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:04,865
Come in.

380
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:11,425
- Is all this stuff yours?
- No, we're only renting an apartment.

381
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:12,865
Here we are!

382
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,984
- Hi!
- I'm Pietro, it's a pleasure.

383
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,744
Enzo, the pleasure's mine.

384
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:20,544
- The trip?
- Fine, there wasn't much traffic.

385
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:23,225
Gennarino! My pleasure.

386
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,304
This is Dede.

387
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,544
Let's go.

388
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:37,504
- I'll stay for a bit then set off again.
- No, stay overnight.

389
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:42,145
We've prepared the beds and dinner,
go back tomorrow.

390
00:30:42,665 --> 00:30:44,504
I don't want to put you out.

391
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:50,105
Remember what Mamma said?

392
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:53,584
Signora Elena, this is for Dede
and this is for Elsa.

393
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:54,665
Thank you!

394
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:56,784
Here.

395
00:30:56,865 --> 00:30:59,945
Actually, my name's Adele
like my grandma.

396
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,185
That's my sister Elsa,
like Elsa Morante.

397
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:07,385
We gather these files,
information, in the system.

398
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:11,905
And then the system manages
the accounts, payroll, suppliers' orders.

399
00:31:11,984 --> 00:31:15,024
- How does the system work?
- With perforated cards.

400
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:16,784
Cards that we make holes in.

401
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:20,784
Lila and I prepare the system
to perform complex operations.

402
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,744
- And if it makes a mistake?
- What do you mean?

403
00:31:23,824 --> 00:31:25,145
The computer.

404
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:28,665
No way, it doesn't make mistakes.

405
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:31,865
If it goes wrong,
then Lila and I have made a mistake.

406
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:34,225
When machines replace men,

407
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:37,185
many jobs will be lost.

408
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:40,105
At Fiat, robots already do the welding.

409
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:42,145
Lila says it will be a good thing,

410
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:45,865
for her humiliating jobs
that frazzle you must disappear.

411
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:50,544
If Lila is so clever,
why is she your helper?

412
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:54,385
What can I say?
We're still in a world of male bosses.

413
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,024
Papa, can you bring me some water?

414
00:31:59,105 --> 00:32:00,385
Dede's woken up.

415
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:02,264
She's calling you, go.

416
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:06,625
We're in a world of male bosses...

417
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,344
- I'm off.
- Bye, Pietro

418
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:11,705
- Good night, thank you.
- Good night.

419
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,984
I like the professor.

420
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:25,304
Tonight he spoke more than usual,
he must like you.

421
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:27,024
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

422
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:48,264
Tell me the truth.

423
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:53,544
Why was Lila in a rush
to send me Gennaro?

424
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:57,465
- What's going on?
- Lenù, nothing's going on.

425
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:03,024
We work a lot and school's over,
he has nothing to do.

426
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:06,024
Lila thought he'd be better off with you.

427
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:08,544
- If it's a problem, I'll take him back.
- No.

428
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:15,105
I heard from Carmela,
she told me about Gino.

429
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:19,544
She's very worried about Pasquale.

430
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:23,625
She says he's in serious trouble
and the fascists want to kill him.

431
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:27,225
The fascists want to kill everyone
who doesn't think like them,

432
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:28,865
including me.

433
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,984
Pasquale came by.

434
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:37,145
He was strange, he didn't seem himself.

435
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:40,185
I didn't really understand
what he wanted.

436
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:44,304
He didn't tell me where he'd been,
where he was going.

437
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:45,905
Do you know anything?

438
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,504
You think we speak? He never calls me.

439
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:52,344
As I said, all we think about is work.

440
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:54,665
We don't see anyone
and it suits us just fine.

441
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:58,304
We mind our own business,
we don't bother about others.

442
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:00,504
Lila has other things on her mind.

443
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:03,304
What things?

444
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,865
She didn't tell you about Michele Solara?

445
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:07,464
Does she have problems
with the Solaras?

446
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,864
No, the opposite.

447
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:12,665
He wants to take the system
and use it for all his businesses

448
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,784
and he wants Lila
as the head of technology.

449
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:17,545
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

450
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:22,145
She doesn't want to disturb you,
you have your own life.

451
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:29,505
If she says yes this time,
it would be a huge leap for her

452
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,824
and a lucky break for both of us.

453
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:35,185
Together we'd make 750,000 a month.

454
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:37,904
And Lila?

455
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:39,985
She has to give her answer
in September.

456
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:41,625
What's she going to do?

457
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,665
Have you ever known in advance
what's in her head?

458
00:34:45,944 --> 00:34:46,944
No.

459
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,505
What do you think she should do?

460
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:52,824
I think what she thinks.

461
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:54,585
Even when you don't agree?

462
00:34:56,464 --> 00:34:57,784
Even then.

463
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,824
I don't know.

464
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:09,744
Lila working with the Solaras?

465
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:12,784
What's behind it?

466
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,824
Let's turn in, I'm tired.

467
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:52,744
Enzù, tell me the truth.

468
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,705
That is the truth.

469
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,904
Tell me the truth.

470
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:13,665
<i>What Enzo told me</i>
<i>thrust me back into that world</i>

471
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:17,665
<i>I thought was moving away</i>
<i>and yet it was still there.</i>

472
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:27,384
<i>Gennarino, there's hot cornetti ,</i>
<i>I'll give you one.</i>

473
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:29,744
- He already had breakfast.
- For a snack.

474
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:33,344
- Come on, let's go.
- I want the cornetto.

475
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,304
See? He wants one.

476
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:36,824
Go get it.

477
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:39,944
Tell them I said it's okay.

478
00:36:42,864 --> 00:36:44,625
You want a coffee?

479
00:36:46,384 --> 00:36:49,264
You said no when I offered you
200,000 lire a month

480
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:51,464
to develop new ideas for me.

481
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:55,625
You said no to doing the books
for the new Vomero store.

482
00:36:56,344 --> 00:37:00,185
I found you a job as secretary
to an important politician.

483
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:03,105
But you know I'm stubborn,
I won't give up.

484
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:06,185
You know where I work?

485
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:09,264
At IBM. You know what it is?

486
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,304
They hired Enzo too.

487
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:16,744
They took us because we studied,
because we're smart.

488
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:18,944
How much do you earn?

489
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,944
Not much, but it's clean money.

490
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,505
- Thank you, Michele.
- Let's go.

491
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:28,904
I'm stubborn, you know it.

492
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:33,264
- I'll wait for you for eternity.
- So, wait!

493
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:35,985
- Just call and I'll run.
- Thanks again!

494
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:40,585
One day something odd happened.

495
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:44,185
<i>Gennarino disappeared,</i>
<i>he was nowhere to be found.</i>

496
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,264
Kids!

497
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:48,784
Kids!

498
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:52,384
- Have you seen Gennarino?
- No, I'm sorry.

499
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:53,985
We haven't seen him.

500
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:58,985
Marinella!
Have you seen Gennarino? My boy!

501
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:01,145
Have you seen Gennarino?

502
00:38:02,424 --> 00:38:04,264
Have you seen Gennarino?

503
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:06,824
Have you seen Gennarino?

504
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,665
Gennaro!

505
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,344
Where the fuck were you?

506
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,065
Where were you?

507
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:50,545
I've been here all the time.

508
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:10,944
That's enough now, tell me.

509
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:12,944
Tell me the truth.

510
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:19,585
You won't solve anything like this.

511
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:21,625
I said tell me. What happened?

512
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,065
I wanted to be by myself.

513
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:26,464
What happened?

514
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,665
I wanted to be by myself.

515
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,105
That's not true!

516
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,464
Lila, will you calm down?

517
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:35,944
I'll go to that asshole
and show him what for!

518
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:38,025
- Where are you going?
- Let go of me!

519
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:39,464
Calm down!

520
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,625
Lila!

521
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:43,744
- I'll kill him!
- Calm down!

522
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:45,505
You're not going.

523
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:51,025
If you stay here nice and calm, I'll go.

524
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:04,784
Stay here.

525
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:14,065
<i>Lila feared it was Michele's way</i>
<i>of getting to her.</i>

526
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:20,025
<i>She felt that Gennarino kept quiet</i>
<i>as he'd bonded with Michele Solara.</i>

527
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:22,625
<i>Gennarino trusted him</i>
<i>more than his mother.</i>

528
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:25,864
Michele, was it you?

529
00:40:25,944 --> 00:40:28,585
You crazy?
Dunno what you're talking about.

530
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:32,065
Gennarino's like my son,
I'll kill anyone who touches him.

531
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,545
Rather...

532
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:43,384
Why don't you let Lila work with me?
She's very intelligent.

533
00:40:44,864 --> 00:40:48,464
Why don't you come, too?
I know you work for IBM.

534
00:40:48,545 --> 00:40:50,744
I'm opening a data processing company.

535
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:53,944
Think about it.

536
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:57,344
I need someone like you.

537
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:02,344
<i>After all, things were good</i>
<i>between Enzo and Lila,</i>

538
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,585
even though she was always on the go

539
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:08,585
<i>and he couldn't swallow the fact</i>
<i>Lila was still married to Stefano.</i>

540
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:13,344
Now there's divorce, it doesn't
make sense to stay married to him.

541
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,264
I couldn't care less.

542
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:21,784
Maybe Stefano does.

543
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:23,985
He wouldn't even know there's divorce.

544
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:27,264
I don't want to waste time.

545
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,545
What do I care if I stay married to him?

546
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,824
I'm with you,

547
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:42,505
I sleep with you.

548
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:44,824
That's the fact of the matter.

549
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:54,145
But maybe we could get married.

550
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:04,985
But aren't we already fine like this?

551
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:08,105
If we get fed up,
each can go their own way.

552
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,304
What are you doing here at this hour?

553
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:37,065
I was looking for the bathroom.

554
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:40,625
It's over there.

555
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:42,424
Thank you, good night.

556
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:44,185
Night.

557
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:52,705
Good morning, Lenù.

558
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:54,065
Good morning.

559
00:42:58,665 --> 00:42:59,625
I made coffee.

560
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:01,625
Thank you.

561
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:24,985
Times change.

562
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:27,904
We want to live peacefully too,

563
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:30,424
without worrying about
making ends meet.

564
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:37,824
And if he wants to take her from you?

565
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:40,744
I'll kill him.

566
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:43,545
But he doesn't want that.

567
00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:46,424
He has a mistress
and everyone knows who she is.

568
00:43:47,304 --> 00:43:48,424
Who is she?

569
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:49,744
Marisa.

570
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:52,904
He got her pregnant again.

571
00:43:55,185 --> 00:43:57,145
Marisa Sarratore?

572
00:43:57,225 --> 00:43:58,665
Alfonso's wife.

573
00:44:02,545 --> 00:44:03,784
And Alfonso?

574
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:06,384
Alfonso couldn't care less.

575
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,384
They say he's a faggot.

576
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:23,304
Anyway, thank you,
a vacation will do Gennarino good.

577
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:26,824
The doctor said the sea air
is good for tonsils.

578
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,185
I better go, or I'll get back too late.

579
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,545
- Hello?
- Lila.

580
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:56,065
- What is it at this hour?
- Why did you send Gennarino here?

581
00:44:56,145 --> 00:44:58,025
Are you worried about him?

582
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:01,464
- You didn't tell me he disappeared.
- Why would I?

583
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:04,145
In your life
the Solaras matter less than zero.

584
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:08,225
You want to be nice? Take Gennarino
to get some sun, to swim.

585
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:10,545
<i>- I gotta go.</i>
<i>- No, explain it to me.</i>

586
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,185
That's enough, take care.

587
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:13,705
Fuck you!

588
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:20,784
<i>The more I tried</i>
<i>to draw her into the open,</i>

589
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:23,464
<i>the more she took refuge</i>
<i>in the shadows,</i>

590
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:26,665
<i>like a full moon</i>
<i>when it crouches behind the woods</i>

591
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:28,864
and the branches scribble on its face.

592
00:45:31,824 --> 00:45:34,424
Whereas I had become a vacationer,

593
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:37,585
<i>with a house at the beach</i>
<i>and three children,</i>

594
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:39,545
a front-row umbrella,

595
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:43,545
<i>menthol cigarettes</i>
<i>and the sun making me blonder.</i>

596
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,985
Elena!

597
00:45:48,424 --> 00:45:50,464
Wasn't it called Soccavo,
the factory where Lila worked?

598
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:52,545
Yes, why?

599
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,185
Come here a minute.

600
00:45:54,264 --> 00:45:55,505
Dede!

601
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:57,344
Get out of the water!

602
00:46:03,424 --> 00:46:07,665
There's an article by Nino Sarratore
that says they killed the owner.

603
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:11,705
GANG WAR RAGES ON

604
00:46:12,464 --> 00:46:13,665
Is it him?

605
00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:19,105
I have to make a call.

606
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:23,304
Go on.

607
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:29,424
You're not as fast!

608
00:46:30,944 --> 00:46:33,904
Mamma, can we go to the tree?

609
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:37,944
Yes, but don't go too far,
I need to see you.

610
00:47:37,384 --> 00:47:38,585
Hello?

611
00:47:38,665 --> 00:47:40,225
<i>- It's me.</i>
<i>- Lenù.</i>

612
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:42,665
Everything okay with Gennarino?

613
00:47:43,424 --> 00:47:44,705
Yes, everything's fine.

614
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:47,705
Did you see they killed Bruno Soccavo?

615
00:47:49,145 --> 00:47:50,744
I didn't know about it.

616
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:54,744
<i>- Haven't you read the papers?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

617
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:57,344
They burst into the factory and shot him.

618
00:47:58,105 --> 00:47:59,864
What horrible news.

619
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:04,185
Call someone,

620
00:48:04,264 --> 00:48:06,424
find out what happened.

621
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:10,545
<i>And see if there's someone</i>
<i>to send a telegram to.</i>

622
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,904
What telegram?

623
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:14,864
<i>I'm out of touch</i>
<i>with the factory people.</i>

624
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:18,344
Nino wrote
that it was a political murder.

625
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:19,784
Political how?

626
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:23,384
It woulda been for other stuff, you get
killed here for a thousand reasons.

627
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:26,304
<i>Cheating, misdeeds,</i>
<i>one glance too many.</i>

628
00:48:26,384 --> 00:48:28,705
Put Gennaro on, I'll say hello.

629
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,625
No, I'm at the café, he's playing.

630
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:35,904
- So, we'll speak later?
- Bye.

631
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:24,145
- Have you seen Dede and Gennaro?
- No.

632
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:51,105
Dede!

633
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,519
It's nothing bad, in the neighborhood
all the girls want to see it.

634
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,639
If you're curious,
you need to satisfy it.

635
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,680
Dede!

636
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:55,680
Come here!

637
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,880
Are you crazy?
I've been looking everywhere!

638
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
And you're older, too.

639
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:10,599
What were you doing?

640
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,959
We weren't doing anything.

641
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:15,919
Not doing anything...
that stuff isn't for kids, okay?

642
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:36,559
You're mean, Mamma.
