00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,274
Before leaving the city for good,

4
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:30,634
<i>I decided to go and see Mrs. Galiani.</i>
<i>I called her.</i>

5
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:36,234
<i>She was unsurprised and invited me</i>
<i>over for the following morning, adding:</i>

6
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:38,715
"Why don't you bring your friend?"

7
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:45,355
<i>That request annoyed me,</i>
<i>I hoped Lila would decline it.</i>

8
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:48,554
- You sure I should come?
- She invited you too.

9
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:53,234
<i>Instead she pulled a long face</i>
<i>and said: "All right, I'll go with you."</i>

10
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:56,355
It's you.

11
00:00:58,035 --> 00:01:01,554
- We're here to see your mother.
- She's not here.

12
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,915
She'll be back later.

13
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:09,835
Come in here, if you like.

14
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,195
She's in her underpants.

15
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:18,674
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:20,075
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:23,475
We have an appointment
with Mrs. Galiani.

18
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:28,874
- Have you recovered?
- Enough.

19
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,314
I'm glad.

20
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:34,275
She's only just recovered.

21
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:37,275
We taught the sausage factory a lesson.

22
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:39,674
They paid her everything they owed her.

23
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,594
Yes...

24
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:46,195
You hear that?
Miss Greco taught Soccavo a lesson.

25
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:48,475
No, not me.

26
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,034
No, not her, God Almighty did.

27
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:52,995
I only tried to help Lila.

28
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:55,954
That means that in factories,
on worksites,

29
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:59,555
whenever the workers are in peril
we'll call Elena Greco.

30
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:04,195
She'll call her friends,
guardian angels in high places

31
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,794
and solve everything!

32
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:08,195
After your article, what did they solve?

33
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:10,195
What's changed? Nothing.

34
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:14,435
It's all gone back to how it was
and those who spoke up are in trouble.

35
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:16,915
My brother was beaten up by fascists.

36
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,195
The doctor?

37
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:22,834
Yes, the doctor, my brother.

38
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:25,155
Those who keep quiet
get money on the side.

39
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:30,355
- The fuck d'you think you'd solve?
- You don't abandon your comrades.

40
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:33,794
You don't win in there with pamphlets
or fighting fascists.

41
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,994
- Then how?
- Mobilizing the bosses' children.

42
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:38,794
Not giving a fuck about others!

43
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,355
Cut it out, that's not what happened.

44
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:44,915
- Be quiet.
- Drop it, they're right.

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,274
Hello.

46
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:53,514
I'm sorry, I'm running late,
let's go in there.

47
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,035
Let me know when you have visitors.

48
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:57,435
Hello.

49
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:01,195
I can't bear rudeness.

50
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,635
Please, sit here.

51
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:10,475
I wanted to drop in before to say hello.

52
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:14,075
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch,
I've been swamped.

53
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,195
The book...

54
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:18,954
I'm about to get married.

55
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:21,435
Congratulations!

56
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:27,394
Are you getting married in church?
You having a large reception?

57
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,834
No, no reception,
we're having a civil ceremony.

58
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:36,554
- How did you get married?
- In church.

59
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:39,435
- Are you a believer?
- No, but that's what you did.

60
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,794
One shouldn't do things
only because others do them.

61
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,355
We do it all the time.

62
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:51,554
- Are you going to Elena's wedding?
- She hasn't invited me.

63
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:53,075
It's not true.

64
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:55,595
- She's ashamed of me.
- What are you saying?

65
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:58,714
We haven't even invited my siblings.

66
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:06,114
I wanted to give you this.

67
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:11,954
Thank you, I already have it.

68
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:20,235
What does your husband do?

69
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,995
He holds the Latin
Literature chair at Florence.

70
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:25,675
So, he's older than you?

71
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,034
No, he's 27, he's just very bright.

72
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,755
What's his name?

73
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,195
Pietro Airota.

74
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,154
Is he related to Guido Airota?

75
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,075
Yes, he's his son.

76
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,115
A good marriage.

77
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,115
We love each other.

78
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,954
Have you begun writing your new book?

79
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:02,914
- I'm thinking about it.
- I know you contribute to L'Unità.

80
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:05,795
A few things.

81
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,354
I don't write for that paper
of bureaucrats anymore.

82
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,834
I heard you did remarkable things
at the factory.

83
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,435
- I didn't do anything.
- It's not true.

84
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,755
I only lost my job.

85
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:27,034
Nadia told me that these are
the things that you said.

86
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,354
- Water under the bridge.
- No, it isn't.

87
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:34,154
They're important things, well done.

88
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,875
- Shall I write an inscription anyway?
- Of course.

89
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,154
To Mrs. Galiani or...

90
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,235
Mrs. Galiani.

91
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,474
What awful people.

92
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,914
Did you see
how the old bird treated you?

93
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:09,235
She can't bear that
you write books and articles,

94
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,115
or that you're about to marry well.

95
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,274
She especially can't bear the idea

96
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:19,834
that she raised Nadia to be the best
and she's with a bricklayer.

97
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,115
And she acts like a slut in front of her.

98
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:25,755
You're wrong to care, screw 'em.

99
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,755
You shouldn't have given her the book,

100
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:33,635
you shouldn't have asked her
if she wanted an inscription.

101
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:36,474
These are people
who need their ass kicked.

102
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:41,154
Your flaw is that you're too good.

103
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,995
When you speak to someone
who's studied

104
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:47,195
you listen as if only they have a brain
and it's not the case.

105
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,435
Have fun, you can.
Get married, have a great honeymoon.

106
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:56,235
You worried about me too much.
Write another novel.

107
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,875
You know I expect amazing things.

108
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,714
I'd helped her every way I could,

109
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:07,315
<i>but she took sides with Pasquale</i>
<i>and Nadia who criticized me.</i>

110
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:12,714
<i>Mrs. Galiani praised her</i>
<i>to humiliate me</i>

111
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:15,594
<i>and now she made</i>
<i>the humiliation explicit,</i>

112
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:18,635
rubbing salt into the wound,

113
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:21,675
<i>making it impossible</i>
<i>for me to ignore it.</i>

114
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:30,394
<i>I suddenly wished the cardiologist</i>
<i>had been wrong,</i>

115
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:33,474
that she really was ill and dying.

116
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:44,635
<i>After that,</i>
<i>we didn't see each other for years.</i>

117
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:28,155
- Anyway, it's illegal.
- Don't exaggerate.

118
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,474
It's sold in pharmacies, you just need
a prescription and to be married.

119
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:36,315
They sell medication
to regulate the cycle,

120
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:38,354
it's not a contraceptive pill.

121
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,874
You know perfectly well it does both.

122
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,954
If a medication serves
to obtain a certain result,

123
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,915
you can't use it to obtain another.

124
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:52,634
Medications are poison,
you don't use them willy-nilly.

125
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,234
They can be very harmful. Let's go.

126
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:58,675
- I want to take that pill.
- Can we go?

127
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:02,354
- Must we be late today of all days?
- Did you hear me?

128
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,114
We're about to get married,
focus on that.

129
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:12,075
- You get married to have kids.
- Can I write another book first?

130
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:15,035
You can write a book
while you're expecting.

131
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,754
It can be done. Can we go now?

132
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:36,435
<i>Article 147: marriage requires</i>
<i>both husband and wife</i>

133

136
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,634
Signor Pietro Airota,

00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,954
do you take Elena Greco

138
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:53,354
I do.

139

Signora Elena Greco, do you take
Pietro Airota to be your husband?

140
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:00,155
I do.

141
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:04,634
Further to your affirmative reply,

142
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:08,155
by the power invested in me
by the City of Florence,

143
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,114
I pronounce you legally married.

144
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:13,915
You may exchange rings.

145
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:35,075
Signora Greco, my compliments,
your book is very good.

146
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,954
Thank you.

Marcella has invited us

153
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:04,954
You told me
you weren't having a reception.

154
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:07,275
I didn't know anything about it.

155
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,114
Tell them.

- But it'll be quick?
- Yes.

159
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:21,795
Pietro had nothing to do with it,
it was Marcella's idea.

160
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,555
I knew nothing about it,
you might have told us first.

161
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,954
Isn't it lovely here?

162
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,834
I'm embarrassed.
Button up your jacket.

163
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,834
But it's a proper party!

164
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,515
It's a surprise!

165
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:43,874
She's beautiful! How did you
convince her to marry you?

166
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,315
Thank you, Marcella!

167
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:46,594
Please, go in.

168
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:53,315
Professor Antonioni!
He's my literature professor.

169
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:55,994
- Marcella.
- Immacolata.

170
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,795
- Greco, my pleasure.
- Please, come in.

171
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,234
May I?

172
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,675
- What a beautiful house!
- Thank you.

173
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:04,675
It's an old family house.

174
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:10,155
Come, I'll introduce you.

175
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,555
Vittorio, Immacolata,
a drop of champagne?

176
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:16,874
No, my head is already spinning.

177
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:20,874
If our son-in-law wants to celebrate,
let's have a glass.

178
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:22,395
All right then.

179
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,874
- What is it?
- Bubbles.

180
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:30,195
- How does it go?
- May you live to be a hundred.

181
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,915
May you live to be a hundred.
I touch wood.

182
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,915
Shall we leave together?

183
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,114
Signor Vittorio, all right.

184
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,954
- Elena Greco in Airota.
- It's a pleasure, Bruno Santini.

185
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,155
My pleasure.

186
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,515
- Norbert Leutshig.
- My pleasure.

187
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:52,075
Marcella, you have introduced her
to these two rascals.

188
00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:53,714
Yes!

189
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:56,035
You don't know
who's standing before you.

190
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:58,915
Come, Elena.

191
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:01,275
Let's go in, I'll introduce you to her.

192
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:14,075
- Where do you teach?
- No, Elena doesn't teach, she writes.

193
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:18,155
She has just published a novel
and she contributes to L'Unità.

194
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,035
Do you write about literature?

195
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:24,155
No, I wrote articles about conditions
for women in factories.

196
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:29,075
Thank goodness, the new generations
are pulling their heads out!

197
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:35,035
I read a very interesting essay
in Worker's World

198
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:37,675
about the state of democracy in Italy.

199
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:40,675
It's a very serious text,
with a lot of information.

200
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,754
Who wrote it?

201
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,915
A young professor
of Economic Geography,

202
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,954
Saranno, I think.

203
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,594
Sarratore!

204
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:54,714
- Giovanni Sarratore.
- Of course, we know him.

205
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:59,155
Nino is a childhood friend, he's
at the State University in Milan now.

206
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:01,874
Adele, we were talking
about Nino Sarratore.

207
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,114
Of course, we know him too.

208
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:09,315
But I've come to take
our Elena away from you.

209
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,754
<i>Adele took me</i>
<i>from one group to the next</i>

210
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:17,594
<i>and I forgot about my father and mother</i>
<i>and about Pietro too.</i>

211
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:20,795
I wanted to tell you that
you have written a marvelous book.

212
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:22,435
Thank you.

213
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:25,155
In Italy women don't write like that.

214
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,155
Let's not exaggerate.

215
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:30,954
I'm not exaggerating, because you are...

216
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:35,474
essential, you don't follow
the cult of fine words,

217
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:37,594
of sentiment...

218
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,594
you're pure energy.

219
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,395
Are you writing something else?

220
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:48,234
- I've made a few notes.
- Are you going to write later or...

221
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,994
Don't listen to this hack poet!

222
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:56,155
Hi, Elena, it's a pleasure to meet you.

223
00:15:56,234 --> 00:16:00,874
My name's Mario Gioia and
I'm a fish out of water in this context.

224
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:05,035
I'm an engineer, you're all people
of letters, I'll keep to myself.

225
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:07,795
- But I wanted to meet you.
- Weren't you busy?

226
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:11,114
I'm really embarrassed
but I haven't read your book.

227
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:14,435
I'm sorry,
but I've read all your articles.

228
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,714
He hasn't read anything.

229
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:17,834
I really have read them

230
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,954
and you're good, seriously.

231
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:21,275
Thank you.

232
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:23,754
In fact, let's make a deal,
you're the witness.

233
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,675
You've got to get busy,
continue along this path.

234
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:29,634
The next time I open L'Unità...

235
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:32,035
When do you open L'Unità?

236
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:34,834
Don't be such a prick!

237
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:38,035
I want to find you there because
you're a breath of oxygen.

238
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,555
It's true, you are
a breath of fresh air...

239
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:58,995
<i>At first, it was much better</i>
<i>than I'd hoped,</i>

240
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:03,475
<i>I liked it more than I ever had,</i>
<i>but I didn't understand.</i>

241
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:06,394
<i>Antonio, I remembered,</i>
<i>just touching him was enough.</i>

242
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,914
Franco held out, but not much.

243
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:15,674
<i>Pietro confused me.</i>
<i>He kept going, he seemed to suffer.</i>

244
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,634
He suffered, I suffered too.

245
00:18:27,035 --> 00:18:30,275
<i>I'm convinced</i>
<i>I fell pregnant that very night.</i>

246
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,035
What are you doing?

247
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:58,154
I have to finish some work for tomorrow.

248
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:00,874
But you were asleep.

249
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,515
Go back to bed, I'll be right there.

250
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:21,195
<i>Pregnancy absorbed me,</i>
<i>it was something all mine,</i>

251
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,594
<i>I was almost glad</i>
<i>I no longer spoke with Lila.</i>

252
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:28,515
<i>Then, against my intentions,</i>
<i>one day I called her.</i>

253
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:29,755
Lenù, at last!

254
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:32,874
- Are you mad at me?
- No, why would I be?

255
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,955
You didn't tell me anything.

256
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:37,435
Your mother's put up notices,

257
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:40,755
even the stones know you're pregnant.

258
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,074
I've only been sure for a little while.

259
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:46,114
<i>- Weren't you taking the pill?</i>
<i>- I decided I wouldn't.</i>

260
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:47,874
The book?

261
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,794
I'll see.

262
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,915
You have to do the best you can.

263
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:55,675
I take the pill.

264
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:57,955
So it's going well with Enzo?

265
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:05,794
Well enough, but I don't ever want
to get pregnant again.

266
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:10,675
<i>Too much pain,</i>
<i>the body doesn't like changing shape.</i>

267
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:13,874
Someone else's life
clinging to you in your belly

268
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,195
<i>and when it comes out</i>
<i>it keeps you on a leash.</i>

269
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:20,275
<i>It's like you fabricated</i>
<i>your own torment.</i>

270
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:23,155
If you need me, let me know.

271
00:20:24,034 --> 00:20:25,955
You helped me,

272
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,354
now I want to help you.

273
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:33,074
<i>Lila wanted me to be like her,</i>
<i>but it wasn't like that.</i>

274
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:37,114
Contrary to what she had told me

275
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:40,755
<i>the period of the pregnancy</i>
<i>was beautiful.</i>

276
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:44,314
<i>I saw myself as part</i>
<i>of an unstoppable force,</i>

277
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:46,034
I considered myself invulnerable.

278
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:49,475
No one could hurt me or my baby,

279
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,995
we two were the only lasting reality.

280
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,275
Squeeze my hand.

281
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:57,755
Little puffs!

282
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:02,074
Good girl, one more and we're there.

283
00:21:02,155 --> 00:21:04,275
I can see the head.

284
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:06,475
Very good! Push!

285
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:08,955
Come in, it's out!

286
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,675
Keep it up!

287
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:13,195
Here she is!

288
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,314
It's a girl.

289
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,874
A beautiful baby girl.

290
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:54,394
<i>She was a beautiful baby</i>
<i>and full of energy.</i>

291
00:21:55,955 --> 00:21:58,915
I felt, in the moment I gave birth

292
00:21:58,995 --> 00:22:01,715
such an overwhelming physical pleasure

293
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:04,834
<i>that to date, I can't find any</i>
<i>other pleasure that comes close.</i>

294
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,874
- Has she eaten?
- Yes.

295
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,515
- How are you today?
- I'm fine.

296
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:17,435
Our darling!

297
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,995
She's so beautiful!

298
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,554
I brought you a little something.

299
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:25,995
I'll open it.

300
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:28,715
It's a notebook.

301
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,275
If you want to start writing...

302
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:33,554
Thank you.

303
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:36,195
I got the checked one, how you like it.

304
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:39,715
- I'll put it here.
- Yes, put it in there.

305
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,995
So you don't lose the habit.

306
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:52,034
Thank you.

307
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:54,995
Adele...

308
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,755
How do you feel
calling her after your mother?

309
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:06,915
She's born, she's a girl.

310
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:08,995
What's her name?

311
00:23:09,074 --> 00:23:10,874
Adele.

312
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:13,794
- Don't you like it?
- It's an old lady's name.

313
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:16,515
My mother-in-law says so too.

314
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:19,755
<i>- How was it?</i>
<i>- It was a beautiful experience.</i>

315
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:23,834
What was?

316
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:27,515
The pregnancy, the birth.

317
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,195
Adele is beautiful, she's very good.

318
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:37,394
<i>Everyone talks themselves into a life</i>
<i>that suits them best.</i>

319
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:40,915
Speak soon.

320
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:16,074
Now you have to take care of her.

321
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:19,515
- Why are you so on edge?
- I can't take anymore, I'm exhausted.

322
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:21,394
Maybe the baby can feel it.

323
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:23,834
Are you saying it's my fault
that she won't sleep?

324
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:26,675
I'm saying maybe you unsettle her.

325
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:29,955
- Calm down and close the door.
- No, I won't calm down.

326
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:31,475
I don't want to be calm.

327
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:35,155
Seeing as I'm not able to,
you get her to eat, you put her to sleep.

328
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:36,874
I've had it!

329
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:34,074
Lila's a witch,
she has a terrifying power.

330
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:37,435
She casts spells,
kills the babies in her belly.

331
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:07,834
That bitch, your friend,
has cast a spell on you.

332
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:10,995
Only you haven't realized it yet.

333
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:13,834
You mustn't ever see her
or speak to her again.

334
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:21,634
Garlic, whitebait,
this spell can't operate.

335
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:25,114
Eye, evil eye, and in your eye.

336
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:27,155
Shoo, owl of misfortune!

337
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:59,235
<i>I began to limp,</i>
<i>it really frightened me.</i>

338
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,394
I went to see a specialist.

339
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:04,394
<i>He said that everything was in order,</i>
<i>just a little sciatica.</i>

340
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:08,155
<i>He asked me affably</i>
<i>why I was so worried.</i>

341
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:11,634
I lied, I said I didn't know.

342
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,515
Actually, I knew very well.

343
00:27:14,594 --> 00:27:16,515
I'd feared all my childhood

344
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,834
<i>that my mother's gait</i>
<i>would catch up with me,</i>

345
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:23,755
<i>and now I thought</i>
<i>it had settled in my body</i>

346
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:26,874
and that I would limp forever like her.

347
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:17,235
You could ask your mother
to come and help you.

348
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:21,435
With her in the house it would be
impossible for me to write.

349
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:27,235
- If you like I can call my mother.
- It's the same.

350
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:30,275
I need to focus, to study.

351
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,114
And your friend Lila?

352
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:37,955
You helped her, will she do it for you?

353
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,475
How does Lila come into it?

354
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:50,675
We'll follow Adele's advice,
we'll find help here in Florence.

355
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:52,755
No, I'd rather not.

356
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:55,995
I don't want slaves in my house.

357
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:01,634
So you think I should be the slave?

358
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:08,354
I wash and iron your clothes,
I cook for you.

359
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:12,675
I clean your house, I raise your child.

360
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,794
And you? You write.

361
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:19,155
You see people, you go to the university,
take care of your career.

362
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,114
You're exactly the same
as every other man.

363
00:29:25,794 --> 00:29:28,634
You don't want a wife,
you want a faithful housemaid.

364
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,874
And then no one ever invites us
to a party, a concert.

365
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,794
Not even your father's friends
invite us anymore.

366
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:41,755
You know what?

367
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,874
I'm fucking fed up.

368
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,449
Months passed as did the superstitions.

369
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:07,370
The baby and I made it,

370
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:10,769
<i>her nights grew more tranquil</i>
<i>and so did mine.</i>

371
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,890
<i>Pietro agreed that</i>
<i>we hire a live-in helper</i>

372
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:20,050
<i>and after a year and a half,</i>
<i>here I am in front of a typewriter.</i>

373
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,050
Signora? I'll take the baby out.

374
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,209
If you get hungry
I've left something in the kitchen.

375
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,409
All right, thank you.

376
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:32,209
Say goodbye to Mamma.

377
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,929
Let's go, Mamma has to work.

378
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,570
Shall we go out?

379
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,489
<i>Despite Clelia's help,</i>
<i>I didn't make any progress.</i>

380
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:56,009
<i>I wanted to write something fitting,</i>
<i>something great,</i>

381
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,570
<i>but I couldn't find anything</i>
<i>that went past ten lifeless pages.</i>

382
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:10,929
<i>I struggled to admit it,</i>
<i>but Lila was still my model,</i>

383
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:13,610
with her stubborn unreasonableness.

384
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,409
<i>Even though I was far away from her,</i>
<i>in every sense,</i>

385
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:22,330
<i>I wanted to say and do what I imagined</i>
<i>she would have said and done</i>

386
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:24,570
if she'd had the resources I had,

387
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,370
<i>if she hadn't self-isolated</i>
<i>in the neighborhood.</i>

388
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,489
It's a form of sadism to think
of getting the same results

389
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,330
from people who have had
different opportunities.

390
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,290
- Who says so?
- You evaluate the students too harshly.

391
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:47,449
You have to be demanding
or you won't change the world.

392
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,169
That's not the point.

393
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,009
My colleagues indulge
the most arrogant students.

394
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,850
Let me speak!

395
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:59,370
And they're merciless with the weakest.

396
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:02,489
They're not weaker,
they're afraid of change.

397
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,570
The ones you call aggressive
are trying to change the world

398
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,409
and maybe they're even workers.

399
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:12,090
- Do you have student workers?
- You're unbearable.

400
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:16,409
I agree with Pietro,
a good professor must be cordial,

401
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:18,449
but also demanding.

402
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,929
A student has the tools
to fill in the gaps from the past...

403
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,929
You're more an engineer
than an assistant.

404
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:28,929
I care a great deal about my students.

405
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:31,249
- Mariarosa too!
- So I see.

406
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:35,330
I'm off, I have
an important article to finish.

407
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,050
So be indulgent, but not too much!

408
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,610
I'll see you later.

409
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:49,050
Good night.

410
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,769
No, thanks.

411
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:00,610
It's not like we have
anything urgent to do.

412
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,050
Let's sit on the sofa.

413
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,090
We'll have one last smoke,
I'm starting to feel like fucking.

414
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:09,090
Professor Airota!

415
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,610
Do you need to use these obscene terms
to make revolution?

416
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:19,090
Is that how it works?
What do you say, Elena?

417
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:24,090
I come from a neighborhood where
these words have always circulated.

418
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,409
We've never found
an alternative to obscenity.

419
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:31,530
I haven't read you in L'Unità lately.
Aren't you writing anymore?

420
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,489
It's difficult to focus,

421
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,890
writing in the kitchen with the baby
is complicated.

422
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:41,409
But you're very good, you mustn't stop.

423
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:44,090
Isn't there a study, a space?

424
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:48,050
Yes, but only Pietro uses it,
he's always holed up in there.

425
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,489
If you want, my studio
is not very far from here.

426
00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:00,090
I'm almost always by myself, you could
come and write as much as you want.

427
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,769
Really.

428
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,969
I don't know...

429
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,370
How's your sense of direction?

430
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:08,249
I get lost everywhere.

431
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:11,249
I'll explain where it is.

432
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,130
This is Florence

433
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,209
and this line is the Arno embankment

434
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,329
and as you know,
this is Piazza Santa Croce.

435
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:25,689
- My studio is there, do you know it?
- I know Piazza Santa Croce.

436
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:28,570
Perfect, then you know
how to get there, number 19.

437
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,450
Come and write whenever you want.

438
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,849
Is it the studio where you draw?

439
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,410
More than draw, I erase, but yes.

440
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,689
Shall we go?

441
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:43,650
Shall we go?

442
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,130
Let's go.

443
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,889
Elena, I'll be expecting you.

444
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:00,689
Let's go, Casanova.

445
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,249
Elena?

446
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,050
I'll see you out.

447
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,809
Will you give us our jackets?

448
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,650
I couldn't wait for them to leave.

449
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:18,090
Come.

450
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,329
- No, I don't want to.
- Come on.

451
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,530
Wait.

452
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:34,090
- Put this on.
- All right.

453
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,930
Is there a problem?

454
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:52,490
- Are you angry with me?
- No, Pietro.

455
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,930
I adore your intelligence,

456
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,530
your education.

457
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,610
Dede's wonderful
but I don't want another child.

458
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,970
I want a more active life,
I feel isolated.

459
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,090
I didn't study all my life

460
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,369
to end up stuck
in the role of wife and mother.

461
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,729
I need to go out, to see people,

462
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,689
I can't stay shut away in here
all the time.

463
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:25,450
I'm dying in here.

464
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,490
<i>The condoms dulled his sensitivity</i>
<i>even more</i>

465
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,169
<i>and he needed even longer</i>
<i>to reach orgasm</i>

466
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:44,490
than he generally did.

467
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,610
<i>I came out of it satisfied</i>
<i>but nevertheless sore,</i>

468
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:52,490
bored even.

469
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:45,249
<i>An anxious desire to transgress</i>
<i>was taking hold of me,</i>

470
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:49,889
<i>I wanted to break free</i>
<i>as I felt the world was doing.</i>

471
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,410
<i>I wanted to leave behind, just once,</i>
<i>everything in my life,</i>

472
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,689
<i>what I had learned,</i>
<i>what I had written,</i>

473
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:07,689
<i>what I was trying to write,</i>
<i>the baby I had brought into the world.</i>

474
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,530
Marriage was a prison.

475
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,490
<i>Lila, who was brave,</i>
<i>had fled from it</i>

476
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,570
at the risk of her own life.

477
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:52,849
I've brought you another eraser.

478
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,010
Shall we take the jacket off?
It's not cold.

479
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:23,369
The scarf too?

480
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:52,689
Come.

481
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,249
I can't do this.

482
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:29,485
- Hi, Lenù.
- How are you? And Gennaro?

483
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,044
At school he's one of the best.

484
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:34,925
- Enzo?
- He's well too.

485
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:37,684
He's really good at his new job.

486
00:41:37,764 --> 00:41:41,044
Now he earns 150,000 lire a month

487
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:44,684
and they hired me too, I'm making 80.

488
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:46,684
You get it? We're rich.

489
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:49,764
I'm glad it's good with Enzo
and things are going well.

490
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,845
Not everything's going well.

491
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:57,405
They killed Dario, you know?
Remember him?

492
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:01,965
The unionist.

493
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:04,485
Who killed him?

494
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:09,164
No one knows anything yet, but
I'm convinced it was the fascists.

495
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:12,325
They're everywhere, like a black hood
over the neighborhood.

496
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,564
<i>The fascists attack comrades</i>
<i>with metal pipes.</i>

497
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:18,805
<i>Pasquale was beaten up twice,</i>
<i>they broke his teeth.</i>

498
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:21,485
Gino attacked Enzo outside his house.

499
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:24,925
- Holy Mother.
- Nothing ever changes here.

500
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:57,244
<i>This shit didn't just start now,</i>
<i>you know when it did?</i>

501
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,684
Remember when Don Achille, fascist
and loan shark, was stabbed to death?

502
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:05,845
Then as now,
justice chose the simplest path.

503
00:43:09,164 --> 00:43:10,405
Think about it.

504
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:13,164
Who truly benefitted from that death?

505
00:43:13,244 --> 00:43:15,604
Who ended up controlling
moneylending?

506
00:43:15,684 --> 00:43:17,044
Think about it.

507
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,724
Who began lending money?

508
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,365
Who got rich?

509
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:27,244
Manuela Solara?
You're saying she killed Don Achille?

510
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:30,965
You think it's not possible
only because she's a woman?

511
00:43:35,684 --> 00:43:37,885
Between his jaw and his collarbone...

512
00:43:39,124 --> 00:43:40,124
A stab wound.

513
00:43:50,124 --> 00:43:53,405
The copper of the pot was so shiny

514
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:56,885
that the blood looked like an ink stain
with a black line dripping from it.

515
00:43:58,684 --> 00:44:02,164
<i>- How do you know all this?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

516
00:44:02,244 --> 00:44:05,164
I open the pail and pull out the words.

517
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:20,885
It was a woman, Lenù.

518
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:44,635
- Have you spoken to your mamma?
- Not recently, no. Why?

519
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,235
It's been a month since
I sent her the book.

520
00:44:47,314 --> 00:44:50,675
How come you sent it to my mother
and not to me?

521
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:54,434
If you'd wanted to read it
there was a copy in the living room.

522
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:57,115
You can call her.

523
00:44:57,994 --> 00:45:00,275
Maybe she hasn't finished it.

524
00:45:00,354 --> 00:45:04,333
Knowing her, I think she has.
If I were you I'd call her.

525
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,720
Papa's going to work, kiss.
You're beautiful.

526
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,999
- Goodbye, professor.
- Call me Pietro.

527
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,519
I can't.

528
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,280
- So do you know if she's read it?
- I don't know, Elena.

529
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,760
I don't know anything.
I'll see you later.

530
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:24,880
Let's go.

531
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:43,450
Hello.

532
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,369
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

533
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,010
- Sorry I'm late.
- Not at all.

534
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:58,530
Why didn't you come to us?
Dede would've been so happy.

535
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,610
Another time,
today I wanted to talk to you.

536
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,050
Too much work,
today I can't be a grandma.

537
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,689
How's that little beast of a son of mine?

538
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,010
Fine.

539
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:15,289
What can I get you?

540
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,570
- Tea for me.
- For me too.

541
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:20,729
So, have you read it?

542
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,450
Yes.

543
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,849
You didn't like it.

544
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:31,329
No, the truth is that I didn't like it.

545
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,729
Why?

546
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,809
The protagonist is unlikable.

547
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:46,410
The writing is mannered, it's chaotic.

548
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:51,610
Maybe you wanted to be modern,
but the result is messy.

549
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:53,490
It wasn't easy.

550
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,769
I wrote the first novel
without awareness,

551
00:46:56,849 --> 00:47:00,809
with this one I tried a new way
of writing, blurred,

552
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:02,570
even chaotic.

553
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,809
I really threw myself into it,
I worked...

554
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,650
Thank you.

555
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:19,050
- May I?
- Go.

556
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:25,090
I worked, but then I realized
what I wanted to say.

557
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,209
I blended Florence with Naples,

558
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:30,689
I worked on distant voices,

559
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:34,450
on how I struggled to get out
of the neighborhood, my origins.

560
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:39,249
Your first novel was new,
but this is old.

561
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,930
It's so pretentious...

562
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:48,530
that the words seem empty.

563
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,769
I understand what you wanted to do,

564
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:56,650
but it's not enough.

565
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:03,010
And the ending is so coarse,
it's an insult to your intelligence.

566
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:09,490
Maybe the others
at the publishers will like it.

567
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,570
Send it to them.

568
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,090
But I'm more than certain

569
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,249
that they'll deem it unpublishable.

570
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:29,570
- Have you given it to Pietro?
- Yes, but he hasn't read it.

571
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,410
Maybe he could give some advice.

572
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:36,055
I doubt it.

573
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:05,814
Do you want something?

574
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:10,454
No.

575
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:31,334
Am I disturbing you?

576
00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:35,535
- Did you read it?
- I read it.

577
00:49:36,735 --> 00:49:37,655
Well?

578
00:49:38,414 --> 00:49:40,055
It's good.

579
00:49:40,135 --> 00:49:43,374
<i>- Good, how?</i>
<i>- It makes you want to read it.</i>

580
00:49:43,454 --> 00:49:47,454
You're not being truthful,
you don't speak superficially like that.

581
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:52,014
I don't know how to read anymore,
I warned you.

582
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:55,454
You do one type of work, I do another.

583
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:59,055
<i>You've studied, you know</i>
<i>how books should be.</i>

584
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:01,695
I need you and you don't care!

585
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:03,494
I helped you, now you have to help me.

586
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:09,055
You shouldn't write these things, Lenù.

587
00:50:11,374 --> 00:50:13,294
That's not who you are.

588
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:18,655
Nothing of what I read resembles you.

589
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:24,055
It's a bad book.

590
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,894
The one before it was bad too.

591
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:41,615
<i>Why did you make me</i>
<i>say these things?</i>

592
00:50:43,095 --> 00:50:44,934
I should have kept them to myself.

593
00:50:45,014 --> 00:50:47,454
I want you to do better.

594
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:51,655
Who am I if you're not any good?

595
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:58,294
<i>Good and bad things that happen</i>
<i>aren't enough to write a book.</i>

596
00:50:59,575 --> 00:51:02,575
Without imagination,
they're not even good,

597
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,615
they just seem fake.

598
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:10,615
I'm sorry I'm crying like an idiot,

599
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:12,454
I'm really sorry.

600
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:18,095
I've got to go now,

601
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:21,215
I have to put Dede to bed.

602
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:24,135
Yeah, take care.

603
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,974
