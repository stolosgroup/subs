00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:17,445
<i>Eleonora showered us with gifts,</i>
<i>she paid at the restaurant</i>

3
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,204
<i>and wanted to buy dresses</i>
<i>for Dede and Elsa.</i>

4
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,564
Then they returned to Naples.

5
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:28,285
<i>Against all odds,</i>
<i>time didn't collapse without Nino,</i>

6
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:31,125
on the contrary, writing absorbed me.

7
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:36,925
<i>Thinking of it now,</i>
<i>I wrote of how men had invented us</i>

8
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,925
<i>so that we would always be</i>
<i>at their service,</i>

9
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:44,165
<i>just because he would read me</i>
<i>and say: "Well done."</i>

10
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:51,885
Hello?

11
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,165
Elena, I'm enthusiastic about it!

12
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:56,205
Can I translate it into French?

13
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:58,925
Some friends run
a small publishing house in Nanterre,

14
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,525
they often publish female authors,
they'd be keen.

15
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:05,005
Without your encouragement,
I'd never have done it.

16
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:07,605
<i>My mother will call you,</i>
<i>she knows I've read the book,</i>

17
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:11,404
she'll be offended
because you didn't send it to her first.

18
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:13,564
No, as if she'd be offended.

19
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:17,365
I have to go now. Bye, Mariarosa.

20

21
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:29,365
Hello?

22
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:34,844
<i>How is it that you let</i>
<i>Mariarosa read your work before me?</i>

23
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,365
I was afraid it wouldn't interest you.

24
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,844
It's only seventy pages.

25
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:44,644
<i>It's not a novel,</i>
<i>I don't quite know what it is.</i>

26
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:48,204
When you don't know what
you've written, it means it's good work.

27
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:51,885
Let me decide
if it interests me or not. Send it to me.

28
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:54,924
- All right.
- Bye, Elena.

29
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,524
Hello?

30
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,325
<i>- Lenù.</i>
<i>- Hi!</i>

31
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:13,165
I'm in Florence.

32
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:16,764
- We were expecting you tomorrow.
- I'll explain later.

33
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,565
<i>If it's a problem,</i>
<i>I can make other arrangements.</i>

34
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:20,964
No problem at all.

35
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:25,364
<i>I'll be there in half an hour, I'll</i>
<i>leave my suitcase and go to the library.</i>

36
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:29,764
- Won't you eat something first?
- No, I can't stay for lunch.

37
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,964
- All right.
- I'm on my way.

38
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:45,685
Hi.

39
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,685
- Come in.
- May I?

40
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:49,165
Hello.

41
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,924
Hi there, meatball!

42
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:56,165
How are you?

43
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,285
Hi there, little meatball.

44
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:04,125
Are you shy?

45
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,685
Or are you tired?

46
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:09,165
- Dede?
- She's at school.

47
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:10,565
Would you like a coffee?

48
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,325
How's your work coming along?

49
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:17,244
Well, I gave the pages
to Mariarosa to read.

50
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:20,125
She said she wants
to translate them into French.

51
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,565
I had no doubts at all.

52
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,325
How is Mariarosa?

53
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:28,204
Always very active.

54
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:31,285
Franco's staying with her
until he recovers.

55
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:35,325
He still hasn't recovered?

56
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:37,764
- Not a lot.
- Pieces of shit.

57
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,364
For him and Silvia it's been very hard.

58
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:46,125
I was very struck
by something you wrote.

59
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:51,484
For you, in the Biblical story, woman
is no different from man, she is man.

60
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,605
Yes, Eve can't, doesn't know how,

61
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,484
she doesn't have the means
to live outside Adam.

62
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,764
Her good and evil are
good and evil according to Adam.

63
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,285
It's as if she were Adam as a woman.

64
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:09,244
God's work is so successful,
she herself doesn't know what she is.

65
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:12,125
She doesn't have a language of her own,

66
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:15,125
a spirit of her own, a logic of her own.

67
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:18,565
- And she has a pliant body.
- And she loses her shape easily.

68
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,164
Now I have to go. Thanks.

69
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,164
Stay.

70
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:30,685
Bye, meatball, see you soon.

71
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,764
Where do I put this?

72
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,005
I'll do it.

73
00:04:35,084 --> 00:04:36,724
You sure? Thanks.

74
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:39,764
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

75
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,365
Nino, I was talking
about responsibility in general.

76
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:10,565
Responsibility? You're always
on about values, morality...

77
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:16,045
In the ideal world of Pietro the priest,
Elena is your governess.

78
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,764
See you later. Dede, be good.

79
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:20,844
Have fun.

80
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:25,284
<i>Pietro's friendship with Nino</i>
<i>did him good.</i>

81
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,245
He was happy with this bond,

82
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,805
<i>he had discovered</i>
<i>the pleasure of not feeling alone.</i>

83
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:34,844
I'll get you, don't worry.

84
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:45,885
Nino? Magic trick.

85
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:49,325
Dede, don't be annoying, just eat.

86
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:51,284
Papa, you're the annoying one.

87
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:55,005
Are you ready?

88
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:03,885
I'll go.

89
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,084
Another one?

90
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:11,365
Hello?

91
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,764
It's me, am I disturbing you?

92
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:15,805
No, we were just finishing lunch.

93
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,764
I'll only steal a minute.

94
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:23,644
I finished it last night.
It's intense, accurate.

95
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:26,805
<i>- At times illuminating, very topical.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

96
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:29,844
Send it to the publisher tomorrow.

97
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:32,005
They can make a small volume

98
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,125
to be published simultaneously
with the publication in French.

99
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:36,844
All right.

100
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,325
<i>You did such good work,</i>
<i>I knew you would.</i>

101
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:44,084
Say hello to the girls,
actually to everyone, my son too.

102
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,365
Bye.

103
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:51,204
- Who was that?
- Your mother.

104
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,445
Was it Grandma Adele?

105
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,084
And what did she say?

106
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:59,685
They want to publish my book
simultaneously with France.

107
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:00,724
Really?

108
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,885
We have to celebrate!

109
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:05,524
To your mother, a great writer.

110
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:12,284
I'll toast with prosciutto.

111
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:17,925
Did you read it in the end?

112
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:20,764
No.

113
00:08:20,844 --> 00:08:22,764
I haven't had time.

114
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:26,805
What does that mean?

115
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,964
That you work too much.

116
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:32,285
I'm swamped with work.

117
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,124
Better that you don't read it at all.

118
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,084
What do you mean?

119
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:40,724
It's not stuff for you.

120
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:45,004
- Have you read it?
- Of course I've read it.

121
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,525
I left it on your desk.

122
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,565
I know,

123
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:57,124
it's just that I've been busy
and I couldn't manage it, sorry.

124
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,844
What did you mean by
"not stuff for me"?

125
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,204
That it's too intelligent.

126
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,165
That is? What do you mean?

127
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:10,724
That you're less intelligent than Elena.

128
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:17,004
- Are you disappointed?
- Eat, Dede.

129
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,244
- Are you offended?
- No.

130
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,045
More magic.

131
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:30,925
More magic?

132
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,525
Enough for today.

133
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:36,084
Papa is offended.

134
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:39,765
Excuse him, Pietro works a lot
and sleeps very little.

135
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:43,484
I don't know
how you put up with him.

136
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:48,325
I love him.

137
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:55,244
Dede, have you finished eating?

138
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,844
Go to Papa.

139
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,525
- Go.
- My prosciutto...

140
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:02,964
Take it with you.

141
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:06,244
- I'll do, leave it.
- Lenù, relax.

142
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:11,204
You make the coffee, I'll do the dishes,
play with the girls, then go to work.

143
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:14,525
- I'll do it, don't worry.
- I'm a guest, I'm happy to.

144
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:19,405
I'll be there in five minutes
and we'll play.

145
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:22,405
Go to Papa.

146
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:30,285
Want me to pick you up?

147
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,124
- I need to pee.
- Let's go.

148
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,325
What was happening?

149
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,004
<i>I should have done something about it</i>
<i>but I did nothing,</i>

150
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:55,124
<i>actually, deep down I liked</i>
<i>seeing how an Airota lost ground,</i>

151
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:58,724
<i>got confused,</i>
<i>replied with flabby quips</i>

152
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,445
<i>to the quick</i>
<i>and cruel aggressions of Nino,</i>

153
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:06,484
<i>my schoolmate, my friend,</i>
<i>born in the neighborhood like me.</i>

154
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,565
"Sir, he replied,
it is not up to me to choose.

155
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:18,204
So I shall always be pleased
with whomever you assign to me."

156
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,964
I waited for you for half an hour
outside the university.

157
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,604
Forgive me, I was held up.

158
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,045
Hi, girls.

159
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:27,285
Hi, Papa.

160
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:31,724
What happened?

161
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:34,325
Don't ever bring people from Naples
into my home again!

162
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:39,204
The police came to the university.

163
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,565
It's your fault,
you shouldn't have reported that boy.

164
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:46,844
Who did you report?

165
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:49,884
- It's normal for them to follow up.
- Who did you report?

166
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:51,884
It has nothing to do with the boy!

167
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:54,844
They showed me some photos,
they named some people.

168
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,645
But who did you report?

169
00:11:59,124 --> 00:12:02,964
I did what was necessary then
and I should have done it today.

170
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,364
I didn't say anything
because you were involved.

171
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:07,244
How do I come into it?

172
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:10,204
Aren't Pasquale and Nadia your friends?

173
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:12,525
Pasquale and Nadia?

174
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,204
The police showed me pictures
of terrorists, they were there.

175
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,405
So now you snitch to the cops?

176
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:20,724
You inform on comrades?

177
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:24,124
Does your father know?
Your mother, your sister?

178
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,325
What informer, Nino?

179
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:32,204
A while ago, Pasquale Peluso
came to visit us, remember?

180
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,964
No, I don't remember him.

181
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,604
He came with Nadia, they're together.

182
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,045
- Nadia?
- Remember her?

183
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:42,604
Galiani.

184
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:48,165
Nadia Galiani? She's the nicest
and kindest person I know.

185
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,084
And only you and a couple of thick cops

186
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:54,645
could think she's part
of the armed struggle.

187
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,645
What nonsense, Nadia Galiani!

188
00:12:58,165 --> 00:12:59,844
Girls, let's go eat.

189
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:08,004
Just be a professor,
not a law enforcement informer.

190
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:13,844
Now eat, defense of the established
order can do without you tonight.

191
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,645
Do you want sauce on your meatballs?

192
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:36,525
- How many do you want?
- Three.

193
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:38,525
The usual meatballs.

194
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:48,004
Eat one, at least.

195
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,925
Enjoy your meal.

196
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:06,004
Mamma, can I go and call Papa
and tell him it's ready?

197
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:08,445
Go.

198
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:17,604
Are you coming to eat?

199
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:20,604
No, papa's tired, you go and eat.

200
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:31,844
Good night.

201
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:42,285
I'm leaving tomorrow.

202
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,645
- Have you finished your work?
- No.

203
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,844
- Then stay.
- I can't.

204
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:55,244
- Pietro's a good person.
- You even defend him?

205
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,884
Papa said he wants to go to bed.

206
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,805
Evidently he wasn't hungry.

207
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:11,964
Dede, eat.

208
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:13,525
Okay.

209
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,364
What an unpredictable person,

210
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:31,844
<i>extremely intelligent and stupid,</i>
<i>a failed Airota,</i>

211
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:35,124
he had stumbled along the way.

212
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:40,364
<i>Perhaps Nino wanted to help me</i>
<i>see my husband for what he really was.</i>

213
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:44,484
<i>In those last days</i>
<i>all he did was rebuke me</i>

214
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:46,884
<i>for having had two daughters</i>
<i>with a nobody.</i>

215
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,244
<i>But did he realize</i>
<i>he was offering himself</i>

216
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,445
as an alternative model of virility?

217
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:55,724
He had been rash.

218
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:59,084
He had sown confusion in a situation

219
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:02,525
<i>that for me constituted</i>
<i>the only possible equilibrium.</i>

220
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:07,084
<i>Who had asked him</i>
<i>to open my eyes and save me?</i>

221
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:10,244
Nino had made a mistake.

222
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:12,285
If he really cared about me,

223
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:15,884
<i>he needed to bring everything</i>
<i>back to the starting point.</i>

224
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:20,045
<i>He had to regain</i>
<i>Pietro's liking and friendship,</i>

225
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:22,124
my husband asked nothing else.

226
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:24,765
I had to talk to him,

227
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:27,565
<i>tell him that was foolish</i>
<i>to treat Pietro that way.</i>

228
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,604
Come in.

229
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,364
At last you've made up your mind.

230
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:27,285
I was very tired last night.

231
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:31,604
And also very rude.

232
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,084
I'll apologize to him, all right?

233
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,844
You should apologize to me.

234
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,124
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:50,684
The police often
come to us at the university.

236
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:54,565
A few months ago they asked
for information about some students,

237
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:57,604
so I asked them if they were sure

238
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:00,084
those students had committed crimes.

239
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:03,164
You know what they replied?

240
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:05,844
"Not yet."

241
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:09,525
So I showed them the door.

242
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:12,164
When they came back
for Pasquale and Nadia,

243
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:15,005
I didn't say they'd been here.

244
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:20,364
Not to defend you, but because
the police are overdoing it.

245
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:27,525
With the excuse of terrorism,
they're criminalizing all dissent.

246
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,805
You look nice.

247
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,924
Anyway, he's leaving today.

248
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,965
I'll go get the girls out of bed,
you check the coffee.

249
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:22,725
Stay longer.

250
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:25,045
I can't.

251
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:29,045
Swear you'll come back.

252
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,884
I swear.

253
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,005
- Tell me you won't leave me.
- I won't leave you.

254
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:39,164
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

255
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:41,684
Say it again.

256
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:42,884
I love you.

257
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:47,404
- Swear it's not a lie.
- I swear.

258
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:09,325
Mamma?

259
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,364
What's your favorite color?

260
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,245
- Green.
- Mine too!

261
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:16,924
- Really?
- Yes.

262
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,765
Mamma?

263
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:25,205
Lovely!

264
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:34,364
- Hello?
- It's me.

265
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,965
I just arrived in Naples
and I called to say hi

266
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:39,404
and to ask how you are.

267
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:41,844
I'm fine.

268
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,205
What are you doing?

269
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:46,725
<i>- I'm with the girls.</i>
<i>- How are they?</i>

270
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,084
Fine.

271
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:50,005
Is Pietro there?

272
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:52,805
No.

273
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,164
Did you like making love with me?

274
00:21:58,444 --> 00:21:59,485
Yes.

275
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:01,245
A lot?

276
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:03,245
Very much.

277
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,604
I have a lesson, I have to go.

278
00:22:06,684 --> 00:22:08,844
Okay, thanks for the call.

279
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:12,045
- Why are you so cold?
- I'm not cold.

280
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:15,285
You demanded
I tell you that I love you and I did.

281
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:19,285
<i>Even though I don't say it to anyone,</i>
<i>not even my wife.</i>

282
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:21,765
I'm glad.

283
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:23,565
But do you love me?

284
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:26,444
Yes.

285
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,404
Tonight you're going to sleep with him?

286
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,045
Don't you sleep with your wife?

287
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:37,765
<i>- It's not the same thing.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

288
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:40,485
- Because I don't care about her.
- Then come back.

289
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:42,684
How can I?

290
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:45,124
Leave her.

291
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:48,364
- I'm out of coins, I'll call you back.
- Okay.

292
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:50,644
Bye.

293
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,644
Who was that?

294
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:10,684
No one.

295
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,005
- Was it Papa?
- Yes, it was Papa.

296
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:18,164
That's not true.

297
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:20,725
Yes, it's true.

298
00:23:27,604 --> 00:23:29,565
- Shall we go in there?
- Let's go in there.

299
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:33,765
Let's go.

300
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,005
Hello?

301
00:23:57,084 --> 00:23:59,045
I've called you five times.

302
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:02,005
When I call you,
you gotta be at home, all right?

303
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,884
I can't always be at home.

304
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,485
Anyway,
we're going on vacation in a week.

305
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:11,805
<i>I thought you'd never answer</i>
<i>but I would've let it ring forever.</i>

306
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,404
I would have loved
the sound of the telephone,

307
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:18,045
<i>that hollow sound</i>
<i>seemed to be all that was left.</i>

308
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,245
All I do is think about you.

309
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,725
Me too.

310
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:24,844
I wish I could bite your shoulders,

311
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:28,765
<i>as I slowly stroke you</i>
<i>between your legs.</i>

312
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,725
<i>I wish I could smell</i>
<i>the odor of your breast,</i>

313
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:40,245
<i>make it sing, make it beg,</i>
<i>just to have another kiss.</i>

314
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,404
Me too.

315
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,325
Bye.

316
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:49,924
Were you talking to your boyfriend?

317
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:53,164
What boyfriend!

318
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:55,684
Why would you think that?

319
00:24:56,844 --> 00:25:00,485
Anyway, I put the shopping bag
in the kitchen.

320
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,045
Hello?

321
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:34,205
Look at me.

322
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,364
- Hello?
- Come out.

323
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,565
Where are you?

324
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:43,684
I'm on the other side of the square.

325
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:45,525
Come out.

326
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,444
Come out, or I'll come there.

327
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:52,164
How can I?

328
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:55,205
Then, I'm on my way.

329
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:57,644
I'll be right there.

330
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:37,005
I have to go
and buy some things for the beach.

331
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:40,924
Give me two minutes and we'll go.

332
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:44,084
It's all right, I'll go.

333
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,924
It won't take long,
you stay here with the girls.

334
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,604
I'll see you soon, be good.

335
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:53,765
It's so funny.

336
00:27:24,805 --> 00:27:26,525
What were you thinking?

337
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,644
I drove all night.

338
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:32,485
Yes, all night...

339
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:34,765
All night, Lenù!

340
00:27:50,644 --> 00:27:51,884
You're crazy.

341
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:53,684
- Why?
- Here?

342
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:23,444
Tell me you love me.

343
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:25,084
I love you.

344
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,164
Let's leave, let's go away together.

345
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:31,725
Let's go now, don't go home.

346
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,644
And Pietro? The girls?

347
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:38,005
And us, Lenù? What about us?

348
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,164
Are we to live a life
that doesn't belong to us?

349
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,765
We have to take everything,
you understand?

350
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:47,884
Even if we think it's impossible.

351
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:57,924
I can't bear the idea
of not seeing you for all of August.

352
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,164
You have to call me every day.

353
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:03,565
What if Eleonora answers?

354
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:06,364
- Hang up.
- And if you're at the beach?

355
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,604
I have to work,
I'll never be at the beach.

356
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,725
We'll take a day,

357
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:13,924
at least one,
to be alone just you and me.

358
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:21,684
It's madness.

359
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:24,565
We'll go to your place
and make love all day.

360
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:28,325
I can't leave the girls with Pietro.

361
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:30,245
Make up an excuse.

362
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:34,005
Say you have to go to Florence
to get a book.

363
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,525
I'll make up an excuse for Eleonora.

364
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,005
Say yes.

365
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:50,325
I love you.

366
00:29:52,005 --> 00:29:53,765
I was happy.

367
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,884
I could feel the touch of his hands,

368
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:59,725
his kisses on every part of my body.

369
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:38,005
<i>The craving for pleasure</i>
<i>wouldn't calm down,</i>

370
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:42,045
<i>my thoughts were all about the day</i>
<i>I'd see him again.</i>

371
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:56,005
I'm an idiot.

372
00:30:56,644 --> 00:31:00,525
I forgot some books at home
that I need to correct the proofs.

373
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:04,565
Without them
I'll never make it for October.

374
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:06,884
I'll go get them tomorrow.

375
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,525
No, you stay here
with the girls, I'll go.

376
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:13,844
I like driving, I can easily go tomorrow.

377
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:19,485
You stay here, I'll leave tomorrow
morning and be back the next day.

378
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,084
You can come back tomorrow night.

379
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,965
Will you leave me in peace?

380
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,805
Can't I have a day off?

381
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:32,285
Maids get one, why can't I?

382
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,684
Don't get so worked up.

383
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:40,525
I said it because
I like driving and you don't.

384
00:31:40,604 --> 00:31:42,364
Can I come too?

385
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,725
No.

386
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,725
- You'll stay here with your sister.
- Why?

387
00:31:50,164 --> 00:31:54,525
So you can spend some time with Papa.

388
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,045
I'm going to take a shower.

389
00:33:34,325 --> 00:33:37,005
For me it was a unique experience,

390
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,644
for him a repetition.

391
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,485
<i>I thought of all the crazy things</i>
<i>he'd done for Lila.</i>

392
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,924
<i>I remembered how she fell to bits</i>
<i>when Nino left her.</i>

393
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:47,965
What's wrong?

394
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:51,525
Nothing.

395
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:54,965
<i>Did he only know how to love</i>
<i>in that excessive way?</i>

396
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:58,164
Tell me what's the matter.

397
00:33:58,644 --> 00:34:00,164
Nothing's the matter.

398
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:05,124
<i>Was that mad love of ours</i>
<i>a reproduction of other mad loves?</i>

399
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:09,924
What happened?

400
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:16,444
Is there something wrong with me?
With sex?

401
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:20,004
What do you mean?

402
00:34:20,085 --> 00:34:21,725
What I said.

403
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,044
Is there something
wrong with me with sex?

404
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,364
Like Lila?

405
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,884
You don't have to answer.

406
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:42,844
I didn't understand what you said.

407
00:34:42,924 --> 00:34:44,805
I was quoting you.

408
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:47,004
I never said anything like that.

409
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,325
You did, at the restaurant in Milan.

410
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:51,765
Anyway, I don't want to talk about Lila.

411
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:53,004
Why not?

412
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:54,285
I don't want to.

413
00:34:58,484 --> 00:34:59,805
Never mind.

414
00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:16,404
- It might be Pietro.
- Who cares?

415
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:24,285
Hello?

416
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:26,484
Elena, it's me. How are you?

417
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:29,245
Fine, you?

418
00:35:30,364 --> 00:35:32,685
Why are you whispering?
Is everything okay?

419
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:36,444
Everything's fine. How are you?

420
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:41,765
We're at the beach.
Hear the music? The girls are dancing.

421
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,484
We're fine.

422
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:45,364
- Will you put Elsa on?
- Yeah.

423
00:35:46,325 --> 00:35:49,325
Elsa, come here, it's Mamma.

424
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,245
<i>She doesn't want to come,</i>
<i>I'll put Dede on.</i>

425
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:58,404
Dede, come here, please.

426
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,884
Mamma's on the phone.

427
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:03,285
Hi, Mamma!

428
00:36:03,364 --> 00:36:04,805
How are you?

429
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:06,765
I'm dancing with Lucrezia and Bruno.

430
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:09,524
- When's she coming back?
- When are you coming back?

431
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:11,364
I'm coming back tomorrow.

432
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:12,364
Okay.

433
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:14,645
Go.

434
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:19,004
Will you be back tomorrow?

435
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,884
Yes, I'll be back tomorrow.

436
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:24,924
See you tomorrow, then.

437
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:27,205
Bye.

438
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,044
What a good wife.

439
00:36:43,884 --> 00:36:45,524
What a good mommy.

440
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:48,285
What about you?

441
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:12,805
In October, I have to go to Montpellier
for five days for a conference.

442
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:17,044
Have fun.

443
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:22,004
- Are you going with your wife?
- No, I want to go with you.

444
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:25,805
- That's impossible.
- Why?

445
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:30,364
Because I have two daughters

446
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:33,605
and I have to stay with them.

447
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,605
And us?

448
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,884
We're both married, Nino.

449
00:38:56,765 --> 00:38:58,884
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

450
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:03,605
If that's possible for you, fine,
for me it's not.

451
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:05,285
That's just talk.

452
00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:09,004
You've had a full life,

453
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:11,685
even without me.

454
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:15,364
You'll soon forget me.

455
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:18,125
Promise me you'll call me every day.

456
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,085
I'm not calling you anymore.

457
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:30,004
If you don't, I'll lose my mind.

458
00:39:32,685 --> 00:39:35,245
I'll lose my mind
if I keep thinking about you.

459
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:29,725
There's only one way
to go to Montpellier with you.

460
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:30,844
What?

461
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:32,884
Tell Pietro everything.

462
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:35,685
Are you really ready to do that?

463
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:37,765
Yes.

464
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:42,484
On the condition
that you tell Eleonora everything.

465
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:48,805
You can't ask me
to hurt Eleonora and the boy.

466
00:40:48,884 --> 00:40:50,645
Won't I hurt Pietro and my daughters?

467
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:53,085
Deciding means hurting people.

468
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:56,404
- Albertino's nearly four.
- Elsa's three.

469
00:40:57,765 --> 00:40:59,364
And you don't care about Dede?

470
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:04,564
Let's do it after Montpellier.

471
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:09,285
- Don't play with me.
- I'm not playing.

472
00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:12,165
If you're not playing,

473
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:14,805
then act accordingly.

474
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:19,884
Speak to your wife

475
00:41:19,964 --> 00:41:22,044
and I'll speak to my husband, tonight.

476
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,165
It's not that simple,

477
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:26,125
it'll take time.

478
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:28,964
Then let's end it here.

479
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:00,964
Eleonora is a fragile woman,

480
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:04,285
as a girl she attempted suicide
more than once.

481
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:06,884
I can't do this to her.

482
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,325
I don't want to understand anything.

483
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:13,245
You're saying it too:
better to end it here.

484
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:14,884
I'm not saying that.

485
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,964
I'm saying it'll take time,
it's a delicate situation

486
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:21,685
and we can do it after Montpellier.

487
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,364
Bear in mind
your father-in-law respects me

488
00:42:27,924 --> 00:42:30,085
and making our relationship public

489
00:42:30,165 --> 00:42:33,924
would lead to an irreparable break
with the Airotas none of us can afford.

490
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:38,325
I've already wasted too much time,
I should have realized it earlier.

491
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:41,004
What do you want to do?

492
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:45,645
Acknowledge that my marriage
is meaningless and go my own way.

493
00:42:46,285 --> 00:42:48,444
- Then, let's go to Montpellier.
- No.

494
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:52,924
I said my way, not yours.

495
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:56,524
- It's over between us.
- Don't be stupid.

496
00:42:56,605 --> 00:42:58,325
I'm not joking.

497
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:02,524
- You always make a fuss.
- I'm not joking.

498
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:05,285
We're so good together.

499
00:43:05,364 --> 00:43:07,564
No, you have to go, I'm not joking.

500
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:09,564
- I'm serious.
- Let's make love.

501
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:11,605
- No, you have to go.
- Five minutes.

502
00:43:12,524 --> 00:43:13,725
You have to go.

503
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:18,285
Nino! You have to go!

504
00:43:21,605 --> 00:43:23,444
I said you have to go.

505
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:48,844
You go first.

506
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:09,285
Nino didn't really want me.

507
00:44:09,364 --> 00:44:11,364
<i>He pretended a lot</i>
<i>and loved very little.</i>

508
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:16,404
<i>He wanted to fuck me</i>
<i>as he had done with countless others.</i>

509
00:44:18,444 --> 00:44:21,685
But loving me was not in his plans.

510
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:36,125
Hi.

511
00:44:39,524 --> 00:44:40,564
Look.

512
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:43,964
What are you doing?

513
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:47,884
I made 150 lire.

514
00:44:51,165 --> 00:44:53,484
I sold a sheep,

515
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:56,085
a giraffe...

516
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:59,125
and a shell.

517
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:01,125
Well done.

518
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:05,924
Why are you sad?

519
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:12,524
Because Grandma's not well.

520
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,924
Did you cry?

521
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:19,564
No, I didn't cry.

522
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,605
Let's go.

523
00:45:23,364 --> 00:45:25,285
Elsa, look who's here!

524
00:45:26,964 --> 00:45:28,165
Hi!

525
00:45:31,205 --> 00:45:32,404
A butterfly.

526
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:39,805
How are you?

527
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,564
Fine.

528
00:45:43,884 --> 00:45:46,165
- You haven't slept.
- I slept badly.

529
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:51,404
Did you find the books you needed?

530
00:45:53,404 --> 00:45:54,404
Yes.

531
00:45:56,325 --> 00:45:59,165
Where are they? Are they in there?

532
00:45:59,884 --> 00:46:01,524
No, they're at home.

533
00:46:02,404 --> 00:46:04,924
I checked what I needed to
and left them there.

534
00:46:05,484 --> 00:46:07,404
I'm going to take a shower.

535
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:14,805
We called you last night, Elsa wanted
to talk to you, but you weren't there.

536
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:17,085
It was hot, I went for a walk.

537
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:20,044
By yourself?

538
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:23,924
Who would I have gone with?

539
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:27,205
Just imagine,
Dede says you have a boyfriend.

540
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:38,524
Dede has a strong bond with you,

541
00:46:38,605 --> 00:46:40,645
she can't wait to replace me.

542
00:46:41,484 --> 00:46:43,964
Maybe she sees

543
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:46,564
and hears things I don't see and hear.

544
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:50,524
What do you mean?

545
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:52,245
What I said.

546
00:46:53,364 --> 00:46:57,645
If you want to add jealousy
to all your complaints, say so.

547
00:46:59,924 --> 00:47:02,165
No, I'm not jealous.

548
00:47:02,245 --> 00:47:03,285
Perfect.

549
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,765
I can't stand jealousy.

550
00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:09,044
Let's go.

551
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:19,165
What did he expect from me?

552
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:22,444
I loved Nino, I'd always loved him.

553
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:27,205
<i>How could I tear him</i>
<i>from my breast, my head, my belly?</i>

554
00:47:30,364 --> 00:47:33,765
<i>During the last days of the vacation</i>
<i>all I did was cry.</i>

555
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:38,645
<i>I said I was tired,</i>
<i>it was too hot, I had a headache.</i>

556
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:51,484
<i>Nino was probably</i>
<i>still in love with Lila.</i>

557
00:47:52,564 --> 00:47:55,444
<i>In the course of his life</i>
<i>he would love only her,</i>

558
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:57,884
like so many who had known her.

559
00:47:58,765 --> 00:48:01,884
<i>And because of this</i>
<i>he would stay with his wife forever.</i>

560
00:48:03,205 --> 00:48:05,325
His love for Lila was the guarantee

561
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:08,564
<i>no woman would ever</i>
<i>endanger that fragile marriage.</i>

562
00:48:09,844 --> 00:48:11,605
I least of all.

563
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:23,564
Everything okay?

564
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:26,285
Yes.

565
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:30,044
How's your mother?

566
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:31,964
My mother?

567
00:49:32,884 --> 00:49:35,004
Dede told me she's not well.

568
00:49:39,404 --> 00:49:40,964
She's better now.

569
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:45,685
I called her,

570
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,685
your mother's been in excellent health.

571
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:54,605
Do you think I'm blind, deaf?

572
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:59,004
You think I didn't notice
when you flirted

573
00:49:59,085 --> 00:50:01,765
with those morons
who came to the house?

574
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:04,364
Before Elsa was born.

575
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:07,364
What are you talking about?

576
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:11,004
You know perfectly well.

577
00:50:12,085 --> 00:50:13,325
No, I don't.

578
00:50:15,685 --> 00:50:18,844
Are you talking about people
who came to dinner years ago?

579
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:22,165
And I flirted with them? Are you crazy?

580
00:50:25,085 --> 00:50:28,285
And didn't you flirt
with that long-haired engineer?

581
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,524
Mario?

582
00:50:32,285 --> 00:50:33,685
See? You remember him.

583
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:37,245
Of course I remember him,
why shouldn't I?

584
00:50:39,285 --> 00:50:41,524
He's one of the few interesting people

585
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,765
who's been to the house
in seven years.

586
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:47,765
So you found him interesting?

587
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,484
What's wrong with that?

588
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:53,844
What's the matter with you tonight?

589
00:50:55,484 --> 00:50:57,245
I want to know.

590
00:50:58,444 --> 00:50:59,964
Can't I know?

591
00:51:01,165 --> 00:51:02,605
What do you want to know?

592
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,285
What I know, you know.

593
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:11,924
It must be four years since
we saw that guy, why bring him up now?

594
00:51:13,645 --> 00:51:15,924
Then let's talk about more recent things.

595
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:21,645
What is there between you and Nino?

596
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:34,765
No, Pietro.

597
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:50,484
Why did you ask me that?

598
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,085
You've spoiled everything.

599
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,725
Now there's nothing we can do.

600
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,964
If only you'd just stayed silent.

601
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:14,404
But you couldn't help yourself.

602
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,325
What should I do?

603
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:25,125
Should I go?

604
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:32,404
Do I have no choice but to go?

605
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:46,484
I've loved him since I was little.

606
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:53,085
When I was resigned
to never having him, he came back.

607
00:52:54,285 --> 00:52:58,444
All the dreariness, the bleakness
you plunged me into,

608
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:01,444
the loneliness you forced on me...

609
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:05,444
I couldn't help it.

610
00:53:12,524 --> 00:53:14,444
I love him, do you understand?

611
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:23,725
Have you made love?

612
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,484
Tell me.

613
00:54:05,844 --> 00:54:07,444
You're hurting me.

614
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:53,484
<i>I had lied to him</i>
<i>out of fear for the irreparable,</i>

615
00:54:53,564 --> 00:54:56,524
out of shame, out of despair.

616
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:59,285
WELCOME

617
00:54:59,645 --> 00:55:04,285
<i>Back in Florence, we reduced our</i>
<i>communication to the bare necessity,</i>

618
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:07,964
<i>using friendly tones</i>
<i>in front of the girls.</i>

619
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:12,524
<i>Pietro slept in his study,</i>
<i>I slept in the marriage bed.</i>

620
00:55:14,004 --> 00:55:17,685
<i>I couldn't decide what to do</i>
<i>and so I did nothing.</i>

621
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:21,444
Say goodbye to Mamma.

622
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:24,884
I'll get it.

623
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:30,805
<i>Nino hadn't called</i>
<i>and Montpellier was approaching.</i>

624
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:34,004
Hello?

625
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,004
Let's go, give me your hand.

626
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:53,205
Always the same trick, huh?

627
00:55:54,404 --> 00:55:55,924
See you later.

628
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:27,884
Hello?

629
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:30,805
Hi, Eleonora, it's Elena Greco.

630
00:56:31,325 --> 00:56:33,844
That slut Elena Greco?

631
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:36,165
Leave my husband alone!

632
00:56:36,245 --> 00:56:39,484
<i>You bitch, don't you dare</i>
<i>ever call here again!</i>

633
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:43,364
<i>As God is my witness,</i>
<i>I'll come and bash your brains out!</i>

634
00:56:43,444 --> 00:56:44,685
Slut!

635
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:06,484
I went from rage to unbridled joy.

636
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:10,564
<i>Nino wanted me to the extent</i>
<i>he had told his wife about us.</i>

637
00:57:10,645 --> 00:57:12,725
He'd ruined his marriage.

638
00:57:13,685 --> 00:57:16,205
So it was true, he loved me.

639
00:57:34,524 --> 00:57:35,605
Hello?

640
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:38,564
My marriage is over, I'm free.

641
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:42,805
<i>- Did you speak to Pietro?</i>
<i>- I've started to.</i>

642
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:45,165
<i>- You haven't told him?</i>
<i>- Yes and no.</i>

643
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:47,725
You want to back out?

644
00:57:48,884 --> 00:57:50,924
- No.
- Then hurry up, we have to leave.

645
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:55,205
I'll see you in Rome and we'll catch
the plane, I've arranged everything.

646
00:57:56,524 --> 00:57:58,725
And if I have problems with the girls?

647
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:00,364
Bring them with you.

648
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:02,404
Seriously?

649
00:58:03,484 --> 00:58:04,524
Yes.

650
00:58:05,884 --> 00:58:08,605
You'd take me with you,
even with the girls?

651
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:09,884
Of course.

652
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:12,484
It's a living hell at my house, Lenù.

653
00:58:12,564 --> 00:58:14,964
I'm afraid about what Eleonora might do.

654
00:58:17,884 --> 00:58:19,524
But you and I are stronger

655
00:58:19,605 --> 00:58:22,645
<i>and our union is</i>
<i>an unavoidable necessity.</i>

656
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:29,085
You really love me?

657
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,844
Yes.

658
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:37,884
Suddenly I felt invulnerable.

659
00:58:40,524 --> 00:58:44,685
<i>Pietro was not Stefano Carracci,</i>
<i>let alone Michele Solara.</i>

660
00:58:45,924 --> 00:58:50,205
<i>We would face each other down,</i>
<i>argue, explain ourselves,</i>

661
00:58:50,285 --> 00:58:52,924
<i>but in the end</i>
<i>we'd come to an agreement.</i>

662
00:58:53,484 --> 00:58:55,364
- Yes?
- May I?

663
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:57,285
Come in.

664
00:59:03,245 --> 00:59:04,645
May I speak to you?

665
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:07,165
Come in.

666
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:20,325
What are you working on?

667
00:59:21,884 --> 00:59:23,484
What is it, Elena?

668
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:31,364
I'm having an affair with Nino.

669
00:59:33,524 --> 00:59:34,924
Stop it.

670
00:59:37,645 --> 00:59:38,924
Pietro.

671
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:41,645
Enough, stop it.

672
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,364
You can't ignore it.

673
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:48,245
I'm telling you
I'm having an affair with Nino.

674
00:59:49,444 --> 00:59:52,605
When I came to Florence in August
it was to be with him.

675
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:55,884
But you told me something else.

676
00:59:56,205 --> 00:59:57,404
Pietro...

677
01:00:00,884 --> 01:00:02,165
Be reasonable.

678
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:06,125
You're telling me you have someone else
and I have to be reasonable?

679
01:00:12,205 --> 01:00:13,725
It's not true, Elena.

680
01:00:14,484 --> 01:00:17,524
- It's not true, you're wrong.
- It's true.

681
01:00:18,004 --> 01:00:20,125
- It's not true.
- Look at me, it's true.

682
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:22,245
- Tell me it's not true.
- It's true.

683
01:00:22,645 --> 01:00:24,645
It's not true, I said!

684
01:00:25,564 --> 01:00:29,004
We love each other,
we have to be together...

685
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:31,924
Stop! Shut up!

686
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,685
Just shut up!

687
01:00:35,085 --> 01:00:36,325
Stop!

688
01:00:40,645 --> 01:00:42,245
Don't speak!

689
01:00:44,605 --> 01:00:47,044
Now you go and tell your daughters.

690
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:48,725
Leave them out of it.

691
01:00:48,805 --> 01:00:52,205
If you've made up your mind,
you have to tell your daughters.

692
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:54,964
Leave the girls out of it,
they're little.

693
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:58,884
Then you're ashamed, you're not sure
of what you're doing. Let's go!

694
01:00:58,964 --> 01:01:01,605
- Let's talk about it.
- I said let's go!

695
01:01:01,685 --> 01:01:04,325
Leave the girls alone,
let's discuss it first.

696
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:05,765
Come with me.

697
01:01:05,844 --> 01:01:08,285
Why do you have
to bring them into it? They're little.

698
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,404
Girls!

699
01:01:10,444 --> 01:01:11,964
Your mamma
wants to tell you something.

700
01:01:15,484 --> 01:01:17,044
- I'm begging you.
- Tell Dede.

701
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:19,165
Explain it to her, she's the elder.

702
01:01:36,165 --> 01:01:39,285
Dede, your father
and I love each other...

703
01:01:42,884 --> 01:01:45,404
but we don't get along
and we want to separate.

704
01:01:45,484 --> 01:01:47,285
That's not true.

705
01:01:47,364 --> 01:01:50,484
Your mother wants to leave and
it's not true that we love each other.

706
01:01:50,564 --> 01:01:52,245
She doesn't love me anymore. Go on.

707
01:01:53,685 --> 01:01:55,165
It's not that simple.

708
01:01:56,484 --> 01:01:58,805
We can love each other
even if we don't live together.

709
01:01:58,884 --> 01:02:00,564
No, that's false!

710
01:02:00,645 --> 01:02:01,844
It's false.

711
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:05,404
If we love each other, we're a family
and we live under the same roof.

712
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:10,125
But we don't love each other anymore
and we're not a family anymore.

713
01:02:10,205 --> 01:02:13,165
If you tell lies,
what will she understand? Go on.

714
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:15,444
Go on, explain clearly

715
01:02:16,844 --> 01:02:19,484
the reasons why you want to go.

716
01:02:21,645 --> 01:02:23,325
I don't want to go.

717
01:02:25,605 --> 01:02:28,964
I'd never leave you,
you're the most important thing I have,

718
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:32,165
but I have problems with your father.

719
01:02:32,245 --> 01:02:33,364
Tell her.

720
01:02:33,444 --> 01:02:36,645
What are these problems?
You have to tell her.

721
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:39,564
You have to say them.
What are these problems?

722
01:02:39,645 --> 01:02:40,805
Listen, Dede.

723
01:02:42,165 --> 01:02:43,484
Go on.

724
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:50,444
I love someone else

725
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:54,085
and I want to live with him.

726
01:02:54,165 --> 01:02:55,524
His name?

727
01:02:57,085 --> 01:02:58,524
His name.

728
01:02:58,605 --> 01:03:00,524
The person's name!

729
01:03:02,765 --> 01:03:04,125
Tell Dede.

730
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:06,444
Tell her.

731
01:03:09,205 --> 01:03:11,125
What's his name? Are you ashamed?

732
01:03:12,844 --> 01:03:13,765
Nino?

733
01:03:16,685 --> 01:03:18,004
Even she knew.

734
01:03:20,605 --> 01:03:23,884
It's Nino. Your mother
wants to go and live with him.

735
01:03:28,924 --> 01:03:32,364
I figured it out,
but please, don't leave us.

736
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:35,325
No, sweetheart, I won't leave you.

737
01:03:36,165 --> 01:03:37,285
I won't leave you.

738
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:39,924
Sweetheart...

739
01:03:40,725 --> 01:03:44,044
I'm sorry you had
to hear all these things.

740
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:50,205
I'm only going away for five days,
then I'll be back

741
01:03:51,725 --> 01:03:53,805
and we'll see how it goes.

742
01:03:53,884 --> 01:03:55,444
All right?

743
01:03:55,524 --> 01:03:57,125
Are you lying to me?

744
01:03:57,605 --> 01:03:59,685
No, I'm not lying.

745
01:03:59,765 --> 01:04:02,685
They don't believe you either,
you're clearly not coming back.

746
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:04,484
It's not true.

747
01:04:10,004 --> 01:04:12,645
Why aren't you
taking me away with you?

748
01:04:13,605 --> 01:04:15,844
I'm only going away for five days.

749
01:04:17,205 --> 01:04:19,605
Then I'll come back, I'm not leaving you.

750
01:04:20,564 --> 01:04:22,844
I'll come back and we'll be together.

751
01:04:22,924 --> 01:04:24,765
I'd never leave you.

752
01:05:15,765 --> 01:05:19,165
<i>The next day, while Pietro</i>
<i>was at the university,</i>

753
01:05:19,245 --> 01:05:23,205
<i>I asked my neighbor if she'd look</i>
<i>after Dede and Elsa for a few hours.</i>

754
01:05:24,444 --> 01:05:26,605
They were confused times.

755
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:31,364
The old way people lived was dissolving

756
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:35,205
and with the books I had written,

757
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:37,805
with my very life, with Nino,

758
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:41,564
I was part of that dissolution.

759
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,085
Lenù.

760
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:13,924
Can I call you back?

761
01:06:14,004 --> 01:06:15,605
Are you busy?

762
01:06:16,404 --> 01:06:17,725
A little.

763
01:06:18,805 --> 01:06:20,484
They killed Manuela Solara.

764
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:23,645
Did you hear me?

765
01:06:26,364 --> 01:06:28,085
Who are you looking for?

766
01:06:35,765 --> 01:06:39,205
<i>Some say they slit her throat,</i>
<i>others say</i>

767
01:06:39,285 --> 01:06:41,325
they fired five gunshots at her,

768
01:06:41,404 --> 01:06:44,245
<i>others, that they beat her</i>
<i>and kicked her.</i>

769
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:50,725
<i>They say</i>
<i>she fell face down on the landing</i>

770
01:06:50,805 --> 01:06:52,605
and nobody noticed.

771
01:06:53,085 --> 01:06:55,004
The Solaras have gone crazy.

772
01:06:56,325 --> 01:06:58,805
They've called people
from all over Naples.

773
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:02,605
All their businesses have stopped,
not even I went to work today.

774
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:05,685
The neighborhood's scary,
you can barely breathe.

775
01:07:12,364 --> 01:07:15,004
I think
I'll send Gennaro to you tomorrow.

776
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:20,245
I know I'm taking advantage of you,
but I can't keep him here.

777
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:22,964
You're the only one I trust.

778
01:07:23,044 --> 01:07:24,844
Lila, I'm going away.

779
01:07:25,484 --> 01:07:26,645
I'm leaving my husband.

780
01:07:29,444 --> 01:07:31,444
My marriage is over.

781
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:37,404
I met Nino again and we realized
we've always loved each other.

782
01:07:38,844 --> 01:07:41,085
<i>Since we were kids,</i>
<i>without realizing it.</i>

783
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:48,444
So I'm leaving, starting a new life.

784
01:07:50,924 --> 01:07:52,524
Are you kidding?

785
01:07:52,605 --> 01:07:53,645
No.

786
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:01,444
Pietro's an extraordinary man.

787
01:08:02,004 --> 01:08:05,004
Good, extremely intelligent,
you're crazy to leave him.

788
01:08:05,844 --> 01:08:07,404
Think of the harm you'll do to your kids.

789
01:08:08,404 --> 01:08:12,044
I can't live with Pietro anymore
because I can't do without Nino.

790
01:08:13,245 --> 01:08:15,925
<i>We're leaving today,</i>
<i>we're flying to France.</i>

791
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:19,005
It's my first time in an airplane.

792
01:08:19,085 --> 01:08:21,925
You're throwing away
everything you are for Nino?

793
01:08:22,404 --> 01:08:24,845
You're ruining your family for him?

794
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:30,804
Don't do it, he'll use you.

795
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:35,965
He'll suck your blood,
he'll take away your will to live.

796
01:08:38,085 --> 01:08:39,404
And then he'll abandon you.

797
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:44,205
Why did you study so much?

798
01:08:44,285 --> 01:08:48,125
What use was it imagining
you'd live a wonderful life for me, too?

799
01:08:51,364 --> 01:08:52,845
I was wrong.

800
01:08:53,644 --> 01:08:55,364
You're just an idiot.

801
01:09:57,205 --> 01:09:58,764
Good morning.

802
01:10:09,724 --> 01:10:10,885
Please.

803
01:10:13,684 --> 01:10:15,005
Good morning.

804
01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:10,965
