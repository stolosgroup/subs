2
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,089
Stop kicking me!

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,370
- What kicking?
- Under the table.

4
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,649
When did I ever?

5
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:28,570
Dede, eat.

6
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,489
- I didn't do anything.
- Gennarino...

7
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,850
Stop it!

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,049
What? I didn't do anything.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,490
- You're older!
- Stop it.

10
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,570
Mamma, he's kicking me.

11
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,729
I'm not doing anything!

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,049
It's not true.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,490
I said that's enough!

14
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,929
Gennarino!

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,369
I didn't do it on purpose.

16
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,609
- What are you doing?
- I'm not hungry anymore.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,530
Don't move or you'll get hurt.

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,010
- Are you crazy?
- There's too much racket in this house.

20
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,049
I can't take any more!

21
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,209
Gennarino and Dede fight all the time.

22
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,370
So you smash the door?

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,890
Are you stupid?
I said not to walk on the glass.

24
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,170
Look, there's blood.

25
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,049
What's going on?

26
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,049
She stepped on the glass.

27
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,930
Go get a Band-Aid.

28
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,370
- Where are they?
- Where do you think? In the bathroom.

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,250
Does it hurt?

30
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,409
Don't worry,
we'll get a Band-Aid and it'll pass.

31
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,569
- Shall I put them here?
- No. Give me one.

32
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:03,250
Here.

33
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,530
- I don't want a Band-Aid, it hurts.
- It hurts?

34
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:13,569
It'll pass, don't worry.

35
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,770
<i>Lenù, how are you?</i>
<i>Everything okay with Gennarino?</i>

36
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,650
<i>I'm having difficulty, do me a favor</i>
<i>and come and get him.</i>

37
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,449
Can't you keep him longer?

38
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,490
No.

39
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,330
I have good news.

40
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,330
<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- I'm the head of technology.</i>

41
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,169
What does that mean?

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,969
Head of the IBM data processing center
Michele has rented.

43
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,210
You accepted Michele Solara's offer?

44
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,729
- Right, he's entrusted me with System 3.
- So, you're working for him again?

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,930
Like in the store at Piazza dei Martiri?

46
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,729
Wanna know how much I earn?
425,000 lire a month.

47
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,409
I have punch-card operators
working under me.

48
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:03,449
<i>- What's wrong?</i>
<i>- I'd never have expected it from you.</i>

49
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,770
- What was I supposed to do?
- Turn it down.

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,330
Why?

51
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:10,330
Because we know
what the Solaras are like.

52
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,889
Michele's been my boss before,

53
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,849
I was better off with him than
with that shithead Bruno Soccavo.

54
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,490
- Do what you want.
- I don't like your tone.

55
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,810
I earn more than Enzo who's a male.
What's wrong with it?

56
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:25,969
Nothing.

57
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,729
The revolution, workers, the new world?

58
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,490
- And all that bullshit?
- Stop it.

59
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,250
If you want to have
a real discussion, I'm in.

60
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,770
Otherwise, forget it.

61
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,849
Can I say something?

62
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,169
You always use "real" and "really"
when you speak and write.

63
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,930
Or you say "suddenly".

64
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,090
<i>When do people really talk?</i>
<i>When do things happen suddenly?</i>

65
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:53,650
It's all false.

66
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,289
One thing relates to another
and then another.

67
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,449
I don't do anything for real anymore

68
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,689
and I've learned
to consider things carefully.

69
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,969
Only idiots believe
things happen all of a sudden.

70
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,729
Good for you.

71
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,129
What are you trying to convince me of
with all these fine words?

72
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,569
That you're using Michele
and not the other way round?

73
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,569
<i>- Forget it.</i>
<i>- No, tell me what you think.</i>

74
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,649
<i>- I have nothing to say.</i>
<i>- Speak, or I will.</i>

75
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,050
Be my guest.

76
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,329
You criticize me but not your sister?

77
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,569
What about my sister?

78
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,850
Don't you know about Elisa?

79
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,490
What's to know?

80
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,649
Ask your mother, your father,
your siblings.

81
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,329
Take care, Lenù.

82
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,769
Papa, are we there yet?

83
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,410
Stop it!

84
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,689
Pietro, go around!

85
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,689
I can't! Can't you see?

86
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,970
Here you can, go!

87
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,689
Where? They're coming right at me!

88
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,810
Let me try, do you mind?

89
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:36,889
Not at all!

90
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,290
Like this, I'll go crazy.

91
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:41,850
You try.

92
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,889
- You can't drive on the wrong side!
- Here you can.

93
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,410
The girls are in the car!

94
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,730
You don't drive like this
in Florence, do you?

95
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,009
- What happened?
- Nothing, we're there.

96
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,050
So?

97
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,730
Gennarino, Dede!

98
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,649
- Hi, Enzo.
- All good, Lenù?

99
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,129
How did it go?

100
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,689
Did you learn to swim
or still using a floaty?

101
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,610
- Hi, Enzo.
- Hi, Dede.

102
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,970
Enzo, how are you?

103
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,129
- All good.
- Good.

104
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:50,769
We left our luggage at the hotel,
we freshened up.

105
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,649
- Bye.
- Bye, Gennarino.

106
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,889
They wore you out, huh?

107
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,370
They fought the whole time.

108
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,689
Dede's sad Gennaro's going home, but...

109
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:07,170
Tensions were too high,
I couldn't handle it anymore.

110
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,689
No need to say it.
Actually, we want to thank you.

111
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,930
You did us a huge favor.

112
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,810
You know what Lila's like.

113
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,850
Tell her
we'll get settled and I'll call her.

114
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,209
- We'll see each other later.
- Later?

115
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,929
Yeah, around the neighborhood.

116
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,929
Anyway, I'll tell her.

117
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,490
See you later.

118
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,889
Come, Gennarino.

119
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,210
Bye.

120
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,889
Look what lovely things
Granny bought you!

121
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,450
- We got some little presents.
- How do you come into it?

122
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,370
Lovely!

123
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,889
What a pretty dress.

124
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,649
Do you like it?

125
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,769
And this one.

126
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,490
Tear it open.

127
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,450
How lovely!

128
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,090
Another dress?

129
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,769
Couldn't you have
got her a doll, a Pinocchio?

130
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,570
Pinocchio? She's a girl!

131
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,490
- Thank Granny.
- Thank you.

132
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,889
"Thank you"? I want a kiss, a hug...

133
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,370
Thank you so much.

134
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,690
You didn't do us
the honor of sleeping at our house.

135
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,769
There are too many of us,
it didn't seem right.

136
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,889
We would have fit you in.

137
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,169
The hotel's better for us,

138
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,250
we've already left our luggage there.

139
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,090
What can I say?

140
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,330
Where are Peppe and Gianni?

141
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,289
We never see them.
They're always at work.

142
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,090
Where do they work?

143
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,169
Marcello found jobs for them.

144
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,929
Doing what?

145
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,210
They bring money home
and that's enough.

146
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:09,570
Elisa's not like you,
she cares about us.

147
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,129
Didn't you tell her I was coming today?

148
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,970
Why isn't she here too?

149
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,409
She's at her place.

150
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,009
- She doesn't live here anymore?
- No.

151
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,929
You told me they were together,
not that they live together.

152
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,049
She and Marcello have a nice apartment
in the new neighborhood.

153
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:43,370
They built new houses there,
you should see how nice!

154
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,129
What did you cook?

155
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,730
Nothing, you're here, so...

156
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,049
It seems a bit over the top.

157
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,690
Don't worry,
we never throw anything away.

158
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,850
I want to hear more about Elisa.

159
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,769
- What?
- For how long?

160
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,809
It must be about two months.

161
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,330
And you gave your permission?

162
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,450
Did you ever ask for our permission?

163
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,850
You did what you wanted
and so did she.

164
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,570
Pietro's not like Marcello Solara.

165
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:13,570
That's true,

166
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:18,289
Marcello would never let Elisa
treat him how you treat Pietro.

167
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,690
You should have told me,
you should have consulted me.

168
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:22,889
Why?

169
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:27,970
You left,
you said you'd think of us. All talk.

170
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,970
You did what you wanted,
you didn't give a damn about us.

171
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,169
I want to go and see her.

172
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,289
No, you just got here,
she's preparing a surprise for you.

173
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,210
I don't care. Where does she live?

174
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,570
This one. Tomorrow we'll wear this one.

175
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,490
It's got flowers on it.

176
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:54,210
What happened?

177
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:58,210
Not only is my sister engaged to
Marcello Solara, but they live together.

178
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,850
I'm going over to see her.

179
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,169
And I stay here alone?

180
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,289
Do you know who
Marcello and Michele Solara are?

181
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,850
They're camorristi.

182
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:19,009
My sister's engaged to a guy
who threatens people,

183
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,490
who extorts storekeepers
and makes loans that'd ruin anyone.

184
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:26,009
The Solaras beat people up,

185
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,450
maybe they get people killed
or do it themselves.

186
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:30,250
Now what do you say?

187
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,330
I'll go with you.

188
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:35,529
No, you stay with the girls,
I'll see you later.

189
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,929
What are camorristi?

190
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,970
Want to play? Let's play a game.

191
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,889
I'd like to get some cool air, Lila.

192
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,929
<i>What would have seemed acceptable</i>
<i>in Milan or Florence,</i>

193
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:49,250
<i>a woman's free use</i>
<i>of her own body and her desires,</i>

194
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,929
living together outside marriage,

195
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:54,649
<i>in the neighborhood</i>
<i>seemed inconceivable.</i>

196
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,330
And my mother was happy.

197
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,610
<i>She, who was furious</i>
<i>because I had a civil marriage</i>

198
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,690
and not a religious ceremony,

199
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,450
<i>she, who considered Lila a slut</i>
<i>for living with Enzo</i>

200
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,409
<i>and Ada a whore</i>
<i>for being Stefano's mistress,</i>

201
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:16,649
<i>she accepted her youngest daughter</i>
<i>sleeping with Marcello Solara.</i>

202
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,450
A bad person.

203
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,409
YOUR MEMORY WILL LIVE AMONG US

204
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,690
CARRACCI GROCERS

205
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:38,610
Lenù!

206
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,649
Come in.

207
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,769
You're hurting me.

208
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,289
Hold on.

209
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,769
Come in.

210
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,250
I'm glad.

211
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,970
You look well.

212
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,450
You too.

213
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,370
How are the girls?

214
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,250
I can't wait to see them.

215
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,330
They've grown.

216
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,570
Dede talks like a little miss now
and Elsa has a temper...

217
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,450
What pretty earrings.

218
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,490
You're so elegant.

219
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:41,809
Try them on.

220
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:42,970
Really?

221
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,690
They suit me too, don't they?

222
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,170
You can have them.

223
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:10,009
Really?

224
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,849
Of course.

225
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,410
You look good.

226
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,690
I thought you'd come to tell me off,

227
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,369
to say you're against me and Marcello.

228
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,569
I'm absolutely against it.

229
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,930
Why are you against it?

230
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:46,809
- The Solaras are bad people.
- Marcello isn't.

231
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,769
When you were pregnant with Elsa,
Mamma visited you

232
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:55,210
and I was left with the whole family
on my shoulders.

233
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,490
Once I went shopping
at the Solaras' supermarket

234
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:04,769
and Rino said to me: "Leave the list,
we'll deliver it for you."

235
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,009
Marcello greeted me from a distance
as if to say: "I told him to do it."

236
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:12,410
From that moment on
you can't imagine how much kindness,

237
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,410
not even once did he behave
in a vulgar way like a Solara.

238
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:19,450
Why that face?
Don't you believe me?

239
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,930
It's all so clear.

240
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,289
He'll use you, he'll get sick
of your body and drop you.

241
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,849
That's not true.

242
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,849
Marcello loves me, if you don't
believe it, there's nothing I can do.

243
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,490
Since people see me with him,
my life has changed.

244
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:38,410
Everyone treats me like a queen,
they pay attention to me.

245
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,970
Of course, you're used to it.

246
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,730
You wrote a book, you're famous.

247
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,809
But I'm not, I was thrilled.

248
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,849
Please,

249
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,650
don't be harsh on Mamma and Papa.

250
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,690
You know what they're like.

251
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,890
They're on my side
and so are our brothers.

252
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,369
So why don't you get married?

253
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,769
We are getting married.

254
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:07,210
Marcello has to tie up
some complicated business first,

255
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,289
but as soon as it's taken care of,
we'll get married.

256
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:16,289
Be careful, Elisa.

257
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,170
Don't get lost.
And if anything happens, call me.

258
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,009
- Where are you going?
- The girls are at home.

259
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,210
Didn't Mamma say anything?

260
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,849
Everyone's coming here for lunch.

261
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,690
- Who's everyone?
- Everyone.

262
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,049
- Hello.
- Elisa!

263
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,730
- Hi.
- Hi, Pietro!

264
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,450
I nearly didn't recognize you.

265
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:45,890
- See what lovely young ladies?
- Yes.

266
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,369
Hi, Mamma.

267
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,250
I was roped into it.

268
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,410
As soon as I've figured out
what's going on, I'll tell you.

269
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,450
Look what we brought.

270
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,049
I'll put them here,
you take them into the kitchen.

271
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,329
Are we really getting lots of presents?

272
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,970
Of course! We'll find something.

273
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,529
- Sit next to me today.
- Don't bore him to death!

274
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,529
- I'm not gonna eat him...
- It's what you do.

275
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,650
- We get on.
- Sure, we get on.

276
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,210
So nice and chubby!

277
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:17,890
You know we have the same name?

278
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,809
Her name's Elsa, not Elisa.

279
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:22,730
Whatever, it's the same thing.

280
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,490
Go and sit on the couch.

281
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:27,329
- Elisa, what can I do?
- Set the table.

282
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,369
With this stuff you prepared?

283
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,130
She's so gorgeous!

284
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,849
Turn it down! Are you deaf?

285
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,170
You turn it down,
you're already standing.

286
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,170
What are they saying?

287
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,130
They're speaking in Neapolitan dialect.

288
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,450
Ah, okay.

289
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,690
You thought your father had changed?

290
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:59,089
- Hi, Gigliola.
- Hello.

291
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,690
Give it to me.

292
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:02,809
- Hello, signora.
- How are you?

293
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,730
- Good, you?
- Not too bad.

294
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:06,609
Come into the kitchen.

295
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,849
Hello.

296
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,410
He's grown so much.

297
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,089
How are you, Gigliola?

298
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,529
Listen, sweetie,
I'm fine, you're fine, we're all fine.

299
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,650
If my husband
hadn't ordered me to come here,

300
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,250
I would have stayed at home,
just to be clear.

301
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:27,410
We came to pay homage
to you professors.

302
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,410
That's the genius of the university?

303
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:34,970
Holy crap, what nice hair
your husband has!

304
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,690
It's a pleasure, Pietro.

305
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,690
No, please stay seated,

306
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:42,490
no one has ever stood up here
to greet a lady.

307
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,930
Hello, Vittorio.

308
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,690
So you see, Pietro...

309
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,609
Maria, come and get the baby.

310
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,130
Give her the baby.

311
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:54,730
- You want a hand, Imma?
- Thank you.

312
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,009
- What's her name?
- Elsa.

313
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,650
Elsa? What a nice name!

314
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,809
Lenù, take it.

315
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,529
Do you like the house?

316
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,130
Did you speak to your sister?

317
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,089
Napkins, plates.

318
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,250
- You wanna play?
- Yes. Can I?

319
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:20,410
Go. Don't get sweaty, be careful.

320
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:35,690
- How do I look?
- Good.

321
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,970
- Hi, Gigliola.
- Elisa.

322
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,529
She's all demure.

323
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,569
Hello!

324
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,490
Come in, Mamma. I'm so pleased!

325
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:46,730
Hi, Michele.

326
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:48,730
Immacolata, you're already here!

327
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:51,049
I brought some food. Congratulations!

328
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,130
Thank you for the invitation,
we were so pleased.

329
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,329
I'm glad you're here.

330
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,769
Congratulations, peace, health and luck,
what I wish for myself.

331
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,170
Thank you! You're such a dear.

332
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,609
- Hello, Marcello.
- Don Vittorio, how are you?

333
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,730
Elena!

334
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:10,849
You're so beautiful.
Beautiful like your sister.

335
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,329
My mother-in-law turned 60 today.

336
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,769
Who's he?

337
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:18,650
Lenuccia's husband.

338
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,329
- The professor.
- Pietro.

339
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,970
Pleasure, congratulations.

340
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,009
- Professor, it's all settled.
- Good.

341
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,609
It's hot.

342
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,089
Bring the bottles into the kitchen.

343
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,890
- I'll keep going.
- I'll help you.

344
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,250
No, it's your birthday, I'll do it!

345
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:37,009
Hi, Michele.

346
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,690
Hi, Lenù.

347
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:43,970
He hurt me.

348
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,690
I didn't do anything!

349
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:48,730
Sure, like I don't know
you're a delinquent!

350
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,730
Leave him alone.

351
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,329
- What are you eating?
- Cutlets.

352
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,890
Go in there, then.

353
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,650
I'll go.

354
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:02,970
It's you, hello.

355
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,410
Put them here.
Your luggage has arrived.

356
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,009
Did you get it from the hotel?

357
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:11,289
No way you're staying in a hotel,
we have so many rooms.

358
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,369
Don't make me cross.

359
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,569
Take them back
where you got them.

360
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,490
Don't you dare.

361
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:20,609
C'mon, Lenù, I'm really happy
to host you in my home.

362
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,130
- It's a great honor for me.
- What?

363
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,930
Anyway I asked your husband
for permission.

364
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:30,210
- I wouldn't have taken the liberty.
- Pietro, we can't stay here.

365
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,849
You're happy to stay?
Then, take the suitcases inside.

366
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,809
She'll show you where.

367
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,970
May we?

368
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,450
Hello.

369
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,569
- Kiddo!
- Where's Dede?

370
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,970
- They're all in the kitchen.
- Go.

371
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,849
- Hi, Lenù.
- Hi, Gennarino.

372
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,849
- Hi, Lila.
- Hello.

373
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,849
- Hi, Enzo.
- Hi, Lila.

374
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,690
- Hi, Lila!
- Hi.

375
00:24:56,089 --> 00:24:57,329
Hi, Enzo.

376
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,210
How are you?

377
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:03,170
- This is Lenù's husband.
- It's a pleasure, Lila.

378
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,130
- Pietro, my pleasure.
- Hi, Lenù.

379
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,690
Now that the other
little queen's arrived, shall we sit?

380
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,250
The kids have already eaten, I'm hungry.

381
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:15,089
Let's sit down, it's ready.

382
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,970
We're one chair short.

383
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:18,930
Marcello, where do I sit?

384
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:21,970
- I told you to get the chairs.
- I'll sit here.

385
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,569
You gotta taste this, my mamma made it.

386
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,450
No, I can't fit anything else in.

387
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:08,890
Tell me if it's good. Mamma never
makes it for us, right, Lenù?

388
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,009
Let's try it.

389
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,970
- Mamma, is it true you never make it?
- Of course I do!

390
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,369
Silvio!

391
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,490
Go eat dessert in there!

392
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,049
Leave him alone.

393
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,930
Pietro, give me your plate,
I made parmigiana for you.

394
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,049
Where did you get the wine?

395
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,650
Do you like it?

396
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,130
It's from a friend in Caserta.

397
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,089
Don't you think
we need to buy a new setting?

398
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,369
Marcello, these plates are no good.

399
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,569
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, Mamma.

400
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,089
May you live to a hundred! To Mamma!

401
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,809
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you, professor.

402
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,970
You're not from here
so you can't know our mother's merits.

403
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:57,450
We're good people,
my grandfather started the bar,

404
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,250
my father slowly grew it
into a pastry shop

405
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,170
renowned in all of Naples.

406
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,289
Also thanks to Spagnuolo,
my wife's father.

407
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,609
But we owe everything to our mother.

408
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,289
People who don't like us
have spread ugly rumors about her,

409
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:16,690
but we're used to being in business,
to being patient.

410
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:19,089
Besides, the truth always wins out.

411
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,769
The truth is
this woman is very intelligent,

412
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,289
she's strong, she's always worked
and never enjoyed anything.

413
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,130
And she did it all for her sons.

414
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,329
Michele's a golden son,
but he has a defect, he likes to talk.

415
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,890
And he overdoes it.

416
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,369
No, Mamma,
everything he said was true.

417
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,009
No one knows
how generous my mother is.

418
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,329
- She's beautiful too, right?
- Yeah, beautiful...

419
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,970
You know you're beautiful.

420
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,170
Today we're here, first,
to give a proper welcome

421
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,329
to these two important professors.

422
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,690
Second, to celebrate
my mother's birthday.

423
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:56,970
Third,

424
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,490
to wish Elisa and my brother
much happiness

425
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:01,730
and a wedding as soon as possible.

426
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,049
And fourth, if I may,

427
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,329
I'd like to toast
to a deal I thought I'd never make,

428
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,569
but instead it's moving ahead
very satisfactorily.

429
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,890
Lenù, don't take offense,
you're smart, you've come a long way,

430
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,769
you've been in the newspapers,

431
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,289
we've known you since
we were kids, we're proud of you.

432
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,970
But I'm sure you'll also agree,

433
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,769
there's only one woman here
equal to my mother.

434
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,690
Lila has a living thing in her head
that none of us have.

435
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,329
A thing that, if she's in a bad mood,
can hurt people,

436
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,450
but if she's in a good mood
it can leave people in awe.

437
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,690
I've wanted to buy this for a long time.

438
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,769
Yes, buy, like you do
with pearls and diamonds.

439
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,930
Come here, Lila.

440
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:04,210
Until a few months ago
it didn't seem possible,

441
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,730
but now we've taken
a great step forward.

442
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,730
I want to drink a toast to this.

443
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,970
Signora Cerullo runs
the data processing center

444
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:17,609
where poor Soccavo's
sausage factory was,

445
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,170
may he rest in peace.

446
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:23,410
It's fascinating
and if you'll do me the honor,

447
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,970
I'd like to invite you
to visit it tomorrow.

448
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,170
Am I right, Lila?

449
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,369
Michele thinks I do Lord knows what,
but that's bullshit.

450
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,410
Even I learned it
and I only went up to fifth grade.

451
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,609
She always wants to be right. A toast!

452
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,970
To beautiful things.

453
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:50,329
I'd be very curious to visit it.

454
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,690
I can take you tomorrow.

455
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:54,569
- Marcello will take you.
- Not a problem.

456
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,369
And you must tell me
all about your work.

457
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,049
It's a set of machines...

458
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,690
- Lenù, I gotta tell you something.
- What?

459
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:04,930
Have you ever been in an airplane?

460
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,650
The airplane story again!

461
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,369
She doesn't know.

462
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,690
It's amazing.

463
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:15,569
We went to Germany,
I went with him for work.

464
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,569
At first I was scared
because it jolted me around,

465
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:24,009
but then I saw white clouds,
blue sky, the colors of the earth

466
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,250
and I discovered that above the clouds
the weather is always good.

467
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,529
- Guess who we met in Düsseldorf.
- That's right!

468
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:32,809
We didn't tell her.

469
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,890
- I don't know.
- Antonio.

470
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:38,089
- He says hi.
- Is he well?

471
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,930
Melina's Antonio?

472
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:43,049
- He gave me something for you.
- Go get it.

473
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,769
Who's Antonio?

474
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:48,009
An employee of ours.

475
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:49,930
One of your wife's boyfriends.

476
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,650
What a blabbermouth.

477
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,369
Anyway, times have changed,

478
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:59,049
today women have lots of boyfriends
and they brag about it more than men do.

479
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:04,289
- How many girlfriends have you had?
- I've only ever loved my wife.

480
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:06,130
C'mon, we're family.

481
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,450
C'mon!

482
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:09,609
We're family!

483
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:11,329
It's true.

484
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,609
Shall I whisper to you
how many I've had?

485
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,609
Go ahead.

486
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,329
That's incredible.

487
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:23,890
Professor,
my brother's had all of Naples.

488
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,609
He's joking!

489
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,609
- Didn't you know?
- No.

490
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,890
- Are you happy?
- Very happy.

491
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,410
- Did you know?
- No.

492
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,650
It's the book Lenuccia wrote,
but with the words in German.

493
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,730
See how famous she is? Well done!

494
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,650
Pass me the book.

495
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,650
All you can understand is "Elena Greco".

496
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,009
I have it now.
Do you speak German too?

497
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,170
No.

498
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,529
So don't be a pain in the ass,
let me look at it!

499
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,490
Let her look at it.

500
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:15,930
Well done, Lenù.

501
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:19,089
For everything, you deserve it.

502
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,450
Your book, your husband, your girls...

503
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,890
What you have, you deserve it,
you worked hard,

504
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,089
without hurting anyone or making passes
at other people's husbands.

505
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:36,970
Thank you.

506
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:42,450
- Sorry, but I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

507
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:43,529
Silvio!

508
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:46,089
- What happened?
- Is she ever trouble...

509
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,690
Gigliola, where are you off to?

510
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:50,250
She always ruins my day.

511
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:51,690
Hurry up.

512
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,809
First let's eat the cake
your father made.

513
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,130
Move.

514
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,089
There's still dessert.

515
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,569
We'll eat dessert and then we'll go.

516
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,890
Sit down this instant!

517
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,529
Gigliola...

518
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,410
let's go get dessert.

519
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:14,650
Stay close to Papa.

520
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,170
I'm sorry, professor.

521
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,529
Don't mind her.

522
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,650
Enjoy the cake.

523
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:36,210
- Would you like anything else?
- No, thanks.

524
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,809
Let's clear the table
and put the cake here.

525
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,450
- Lila, do you want to see it?
- No.

526
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,609
Gennarino, come here.

527
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,289
Where have we ended up?

528
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:09,329
How could you allow them
to move us here?

529
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:11,449
How did I know what they were like?

530
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,329
No, Pietro, you never listen to me.

531
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,489
How often have I told you
where I come from?

532
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,690
If he invites me so arrogantly,
how can I get out of it?

533
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:22,769
Come on!

534
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:28,610
Even your parents said:
"Professor, say yes!"

535
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,409
You let them walk all over you.

536
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,570
You only put your foot down
with educated people.

537
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,929
Maybe because educated people
don't force you to stay with them.

538
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,929
How can I trust you?

539
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,489
I leave you for a moment
and look what you do.

540
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,889
Come on, we'll leave early.

541
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:08,369
I can't even trust your mother anymore.

542
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,730
The book came out in Germany
two years ago and I had no idea.

543
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,969
Tomorrow you'll call my mother
and the publisher

544
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,210
and ask for an explanation.

545
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,530
Anyway, I had fun.

546
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,130
Your mother's smart, kind.

547
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,889
Your father's so affectionate
that it almost embarrasses me.

548
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,449
Elisa...

549
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,369
she loves you so much!

550
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:37,489
Gigliola...

551
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,010
She's a caged animal.

552
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,929
No.

553
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,650
She's so authentic.

554
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,409
Enzo doesn't talk too much.

555
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,130
Enzo's like that.

556
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,329
Yes, I remember in Florence.

557
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:55,010
But he has kind eyes.

558
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:58,889
Unlike the others.

559
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:02,210
The Solaras?

560
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,130
They're a couple of crooks,
they really have...

561
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,650
sly, evil faces.

562
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,050
They're a couple of criminals.

563
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,730
And they manage to be likable.

564
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:16,610
Incredible.

565
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,369
Then? Who else?

566
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,250
Lila.

567
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,170
Lila's the one
who disturbed me the most.

568
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:30,969
You spoke to her the whole time.

569
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:34,570
Can I tell you what I think?

570
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,650
I think Lila's the worst.

571
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,409
She's definitely smart,

572
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:48,369
charming, I won't deny it.

573
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:50,809
But she's...

574
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,969
it's as if her intelligence sows discord.

575
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:57,690
It's an evil intelligence,

576
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,289
like her charm.

577
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,250
And then I don't understand

578
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,849
how you can define her as your friend.

579
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:12,050
Elena, I think she detests you.

580
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:14,849
Why?

581
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,690
I don't know, the way she looks at you,

582
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:21,090
the way she relates to you.

583
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:28,849
I don't understand how
your relationship's lasted so long.

584
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:34,050
Maybe you carefully
hide from each other

585
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,650
things that could ruin it?

586
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,369
Either I don't understand
a thing about Lila

587
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:45,090
or I don't understand a thing about you.

588
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,809
This is a little more concerning.

589
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:51,849
Then...

590
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:53,809
What?

591
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,889
Lila and that Michele...
it shows, they're made for each other.

592
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,570
I think they're already lovers.

593
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,409
And if they're not, they soon will be.

594
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:13,050
What nonsense.

595
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,289
You think you know everything,

596
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:19,250
but you don't understand
a thing about Lila.

597
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,050
Don't ever speak
about her like that again.

598
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,289
Good night.

599
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,050
Lila had made an impression,

600
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,170
<i>Pietro had understood</i>
<i>how exceptional she was,</i>

601
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,690
<i>it had frightened him so much</i>
<i>that now he needed to dismiss her.</i>

602
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:29,170
You understand German now?

603
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,130
I understand everything before you do.

604
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,289
The book's better
in German than in Italian.

605
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,250
Try it.

606
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:00,690
It's tasty.

607
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:02,809
You tore up Antonio's present?

608
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,889
Now you'll eat it all!

609
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,369
What's wrong,
you don't even like it in German?

610
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,409
Would you like some oil? A pinch of salt?

611
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,210
How come you chose
to invest in this field?

612
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,489
I don't know!

613
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:11,010
As soon as we accomplish something,
my brother's onto the next thing.

614
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,809
- And you play along?
- What can I do?

615
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:20,489
I heard you have business
in Germany.

616
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,570
In Germany or in Italy it doesn't matter,

617
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,849
it's one world and it's all the same.

618
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:28,050
I'm more communist
than the communists,

619
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,409
more revolutionary
than the revolutionaries.

620
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:32,730
I think everything
should start all over again.

621
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:35,050
And if it starts again,
I'll be in the front row.

622
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,369
But love is the most important thing.

623
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,210
What can you do!

624
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,650
Here, professor.

625
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,250
Here's the thing Michele rented.

626
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:54,889
I can hear a weird hum,
is it always there?

627
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:57,409
It's the sound of electronics,

628
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:00,849
I can't stand it,
that's why I never come here.

629
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:04,170
I wonder what all these buttons...

630
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,170
Don't even try, it's complicated stuff.

631
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,969
Lila, Enzo know all about it.

632
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,250
You know what I like, professor?

633
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,329
- What?
- Walking around the neighborhood.

634
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:21,769
Going to visit my mom,
and as soon as it's possible,

635
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,769
going home to Elisa.

636
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,929
Nothing beats knowing
that she's waiting for me.

637
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,530
That she's cooked for me,
that we'll talk about our day.

638
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,289
I mean, do you understand?

639
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:39,929
- Signora Cerullo...
- Be quiet! Just do what I asked!

640
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,530
You're here.

641
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:47,849
The professor wanted to understand
how this thingamajig works.

642
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,929
It's not a thingamajig, it's a machine.

643
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,530
There are so many things
to explain in here.

644
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,570
Magnetic cards, tapes, elaborations.

645
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,929
Hi, Lenù.

646
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:03,929
Enzo explained it one night,

647
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,650
I was curious to see it working.

648
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,210
Yes, but now I'd like
to talk to my friend.

649
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:11,289
Maria, let's see if you've learned,

650
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:13,170
explain the computer to the professor.

651
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,969
Then show me if you understood

652
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,050
and if you haven't
I'll deal with Maria later.

653
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:19,809
Come with me.

654
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,969
Do you like it?

655
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:39,809
My compliments.

656
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,210
My compliments to you, Lenù.

657
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:51,090
You have a handsome
and smart husband.

658
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:55,889
He speaks like he's religious
even though he's not,

659
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:58,170
he knows all the ancient
and modern things.

660
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,730
Yesterday he told me
heaps of things about Naples.

661
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,610
I was embarrassed,
I'm Neapolitan and I didn't know them.

662
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,210
How did you find Gennarino?

663
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,929
He's grown, he speaks more.

664
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,090
He told me all about
when you were at the beach.

665
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,570
What did he tell you?

666
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,170
Was he supposed to tell me
anything in particular?

667
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,289
No, nothing.

668
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:28,929
I'm glad he enjoyed himself.

669
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,130
Enzo?

670
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,329
We work a lot and hardly see
each other, but it's fine.

671
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,610
Did you hear about Stefano?

672
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:38,690
He lost everything.

673
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:42,449
He brought it on himself.

674
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,409
The carabinieri found him
with stolen goods

675
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:49,329
and they arrested him.

676
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:51,849
He's out, but he has to be careful.

677
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:53,769
He has nothing.

678
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,650
I give him money,
not the other way round.

679
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:00,329
How things change!

680
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:06,650
If I'd stayed with him, I'd be flat
on my ass like all the Carraccis.

681
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,889
And instead I'm Raffaella Cerullo

682
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:12,650
and I run this center for Michele Solara
for 425,000 lire a month.

683
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:16,010
As a result
my mother treats me like a queen,

684
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,170
my father's forgotten everything,
my brother sucks money out of me,

685
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,369
Pinuccia says she loves me so much

686
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,730
and her kids even call me "auntie dear".

687
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,250
The things that happen
when there's money involved!

688
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:35,849
One day I'll be reduced to diagrams,

689
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,969
I'll become a punch card myself
and you won't be able to find me.

690
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:43,570
- What an ugly thing, a restless mind!
- Don't you like your job?

691
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,329
It's boring, the opposite
of what it seemed at first.

692
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,849
Here's hoping
the new machines arrive soon,

693
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,210
they'll be much faster.

694
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,130
Or not.

695
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:03,570
Speed mars everything.

696
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,809
Like when photographs come out blurry.

697
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:09,210
Alfonso used that expression.

698
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:12,090
You know, he tells me
all about his friendships?

699
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,250
I know you're the only one he talks to.

700
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:25,849
Alfonso wants to be my friend,
but he'd like to be my carbon copy.

701
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:29,130
He'd like to be a woman like me.

702
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,690
I told him: "You're a man,
you know nothing about me.

703
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:35,530
Even if you copy me, study me,
you'll know nothing."

704
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,769
You know what he confessed to me?

705
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:43,210
- That he's always loved Michele.
- Michele?

706
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:44,769
Michele Solara, yes.

707
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,489
He wishes Michele liked him
the way he likes me.

708
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,610
I said: "All right, we'll be friends,

709
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,730
but don't think you can be
a woman like me,

710
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:01,250
you'd only be a woman
the way men see us.

711
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,849
You can copy me, you can do
an exact portrait of me,

712
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,570
but my shit will always be mine."

713
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,809
I'd like to go and see how he's doing.

714
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,329
How are you doing?

715
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:30,130
Did you congratulate Elisa?

716
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,969
Do you sleep well at Marcello's house?

717
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,530
You glad the old witch made it to 60?

718
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,530
If it's what my sister wants,
what can I do? Bust her head open?

719
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,050
See?

720
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,690
In fairy tales you do what you want,
in life, what you can.

721
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:50,050
That's why you let Michele use you?
There was no need.

722
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,889
I'm using him, not the other way around.

723
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,769
Dream on.

724
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,130
Wait and see.

725
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,929
What do I have to see?

726
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,369
I don't like it when you do this.

727
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:05,010
- You're out of touch with us, be quiet.
- What do you mean?

728
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,289
I can criticize you
only if I live in Naples?

729
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:10,769
Naples, Florence,
you're not doing anything anywhere.

730
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,769
- Who says so?
- The facts.

731
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,929
I know my facts, not you.

732
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,969
You make me angry
and I say things I don't mean.

733
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,570
You did well to leave Naples.

734
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,130
Do you know who's come back?

735
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:36,170
Who?

736
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:38,329
Nino.

737
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:41,250
How do you know?

738
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:45,210
Marisa told me.
He got tenure at the university.

739
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,929
Didn't he like it in Milan?

740
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,929
He married a woman
related to Banco di Napoli big shots

741
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:55,010
and they have a one-year-old boy.

742
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,730
- Do you intend to see him?
- No.

743
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,769
But if I run into him
I wanna tell him Gennaro's not his son.

744
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,929
<i>I should have said:</i>
<i>"Do you want to take Nino back again?</i>

745
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:21,809
I know what you'll do,

746
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:26,409
<i>you'll leave Enzo,</i>
<i>divorce Stefano and marry Nino.</i>

747
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:30,969
<i>You'll pool your brains and become</i>
<i>who knows what together."</i>

748
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,289
But I didn't say a word.

749
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,570
Why was I feeling so anxious?

750
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,250
Because of Lila, because of her pride.

751
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,130
<i>Just the sight of her</i>
<i>made me aggressive.</i>

752
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,969
What a bad dream I'd had.

753
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:16,170
I didn't like myself, not one bit.

754
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,369
<i>I told myself:</i>
<i>"You have to accept her as she is.</i>

755
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:38,010
<i>And if you can't be kind</i>
<i>and affectionate, learn how.</i>

756
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,010
That's how you have to become."

757
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:47,050
<i>To become was a verb</i>
<i>I'd always been obsessed by,</i>

758
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,489
but I only realized it on that occasion.

759
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,170
<i>I wanted to become something,</i>
<i>but I never knew what.</i>

760
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:59,610
<i>I just feared Lila would become</i>
<i>someone and I'd be left behind.</i>

761
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,530
- Mamma, can we play?
- No, sweetheart, I'm tired.

762
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,210
Mamma's tired, leave her in peace.

763
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:08,929
- I'll play with you, all right?
- Yes.

764
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:21,730
My becoming had actually been

765
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:24,210
becoming in her wake.

766
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:28,369
<i>I had to start becoming again,</i>
<i>but only for myself,</i>

767
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:33,730
<i>as an adult</i>
<i>and detached from her for good.</i>

768
