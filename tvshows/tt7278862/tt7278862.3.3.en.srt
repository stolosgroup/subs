3
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,229
Is she asleep?

4
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,869
She's not well.

5
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,309
She left the factory.

6
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,589
She has to stop working now.

7
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,069
Lila has a bad life, it's true,

8
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,429
like everyone who's exploited.

9
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,709
She'll die at this rate.

10
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:05,070
Lila's destined to do so much,
she can't stop now.

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,951
The struggle at the Soccavo factory
is serious.

12
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,151
These fights are happening
all over the world...

13
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,591
You're always lecturing people!

14
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:19,271
We're all aware of the facts,
but this is about Lila's health.

15
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,831
Lila's health...

16
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:25,751
For a little fever, your friend gets
to stay home like a lady?

17
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:29,271
- Like you are now.
- What am I?

18
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,593
An intellectual.

19
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,033
So what?

20
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:38,313
A petty bourgeois who cares more
about her friend than the working class.

21
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:43,393
Lots of workers
can wage war on Soccavo.

22
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:48,674
I knew there was something strange,

23
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:52,674
that she was in trouble,
that she was wearing down.

24
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:54,474
Lila's really ill.

25
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,634
She was right to quit.

26
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:05,474
Drive me home.

27
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:08,475
Let's go.

28
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:10,716
Enzo...

29
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:12,515
I'll see you out.

30
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,756
Keep Pasquale away from Lila.

31
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,957
<i>Lila seemed like one of those plants</i>
<i>that lose their brilliant green,</i>

32
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:41,797
their leaves turn gray, lose their shape

33
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:46,119
<i>and you feel particularly satisfied</i>
<i>coming to their aid,</i>

34
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:49,319
<i>seeing how they turn green again</i>
<i>thanks to us.</i>

35
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,918
I felt a certain sense of power,

36
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:57,919
<i>as if her withering gave me the chance</i>
<i>to show off my new status.</i>

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,800
What happened?

38
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,481
Fine time to come home...
where have you been?

39
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:21,081
I was at Lila's.

40
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,081
I knew you were with that slut.

41
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,002
She's not well, she needs help.

42
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:32,802
That one'll lead you down a bad path.

43
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:38,762
No one in the neighborhood
wants her, not even her family.

44
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,443
And you do?

45
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:01,565
For once, will you listen to me?

46
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:05,405
Think of what you've become
and how she's ended up.

47
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,965
Wasn't writing a dirty book
enough for you?

48
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,446
You want to stay friends with her too?

49
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,607
What are you doing?
Who are you calling at this hour?

50
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:36,648
Hello, Pietro?

51
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,528
Did I wake you?

52
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:41,247
Don't open them, your sister's sleeping.

53
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:44,849
We're all awake, with all this noise.

54
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,328
Thanks to your sister.

55
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:49,729
I have to help her. What can I do?

56
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:53,248
To resign and get a little money

57
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,889
she needs a lawyer.

58
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,689
- Who can I ask?
- I'll ask Mariarosa.

59
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,569
I think she dated a Neapolitan lawyer.

60
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,971
- Then we have to help her companion.
- Enzo.

61
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:12,250
<i>If he's good with computers,</i>
<i>I'll ask Mansani.</i>

62
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,930
He's a young Greek scholar from Pisa
who's obsessed with computers.

63
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,931
Call Mariarosa
and the Greek scholar, please.

64
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:23,412
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>- Don't just promise, do it.</i>

65
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:27,131
You just used the exact same tone
as my mother.

66
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:29,892
I'm different from Adele, unfortunately.

67
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,653
Thank goodness you're different.

68
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:36,173
She's exceptional with these things,

69
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,973
so tell her about your friend,
she'll help you.

70
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,373
Okay, I'll speak to you tonight.

71
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:49,054
Making calls for someone who left her
husband and is living with someone else.

72
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:57,095
Wake up! Not even shouting
makes you open your eyes.

73
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:01,095
You always shout, we're used to it.

74
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:03,175
Adele, it's Elena.

75
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:07,135
What on earth happened this morning?

76
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:11,135
Lenuccia.

77
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:14,335
She slept over with that trash
without letting us know.

78
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,656
May I give you a piece of advice?

79
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:22,417
Elena, can you hear me?

80
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:24,816
Yes, I'm here.

81
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:29,136
She's not a kid anymore,
she's an adult woman.

82
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:32,697
I'll help you, I'd be very pleased to,

83
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:36,778
but you must learn
to take sides, don't be shy.

84
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:40,697
<i>You're a writer,</i>
<i>make your role count for something.</i>

85
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:44,018
Get involved, be there.

86
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,578
Start with that riffraff where you are.

87
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,818
<i>Put them</i>
<i>with their back against the wall.</i>

88
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:53,338
- How can I do that?
- By writing.

89
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,780
Frighten the factory owner to death.

90
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,139
Him and those like him.

91
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,939
Promise me you'll do that.

92
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,339
I'll try.

93
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,221
I'll give you the number

94
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,700
of a good man
on the editorial staff of L'Unità.

95
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:11,700
Write down the number.

96
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,861
How much longer
do we have to support her?

97
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,742
Thank you, we'll speak soon.

98
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:24,222
No worries, I can give Elisa
a little money.

99
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,821
Look what a little sweetie
he is this morning.

100
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,142
Don't hit me!

101
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:36,183
Where's Gianni?

102
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:39,262
He's gone out,
he didn't even have breakfast.

103
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,984
What's wrong, Lenù?

104
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,343
You wanna say something?

105
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,823
Mamma...

106
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,463
Mamma?

107
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:56,225
First thing this morning, he goes:
"Mamma, did you buy cookies?"

108
00:07:56,305 --> 00:08:00,105
He can't get out of bed
without sugar and milk.

109
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:04,785
<i>I was no longer the little match girl</i>
<i>always down to her last match.</i>

110
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,666
<i>Now I had a sizable stock of matches,</i>
<i>I could do a lot for Lila.</i>

111
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:13,786
I was leaving the family I came from

112
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:18,706
<i>and I was joining a powerful,</i>
<i>generously protective family.</i>

113
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:23,307
Saving Lila also became a way

114
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:27,586
<i>to demonstrate, above all to myself,</i>
<i>what kind of person I could be.</i>

115
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,593
Come, I'll take you in to meet Giuntini.

116
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,714
Don't be shy,
he's kind underneath it all.

117
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,035
Giuntini? She's here.

118
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:03,075
- Good morning, Mr. Giuntini, I'm...
- You're Elena Greco, I know.

119
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:07,556
The paper devoted
half a page to you, a rave review.

120
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,036
- Your book wasn't bad.
- Thank you, sir.

121
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:15,715
We're less formal here, comrade.
You are a comrade, right?

122
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:23,677
I don't remember what you wanted
to write about. Dock workers, miners?

123
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,677
The sausage factory.

124
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,517
Right, the one in San Giovanni.

125
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:30,717
So why do successful young novelists

126
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,237
want to dirty their hands
with shifts and overtime?

127
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:38,558
- Don't you have the piece?
- I thought we had to discuss it.

128
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,758
How do we put the paper together,
with chatter?

129
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,998
Find a typewriter and write.

130
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,718
- Now?
- How long do I have to wait?

131
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,079
Sit there and give me 30 lines.

132
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:52,319
No, actually...

133
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,959
You write well, make it 60.

134
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,759
This is Greco, she'll be with us today.

135
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,160
Hi.

136
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,920
Good morning.

137
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:19,846
"As we walk in the street
with lowered eyes,

138
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:25,287
we don't notice others who brush past,
we don't ask who they are, how they live,

139
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:29,087
the sacrifices they make,
the despair in their eyes,

140
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:32,928
the wrath they feel
when they show us their hands wounded

141
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,408
from boning animal carcasses,

142
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:39,928
scarred forever by toil
and neglect in their workplaces,

143
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:43,449
the hands of workers who at night
collapse not saying a word.

144
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:49,689
And young women
who aren't able to tell their men

145
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:53,489
their bosses suddenly
decided they mustn't be immersed

146
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,690
in the cooking water
for the mortadella..."

147
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,769
I wrote what you told me.

148
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:08,531
The teacher's Communist kids
won't like this way of doing things.

149
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,091
What way?

150
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,451
At the newspaper
they complimented me,

151
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:15,890
they asked me to work with them.

152
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:20,412
Nadia, you mean? Don't give her more
importance than she gives herself.

153
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,891
And Armando too.

154
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,851
All right, forget it.

155
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:28,611
- I'm not going to the cardiologist.
- Why?

156
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,372
Because I don't want to.

157
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,372
I called half the world to get you
an appointment, you can't do this.

158
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:37,652
- That's why I have to go?
- You're going, period.

159
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:39,492
It's important.

160
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,334
We'll put our shoes on
and go to your neighbor.

161
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,253
You get ready.

162
00:13:54,854 --> 00:13:57,095
You're going to the cardiologist
by yourself.

163
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,935
Bye, Gennarino. Bye, Titina, thank you.

164
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,615
Are you ready?

165
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:17,817
I want to go back
to live in the neighborhood.

166
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:23,057
You're strong, I never have been.

167
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:28,496
You, the further away you go,
the more real you feel.

168
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:33,137
Me, if I go through the tunnel,
I get scared.

169
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:41,137
Remember when we were going
to the seaside and it started raining?

170
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:42,219
Yes.

171
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:46,978
Who wanted to keep going
and who wanted to turn back?

172
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:52,219
But you can't go back
to the neighborhood.

173
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,300
What will you do about Stefano,
about your family?

174
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,859
Have you forgotten
how you treated your mother?

175
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,619
And your father doesn't want
to see you anymore.

176
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,980
How do you know all these things?

177
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,341
People talk.

178
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:09,941
He's getting married, she's run off...

179
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,341
Rumors spread in the neighborhood.

180
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,101
Is this news to you?

181
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:24,981
Come.

182
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,382
<i>What madness to return</i>
<i>to the neighborhood!</i>

183
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:35,502
I was about to leave it behind me,

184
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,982
she wanted to go back into the trap.

185
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,063
You're beautiful like these statuettes.

186
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:42,424
You're the lady and I'm the maid.

187
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,304
I didn't understand her.

188
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:49,143
<i>She must have felt so helpless</i>
<i>in the factory and outside</i>

189
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:53,305
<i>that now the neighborhood</i>
<i>seemed comfortable ground.</i>

190
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:58,105
If I'm all right,
I'll go back to the neighborhood.

191
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,186
Cerullo, this way.

192
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,466
Can my friend come in too?

193
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:10,706
No, she has to wait here.

194
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:13,186
Go, don't worry.

195
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:16,306
If she's not there, I'm leaving.

196
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,427
All right, follow me both of you.

197
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:28,227
Lila, you have to tell me when to make
an appointment for Enzo at IBM.

198
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,308
Do I have to tell you right now?

199
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:46,788
My son graduated at the Normale
University, a few years before you.

200
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:48,829
Now lie down.

201
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,309
How do you know Adele?

202
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:55,789
Her cousin, a world-renowned physicist,
is a friend of mine.

203
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:59,310
So you're marrying Pietro.

204
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:02,869
Good, I know he is a young man
of great intelligence.

205
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,551
You're lucky.

206
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,791
Relax now.

207
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,791
- When's the wedding?
- May 17.

208
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,471
17? But that's unlucky.

209
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:20,592
- Change the date!
- I don't think it's possible.

210
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,151
- Do you have trouble waking up?
- I don't have trouble doing anything.

211
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:29,593
It's not true, she's often tired,
with no energy.

212
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,513
- Does she eat?
- Very little.

213
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,753
- And how would you know?
- I can tell.

214
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:37,833
You can get dressed.

215
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,834
She has a perfect heart,

216
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:53,995
but we need to take urgent action
on your friend's health.

217
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:57,234
She needs a restorative tonic.

218
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,795
Most of these symptoms

219
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:05,556
will vanish as soon as
she gets her strength back.

220
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,155
Hear that?

221
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:11,116
In any case, I advise
a neurological examination.

222
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,235
Do I have a nervous illness?

223
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:16,875
On the contrary,
I'm merely advising a check-up.

224
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:19,757
Did I say something wrong?

225
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:25,156
Don't worry, the examination is
to gain a clear picture of the situation.

226
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:33,318
A relative of mine, my mother's cousin,

227
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:37,838
has always been unhappy.

228
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:42,678
When I was young I'd hear her
through the window, shouting, laughing.

229
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,438
But it was always unhappiness,

230
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,999
she never went to any doctor.

231
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,559
She should have gone.

232
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:54,280
Nervous illnesses are for ladies.

233
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,639
And wasn't your mother's cousin a lady?

234
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,719
No.

235
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,000
- And you?
- Even less.

236
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:05,680
- Do you feel unhappy?
- I'm just fine.

237
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,561
Have her follow
this treatment regularly, absolute rest.

238
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,842
And if you can take her to the country
for a bit, all the better.

239
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:24,002
Once a doctor sent me to the seaside
and I got into a lot of trouble.

240
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:30,003
It was hard to convince Lila.

241
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:34,123
<i>She put up resistance,</i>
<i>but she was exhausted, saddened.</i>

242
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:38,843
<i>In the end I managed to drag her</i>
<i>from one doctor to another.</i>

243
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:43,524
Both the irascible and the desirous souls
prevail over the rational one.

244
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:47,883
Let's try to restore
the wellbeing of the body

245
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:49,923
to restore that of the mind.

246
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:54,845
Could you give me those pills
that prevent you from having children?

247
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,045
- Are you married?
- I was, not now.

248
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,724
- What does that mean?
- I'm separated.

249
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:02,204
You're still married.

250
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:06,245
- Do you have any children?
- I have one.

251
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,685
- It isn't much.
- It's enough for me.

252
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:13,806
A pregnancy would help you,
there's no better medicine for a woman.

253
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:17,767
I know women destroyed by pregnancy,
better the pills.

254
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:19,966
I don't know of any contraceptive pills.

255
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,486
And if they exist, they're illegal.

256
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:28,007
There are pills that regulate your cycle,

257
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:31,407
but they are reserved
for legitimately married women.

258
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:35,128
And if you need them, don't ask me.

259
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:39,768
Anyway, I'll write you a prescription

260
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:43,728
with the medicines for your friend.

261
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,009
Here.

262
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:53,729
My wife read your book,
she liked it a lot.

263
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,889
Thank your wife from me.

264
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:00,610
What's with the face? It's a good thing.

265
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,890
All right...

266
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,331
I'll give you the number
of a lady doctor,

267
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,450
a friend of mine.

268
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:19,292
- Here.
- Thank you.

269
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,332
How much do I owe you?

270
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,731
Heaven forbid!

271
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,972
What a view!

272
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,573
- We shouldn't be here.
- Let's go.

273
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,613
I won't take the medicine
that asshole gave me.

274
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:43,733
My head's coming unstuck anyway.

275
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:46,413
I think you're wrong,
but do what you want.

276
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:49,213
I'm not mad at you, but at the doctors.

277
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:51,733
What do you want those pills for?

278
00:21:51,814 --> 00:21:54,775
- You already knew about them?
- Yes.

279
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,055
The doctor, to be polite,
said they're used for the cycle.

280
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:04,214
Do you take them?

281
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:07,415
No, but I will as soon as I'm married.

282
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,056
Don't you want children?

283
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:13,136
Yes, but first I have to write
another book.

284
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,296
Does your husband know that?

285
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,736
- I'll tell him.
- Have you already...?

286
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:23,416
No, not yet.

287
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:26,736
Then, let's both get
a prescription for the pill.

288
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:30,338
Those pills aren't candy.

289
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,657
And if you're not doing anything
with Enzo, why take them?

290
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:40,417
I'm not doing anything now,
but who knows later on.

291
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,458
- Seriously?
- Am I not allowed?

292
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,539
Yes, of course...

293
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,419
But you ask the lady doctor.

294
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:58,780
No, you ask her, I'm embarrassed.

295
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,780
I'm embarrassed too.

296
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,141
That thing...

297
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:14,581
it never gave me the pleasure
I thought it would as a girl.

298
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:17,782
To be honest, it annoys me.

299
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,501
I've always done everything,

300
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:24,102
everything a man wants from a woman.

301
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,782
I did it because I had to...

302
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,182
or out of curiosity,

303
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:33,702
or out of passion.

304
00:23:33,783 --> 00:23:36,182
With Nino I even had a child.

305
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:43,663
But now I can't accept
a decent man like Enzo inside me.

306
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:48,544
This joy that drives you crazy
seems overstated to me.

307
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,544
For me it's not like that.

308
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,625
You wrote something else in your book.

309
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:59,145
So you've read it!

310
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:11,185
I don't even know
what ended up in there.

311
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:13,745
Dirty stuff ended up in there, Lenù.

312
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:18,387
What men don't want to hear
and women are afraid of saying.

313
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,746
Now you're hiding?

314
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,627
You talked about
the annoyance of screwing.

315
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:29,907
And if you talked about it, you know it.

316
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,588
No use saying it's not like that.

317
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,507
Maybe it's true, I don't know.

318
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,708
I'm sorry you got pregnant without joy.

319
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,469
Let's stay here for a bit
then go and see that lady doctor.

320
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,030
Look at all the shells.

321
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,510
<i>We'd never shared</i>
<i>such intimate details.</i>

322
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,631
I listened to her.

323
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,071
<i>I was careful not to mention</i>
<i>Nino's "made wrong in sex".</i>

324
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,470
If she was, so was I.

325
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:20,552
<i>Sex gave me pleasure</i>
<i>and I desired that pleasure,</i>

326
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:25,792
<i>but I was riddled with anxiety,</i>
<i>scared of getting pregnant</i>

327
00:25:26,552 --> 00:25:28,992
or being judged by men.

328
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:32,033
It was them who told us how to behave

329
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:36,232
<i>and criticized us whether</i>
<i>we pulled back or gave in.</i>

330
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:39,672
<i>Nino, too, with his remark,</i>
<i>had done the same.</i>

331
00:25:40,594 --> 00:25:45,993
<i>Men behaved as if their desires</i>
<i>were necessarily ours.</i>

332
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:51,114
<i>As a result, pleasure</i>
<i>became depraved unhappiness.</i>

333
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:29,997
Good morning.

334
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,838
- How are you?
- Well, thank you.

335
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:38,358
- Have you been waiting long?
- No...

336
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:40,038
What are your names?

337
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:42,478
- Raffaella Cerullo.
- Elena Greco.

338
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,159
First of all, I'm not a gynecologist.

339
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,839
What do you mean?

340
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:52,919
That's not important, but I can help you.

341
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,199
You know the pill is used here
but it's not legal.

342
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,719
- I don't know anything.
- What does that mean?

343
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,760
- We'll pretend it's for something else.
- Why?

344
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:09,440
We're being hypocritical.

345
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,760
The pill is only used
for therapeutic purposes,

346
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,921
to regulate the cycle,
and it is given to married women.

347
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:20,402
I'm still married, but I left home.

348
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:23,322
She's about to get married,
let's say we're eligible.

349
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:28,441
Now I'll ask you a few
questions about your health,

350
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:31,962
and I'll slip prescriptions
into your purses.

351
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:33,843
All right?

352
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:51,604
I felt like a guardian goddess

353
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:55,325
<i>who cared about Lila's fate</i>
<i>above all else.</i>

354
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:59,964
<i>The next move was to determine</i>
<i>the risks she'd be exposed to</i>

355
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,244
<i>if she really did return</i>
<i>to the neighborhood.</i>

356
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:05,606
In the end, you all left that family.

357
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:10,606
Lila and I have one thing in common:

358
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:14,646
in the Carracci family
we were aliens, Martians.

359
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,326
We couldn't last.

360
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:19,567
Is Stefano still mad at her?

361
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:21,847
My brother hates her,
but he has too many troubles.

362
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,926
Lila is the last of his concerns.

363
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:37,247
Are you happy to be getting married?

364
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:41,488
I was fine the way I was,

365
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:46,448
but Marisa wanted it
and she turned to Michele.

366
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,329
You did what she wanted?

367
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:53,330
I don't get it.

368
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:56,729
You're getting married because
Marisa asked Michele?

369
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,811
Life is a very ugly affair.

370
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:08,811
Why did you accept?

371
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,132
To avoid upsetting Michele.

372
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:19,812
He put me in here, he trusted me.

373
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:25,892
And sometimes we all go out together,
Michele takes us out.

374
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,573
- And Marisa is pregnant.
- Congratulations!

375
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:35,212
Marisa will be a good wife
and a wonderful mother.

376
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:45,614
- Didn't Lila ever tell you?
- Tell me what?

377
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,534
If she didn't tell you,
she hasn't told anyone.

378
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:04,014
She's a very special person.

379
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,856
Lenù...

380
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:16,456
I'm queer, I don't like girls.

381
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,417
And if I were a girl,

382
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:24,296
I'd like to be identical to Lila.

383
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:39,937
They suit you.

384
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:43,698
How much do they cost?

385
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,099
I'll give you a special price.

386
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:52,099
<i>From Alfonso I realized the Carraccis</i>
<i>were in too much trouble</i>

387
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,739
<i>to indulge in the luxury</i>
<i>of tormenting Lila.</i>

388
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,340
Lenù, how are you?

389
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,340
<i>Understanding</i>
<i>the Solara's intentions was urgent,</i>

390
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,779
so I went to visit Gigliola.

391
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,821
She was about to get married too,

392
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:09,421
<i>to the most dangerous</i>
<i>of the two, Michele.</i>

393
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,020
In this building there are engineers,
lawyers, important professors.

394
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,021
Look what a view.

395
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:22,221
Look.

396
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:25,941
Ever seen the sea like this?

397
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:29,623
Naples... Vesuvius is behind there.

398
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:34,143
-Ever seen this sky in the neighborhood?
-Wonderful.

399
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:36,823
There's no comparison with Lila's house
in the neighborhood.

400
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:40,584
In what's now Ada's house.

401
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,584
No, there's no comparison.

402
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,703
This is more upper-class.

403
00:31:51,184 --> 00:31:53,944
- Yes...
- You're not convinced.

404
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:57,224
Of course I am, Gigliola.
I'm really happy for you.

405
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,704
Each to his own.
You studied, you write books.

406
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:04,945
And I have this.

407
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:10,626
If you save up,
you can buy a house like this.

408
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:12,066
I don't think so.

409
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:14,386
Doesn't he want to live in Naples?

410
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:16,986
I'd rule that out.

411
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:21,147
You can tell he's a good guy.

412
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:23,986
He's not like Michele,
he'll do what you want.

413
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:27,907
You've been lucky.

414
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:31,227
Of course, I've been lucky too.

415
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:34,267
Pinuccia lives in misery
because of that moron Rino,

416
00:32:34,348 --> 00:32:37,348
Ada is Stefano's whore
and I have Michele

417
00:32:37,428 --> 00:32:39,547
who's everybody's boss.

418
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:41,748
See where he set me up?

419
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:45,268
We're having a wedding worthy
of the Shah of Persia and Soraya.

420
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,988
I was sly,

421
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,389
I took Michele when I was a kid.

422
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,150
This is the result.

423
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,230
I'm always alone here.

424
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:14,631
- I'm getting married on my own.
- It's not true.

425
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,592
Do you think I exist?
Look at me, do you think I exist?

426
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:23,872
Let's eat something.

427
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,792
I'm only 25 years old

428
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:33,712
and he fucks here and there as he likes.

429
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:39,593
I feel disgust when they ask us how
many children we want and he replies:

430
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:42,793
"I already have children,
I don't even know how many."

431
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,033
Does Pietro say these things?

432
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:52,675
He's never loved me.

433
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,115
Men only get married
to have a faithful housemaid.

434
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:03,635
He's always telling me:
"What the fuck will I do with you?"

435
00:34:06,515 --> 00:34:07,636
I'm sorry.

436
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:12,036
I'm talking like this because you wrote
that book and you know suffering.

437
00:34:12,795 --> 00:34:16,756
- Why do you let him speak like that?
- Otherwise he won't marry me.

438
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:20,356
- After the wedding make him pay for it.
- How?

439
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:22,957
He doesn't give a shit about me.

440
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:26,637
I never see him as it is,
just imagine afterwards.

441
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:28,837
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

442
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:32,837
You don't understand
because you're not me.

443
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,678
Would you take someone
who's in love with someone else?

444
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:40,038
Michele has a lover?

445
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,918
He's a man, he sticks it
wherever he can.

446
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,718
- But that's not the point.
- What is?

447
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,919
Sit down.

448
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:20,721
He loves Lila,

449
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:25,122
he loves her in a way
he's never loved me,

450
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:27,841
in a way he'll never love anyone.

451
00:35:28,603 --> 00:35:31,282
I'm not making this up,
he told me himself.

452
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:37,203
One night he was so drunk he said
how many women he had fucked.

453
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:43,283
122, for free and paid.

454
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:49,164
He told me I was on that list too.

455
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:54,085
"But you're not among those
who gave me the greatest pleasure,

456
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,525
because you're a moron
and to fuck well it takes intelligence.

457
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,085
For example when you do a blow job,

458
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:05,966
you're hopeless,
I can tell it disgusts you.

459
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:08,566
I'm marrying you
out of respect for your father

460
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:12,206
and because one has to have
a wife and children."

461
00:36:14,725 --> 00:36:16,967
Then he almost started crying.

462
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:25,207
He said: "For me women
are all dolls with a few holes.

463
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,527
All of them.

464
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,488
All except one.

465
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:36,367
Lila.

466
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:41,049
She is the only woman
I love and respect."

467
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:47,448
He told me to my face.

468
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:53,650
He says with her
he could have become truly important,

469
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,289
that he didn't want her for sex,

470
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,249
but rather to kiss her, to caress her.

471
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:09,011
He wanted her
to see her grow old, to talk with her.

472
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:13,091
He says only
he really understands who she is.

473
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:15,011
He recognized her.

474
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:19,052
And what did you say?

475
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,251
Nothing, I didn't say a thing.

476
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:26,092
I thought: "Now he'll fall asleep
and I'll stab him

477
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:28,252
and I'll get my Michele back."

478
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:33,693
I don't have it in for Lila.

479
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:36,533
Not anymore.

480
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:39,974
I wanted to kill her when Michele
took me out of the shoe shop

481
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:42,214
and put me back in the pastry shop.

482
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:47,373
But I don't have it in for her
anymore, actually,

483
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:52,655
I'm glad because she'll never take
Michele, she'll make him spit blood.

484
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:55,894
Do you think he could hurt Lila?

485
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:58,575
Who, him? Hurt Lila?

486
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:03,535
Haven't you seen
how he's behaved all these years?

487
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:08,375
He could hurt me, you,
even his mother and his brother,

488
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,455
he could hurt all the people
close to Lila,

489
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,295
especially Enzo.

490
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:17,896
But not her,

491
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:22,017
he'd never do anything to her.

492
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:30,378
<i>The Unità articles had the effect</i>
<i>my mother-in-law predicted.</i>

493
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:33,617
One day Bruno Soccavo called.

494
00:38:33,697 --> 00:38:36,257
He brought up Ischia, our friendship...

495
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,338
Lenù, I'm not to blame,

496
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,859
<i>my father left me a business</i>
<i>that was struggling.</i>

497
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:43,578
Your friend behaved badly.

498
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:46,138
Don't make me think about it.

499
00:38:46,218 --> 00:38:48,899
All she did was cause trouble.

500
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:51,939
Don't get worked up,
I believe Lila not you.

501
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:55,539
Now order them
to pay her down to the last cent.

502
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,460
There's nothing I can do,

503
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,940
I don't manage my money.

504
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,380
There's people behind me
whom you know very well.

505
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,100
What do you mean?

506
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,461
Maybe you've forgotten what certain
people in your neighborhood are like.

507
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:22,022
Lila.

508
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,303
See this, Enzo?

509
00:39:30,943 --> 00:39:33,383
That shitbag Soccavo coughed up
every last cent.

510
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:37,423
Thank you.

511
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:40,623
That man you sent me to see
was very kind,

512
00:39:40,703 --> 00:39:42,623
he knew all about your fiancé,

513
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:45,384
he told me his father is very important.

514
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:47,904
But he said you have to wait.

515
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:51,864
He says that IBM is producing
a new computer in Italy

516
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:54,465
and that they need an expert in Naples.

517
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:58,905
He'll let me know as soon as
the training courses begin.

518
00:39:58,985 --> 00:40:00,144
Thank you, Lenù.

519
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:04,144
My father-in-law's prestige
doesn't count for much.

520
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:07,826
This man will help you
only because you're good.

521
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:12,625
Boss! Open the back door!

522
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,706
He's really good.

523
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:23,427
Yeah, sure...
I've never even seen a computer.

524
00:40:24,027 --> 00:40:27,226
That guy must have understood anyway
that you're on the ball.

525
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,067
So it's Don Carlo's widow's house?

526
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:36,107
How much is the rent?

527
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:38,828
Houses cost less in the neighborhood
than in San Giovanni.

528
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:47,349
Come, I'll introduce you
to your grandfather.

529
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,588
Let's do it some other time,
let's go and see the apartment.

530
00:40:50,668 --> 00:40:53,749
Why? Can't the child meet
his grandfather?

531
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:09,710
Papa!

532
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,872
Hi, Papa.

533
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:22,352
Here's Gennarino.

534
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:30,552
Gennarino...

535
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:36,272
When you see your mother,
tell her she's a whore.

536
00:41:36,712 --> 00:41:38,232
Got that?

537
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:52,955
Don't worry, Grandpa was joking.

538
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:57,594
People like to joke in the neighborhood,
didn't I tell you?

539
00:42:36,398 --> 00:42:39,358
Aunty Lenù and I used to walk here.

540
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,678
We grew up here.

541
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,758
I went to school down there.

542
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,320
Lenù.

543
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,599
How are you?

544
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,800
- Fine, and you?
- Fine, thanks.

545
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,119
The things we've heard about you!
Now you're getting married.

546
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,321
- You're going to live in Florence...
- Yes, I'm leaving soon.

547
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:10,841
Beautiful city, Florence, Ada and I
were there a few months ago.

548
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,560
God, what a city! You're lucky.

549
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,962
When you come back, come and visit us.

550
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:19,402
Don't forget your friends
in the neighborhood.

551
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:20,842
You got that?

552
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:22,681
Of course.

553
00:43:30,562 --> 00:43:32,122
- How are you?
- Good.

554
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:33,403
Good?

555
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:41,683
- Hurry up!
- Papa's girl! Hi!

556
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:43,804
- Say hello to Papa.
- Give me a kiss.

557
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:46,123
Good girl.

558
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:48,723
- Where are you taking her?
- To your place.

559
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:51,924
- Tell Ada I'll be late tonight.
- All right.

560
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,684
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, Maria.

561
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:55,684
Bye, little man.

562
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:59,925
You're here! Let me say hello!

563
00:44:01,164 --> 00:44:02,084
Lenù!

564
00:44:06,966 --> 00:44:07,886
Hi!

565
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,446
You know Antonio's still in Germany.

566
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:14,806
He always asks after you in his letters.

567
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:16,887
You look so well.

568
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,246
All right...

569
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:24,847
That's what I'll turn into.

570
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:29,808
Is this your son?

571
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,488
Lila, you've gotten thin, ugly.

572
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:37,368
Look at yourself,
you look like a cadaver.

573
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:40,328
Of course Stefano left you!

574
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:44,449
Men need flesh. If they don't know
what to hold onto, they leave.

575
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:49,369
Do you know, this is your sister?

576
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:53,050
Her name's Maria.

577
00:44:53,129 --> 00:44:54,850
Give each other a kiss!

578
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,649
You're so cute!

579
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,530
Let me see, stand close together.

580
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,971
They're identical to their father,
like they stuck his head on.

581
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:15,411
We'll get going. If we're late,
your mother will give us what for.

582
00:45:15,491 --> 00:45:16,731
Let's go.

583
00:45:16,812 --> 00:45:19,012
Eat something,

584
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,571
you look like a cadaver.

585
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:24,972
Skinny and white! Eat a nice steak.

586
00:45:25,052 --> 00:45:27,972
Eat a nice steak!

587
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:38,893
- Did you see the resemblance?
- What resemblance?

588
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:42,693
Melina was right,
they're both identical to Stefano.

589
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,293
- It's not true.
- They're two peas in a pod.

590
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:48,293
Gennarino's Stefano's son, not Nino's.

591
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:06,735
This is the apartment.

592
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:09,376
Here's the bathroom.

593
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:13,536
The dining room, the kitchen.

594
00:46:13,615 --> 00:46:16,296
I'll open the window in the bedroom.

595
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:20,057
To move in here
we'll have to gut the place first.

596
00:46:22,817 --> 00:46:24,736
Look at this, Gennarino.

597
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:36,697
It's the right place: in the
neighborhood, but not in the heart of it.

598
00:46:38,777 --> 00:46:40,939
We can even escape.

599
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:44,298
You can see
Carmen's fiancé's gas pump.

600
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:47,698
I like that too.

601
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:55,779
It's the perfect apartment
for us, isn't it?

602
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:01,659
If Lila's got it into her head
that it's right, we have to take it.

603
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:10,260
But you'll have to meet us halfway.
I'll have to work on it every night.

604
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:13,620
Don't worry, I'll lower it a bit.

605
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,660
- A bit?
- Yes, a bit.

606
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:23,462
- You'll have problems, you know.
- Got them in San Giovanni too.

607
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:27,101
- Here, there'll be more of them.
- We'll see about that.

608
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:30,823
- Will you always stay close to her?
- For as long as she wants.

609
00:47:33,102 --> 00:47:35,543
Gennarino and I will sleep in there.

610
00:47:35,622 --> 00:47:38,343
But at night
you'll hear the trucks in here.

611
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:41,143
I like trucks.

612
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:42,544
Me too.

613
00:47:42,623 --> 00:47:45,504
Enough, or the signora
will raise the price.

614
00:47:46,984 --> 00:47:49,944
- What do I have to sign?
- We'll do a contract.

615
00:47:50,024 --> 00:47:52,945
- That way you're all happy.
- Fine.

616
00:47:53,784 --> 00:47:57,065
- So, you'll come down a bit.
- Yes, a bit, don't worry.

617
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:02,385
What can you do!

618
00:48:05,506 --> 00:48:07,386
Are you sure?

619
00:48:07,466 --> 00:48:10,346
- Extremely sure.
- All right then.

619
00:48:11,305 --> 00:49:11,377
