2
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,960
Elena... you coming?

3
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,799
- I really enjoyed the presentation.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,079
May I ask for one too?

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,479
Me too, please.

6
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,480
To Olivia, fondly.

7
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,079
It was a rather stormy presentation.

8
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,879
Back in school
Elena was the literary one.

9
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,560
Come to dinner,
so you can tell us about it.

10
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,079
I've made a reservation nearby.

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,439
We have to celebrate,
there's a nice surprise for Elena.

12
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,359
Hi, Lenù.

13
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,799
Hi, Nino.

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,120
How long has it been?

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,079
The Airotas...

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,359
They're a family of great traditions,

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,760
among the most civilized
of those that count in Italy.

18
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,359
Guido's an exceptional man.

19
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,959
- I'm good friends with Mariarosa.
- Yes?

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,319
Yes, we have certain arguments...

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,319
I know you're marrying Pietro.

22
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,400
I've read his book, I found it brilliant.

23
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,120
How do you like it in Milan?

24
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,039
It's a difficult city,

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,759
especially if you're from the South
without a cent in your pocket.

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,439
- Did you move back to Naples?
- For now, yes.

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
- In the neighborhood?
- Yes.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,680
I broke all ties with my father,
I don't see my family anymore.

29
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,439
- Too bad.
- No, it's fine like that.

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm only sorry
I don't have any news of Lila.

31
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,199
She left her husband,
she lives with someone else.

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,080
Did she have a boy or a girl?

33
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,919
A boy.

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,840
Lila's brave, even too much so,

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,159
but she won't bend to reality,

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,240
she's incapable
of accepting others and herself.

37
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,759
Loving her was a difficult experience.

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,319
Why?

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,639
She doesn't know what dedication is.

40
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,400
- You're exaggerating.
- No, she's all wrong.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,080
In her head, in everything, even sex.

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,919
<i>I would have liked to ask:</i>
<i>Lila is all wrong in the head?</i>

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,159
<i>And what does</i>
<i>all wrong in sex mean?</i>

44
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,800
Nino, when is a girl all wrong in sex?

45
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,360
Was I all wrong like Lila?

46
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,120
<i>But even if it were possible</i>
<i>to ask him those questions,</i>

47
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,800
what did I care?

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,120
<i>Besides, who was he to say</i>
<i>you're made wrong, you're not?</i>

49
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,639
I've got it in for the overlords.

50
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,599
I agreed with the piece
Professor Airota wrote in Il Ponte.

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,039
The teaching conditions for us lecturers
are as he described them.

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
I must tell my daughter,

53
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,639
because Mariarosa, as usual,
thought it was an awful article.

54
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,360
Mariarosa only stands for
what the world can't give her.

55
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,479
If you'll excuse me.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,160
Where are you going?
We'd like to hear your view.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,079
- I have nothing to say.
- A writer always has something to say.

58
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,399
Maybe I'm not a writer.

59
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
<i>By then, I knew</i>
<i>he wasn't attracted to me.</i>

60
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,319
In Ischia he chose Lila, not me.

61
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
<i>And yet I still wanted him,</i>
<i>I only wanted him.</i>

62
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,199
<i>I would have liked to make him</i>
<i>walk all night to ask him:</i>

63
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,959
What music should I listen to?
What films should I see?

64
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
What books should I read?

65
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,000
<i>Enough, I was sick</i>
<i>of everything and everyone,</i>

66
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>even of myself for wasting</i>
<i>the evening like that.</i>

67
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,560
Here's your surprise!

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
Elena!

69
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,279
I'm sorry, I came by car but I didn't
make it in time for the presentation.

70
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,600
- Never mind.
- Are you sure?

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
- Pisa-Milan is an arduous trip.
- Yes, but driving relaxes me.

72
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,639
- What car do you have?
- A 600.

73
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,319
How do you like it?

74
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,800
It's fine, I don't know much about cars
but they say it has good gears.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,399
I wanted to buy one,
but you know how the university pays.

76
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,279
Enough chatter now.

77
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,040
- Let's come to the second surprise.
- You tell them, Mamma.

78
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
No, you tell them.

79
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,279
They've made me a professor
at Florence.

80
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,399
He's got tenure.

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,920
Just like that, as if by magic.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,480
I never know what he's studying,
what tests he has to take...

83
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,079
Elena, it's much better like this.

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,079
We women are given the task
of being happy about their success.

85
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,519
It's not every day
you become a full professor,

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,360
so young.

87
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,680
No, but there are thousands of lecturers
slogging day and night.

88
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,399
You have one right here.

89
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,399
Congratulations, it's wonderful news.

90
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
Thank you.

91
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,399
It'll be your turn soon,
you're so generous and brilliant.

92
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,759
Let's raise a glass to our young
professors, they'll change the world.

93
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,360
- To you, Pietro.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,480
- Congratulations, cheers!
- Cheers, everyone.

95
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,560
<i>How handsome Nino was,</i>
<i>how seductive, how...</i>

96
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,879
<i>I don't want to search for adjectives</i>
<i>for Pietro, it'd be unfair.</i>

97
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,720
The gap between them was too great,

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
<i>but they seemed pleased</i>
<i>to have met and they ignored me.</i>

99
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,560
Professor, it's been
a pleasure meeting you.

100
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
For me too, son.

101
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,360
Be well.

102
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm off to bed.

103
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Good night everyone.

104
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,439
Blessed youth!

105
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,800
- I hope to see you again soon.
- It'd be a pleasure.

106
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,080
- I'll send your regards to Mariarosa.
- And pay my respects to your husband.

107
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,320
See you soon, Adele.

108
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,879
I wish you all the best.

109
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,480
Good night.

110
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,080
Good night, Nino.

111
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,200
I'll stay with Elena for a while.

112
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,679
Good.

113
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,480
Goodbye, my dear.

114
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,320
I'll see you at your sister's, then.

115
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,720
Good night.

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,799
What's wrong?

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm just a bit tired.

118
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,320
It was just an excuse for us
to be alone for a while.

119
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,399
Have I done something wrong?
Are you angry?

120
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,279
I don't like Florence.

121
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,080
Have you ever been to Florence?

122
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,559
Twice, but I don't like it.

123
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,480
I don't even want to write anymore.

124
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:38,919
Why?

125
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,799
I don't want to talk about it.

126
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
I want to teach.

127
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,799
You can do both.

128
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,440
We have our whole lives ahead,
you can do what you like.

129
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,320
Tell me when I can come to Naples
to meet your parents.

130
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,879
Forget about my parents.

131
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,440
You're not suitable for them
and they're not suitable for you.

132
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,720
- Don't you want to marry me anymore?
- Of course I do.

133
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,840
It's been a tiring evening.

134
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,639
Can I sleep with you tonight?

135
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,360
You wanted to wait, let's wait.

136
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,879
Let's go.

137
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,120
Good night.

138
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,679
Here's your key.

139
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,559
Have a pleasant evening, goodbye.

140
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
Elena!

141
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,120
What a lovely evening!

142
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,159
I'll see you up.

143
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,559
- Floor?
- Fourth.

144
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,679
Same as me! It's destiny.

145
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,879
Your pages are things that...

146
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,000
are things that...

147
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,159
Well, good night.

148
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,879
Professor!

149
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,159
He's drunk...

150
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,600
<i>I had the impression</i>
<i>that Nino's appearance</i>

151
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,639
had finally given life full meaning

152
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,840
and that his disappearance, instead,

153
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,480
<i>had stripped meaning</i>
<i>from every thing or feeling.</i>

154
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,159
You think you're somebody
'cause you write books,

155
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,440
'cause you're marrying a professor...

156
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,159
But you came out of this belly,
this is your kind.

157
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,919
So it's pointless to act superior.

158
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,679
You're clever because I am,
even more than you!

159
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,279
If I had the chances you had...

160
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,759
I woulda gone just as far as you,
you hear me?

161
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,960
Nothing to say?

162
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
Nothing to say?

163
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,399
You don't care about anyone.

164
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,279
You went and did what you wanted

165
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,240
without helping your siblings,
who haven't amounted to much.

166
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,840
At least you can give us some money.

167
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll have a telephone put in,
and a television.

168
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,399
A television and a telephone
in this house? You'll pay for it?

169
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,879
Always, even after you're married?

170
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,039
The professor knows
we can't afford a dowry or a reception?

171
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,480
He knows.
And we're not having a reception.

172
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,159
- No reception? Make him pay for it!
- We'll do without.

173
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,120
Remember Lila's wedding,
her reception?

174
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
You're a hundred times better than her
and you don't want one?

175
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,399
No, and not only
are we not having a reception,

176
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,080
but we're not even
getting married in church.

177
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,480
We're getting married at city hall.

178
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,440
Wretched girl!

179
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,000
- Shush.
- Wretched!

180
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,159
If a priest doesn't bless your marriage
it's worthless!

181
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,759
You'll be treated like a whore,
not like a wife!

182
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,879
Vittorio, come.

183
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,639
You two, don't you have
to go to work now?

184
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,519
Come and listen to this bullshit.

185
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Come on, it's late! It's afternoon.

186
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,840
You hear what she's got in mind?
She studied so much her brain's gone!

187
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,279
She wants to be treated like a whore.

188
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,120
I won't be able
to leave the house out of shame!

189
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,679
Stop shouting, let me understand.

190
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,240
You gotta kick her out right now,
I don't want her here.

191
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,679
She's happy to be treated like a whore!
Like Lila, like Ada!

192
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,320
You want to get married at city hall
or your sweetheart does?

193
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,440
Whether I get married at city hall
or in church is the same to me,

194
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,440
but for Pietro and his family a church
wedding would be unacceptable.

195
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,399
If we don't get married at city hall,
we won't get married.

196
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,519
- Or he won't marry you?
- No.

197
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,840
What will he do, leave you?

198
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,159
No, we'll live together
without getting married.

199
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,000
I swear I'll slit your throat,
you hear me?

200
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,159
Put the knife down, Immacolata,
try to calm down.

201
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,080
Don't try my patience, calm down.

202
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,120
Let's think it through.

203
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,039
You can get married in church,
have a lavish party

204
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,559
and still end up badly.

205
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,320
The professor's a Communist, right?

206
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,200
Communist and professor.
Professor of my ass!

207
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,639
A man who thinks like that
is a piece of shit!

208
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,799
What piece of shit?

209
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,279
He's educated

210
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,000
and he knows what
nasty stuff priests get up to.

211
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,120
That's why he only wants
to get married at city hall.

212
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,279
Lenù, I was speaking to you too.

213
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm listening.

214
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,840
The teaspoon.

215
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,600
Thanks.

216
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm prepared to trust
this university professor.

217
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,840
He loves her, he'll see
she doesn't look like a whore.

218
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,919
Anyway, I trust him
even though I haven't met him.

219
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,279
He's an important person.

220
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,279
The girls here can only dream
of a match like him.

221
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
Listen to me, let's trust him.

222
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,080
Even this thing about city hall...

223
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,360
I know a judge who got married
at city hall here in Naples.

224
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,159
I can assure you the marriage is as valid
as one in church, maybe more.

225
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Vittorio, I don't even trust you.

226
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,440
Not you, not city hall,
not this damn professor!

227
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,879
You can't stand me.

228
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,320
No.

229
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,039
Me neither.

230
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,159
THE DIGRESSION

231
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,279
THREE ESSAYS ON
THE THEORY OF SEXUALITY

232
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,680
Excuse me, are you a writer?

233
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,480
This morning I saw your picture
in the newspaper.

234
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,440
I've already sold two copies of your book
since this morning.

235
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,279
It's a book that will sell.

236
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,160
- My compliments.
- Thank you.

237
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,599
Goodbye.

238
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
Corriere della Sera, please.

239
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,599
Thank you.

240
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
I broke out in a cold sweat.

241
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,759
The critic defined me as

242
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,519
<i>"a young girl busy</i>
<i>hiding her lack of talent</i>

243
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,519
<i>with salacious passages</i>
<i>of mediocre triviality."</i>

244
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,319
Elena, get used to it. The main thing
is they're talking about the book.

245
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,680
I don't care if they talk about it
if they say bad things.

246
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,400
All of Italy reads Corriere della Sera.

247
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,319
I understand, but...

248
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
You need to calm down.

249
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,680
I'll put my mother on, she's here.

250
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,119
I gotta go, we'll speak tomorrow.

251
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,839
Hello?

252
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,880
It's Elena, hello.

253
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,079
<i>- Did you read it?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

254
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,400
<i>- Pleased?</i>
<i>- What's there to be pleased about?</i>

255
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
He defined me as a little girl
who writes trivial things.

256
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,920
L'Unità is coming out tomorrow

257
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,279
and you'll find something
in the Messaggero too

258
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,319
and in Il Mattino.

259
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,279
Positive reviews.

260
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,480
<i>And one is coming out</i>
<i>on Saturday in La Stampa.</i>

261
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,359
People like the book, it's selling.

262
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,000
<i>If it goes on like this,</i>
<i>we'll reprint it.</i>

263
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
I'll put Guido on,
he wanted to say hello.

264
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,839
Bye.

265
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,480
Elena, my compliments, really.

266
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,160
<i>Don't let a bigoted journalist</i>
<i>ruin your day.</i>

267
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,279
Speak soon

268
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,519
and enjoy your success.

269
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,960
<i>I hoped that wherever she was,</i>
<i>Lila wouldn't read the article.</i>

270
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,200
How embarrassing!

271
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,799
I wondered if she read my book.

272
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,559
I cared about her opinion the most.

273
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,799
<i>But I was also afraid she'd say:</i>
<i>"I don't like your book.</i>

274
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,759
You write such nonsense".

275
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,400
- What are you doing here?
- I'm going to buy the newspaper.

276
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,519
You haven't changed a bit.

277
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,880
- And I almost didn't recognize you.
- I work out.

278
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,680
I've moved up in the branch,
the secretary trusts me.

279
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,400
- What branch?
- The MSI.

280
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,759
I'm a fascist, Lenù.

281
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,799
- I must read your book.
- Don't bother, it's not for you.

282
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,400
What do you mean, "not for me"?

283
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,079
Remember our bet?
Did you put that in the book too?

284
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,720
The tits you showed me for money
have gotten bigger.

285
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,200
- Why don't you just go?
- Get outta here!

286
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,039
Little fascist.

287
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,440
Hi.

288
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,599
- How are you?
- Good.

289
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,359
I heard you're engaged.

290
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,960
- And that you wrote a book.
- Yes.

291
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,880
I wanted to read it,
but I heard it's a little racy.

292
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,279
<i>They'd only read those pages,</i>
<i>the whole book would have bored them.</i>

293
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,920
And now they treated me as at last

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,119
<i>I'd made the false move</i>
<i>they'd been expecting for some time.</i>

295
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,640
That wasn't a novel for them,

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,279
<i>it was me, Elena Greco,</i>
<i>telling my deepest secrets,</i>

297
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,680
<i>secrets that a respectable girl</i>
<i>should never have told anyone.</i>

298
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,160
A COURAGEOUS BOOK

299
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,279
ELENA GRECO
A TRUE WRITER

300
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,079
Lenù!

301
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,640
Let me buy you a coffee.

302
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,880
Thanks, Michele,
maybe some other time.

303
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,519
I get it, now that you're famous
you haven't got time for us.

304
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,960
That's not true, I really can't,
but thank you.

305
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,559
It'll only take you a minute.

306
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,720
Gigliola will be here in a minute,
you can say hi.

307
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,519
- I really can't.
- Come.

308
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,880
Thank you, really.

309
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,640
So how are you?

310
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,799
Fine.

311
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,720
- Everything okay at home?
- Yes.

312
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,839
Where's the newspaper?

313
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,079
Did you see what's written here?

314
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,599
Donato Sarratore wrote it.

315
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,200
He claims it should
be banned for under 18s.

316
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,599
Is it true?

317
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,359
- No, it's not true.
- I thought so.

318
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,519
That's what you studied in Pisa?
What you learned in Pisa?

319
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,799
I don't believe what it says here.

320
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,559
I think you and Lila
had a secret agreement.

321
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,400
She does the dirty stuff
and you write about it.

322
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
Is that right? Tell me the truth.

323
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,279
I'll be off then, thanks for the coffee.

324
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,759
Are you offended?

325
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,440
Go on, beat the crap out of him!

326
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,400
Aren't they your brothers?

327
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,079
Stop!

328
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,039
Stop!

329
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,839
Stop! Peppe, Gianni, let's go.

330
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,400
Why were you fighting?

331
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,039
- We were fighting because of you.
- Why?

332
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,119
Because you're a whore!

333
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,680
People read the book and
now they're talking behind our back.

334
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,079
- Did you write the nasty stuff you do?
- What nasty stuff! Read it.

335
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,279
If Papa hears what they're saying
about you, he'll kick you out.

336
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,359
- There's no need, I'm leaving.
- Where will you go?

337
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,319
I have to go to Milan.

338
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,039
STUDENT MOVEMENT OCCUPATION

339
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,920
CAPITALISM? ENOUGH!

340
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,400
Fascists, bourgeoisie,
in a few months dead you'll be!

341
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,759
Fascists, bourgeoisie,
in a few months dead you'll be!

342
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,400
Where's the meeting
for Literature students?

343
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,039
What meeting?

344
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,920
The one with Elena Greco.

345
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,960
Who's she?

346
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,799
Never mind, thanks.

347
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,480
<i>In Milan, I felt as</i>
<i>if my tension was released.</i>

348
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,279
<i>I was almost glad to discover</i>
<i>that no one was expecting me,</i>

349
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,640
my book had zero importance.

350
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,759
<i>There were bigger things</i>
<i>to squabble over.</i>

351
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,519
We won't bow our heads.

352
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,519
But this is already happening.

353
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,759
It's happening in the courtyard
of the Sorbonne,

354
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:06,759
where our French comrades are doing
their share of revolutionary action.

355
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,920
They're protesting peacefully.

356
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,839
The French government
immediately opposed

357
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,039
this new course.

358
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,200
First they occupied the Latin Quarter...

359
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,200
<i>I recognized Franco Mari immediately,</i>
<i>my boyfriend from my early days in Pisa.</i>

360
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,960
<i>At the desk with him</i>
<i>was Mariarosa, Pietro's sister.</i>

361
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,200
The girls were always in a group,

362
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:44,119
<i>they seemed game</i>
<i>for that experience of male chaos,</i>

363
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,519
provided they stick together.

364
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,759
I was struck by a girl with a baby.

365
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,640
<i>I got the impression she wanted</i>
<i>to get involved but couldn't</i>

366
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,319
and that made her unhappy.

367
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,680
We must continue to rebel,
as our comrade Cohn-Bendit says...

368
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,839
Clown! Stop raving!
You know what class consciousness is?

369
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,079
Shame!

370
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,880
The revolution belongs
to the proletariat!

371
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,480
We must refuse to be the future ranks
of capitalist exploitation.

372
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,319
We may not be the avant-garde
of the people's army

373
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,160
that will defeat the establishment,
but we can open the eyes of the workers,

374
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,599
the workers' children,
yours, everyone's.

375
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,599
What are you doing here?

376
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,920
I had a meeting with the Literature
students, but it fell through.

377
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,720
- I'm sorry, but look at this mess!
- I see it.

378
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,799
- It was good to listen to Franco.
- Do you know him?

379
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,720
- Yes, we were at university together.
- I invited him.

380
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,519
They'll make me pay for it,
look what a wasps' nest.

381
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,440
Come to my place tonight,

382
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,079
they've lent me a beautiful house,
it's very big.

383
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Come for dinner and then sleep over.

384
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,799
- I've booked a hotel.
- I don't want to hear it.

385
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't want you to be alone
and you can catch up with Franco.

386
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,319
He's sleeping at my place too.

387
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,400
See you later.

388
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,839
- Have you been back to Pisa?
- No.

389
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,960
No, it makes me kind of...

390
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,920
sad.

391
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,799
Why? We had a good time.

392
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,200
I don't know, it seems like
such a long time ago...

393
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
Another life.

394
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:38,839
You said you'd write to me.

395
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah.

396
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,240
Elena...

397
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,240
That's just how it was meant to be.

398
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,880
I'll show you, you can get lost here.

399
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,720
I still get lost.

400
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,839
I'll show you my work.

401
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm still working on them.

402
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,680
What do you think?

403
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,599
Interesting.

404
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,720
That's all?

405
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,720
I don't know much about paintings.

406
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,519
And painters?

407
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,119
What's there to laugh about?

408
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,400
<i>At the house, I came across the girl</i>
<i>again, her name was Silvia.</i>

409
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>She was very on edge,</i>
<i>she'd had it with the baby.</i>

410
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,920
I can try if you like,
I have three siblings.

411
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,400
Do what the hell you want.

412
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,759
You're so handsome!
Shall I sing you a song?

413
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,599
The revolution has to be cultural,

414
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,400
not just a political revolution,

415
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,440
or else in the end all the pressure
will be on the people, as usual.

416
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,480
The only way
is to change their mentality.

417
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,400
My little lamb what will you do

418
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:28,680
when you are in the jaws of the wolf?

419
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,160
You're so handsome.

420
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,200
You smell so good.

421
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,759
He's asleep.

422
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,079
..the reformist policies
of the European workers parties...

423
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,480
I stayed at Mariarosa's,

424
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,759
<i>I wanted to show Franco</i>
<i>I was no longer the girl from the past.</i>

425
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,440
<i>I'd graduated brilliantly,</i>
<i>I'd written a book,</i>

426
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,279
<i>I was a different person</i>
<i>and I wanted him to acknowledge this.</i>

427
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,319
Everything all right at home?

428
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,599
Fine.

429
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,599
That friend of yours
who was so important to you?

430
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,200
Why do you ask?

431
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,720
I don't know,
you always talked about her.

432
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,400
She's fine.

433
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,279
What's she doing?

434
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,920
She works in
a sausage factory in Naples.

435
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,880
- Didn't she marry a storekeeper?
- Yes, but it didn't work out.

436
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,119
Right...

437
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,319
When I come down to Naples...

438
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:48,559
- You can introduce me to her.
- Of course.

439
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,359
Leave me a number, an address...

440
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,880
Mine or hers?

441
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,519
Yours.

442
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,599
All right.

443
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,880
Has she read your book?

444
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,799
- I don't know, have you read it?
- Of course.

445
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,400
I thought it was good.

446
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,960
Good how?

447
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,320
- There were some beautiful passages.
- Which ones?

448
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,679
The ones where
you allow the protagonist

449
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,079
to piece together
fragments of things in her own way.

450
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,079
And that's all?

451
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,199
- Isn't that enough?
- You clearly didn't like it.

452
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,440
No, I thought it was good.

453
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,320
It's a book that stirs debate,
it's selling well.

454
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,000
Exactly. That's good, right?

455
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,800
Yes, but not for you.

456
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,559
What doesn't work?

457
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,599
Elena...

458
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,159
There isn't much to it.

459
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,280
You use tales of romance and social
climbing to hide what's worth saying.

460
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,119
And what's that?

461
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,119
It's...

462
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,719
Forget it.

463
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,320
It's late, we need to get some sleep.

464
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,599
You did what you could, no?

465
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,039
Pity this, objectively...

466
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,880
isn't the time to be writing novels.

467
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,159
What time are you leaving
in the morning?

468
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,880
At dawn.

469
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,039
Shall we go to bed?

470
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,800
Let's go.

471
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,480
Bye.

472
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,760
What is it?

473
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,079
Can I sleep with you?

474
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:25,840
- Sleep?
- I'll get in next to you.

475
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,400
I won't bother you,
I don't want to be alone.

476
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,599
Absolutely not.

477
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,679
- Why?
- I'm engaged.

478
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,320
So? We'll just sleep.

479
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,400
Get out, I don't even know you.

480
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm Juan, I showed you my work.

481
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,800
What else do you want?

482
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,719
Out!

483
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,800
They told me you write about love
with great freedom.

484
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,320
Everything that happens to us
can be used to create.

485
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,440
It feeds our imagination.

486
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,320
Let me get close to you,
you'll be able to write about it.

487
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,000
Let go of me!

488
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,400
Let go of me, out!

489
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,639
You're a hypocrite.

490
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,039
Asshole.

491
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,320
Go on, read.

492
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,559
How boring!

493
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,440
<i>Did any stranger think</i>
<i>he could lay his hands on me</i>

494
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,679
and insult me if I rejected him?

495
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,760
What kind of person did he think I was?

496
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
What legitimized his request?

497
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,679
<i>Did it depend on my fame as a free</i>
<i>woman my book was giving me?</i>

498
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,280
I didn't consider myself a hypocrite.

499
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,840
<i>In Milan, I felt ready to make love</i>
<i>with Nino, betraying Pietro.</i>

500
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,280
That passion was of long standing,

501
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,360
it justified sexual desire, betrayal.

502
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,440
But sex for its own sake, no,

503
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,679
that disturbed me.

504
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:26,159
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

505
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:36,280
I just feel like I'm a hopeless mother,
I'm at my wits' end.

506
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,639
He cries all the time...
I can't feed him all night long.

507
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,239
I can't take it any more.

508
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,960
You're beautiful, you're smart.

509
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,320
You're everything.

510
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,559
You'll be a proper mother.

511
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,519
Your kids'll be lucky.

512
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,719
You've got a beautiful baby.

513
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,880
I didn't want him.

514
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,920
I hid that I was pregnant
from everyone,

515
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,639
including myself.

516
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:25,880
But my body was changing shape,
so I had to tell my parents.

517
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,599
We fought, there was a huge row.

518
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,480
So I left home.

519
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,679
I wouldn't admit I'd ruled out abortion
because I was scared of it.

520
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:42,880
I told myself I wanted the baby out
of love for the guy who got me pregnant.

521
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,079
He had said: "If you want it,
I want it too, out of love for you."

522
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,119
He was serious at the time,
I didn't make it up.

523
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,800
I'm not so stupid.

524
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,000
But after a few months
there was no love left,

525
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,159
just bitterness.

526
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,760
I was all alone before the birth

527
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,079
and if I've made it this far,
I owe it to Mariarosa.

528
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,199
She's savvy, generous and intelligent.

529
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,880
All the Airotas are generous
and intelligent.

530
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,880
They're a great family. I'm marrying
her brother soon, you know?

531
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,000
Families are disgusting,
it's all old stuff,

532
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,840
even if the family head is a professor.

533
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,599
My son's father
also works at the university.

534
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,519
Does he take an interest in the baby?

535
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,880
No.

536
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:39,039
The asshole hasn't been seen since.

537
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,280
He's charming,

538
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,039
the girls fight over him,
pulling him this way and that.

539
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,199
A male, save the moments you love him
and he enters you,

540
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,159
is always outside.

541
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,920
When you stop loving him, the very
thought you ever wanted him, irks you.

542
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,159
He liked me and I liked him.
End of story.

543
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,000
All that's left is the baby.

544
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,559
It's a part of you.

545
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,320
The father was a stranger
and is one again.

546
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,119
Even his name doesn't
have the sound it once did.

547
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,400
I used to repeat it in my head,
from when I woke up.

548
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,280
It was a magic word.

549
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,400
Now the sound of it makes me sad.

550
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,440
Nino...

551
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,000
Is the baby's father called Nino?

552
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,599
Yes.

553
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,559
Everyone knows him.

554
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,719
Nino what?

555
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,280
Nino Sarratore.

556
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,199
Professor Nino Sarratore.

556
00:41:57,305 --> 00:42:57,864
