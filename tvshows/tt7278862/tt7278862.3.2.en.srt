2
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:16,559
- It's just a sip.
- As if!

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
He drank the whole bottle,
he poured it for her sister too.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,079
It's not true,
I didn't pour it for her.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,359
You did, you liar!

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,759
You saw it too. Come on, help me.

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,479
- Can I help?
- Professor, that's for the women.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,719
Papa...

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,240
- Signora, it was all delicious.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,200
Your wife cooks so well
that I couldn't hold back.

11
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,679
Did you hear that compliment?

12
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,799
- How is he?
- Ugly, he's got crooked feet.

13
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,000
Papa was no better.

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,560
- What's that about your father?
- Nothing.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,719
Be quiet then.
All you do is boss us around.

16
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,799
Pietro's so refined!

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,399
Do you really have to go?

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,159
Papa, Pietro's got things to do.

19
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,879
I know the professor's got things to do,
but I'm sorry he's going.

20
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,200
Signor Greco,
I'm sorry too, I wish I could stay.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,879
I had a very good time.

22
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,120
But I really have to leave.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
But first I have something
important to say.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,599
Quiet now! The professor
has something important to say.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,000
- Papa...
- Quiet, you.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,959
Signor Greco,

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,439
I'm not good at these things.

28
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,319
You...

29
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,439
I imagine you already know, I mean...

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,680
I mean...

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,359
I'm asking you for your daughter's hand.

32
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,879
If an important person like you
asks for my Lenuccia's hand,

33
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,879
for me it is a great honor.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,879
You have an important job,
you're from a fine family.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,199
What can I say?

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,800
My daughter has happy eyes,

37
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,439
it shows that you love her
and that's enough for me.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,280
Then let's celebrate.

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,639
But before that,
we need to clear something up.

40
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,840
We don't agree with you
not getting married in church,

41
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,400
because marriage without a priest
isn't marriage.

42
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,400
I understand.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,199
I respect those who sincerely
entrust themselves to God.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm not a believer,
I have my own convictions,

45
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,319
but I don't believe in any god.

46
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,879
But signora, please, you can trust me.

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,879
Not being a believer doesn't mean
I don't believe in anything.

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,120
I have unshakable faith in the love
I feel for your daughter.

49
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,879
This love will make our marriage solid,

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,719
not an altar,
a priest or a city hall official.

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,120
If what counts is love,

52
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,680
what would it cost you?

53
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,560
Get married in church
then love each other, it's a formality.

54
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,840
No, it's a principle.

55
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,400
If I get married in church,
if I take communion,

56
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,639
I become someone who is untrustworthy,
who doesn't stick to his principles.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,840
And knowing how your daughter is...

58
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,840
she would stop loving me.

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,039
And you, signora...

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,520
I can't believe you'd give your daughter
to someone untrustworthy.

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,759
Since she was small
Lenuccia has been out of the ordinary,

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,600
she did things no other girl
in the neighborhood was capable of.

63
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,920
This girl has never disappointed me.

64
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,680
She's my pride, she's the pride
of the whole family.

65
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,839
With what she's done,
she deserves to be happy

66
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,759
and if anyone makes her suffer I'll make
them suffer a thousand times more.

67
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,160
I know how precious Elena is

68
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,519
and I'm grateful to you
for bringing her up this way.

69
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,160
It was my grandmother's,
my mother's mother.

70
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,040
My family is very happy
for you to have it.

71
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,759
Kiss! Kiss!

72
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,279
Congratulations, my daughter.

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,079
Thank you.

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
- At last, welcome to the family!
- At last, Signora Immacolata.

75
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,680
Peppino.

76
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,199
Congratulations!

77
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,399
Gianni.

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,839
We've married off this one,
now we have to marry off the other three.

79
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
All in good time.

80
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,920
- Cigarette?
- Thank you, I quit.

81
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,000
The builders are doing a good job,
but it's a mess here.

82
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,360
- It's all dirty!
- Hi there.

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,879
They'll be done in a few days.

84
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,759
It's not your problem,
I'm the one who cleans.

85
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,319
Elisa and I will help you.

86
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,879
Why do you need a license
if you don't even have a car?

87
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,560
You like wasting money.

88
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,199
So, the phone and the TV
are a waste of money, too.

89
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,879
You want to buy a car, I know you.

90
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,879
- How much you got stashed away?
- It's none of your business.

91
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,160
No?

92
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,959
Elena!

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
What're you doing? I just cleaned it!

94
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,000
Then you say it's me!

95
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,639
Enzo!

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,919
- Pasquale, what's happened?
- Can you come down?

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,360
Now? Why?

98
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,200
- Come down, we'll explain.
- I'll be right there.

99
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,519
- Where are you going?
- Be right back.

100
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,559
Where's she going?

101
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,639
Hi.

102
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,679
Hi, Lenù.

103
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,879
What's happened?

104
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,679
Lila doesn't feel well
and she wants to see you.

105
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,519
What happened?

106
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,799
She usually gets back
from the factory at four-thirty,

107
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,159
tonight when I came home
she wasn't there.

108
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,879
Gennarino was still with the neighbor.
I gave him dinner and she came in.

109
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,159
It must have been seven o'clock.

110
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,440
She was very pale.

111
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,600
She wouldn't answer any questions.

112
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,840
All she said was:

113
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,799
"My nails are falling out."

114
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,039
I looked at her hands,
I told her there was nothing wrong.

115
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
She started screaming.

116
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,600
She locked herself in her room
and started saying:

117
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,480
"Call Lenuccia,
I want to talk to Lenuccia."

118
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,519
- Did you have a fight?
- No.

119
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,360
Did she get injured at work?

120
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,559
I don't think so.

121
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,279
I don't know.

122
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,759
Let's not panic now.

123
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,320
Hopefully Lila will calm down
when she sees you.

124
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,879
Let's go.

125
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm so glad we found you!

126
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,279
You're an important person now,
you must be busy.

127
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,840
What are you two doing together?
You've moved to San Giovanni too?

128
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,879
No, I'm the section secretary now.

129
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,799
I often come to San Giovanni for
meetings, we met in the section office.

130
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,759
Is Lila a Communist too?

131
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,600
Lila's such a Communist
that she's never joined the party.

132
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,759
L'Unità reports a lot about students.
They interview them, listen to them.

133
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,519
People who actually work,

134
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,519
factory workers,
why don't they let them speak too?

135
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,240
The party stays mum, waiting
for Aldo Moro to go to government.

136
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,879
Are we Aldo Moro's lapdogs?

137
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,120
We have to make the revolution!

138
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,120
What do you reckon?

139
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,600
- You're right.
- Good, you've always been smart.

140
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,679
Go Lenù, she's in there.

141
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,120
Come in.

142
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,759
I knew you'd come. Give me a kiss.

143
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,200
I know all about you.

144
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,639
I saw you in the papers.

145
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
You look so good!

146
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,519
I also know you're marrying
a professor, well done.

147
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,799
Forgive me for bothering you
at this hour, but I need you.

148
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
My head's coming unstuck
like peeling wallpaper.

149
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,200
What happened?

150
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,200
I bothered you because
you have to promise me something.

151
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,559
If anything happens to me,
if I end up in hospital,

152
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,440
if they lock me up in an asylum,
if I disappear,

153
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,720
you have to take Gennaro.

154
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,360
You have to bring him up in your house.

155
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,799
Enzo's a good guy, I trust him,

156
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,399
but he can't give the child
what you can.

157
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,159
If you don't explain, I can't understand.

158
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,480
Promise first.

159
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,840
All right.

160
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,240
No, don't say all right!

161
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
You have to promise now
you'll take the boy.

162
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,639
And if you need money, go find Nino.

163
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Tell him he has to help you.

164
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,440
But promise.

165
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,919
"I'll raise your child."

166
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,360
I'll raise your child, I promise.

167
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,440
Good.

168
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,399
Now will you tell me what happened?

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,559
<i>I realized immediately</i>
<i>that Lila needed to talk.</i>

170
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,840
Talking soothed her.

171
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,399
<i>She told me that for her going to work</i>
<i>was a horrible and humiliating effort,</i>

172
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,559
but she had to do it.

173
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,080
Put a little white meat in, not just red.

174
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,200
<i>Bruno, Nino's friend</i>
<i>whom we'd met in Ischia,</i>

175
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,519
<i>who had given her a job,</i>
<i>was no longer the boy he once was.</i>

176
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,200
<i>His father died, the sausage factory</i>
<i>fell on his shoulders</i>

177
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,559
and it broke him.

178
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,440
Listen to this joke.

179
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,039
A man mistakenly enters
the ladies' to take a piss.

180
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,440
A woman comes in,
sees him and starts screaming.

181
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,279
And he goes:
"What the fuck are you screaming at?"

182
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,799
And she goes:
"This is only for women."

183
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,679
He turns around and shows his dick.

184
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,639
"Isn't this only for women?"

185
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,559
Didn't make you laugh, eh, girlie?

186
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,440
I know what you need to have fun.

187
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,679
How dare you, you asshole?

188
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,360
Never mind him!

189
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,080
He's all talk, he's harmless.

190
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,480
Harmless or not, he can't fuck with me!

191
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,240
I'll show you!

192
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,600
Bitch!

193
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,799
If they lay their hands on me again,
there'll be hell to pay.

194
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,200
You hear me?

195
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,039
Bruno, what kind of shithole is this?

196
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,559
You can't kick up a stink every time.

197
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,120
People need to horse around a bit
or it's agony in here.

198
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,559
- I thought you liked jokes.
- When I decide I do.

199
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
You're always the same.

200
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,919
Go back to work.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
Go!

202
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,159
<i>She had no news of the neighborhood,</i>
<i>she hadn't even seen her mother.</i>

203
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
She said:

204
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,879
<i>"I erased the past</i>
<i>and the past erased me."</i>

205
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,559
Until one night...

206
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,120
Lila, look who I brought to see you.

207
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,839
What are you doing here?

208
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,000
Good evening, Lila. How are you?

209
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
Standing, as you can see.

210
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,480
Shall I set a place for you?

211
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,759
No, I just dropped in to say hello.

212
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,960
I'll go back to the party meeting.

213
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,599
We bumped into each other.

214
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,400
He's become section secretary.

215
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,960
Who would have thought?

216
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,079
- A plate of pasta?
- There's plenty.

217
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,480
Come on.

218
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,839
Thank you.

219
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,799
So, what do you do in the party?

220
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm the neighborhood party secretary.

221
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,279
But soon they're going to kick me out.

222
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,799
Why?

223
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,319
They complain I make
too much fuss, that I'm not calm.

224
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,799
Guess who's the head of the right-wing
party for our neighborhood.

225
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,359
Gino.

226
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,519
- The pharmacist's son?
- Michele Solara's slave.

227
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,359
If the fascists raise their voices,
do I enact democratic vigilance?

228
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,799
What the fuck is democratic vigilance?

229
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,000
Pasquale's a friend, never mind
if he uses bad words.

230
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,839
I only came to tell you this.

231
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,680
If people had the strength you have...

232
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,599
the world would be a lot different.

233
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,839
Don't tell anyone in the neighborhood
that you came to my house.

234
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,759
You'll get in trouble.

235
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,559
I'm not afraid, I'll follow your example.

236
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
No one gave it back to the Solaras
and the Carraccis as good as you.

237
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,480
I'm completely out of touch,
even with my family.

238
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,680
Better that way.

239
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,559
Your father's repairing shoes on his own.

240
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
We never see your mother,

241
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,839
she stays shut away at home.

242
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,759
And Rino... remember
how well Rinuccio was doing?

243
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,720
He's a thorn in Stefano's side,
always begging him for money.

244
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,519
Whenever you want to come,
there's no need to tell me in advance.

245
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,039
I'll put out an extra plate,
you just sit and eat.

246
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,960
Thank you.

247
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,480
- You're not eating?
- I'm not hungry.

248
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,319
If you want some more, there's plenty.

249
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,880
Enzo not only worked in the factory,

250
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,720
<i>but at night he studied electronics</i>
<i>until he was in a stupor.</i>

251
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,559
Aren't you going to bed?

252
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,640
No, I have to study.

253
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,119
Shall we study a bit together?

254
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,119
<i>Lila helped him,</i>
<i>sorry to leave him alone.</i>

255
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Being near him calmed her.

256
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,799
We need to make practical examples
or it's just talk. Look here.

257
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,119
Zero.

258
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,599
One...

259
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,400
Schematize the door opening
using the 0-1 system, can you?

260
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,200
Sure.

261
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,599
Then you know how.

262
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,920
This way we can do even
more complicated things.

263
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
Yes, of course.

264
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,960
Everything okay at the sausage factory?

265
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Why don't you tell me
how things are in your factory?

266
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,119
What can I say...

267
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,759
same as ever.

268
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,960
Same here.

269
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,359
You say you can apply it to everything,

270
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,200
then let's schematize the factory.

271
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,319
- With the binary system?
- Yes.

272
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Are algorithms
a sequence of procedures?

273
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,160
So, we do lots of things
that are defined algorithms.

274
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,599
I know.

275
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,599
And if we do block diagrams,
we turn them into geometric shapes.

276
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,720
Exactly.

277
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,279
So they can be applied to everything.

278
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,240
We gotta try them on everything.

279
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,519
Help me.

280
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,839
Show me.

281
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,279
Shall we start with your factory?

282
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,960
They don't deserve anything.

283
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,240
Actually, do it by yourself,
I'm tired tonight. Good night.

284
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,799
What are you doing here?

285
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,799
I came to check, do you mind?

286
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,799
You can do what you want in here.

287
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,759
How's Pinuccia?

288
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,519
How would I know?

289
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,519
I think she's in the shit, she's
never been happy with your brother.

290
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,680
That summer she fell in love with me
and you with Nino.

291
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,839
That's when I found out that pregnant
women really like making love.

292
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,279
What? Pinuccia?

293
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,359
Do you really think
we went to get coconut?

294
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,960
You know, the factory
has always disgusted me.

295
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,559
Really,

296
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
since I was a kid.

297
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,720
But here in the drying room,
I felt all right.

298
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,599
Maybe because
there's the whole process.

299
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,599
The product being perfected

300
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,319
until it's ready to be sold.

301
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,279
Or the smell of cured meat

302
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,960
that reminds me of the smell of a man
and a woman touching each other.

303
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,839
What's wrong?

304
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
What are you doing? No!

305
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,039
Leave me alone.

306
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,319
Come on, show me.

307
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,640
Pull out that thingy of yours,
I'll break it off!

308
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,400
I hoped for a little gratitude, no?

309
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
Do I have to submit or you'll fire me?

310
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,039
Is that it?

311
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,720
Lila?

312
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,839
Are you all right?

313
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,000
This time you were lucky.

314
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,079
But I swear...

315
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,680
I don't give a shit if you fire me.

316
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,680
I'll make you regret the moment
you put your hands on me.

317
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,599
I didn't do anything to you.

318
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,920
Lila, I didn't do anything to you!
You hear me?

319
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,319
So, dear comrades, everyone has
their reasons to be here.

320
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,759
<i>Lila had always liked</i>
<i>Pasquale's political passion.</i>

321
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,680
<i>One night he dragged them</i>
<i>to a meeting with students and workers.</i>

322
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,519
The party abandoned my father,
although he'd been a great comrade.

323
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,160
He fought at the Ponte della Sanità
and after the war he took sides.

324
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,559
But nobody helped my mother,
she was left on her own.

325
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,000
She didn't exist anymore for the party.
The party!

326
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,359
Traditional left-wing parties are no
longer able to respond to the masses.

327
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,559
<i>She realized at once</i>
<i>who that student was.</i>

328
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,319
<i>She was Nadia,</i>
<i>Professor Galiani's daughter.</i>

329
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,839
<i>Nino's girlfriend who sent him</i>
<i>love letters to Ischia.</i>

330
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,720
I'd like to thank Nadia and all of you.

331
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,400
Tonight I've brought a dear friend
from my neighborhood,

332
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,640
Lila Cerullo,
a comrade from the working class.

333
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,799
She works in the food industry,
she's a mother...

334
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
She's my mother.

335
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,960
She makes many sacrifices

336
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:18,519
and although she's exhausted,
I persuaded her to come here tonight

337
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,400
because we have much to learn
from a person like her.

338
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,319
Please say something.

339
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,599
<i>Lila would have done better</i>
<i>to keep quiet,</i>

340
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,000
but she said: "She screwed me over.

341
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,359
<i>What would that shiny clean bitch</i>
<i>know about hard work?</i>

342
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,799
<i>I spoke without thinking</i>
<i>that an extra word you say today</i>

343
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,400
<i>becomes trouble the next day</i>
<i>and even worse the day after."</i>

344
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm not like you.

345
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,599
You all talk about the working class,

346
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,000
and I know nothing
about the working class.

347
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,880
But I do know the workers
in the factory where I work

348
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,680
and I can assure you, there's nothing
to be learned from them, except misery.

349
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,400
Can you imagine what it means
to spend eight hours a day

350
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,119
standing up to your waist
in mortadella cooking water?

351
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,759
Or to have your fingers covered in cuts
from slicing meat off animal bones?

352
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,279
Or to go in and out of refrigerated rooms
at 20 degrees below zero

353
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,279
and earn ten lire more.

354
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,000
Ten lire, for cold allowance?

355
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,440
If you can imagine that,

356
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:47,359
what can you learn
from people forced to live like that?

357
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,279
The women must quietly accept
men squeezing their asses.

358
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,720
If the boss feels like it, a woman has
to follow him into his office,

359
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,880
just as they used to with his father,
maybe even his grandfather.

360
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,960
We're searched because
there's a thing called the partial.

361
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,039
The partial is at the discretion
of the guard, who's the boss' spy.

362
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,160
He searches you if he thinks
you're taking salamis out.

363
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,720
The partial is not just for thieves,

364
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:25,000
it's especially for pretty girls
they want to get their hands on.

365
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,079
This is the situation
in the factory where I work.

366
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,960
The union's never entered, the workers
are poor people who are blackmailed,

367
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,240
subject to the law of the boss:
I pay you, so I own you.

368
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,599
I own your life, your family
and all that surrounds you.

369
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,359
So, either you do what I say,
or you'll be in big trouble.

370
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,519
So what do you want to learn from us?

371
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,359
You were fantastic, you speak so well.

372
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,720
We still have a lot to learn,
your speech showed us how much.

373
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,480
- Will you come back?
- Where will I get the time?

374
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,279
I have a child, I work eight hours a day,
not counting overtime.

375
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,559
At night, people like me
only want to sleep.

376
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,359
You really work in those conditions?

377
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,880
Why, how do you work?
And the other workers?

378
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,000
Fuck off, you and the working class.

379
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,079
Why didn't you ever say anything?

380
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,920
- Who put their hands on you?
- Nobody.

381
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,759
They don't dare with me.

382
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,720
<i>A few days later,</i>
<i>she found all her words</i>

383
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,440
<i>on a leaflet being handed out</i>
<i>outside the sausage factory.</i>

384
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,200
INVESTIGATION INTO WORKERS'
CONDITION IN NAPLES AND PROVINCES

385
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,359
Lila, hi.

386
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,640
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Dario from the union.

387
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,119
- Bye.
- All the best.

388
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,519
And you've got the nerve
to not even say hello. Stop.

389
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,799
What do you want?

390
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,319
Listen up.

391
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,480
If you said the things written here,
you're in deep trouble.

392
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,640
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't? Well, read this.

393
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,440
We always got along here,
only you could say these things.

394
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,759
I'll turn on the partial
whenever I like?

395
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,880
I put my hands on women?
Me, the father of a family?

396
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:14,599
Bruno's gonna make you pay dearly
when he reads this garbage.

397
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,480
By God, I oughta smash her face
with my own hands.

398
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,720
Where's Cerullo?

399
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,599
There she is!

400
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,640
- Was it you?
- No.

401
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,720
Tell me the truth, there's too many
troublemakers in here.

402
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,079
- Have you joined them?
- I said no.

403
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,720
So who was it?

404
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:39,920
Who had the nerve
to write this bullshit?

405
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,920
It must have been an office worker.

406
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,160
The office workers don't do this stuff.

407
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,759
What are you gonna do? Birds sing,
take it out on them.

408
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,400
Lunchtime!

409
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,839
It's lunchtime, I said! Enjoy!

410
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,359
No, you stay here.

411
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,160
Come on, it's lunchtime! Quickly!

412
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,400
I gave you a job, I didn't say anything
when you joined the union,

413
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,720
my father would have kicked you out.

414
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,039
I made a mistake in the drying room,
but I apologized.

415
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,160
You can't say I persecuted you.
So what do you do?

416
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,920
You put my factory in a bad light.

417
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,839
You say that I take
the women workers there.

418
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Why, do I take them there? As if!

419
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,319
You make me regret
how good I've been to you.

420
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,759
Good? I work myself to death
and you pay me peanuts.

421
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,160
I'm doing you a favor.

422
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,440
See? You talk just like those assholes!

423
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,359
Just admit you wrote those things!

424
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,319
Bruno, trust me, I have a small kid.

425
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:05,079
I really didn't write those things.

426
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,559
You know what you're forcing me to do?

427
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,400
No, and I don't want to know.

428
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,239
I'll tell you anyway,
if they're your friends, warn them.

429
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,119
The next time they come here,

430
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,239
I'll have them beaten up so hard
they'll lose the will to go on.

431
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,320
And get rid of
this fucking Christmas tree!

432
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,360
It's still Christmas in here...
Christmas is over!

433
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,599
She was furious, especially with Nadia.

434
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,440
She was fond of Pasquale,

435
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,599
he belonged to our world,

436
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,000
<i>he always paid first-hand,</i>
<i>Nadia didn't.</i>

437
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,960
Nadia's not here,
but come in and wait for her.

438
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,880
<i>She'd gotten her in trouble</i>
<i>without risking anything.</i>

439
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,239
This way.

440
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,159
- He can play with my grandson.
- So pretty!

441
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,559
We didn't get one.

442
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,280
Go and play with the little boy.

443
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,559
Please.

444
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,960
<i>As soon as she set foot in the house,</i>
<i>she felt the same unease</i>

445
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,280
<i>as when she had accompanied me</i>
<i>to the party and felt tired.</i>

446
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,159
<i>Tired, as if the air in the house</i>
<i>were poisoned.</i>

447
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,800
It's mine!

448
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,840
- Stop it or we'll go home!
- Leave them, they're just kids.

449
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,800
<i>Mrs. Galiani had acted kind,</i>
<i>interested, understanding.</i>

450
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,239
But Lila was immediately convinced

451
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,320
<i>that all that courtesy</i>
<i>and understanding was false.</i>

452
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,199
Do you want to make Mamma cross
or will you behave?

453
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,960
He never behaves, but he's clever.

454
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:49,599
He can read and write
all the letters, capitals and lower case.

455
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,880
I try not to speak to him in dialect,
to encourage him.

456
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,480
<i>Teaching Gennaro</i>
<i>to speak proper Italian,</i>

457
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,760
<i>to read and write, to study,</i>
<i>served no purpose.</i>

458
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,079
<i>Mrs. Galiani and Nadia</i>
<i>and all their kind</i>

459
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:07,239
would have stayed on top...

460
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,280
and she below.

461
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,960
<i>Professor Galiani's grandson would give</i>
<i>orders and Gennaro would obey.</i>

462
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,719
As she thought these terrible things,

463
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,760
she felt her heart break in her chest.

464
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,519
Good morning, there are guests.

465
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,480
Hi, Mamma.

466
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,199
Give Mamma a kiss.

467
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,559
Lila! Thank goodness you're here,
we need to talk.

468
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,079
That's why I'm here,
I don't have much time.

469
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,840
All right, let's go.

470
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,000
Guys, we're going to my room.

471
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,360
Hi.

472
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,880
You've unleashed hell! The boss is
threatening to bring some ugly people.

473
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,599
How scary!

474
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,960
Don't ever show up there again,
you risk causing real trouble.

475
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,760
Of course I'm going to show up.

476
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,119
Wait, listen to me.

477
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,400
What you told us is too important,

478
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,199
we decided
it was our duty to divulge it.

479
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,519
We'll protect you and your comrades.

480
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,199
- What job do you do?
- What do you mean?

481
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,159
- What job do you do?
- Doctor.

482
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,800
- Like your father.
- Yes.

483
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,320
Are you risking your job? Could you
end up on the street with your son?

484
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,480
It's not a contest to see
who risks more, how can I put it?

485
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,599
He was arrested, I have eight charges
against me, it's not about risk.

486
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,239
Then what is it about?

487
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,239
We're all on the front line and ready
to assume our responsibilities.

488
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,079
So if I lose my job
I can come and live here?

489
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,000
Yes, you can!

490
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,400
If you like, yes.

491
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,320
You can't work in those conditions,
you have to fight to change things.

492
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,320
Don't get in the way.

493
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,119
That's how it is, Lila.

494
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,000
Stretch your legs out. Breathe!

495
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,400
- Take her coat off.
- Give her some air.

496
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,639
I'm fine.

497
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,760
Hand me my bag.

498
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,159
Are you sleeping well?

499
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,800
It depends.

500
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,199
On what?

501
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,920
My thoughts.

502
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,760
- I have to go now.
- Wait, Lila.

503
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,440
- Lisa, can you...
- Of course.

504
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,639
Thank you.

505
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,519
Do you ever feel pain in your chest?

506
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,440
Like a weight, but light.

507
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,679
Have you fainted before?

508
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
No.

509
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,800
Are you regular?

510
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,920
- With what?
- Menstruation.

511
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,440
No.

512
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,239
- When did you last have it?
- I dunno!

513
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,920
- Don't you keep track?
- Why, should I keep track?

514
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,400
Yes, it'd be better.

515
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,840
Do you use birth control?

516
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,199
The spiral, condoms, the pill?

517
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,119
What pill?

518
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:11,800
It's a new medicine
for not getting pregnant.

519
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,400
But why are we talking
about these things?

520
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,840
You've pushed your body too far,
you need to slow down.

521
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Meaning?

522
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,840
You're malnourished,
you've neglected yourself.

523
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,920
Your liver is enlarged,
you need to do some tests.

524
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,199
I don't have time for that,
give me some medicine.

525
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,440
No point mincing words with you.
I think I heard a murmur.

526
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,079
A murmur?

527
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,880
A murmur is a heart problem,
we have to see how serious it is.

528
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,280
- You mean I'm dying?
- No.

529
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,280
You need to see a cardiologist,
come to the hospital tomorrow...

530
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,719
Hold on.

531
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,880
On Monday I'm going to work.

532
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,000
Pasquale, take me home.

533
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,559
Gennarino, put that car down.

534
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,920
No, it's a gift.

535
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,440
- You taking me home or not?
- I'm right here.

536
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,920
You're all very generous
in this house, thank you!

537
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,719
What did Armando tell you?

538
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
I need to eat more.

539
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
See? You neglect your health.

540
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,920
You're not my father,
you're not my brother, you're nothing.

541
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,480
Whaddaya want from me?

542
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,840
- Can't I worry about you?
- No.

543
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,519
And watch what you say and do,
especially with Enzo.

544
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,199
If you tell him I wasn't well,
you've lost me as a friend.

545
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,719
And anyway it was just a dizzy spell.

546
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,840
Lila, listen to me.

547
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,559
Take a couple of days off,
don't go to Soccavo's.

548
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,320
We're trying to get the union involved,
it's better that way.

549
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,599
It's a political opportunity.

550
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:21,320
The fuck do I care
about political opportunities?

551
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,599
You got me into trouble
and now I'll do what I want.

552
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,400
Stay home for a couple of days.

553
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,960
Again...

554
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,960
Listen to me.

555
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,000
Come, Gennarino.

556
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,960
Bye, Gennarino.

557
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,119
Bye.

558
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,119
Take care.

559
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,880
Pasquale was trying to warn her.

560
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,400
<i>He knew the grapevine would</i>
<i>generate more unpleasantness</i>

561
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,679
and Bruno would call the fascists.

562
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
Go and wash your hands.

563
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,480
You go out and come back
with Pasquale.

564
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:19,679
Why? What secrets do you have?

565
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,679
Nothing, he bugs me.
Him and the union...

566
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,920
What's wrong?

567
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,280
Pasquale's a friend. But what are you?

568
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,719
Why am I the only one
who never knows anything?

569
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,599
Can I sleep with you?

570
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,239
Sleep how?

571
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,639
You decide.

572
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,360
And do you want to?

573
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,440
As long as you hold me close.

574
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,519
You don't want me.

575
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,039
I want you,

576
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,880
but I don't feel anything.

577
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,239
So why do you want to sleep with me?

578
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,639
I'm scared you'll send me away.

579
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,239
Let's go to bed.

580
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:40,719
Each in our own room?

581
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:44,639
No, in mine.

582
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,760
You're trembling?

583
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:43,079
My feet are freezing.

584
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:45,400
Can I put them near yours?

585
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,679
Shall I caress you?

586
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,679
Don't bother.

587
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,239
Can I sleep?

588
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,119
Sleep.

589
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,360
- Cerullo!
- Gino.

590
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,880
This is where you ended up?
You acted the lady and look at you now.

591
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,519
- What is it?
- Can you still read?

592
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,000
WORKER!
ENOUGH RED BLACKMAIL!

593
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,599
I do, but when did you fascists
learn to write?

594
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,599
Be careful, I asked your husband
for permission to smash your face in.

595
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:12,360
And he said yes.

596
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,880
And to smash my face in

597
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:20,280
you went to ask for
my husband's permission?

598
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,800
It's not even good as toilet paper.

599
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:29,800
Pick it up right now.

600
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:32,000
Or else?

601
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,239
- I said pick it up.
- Or else what'll you do?

602
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,280
Pick it up!

603
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,400
- Who's this, Cerullo?
- The neighborhood idiot.

604
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,760
Is this asshole bothering you?

605
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:45,679
What the fuck are you doing?

606
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,559
Piece of shit!

607
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:48,760
Goddamnit!

608
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,280
Let's get outta here.

609
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,960
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, you'll get hurt!

610
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,280
Let's get outta here.

611
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,199
Communist shitbag!

612
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,239
Asshole! Next time I'll kill you!

613
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,840
Before you wanted to tear his ear off
now you're helping him?

614
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,519
- He helped me.
- Did you?

615
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,119
I'm gonna smash her face,
not some fascist.

616
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:07,679
Did you call the Communists?

617
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,199
No, but I know who called
the fascists: Soccavo.

618
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,840
What a piece of shit!

619
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,239
- We gotta do something.
- Who'll help us, the union?

620
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,840
First, we gotta realize that
all our problems are connected.

621
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,360
We still need to figure out
what to fight for.

622
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,760
All our illnesses
are linked to our working conditions,

623
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,840
problems with our hands, our lungs...

624
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:30,800
The factory is pitiful, the hygienic
conditions are disgusting.

625
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,960
There's no need to wait for the union,

626
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:40,320
we gotta speak with Soccavo.

627
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,840
You go.

628
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,880
- I get pissed off too easy.
- Better.

629
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,280
No, you go, you know how to talk,
you'll put him in his place.

630
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,840
Forget it.

631
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,119
Lila!

632
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,000
What a pleasure! How are you?

633
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,679
And you kept Signora Carracci
hidden among the salamis?

634
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,519
I'll come back later.

635
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,880
Sit down.

636
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:42,199
Sit down, or you'll get tired.

637
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,920
How are you?

638
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,400
Everything's okay.

639
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,719
We've restructured
the store in Piazza dei Martiri.

640
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,639
There are new shelves,
modern light fittings...

641
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,360
- I'm not interested in your store.
- Our store.

642
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,519
- We invented it together.
- I didn't invent anything with you.

643
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,719
If you'd kept working with me
you'd be a queen.

644
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,239
You know I'm marrying Gigliola?

645
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:39,280
I'd invite you to the wedding
but I can't embarrass your husband.

646
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,719
He's having a hard time too,
his grocery stores aren't doing so well.

647
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,360
The competition's growing.

648
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,000
Even Marcello sells bread, pasta...

649
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,760
You and your brother had the nerve
to put Stefano under too?

650
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,880
What are you thinking?

651
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,000
We help our friends.
Isn't that right, Mr. Soccavo?

652
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,480
- You know who Marcello got in to help?
- No.

653
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,320
Your brother.

654
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,159
You're making Rino work as a clerk?

655
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,199
What could he do? You disappeared.

656
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,960
He's got the whole family on his
shoulders, Pinuccia's pregnant again.

657
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,400
He asked Marcello for a hand
and he helped him.

658
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,840
Aren't you glad?

659
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,280
No, I'm not glad.
I don't like anything you do.

660
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,880
This girl is determined,
she has the courage of a lion.

661
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,960
She can turn shit into gold,
she could reorganize your business.

662
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:53,400
She has a brain like no other woman,
or even us men.

663
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,480
But she's crazy in the head.

664
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,119
And so one day she didn't show up
for work, she disappeared.

665
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,239
This is because she still hasn't found
a real man to put her in her place.

666
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,039
She can't cook? She learns.
The house is dirty? She cleans.

667
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,280
A real man has
the woman do everything.

668
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:14,480
Just to give you an example...

669
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,480
I met a woman
who didn't know how to whistle.

670
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,599
We were together for two hours of fire.

671
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,400
And then I said to her: "Go on, whistle."

672
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,679
You won't believe it but she whistled.

673
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,239
If you know
how to educate a woman, fine.

674
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:36,840
If you don't, forget it,
she'll only hurt you.

675
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:49,119
But with her it's difficult.

676
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,880
Just look at her: small eyes,
tits you can't even see...

677
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,599
An ass like a little kid, a broomstick.

678
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:01,519
With someone like her
you can't even get it up.

679
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:08,880
But it only takes a moment
and you want to fuck her.

680
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:10,840
Piece of shit!

681
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:12,800
Bitch.

682
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:15,039
You think I'm nobody?

683
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,760
You really think you depend
on Mr. Soccavo? You're wrong.

684
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,039
Mr. Soccavo is in my mother's red book.

685
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,199
Michele, you're taking it too far.

686
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,119
Remember, you depend on me,
always and only.

687
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:30,760
And if I want you,
you come running, is that clear?

688
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,760
I don't know what trouble you're in
to end up in the Solaras' hands.

689
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,239
Maybe you better go to work.

690
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,320
To work?

691
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,559
I could whistle when I was five.

692
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,079
Go away! Go away!

693
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,719
Mamma, Mamma, help!

694
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,199
I beg you...

695
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,440
don't hurt me.

696
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:34,559
With the appearance of Michele Solara,

697
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,960
<i>her small world made up of Enzo</i>
<i>and Gennaro crumbled away.</i>

698
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,400
The boundaries were dissolving again,

699
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:47,679
<i>everything was spilling out</i>
<i>without borders.</i>

700
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,480
Lila had a breakdown.

701
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,679
<i>I let her talk</i>
<i>and then here we are,</i>

702
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,519
in this room in San Giovanni a Teduccio.

703
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,559
I felt incredibly guilty, I thought:

704
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:09,039
this is the life I could have had

705
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,960
<i>and if it didn't happen</i>
<i>it's also thanks to her.</i>

706
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,320
Remember what I told you
about Gennaro.

707
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,079
I'll stay for a while longer.

708
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:28,360
Watch over me until I fall asleep.

709
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,920
Watch over me always,
even when you leave Naples.

710
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:42,559
So I'll know you're watching
and I can relax.

710
00:57:43,305 --> 00:58:43,804
