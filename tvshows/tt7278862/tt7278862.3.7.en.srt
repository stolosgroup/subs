00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,395
I'll repeat the question.

3
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:20,915
Nostalgia for the ancient glory of Rome

4
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:23,915
<i>in "De reditu suo "</i>
<i>by Rutilio Namaziano.</i>

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,595
"Exaudi, regina tui pulcherrima mundi,

6
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,634
inter sidereos,

7
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:40,795
Roma, recepta polos."

8
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,475
Do these verses tell you anything?

9
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:45,634
No.

10
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:53,674
- You know who Rutilio Namaziano is?
- No and I can't see why I need to.

11
00:00:57,954 --> 00:00:59,915
You're a reactionary, aren't you?

12
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,275
Are you afraid of the revolution?

13
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,395
Of revolution in general, no.

14
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,195
Of that of jackasses, yes. Here.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

16
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:31,434
Call me a jackass again
and I'll empty my gun in your face.

17
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:34,915
Either you actually fire it,

18
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,915
or I advise you
to get rid of that weapon right now

19
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:43,195
because if you don't shoot,
in one minute I'll go and report you.

20
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:57,154
Son of a bitch.

21
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,154
Son of a bitch!

22
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,035
We'll resume the exams in one hour.

23
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:22,795
Since when does a "good boy"
point a gun at a teacher?

24
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:27,835
I won't drop the charges just because
his father is your colleague!

25
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,555
Papa...

26
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:35,075
- Do you realize how you behave?
- What should I do?

27
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:36,635
Keep it calm.

28
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,355
I don't understand you.

29
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:42,474
You behave like
our unbearable professors in Pisa.

30
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:45,955
- Hardly.
- But you do.

31
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:50,675
You've forgotten how we struggled
to keep up with useless courses.

32
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,555
- My course isn't useless.
- You should ask your students.

33
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:57,594
You ask opinions
from people with competence.

34
00:02:57,675 --> 00:02:59,914
Would you ask me
if I were your student?

35
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:02,115
I have a great relationship
with my students.

36
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:04,115
You like those who wag their tails.

37
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:06,555
And you like braggarts,
like your friend in Naples.

38
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,555
Yes, I like braggarts.

39
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,994
So, why have you always been
the most dutiful?

40
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:14,555
Because I was poor and
it already seemed a miracle to be there.

41
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,874
That boy has
nothing in common with you.

42
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:22,154
Right, he's the son of a baron,
he has much more in common with you.

43
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,754
It was pointless reporting him,
you'd already failed him.

44
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:29,115
He committed a crime!

45
00:03:29,194 --> 00:03:30,994
He was just messing around.

46
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,994
A gun isn't a toy.

47
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,434
- He didn't shoot.
- And if he had?

48
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,154
But he didn't!

49
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,835
I should've waited for him
to shoot to report him?

50
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:43,434
- Your nerves are shattered.
- Think of your own nerves!

51
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,275
You're afraid.

52
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:53,714
I'm not afraid,

53
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:55,635
I'm used to these things.

54
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:58,835
Let's leave it at this, enough.

55
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:32,275
Bye, guys.

56
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:35,955
- Did you park here?
- Yes, there.

57
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,234
Me too.

58
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:40,435
Did you come on the Vespa?

59
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,195
Stop it!

60
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,195
- Silvia came on her Vespa!
- They lent it to me.

61
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,554
Then we'll accompany the young lady!

62
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,875
Stop it! You're unbearable!

63
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,354
- Give Mirko a kiss from me?
- All right.

64
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,315
- Good night.
- Bye.

65
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:57,755
Take care.

66
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,395
Hey, Franco.

67
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:05,755
Hey, guys.

68
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:08,234
Wait.

69
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,995
C'mon, wait.

70
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:16,114
Silvia, run!

71
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:20,075
Silvia, run!

72
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:23,594
Run, Silvia!

73
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:25,794
Where are you going?

74
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,875
Fucking fascists!

75
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:37,875
Bastard!

76
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:40,354
What the fuck are you doing?

77
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:44,995
Don't move!

78
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,234
Leave her alone!

79
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,315
Don't move.

80
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:51,914
Bastards!

81
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,635
It's nothing.

82
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,554
Come here.

83
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:52,914
<i>When I found out about</i>
<i>Silvia and Franco's tragedy,</i>

84
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:55,154
I went to Milan to visit them.

85
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:58,914
<i>I left Florence,</i>
<i>Pietro and his bad mood.</i>

86
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,395
- Are you tired?
- A little.

87
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,635
- You too, right?
- Yes, it shows.

88
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:08,234
It shows.

89
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,594
I'll take my shoes off.

90
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:14,755
How are you?

91
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,674
It's very difficult to be around him.

92
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,794
I can imagine.

93
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,594
He feels guilty for
what happened to Silvia.

94
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:25,594
He's here, yet he'd like to disappear.

95
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,515
He's here, but he's not really here.

96
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:35,074
- And his eye?
- Nothing could be done.

97
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,314
Mariarosa, who's here?

98
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:41,434
Elena's here.

99
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:46,554
I'll go in.

100
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:52,635
- Can I come too?
- No, we'll stay here.

101
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:55,914
Will you show me some things?

102
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,635
What did you bring?

103
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:03,074
Before we left, with Mamma
we made a treasure hunt.

104
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:06,715
Franco?

105
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,194
It's not a good time, Elena.

106
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:13,034
Why?

107
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,355
I'm coming in.

108
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:26,154
Please.

109
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:16,074
Why did you come all the way to Milan?

110
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,034
You could have just called.

111
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,875
If only you'd answer.

112
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:26,034
What did you want to say?

113
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,275
Go away, Elena.

114
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,115
I wanted to spend some time with you.

115
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:43,154
I don't want you here, go away.

116
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,314
Why?

117
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,595
No!

118
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:09,834
Dede, go away, I'll be there in a minute.

119
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:12,034
Please, send her away.

120
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,554
Can I stay?

121
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,595
No! You can't stay!

122
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:18,875
Did you hear your mother? Go away!

123
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:33,194
She's a very rude little girl.

124
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,875
You're very rude.

125
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:43,635
Auntie said
that Franco used to be your boyfriend.

126
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:45,834
Used to be.

127
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,275
Is Auntie with Franco now?

128
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:50,515
More or less.

129
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,794
Are you jealous?

130
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,074
No, I'm not jealous.

131
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:58,995
It was many years ago,
now I'm with Papa.

132
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,395
Now go to sleep.

133
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:08,914
Good night.

134
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,635
Kiss.

135
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,834
Good night. Sleep tight.

136
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,355
Can you leave the door open?

137
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:21,074
I'll leave it open a bit.

138
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:23,595
Good night.

139
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,954
I'm sorry for Franco.

140
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:51,275
He needs time.

141
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:55,074
He did a lot for me when I was in Pisa.

142
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:04,995
But all that affection

143
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:09,595
was only there because

144
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:13,834
I corresponded to the model woman
he imagined at his side.

145
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,034
I was a young girl back then.

146
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:28,554
And I didn't realize

147
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,074
that his wanting to transform me

148
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:37,235
was the proof
that he didn't like me as I was.

149
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:42,475
He wanted me to be someone else.

150
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:46,034
He wanted a woman

151
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:49,954
how he imagined he'd be
if he were a woman.

152
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,154
And he molded me

153
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,434
to achieve the ideal girlfriend.

154
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:04,554
Maybe there's something wrong
with men's desire to educate us.

155
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:13,875
I hate intelligent men
who tell me how I should be.

156
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:18,674
I prefer Franco as he is now,

157
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:22,235
suffering and pensive.

158
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,355
And an asshole.

159
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:28,355
An asshole, too,
now he has the right to be.

160
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:29,595
Yeah.

161
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:37,034
Why don't you write
something about that?

162
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:42,794
What do you mean?

163
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:47,434
Write down what you just said.

164
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:56,475
Even Pietro tries to impose his way
of seeing things on me...

165
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:59,475
Pietro can barely figure out
his own manhood,

166
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:04,595
let alone impose a vision
of womanhood on you.

167
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:08,235
I would have sworn
you wouldn't marry him.

168
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:11,914
You really are a good girl.

169
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:17,674
I mean it.

170
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:22,355
Write down what you just said.

171
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,314
So, we were at this point,

172
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:30,674
<i>my husband's sister</i>
<i>considered my marriage a mistake</i>

173
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,995
and frankly told me so.

174
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:35,834
Are you awake?

175
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:38,954
Sleep.

176
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:44,914
Sleep.

177
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,715
Sleep.

178
00:16:56,674 --> 00:16:59,834
I'm my own and I have the power!

179
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:03,354
WOMEN ARE SUBJECTED
TO VIOLENCE EVERY DAY

180
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:10,435
NOT ONLY RAPED...
BUT BLAMED TOO!

181
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:34,834
We must accept equal rights.

182
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:41,195
<i>The only male among</i>
<i>all those women was Mirko,</i>

183
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,955
Silvia and Nino's son.

184
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:45,794
<i>Who knows how</i>
<i>he was being brought up.</i>

185
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,715
We mustn't accept equal rights.

186
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,594
Fascist assholes, their dicks!

187
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:52,995
All they understand is their dicks.

188
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:55,915
When their dicks are impotent,

189
00:17:55,995 --> 00:18:00,874
those shits replace them
with metal bars, clubs,

190
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:02,715
the army.

191
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:05,874
Let's end it with men.

192
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,074
Even our companions are fascists.

193
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,114
Enough! Let's play husband and wife!

194
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,314
- Tell me to wash the dishes.
- Wash the dishes!

195
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:17,675
I'll never ever wash them, you do it.

196
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,755
I'm tired, I've worked all day.

197
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,834
So have I!

198
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,034
What should I do now?

199
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:25,394
Give me a slap.

200
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:27,554
No.

201
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:28,995
Give me a slap!

202
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:36,314
<i>Despite all our efforts,</i>
<i>the new flesh did what the old had done.</i>

203
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:40,235
<i>We were a chain of shadows</i>
<i>going on stage</i>

204
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:44,354
<i>with the same charge of love,</i>
<i>hatred, desire and violence.</i>

205
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:04,195
<i>Maturity consisted in accepting</i>
<i>the turn existence had taken</i>

206
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,675
without getting too upset by it.

207
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:11,114
<i>I was Mrs. Airota,</i>
<i>a woman saddened by inaction,</i>

208
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:14,435
<i>and who, in any case,</i>
<i>in order to combat despondency</i>

209
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:18,955
<i>had in secret begun studying</i>
<i>the invention of women by men.</i>

210
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:23,594
<i>Defoe/Flanders,</i>
<i>Flaubert/Bovary, Tolstoy/Karenina.</i>

211
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:27,874
<i>I discovered automatons of women</i>
<i>fabricated by men.</i>

212
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:31,235
<i>There was nothing of ours</i>
<i>and what little arose,</i>

213
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,955
<i>became material</i>
<i>to be manufactured by men.</i>

214
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:36,394
Have you read "Madame Bovary"?

215
00:19:40,435 --> 00:19:41,515
Don't read it.

216
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:49,995
Hi.

217
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,275
There's a friend of Papa's.

218
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,034
A friend of Papa's?

219
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,074
I think he's a colleague.

220
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:00,195
I think.

221
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:01,955
Let's go and see who it is.

222
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,195
Come on.

223
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,235
Look who I've brought you.

224
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:19,034
Hi!

225
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:20,834
How are you?

226
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:22,755
Well, you?

227
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,034
Well.

228
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,915
I've met Dede, so you're Elsa?

229
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:33,354
You're so pretty!

230
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:35,715
They're beautiful.

231
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:38,354
Forgive the intrusion.

232
00:20:38,435 --> 00:20:41,034
I ran into him at the university
and invited him to lunch.

233
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,874
- I brought some pastries.
- No problem.

234
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:46,554
Where there's enough for four
there's enough for five.

235
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:48,034
Nino, come.

236
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,475
- The house is splendid, Lenù.
- Thank you.

237
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:53,515
Sit here.

238
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,675
Why were you
at the university in Florence?

239
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,794
I met Pietro's father
at a Socialist congress in Rome

240
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:03,634
and he told me
Pietro needed a reference

241
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:07,114
for the book he was writing,
so I offered to bring it to him.

242
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,794
I'll go and set the table.

243
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:22,354
- I'll keep you company.
- Stay here, Elena will do it.

244
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,155
Sit down.

245
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,235
Sit down, Nino.

246
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,515
I come to Florence often for work.

247
00:21:37,074 --> 00:21:39,074
I didn't know you lived here

248
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:42,074
and that you had two lovely young ladies.

249
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:43,715
But very crazy!

250
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:46,435
It shows.

251
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:49,554
- Are you still lecturing in Milan?
- No, I'm in Naples now.

252
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:52,275
- What subject?
- Urban geography.

253
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,155
How come you went back?

254
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:56,195
My mother's not very well.

255
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:57,354
I'm sorry, what's wrong?

256
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,235
Her heart.

257
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:03,834
- How are your siblings?
- Fine.

258
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:07,074
And your father?

259
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:10,675
The usual, but time passes,
one grows up,

260
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,834
we've reconciled.

261
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:17,755
You realize they're human beings
with their virtues and flaws

262
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,634
and you learn to accept them.

263
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:24,594
How much trouble
we caused our fathers, Pietro.

264
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:27,314
And now that it's our turn
how are we doing?

265
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:28,794
I'm doing well.

266
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:32,834
I have no doubt,
you married an extraordinary woman.

267
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:38,394
And these two girls
are well-behaved and elegant.

268
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:41,155
Dede, that dress really suits you.

269
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,995
And you, with that yellow barrette?

270
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:46,755
Who gave it to you?

271
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:49,634
- Mamma, she gives us everything.
- And Papa.

272
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,594
- Mamma.
- Not only Mamma.

273
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,995
How do you make that spiral?

274
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,915
It takes years of practice. Look.

275
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,594
Would you like a slice of apple?

276
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:08,435
Do you eat apples?

277
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:14,874
And do you want a slice of apple?

278
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,275
You sure?

279
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:21,594
I have a son your age,
his name's Albertino.

280
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:24,074
I'll show him to you.

281
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:28,314
In this picture
he seems calm and well-behaved,

282
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:30,314
but he's a pest, look.

283
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:34,874
Is he the kind who seems
well-behaved but he's not?

284
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,074
Exactly, a pest.

285
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:39,675
But when he laughs
he makes even the stones laugh.

286
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:49,675
He's beautiful.

287
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,915
Cute.

288
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,755
Everything was delicious,
you've become an excellent cook.

289
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:02,755
- I'll clear the table.
- No, I'll do it, relax.

290
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:04,515
It's fun.

291
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:06,354
Dede will you give me a hand?

292
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:08,394
Help me with the dishes.

293
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:10,755
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I can do it.

294
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,394
Sit down.

295
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:16,834
- If you can't find the trash, it's here.
- Perfect.

296
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,475
Would you like a coffee?

297
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,634
- Yes.
- Yes, please.

298
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:27,394
I'll get...

299
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:32,955
- Elena, shall I get the glasses?
- Yes.

300
00:24:50,915 --> 00:24:54,755
Seeing two men
wash the dishes, looks strange.

301
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:56,475
It's not that strange.

302
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:58,515
Or perhaps Papa doesn't do enough?

303
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:03,515
- It was a pleasure seeing you.
- Me too.

304
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:07,034
I'm sorry to leave in such a rush,
but I have an appointment.

305
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:11,515
- Imagine if I'm late for Coldagelli.
- God forbid.

306
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,594
I'll be back next week.

307
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:17,235
- Call us.
- Of course.

308
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:19,114
Goodbye, little soldiers!

309
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:20,915
Be good.

310
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:24,235
- Pietro, thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

311
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,834
- Bye, Elena.
- Bye, Nino.

312
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:27,755
See you soon, thanks again.

313
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:32,435
Bye, Nino.

314
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:39,354
At last a person
worth spending time with.

315
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:47,275
<i>I hoped that Nino</i>
<i>would call right away, the next day.</i>

316
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:51,114
<i>Instead, a week slipped by</i>
<i>without any news from him.</i>

317
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:53,995
I felt as if I had a bad cold.

318
00:25:57,995 --> 00:25:59,755
I became listless,

319
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:02,354
I stopped reading and taking notes.

320
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:05,755
<i>I was angry at myself</i>
<i>for that senseless waiting.</i>

321
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:07,955
Here we are!

322
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,354
Is it ready, Mamma?

323
00:26:13,554 --> 00:26:14,955
Dede!

324
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:16,955
Pick it up and go wash your hands!

325
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,594
- No.
- I said go!

326
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:20,634
Right now!

327
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:31,235
Nino came to the university today,

328
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:33,354
we had coffee.

329
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,034
I couldn't convince him to come to lunch.

330
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:38,594
He's back...

331
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:42,275
For a couple of days,
but he hasn't had a moment.

332
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:45,314
He invited us out for lunch
on Sunday with the girls,

333
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,915
so you don't get tired.

334
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,394
When will just
the two of us go out to eat?

335
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:01,955
Let's go.

336
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,195
You and I can go...

337
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:14,034
Shall we go for a picnic?

338
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:17,394
We'll go for a picnic.

339
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,155
There they are!

340
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:12,594
Nino!

341
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:13,675
Hey, you!

342
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:15,715
Hi!

343
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:20,515
We're going to a place
where the food is fantastic.

344
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:21,834
It's over there.

345
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,794
Let's go.

346
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:26,834
They make the yummiest frittelle.

347
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,114
You look great.

348
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:31,794
You can have them with jam inside,

349
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:34,794
custard cream...

350
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:42,034
I want ten more.

351
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:47,034
You live in Florence
and you don't know Luciano's?

352
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:49,034
We don't go out much.

353
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,915
It's very good.

354
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:55,594
How come nothing of yours
has come out?

355
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,755
I've been doing other things.

356
00:28:58,275 --> 00:29:00,794
- Your novel was excellent.
- Thank you.

357
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:04,874
You've always been good at writing.

358
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:07,554
- Are you writing now?
- In my spare time.

359
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,435
- Is it a novel?
- I don't know what it is.

360
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:17,034
- The theme?
- Men who fabricate women.

361
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:18,715
Interesting.

362
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:24,594
I read "The Invention of Liberation"

363
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,235
by Jean Starobinski, do you know him?

364
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:30,834
- Yes, but I've never read him.
- It's a book about the 1700s.

365
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:34,915
In the chapter "The Fictitious
Realm of Women" he explains

366
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:38,475
that being treated like queens
was only an illusion,

367
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:42,235
because the promise of pleasure
rotated around them.

368
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,155
What do you mean?

369
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:47,675
Love was a game, a lie,

370
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:51,794
and that lie was not despicable,
on the contrary, it was a refinement.

371
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:56,114
That way a man could have
a wife and a lover,

372
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:59,195
like he had a house in the city
and one in the country.

373
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,915
The quest for pleasure
justified a double life.

374
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:07,475
In fact, the 1700s
is the age of libertines.

375
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,554
However, it was male pleasure.

376
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:12,314
But it takes two to make love
and there were very free women.

377
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:15,755
But their freedom
was instrumental to male pleasure.

378
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,275
Get busy, I want to read you.

379
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,034
Who wants more frittelle ?

380
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:28,195
I do.

381
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:32,794
Luciano, can you bring us
ten more frittelle ?

382
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:37,394
- Let's not overdo it, one each is fine.
- Coming up.

383
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:40,475
- I want ten.
- One each is enough.

384
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:42,314
I want ten.

385
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:46,235
We'll have them bring ten
but you'll get two.

386
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:51,874
You have to leave your wife more time.

387
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:55,675
If she were organized
she'd have all day.

388
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:58,594
I'm serious.

389
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:02,874
If you don't, you're guilty from
a human and a political point of view.

390
00:31:04,435 --> 00:31:06,435
What would the crime be?

391
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,794
Waste of intelligence.

392
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:12,515
A community that smothers
the intellectual energies of women

393
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:16,074
with housework and child-rearing
is its own enemy.

394
00:31:17,915 --> 00:31:20,314
Elena is free
to cultivate her intelligence,

395
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:23,354
as long as it doesn't take time
from my work.

396
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:26,155
If she doesn't take it from you,
who can she take it from?

397
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:30,874
When our tasks have
the urgency of passion,

398
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,995
nothing can stop us
from completing them.

399
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:36,794
He's saying I have no interests.

400
00:31:36,874 --> 00:31:38,955
- No.
- Is he right?

401
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,314
Is it you?

402
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:49,394
We brought them all, they're the last.

403
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,515
- But for our customer...
- Thank you.

404
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:55,874
Let's do this.

405
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:58,675
I'll eat one,

406
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:01,235
Mamma too, Papa too...

407
00:32:02,235 --> 00:32:04,955
And you eat two, but then enough.

408
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:10,715
Luciano, I'll be back in 30 days
with these two splendid young ladies

409
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:13,394
and I want to find
a mountain of frittelle .

410
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:17,435
Don't throw money away,
we have a guest room.

411
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,475
You can stay with us.

412
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:24,594
We said that
Elena needs time to herself,

413
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:26,834
better not to burden her
with my presence.

414
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:29,435
It'd be a pleasure for me and the girls.

415
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:32,235
I'll think about it,
but I've already imposed too much.

416
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:34,594
In fact, today, you're my guests.

417
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:36,034
Absolutely not.

418
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:37,995
I insist.

419
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,955
Next time, I'll insist.

420
00:32:44,314 --> 00:32:46,594
Consult me before you make invitations.

421
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:51,155
I thought you'd like it.

422
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:55,034
Of course I'd like it.

423
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:59,634
The 30 days flew by too fast.

424
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:03,794
<i>It didn't occur to me to call Lila,</i>
<i>I didn't call Mariarosa,</i>

425
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:07,114
<i>I barely paid</i>
<i>any attention to the girls.</i>

426
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:10,074
I just wrote, with great commitment.

427
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,915
<i>My only preoccupation was to have</i>
<i>a readable text in time,</i>

428
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:17,275
but the month passed and he didn't call.

429
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:21,794
This game drives me crazy!

430
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:24,594
What did I say? No playing...

431
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:26,314
At the table.

432
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:30,594
Eat.

433
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,554
Have you heard from Nino?

434
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:35,874
Yes, we've spoken often
in recent weeks.

435
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,874
- You've spoken to him often?
- Yes.

436
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,354
And you didn't tell me?

437
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:51,475
- What's there to tell?
- That you've spoken often.

438
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:53,314
They were work calls.

439
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:57,074
Seeing as you've become
such good friends,

440
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:59,515
tell me if he deigns to say he's coming,

441
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:03,155
seeing I have to do everything
and I'd like some advance notice.

442
00:34:03,634 --> 00:34:05,715
He's coming the day after tomorrow.

443
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:10,874
He's staying at a hotel
with his wife and son.

444
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,394
Will we go to eat frittelle ?

445
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:18,994
- He could have let us know.
- He decided at the last moment.

446
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:20,434
He's rude.

447
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:22,834
What's the problem?

448
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:28,275
<i>- But the frittelle ?</i>
<i>- Yes, we'll go to Luciano's.</i>

449
00:34:28,354 --> 00:34:30,555
- Want to go to Luciano's?
- Yeah!

450
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:43,555
Hello?

451
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:45,635
Hi.

452
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,035
I'll put him on.

453
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,275
- Pietro, it's for you.
- Yes.

454
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,235
It's Nino.

455
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:57,514
Remind him about the frittelle .

456
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,595
Coming.

457
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:01,755
Give it to me.

458
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:06,794
As soon as Nino's mentioned here,
there's talk of frittelle .

459
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:08,514
How are you?

460
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:12,434
Have you made a reservation?

461
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:14,434
At Luciano's?

462
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,354
So, what is it?

463
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:23,755
- How do I look?
- Very nice.

464
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:27,115
What do you say? Do you like it?

465
00:35:31,155 --> 00:35:32,235
Pietro?

466
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:34,715
How do I look?

467
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:36,195
Nice.

468
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,195
- Do you like it?
- It's very nice.

469
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:41,275
I'm not convinced.

470
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:52,715
Wait.

471
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,555
Nice.

472
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:57,474
More this or the other one?

473
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,314
The purple one.

474
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:01,354
- The purple one's better?
- Yes.

475
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:04,275
I don't know...

476
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:13,394
Which one do you like best?

477
00:36:15,115 --> 00:36:18,794
<i>I didn't want that dress</i>
<i>just to look better than another,</i>

478
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:21,155
I wanted it to look great.

479
00:36:21,235 --> 00:36:25,474
<i>I wanted my earrings</i>
<i>and my hair to look great</i>

480
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:27,555
and my shoes to look great too.

481
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:31,275
<i>I detested competing in looks</i>
<i>with another woman,</i>

482
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:33,514
especially under the gaze of a man.

483
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:37,834
I would've liked to make up an excuse

484
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:42,555
<i>and send only Pietro and the girls</i>
<i>to go with Nino and his family.</i>

485
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:44,994
But I couldn't resist it.

486
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,155
Elena.

487
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:48,994
- Eleonora.
- My pleasure, Pietro.

488
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:51,595
I feared Nino's wife would weigh me up,

489
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:55,555
<i>study me in every detail with</i>
<i>the haughtiness of a rich young lady</i>

490
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:58,195
<i>educated to care</i>
<i>for her body since birth.</i>

491
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,635
Nino said you're studying law.

492
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:40,635
I was.

493
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:44,755
Now I follow Albertino
more than university.

494
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:47,794
My father has a law firm,
he's a great lawyer, but...

495
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,954
I don't know.

496
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:56,834
Elena, Nino told me
you studied literature in Pisa.

497
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:58,514
Why Pisa?

498
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:02,275
I won a scholarship, otherwise
I wouldn't have been able to study.

499
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:04,834
- Elena's a great writer.
- Not at all!

500
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:08,434
- Really?
- I published a novel eight years ago.

501
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:14,394
- Elena.
- Yes?

502
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:17,874
Tomorrow will you take me
shopping while Nino works?

503
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:19,195
All right.

504
00:38:21,394 --> 00:38:22,994
Darling, what are you doing?

505
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:24,195
Pietro, will you take her?

506
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,075
What are you reading?

507
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:30,675
Are you leaving your wife time to work?

508
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:32,994
Of course.

509
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:36,635
- How is it going?
- I finished a first draft.

510
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:39,035
Have you read it?

511
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:42,755
- Elena never lets me read anything.
- You don't want to.

512
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:46,155
- With all that you have to read, right?
- It's true.

513
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:48,994
With studies, publications, theses...

514
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,595
I'd like to attend one of your lessons.

515
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:53,474
Whenever you like.

516
00:38:57,675 --> 00:38:59,914
Today he seems calm...

517
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:03,235
Would you like to take a look at my text?

518
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:06,874
- Would you really let me read it?
- If it doesn't bore you, yes.

519
00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:08,275
Of course.

520
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:55,115
Elena.

521
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:56,675
Lenù.

522
00:40:09,314 --> 00:40:10,514
Am I bothering you?

523
00:40:10,595 --> 00:40:13,115
No, we were having breakfast, come in.

524
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:16,354
Eleonora and the boy are waiting,
I came to call you.

525
00:40:16,434 --> 00:40:18,195
- I'll be right out.
- Wait.

526
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:23,914
I came here without her
because I wanted to speak to you alone.

527
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,115
I read it.

528
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,314
Already?

529
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,035
It's exceptional work.

530
00:40:36,595 --> 00:40:38,994
You have a great capacity for study,

531
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:41,675
admirable rigor,

532
00:40:41,755 --> 00:40:43,834
inventiveness that leaves me in awe.

533
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:47,474
What I always envied about you

534
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,635
is your great ability as a narrator.

535
00:40:52,235 --> 00:40:55,314
I don't know how to define it,
if it's an essay or a story,

536
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:58,715
but it's extraordinary, well done.

537
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,235
Is that a flaw?

538
00:41:03,314 --> 00:41:04,874
What?

539
00:41:05,555 --> 00:41:07,675
That it can't be cataloged.

540
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:09,914
No, it's a merit.

541
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:14,514
- Should I publish it as it is?
- Absolutely yes.

542
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,874
Thank you.

543
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:22,354
I'm going back to Naples tomorrow,
if you want I'll call and we can talk.

544
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:30,195
If you come to Florence,
don't go to a hotel, stay here.

545
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:34,555
No, I have my little boarding house
near the station, I'm comfortable there.

546
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:40,474
- You sure I won't bother you?
- No.

547
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:53,595
Lila, when we were kids,
dazzled us both.

548
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,235
What do you mean?

549
00:41:57,954 --> 00:42:01,874
You attributed to her
abilities that were yours.

550
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:03,555
And I did worse:

551
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:07,555
what I'd seen in you,
I stupidly looked for in her.

552
00:42:14,994 --> 00:42:16,555
Will you be back soon?

553
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:20,514
Yes.

554
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:23,555
I'll be back soon.

555
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:32,715
Hurry.

556
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,834
They're waiting for us.

557
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,155
- Eleonora.
- Dede.

558
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:46,514
I'm off, I'm running late.

559
00:42:46,595 --> 00:42:47,755
Bye, Lenù.

560
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,275
Look who's here!

561
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:50,954
Bye, honey.

562
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:54,794
Be a good boy for Mommy.

563
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:56,954
Have a nice time.

564
00:43:02,035 --> 00:43:03,954
Can we go and look at embroidery?

565
00:43:04,794 --> 00:43:06,834
Do you know any embroidery stores?

566
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,354
Yes, let's go.

567
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:12,354
Let's go.

568
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:26,354
Here's our children's section,
all hand embroidered.

569
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:31,755
Mamma, can we get this?

570
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:34,595
No, sweetheart,
you can't have everything.

571
00:43:34,675 --> 00:43:36,434
- Please!
- No.

572
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,834
All right.

573
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,874
I really admire you,
they're so well behaved.

574
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:45,954
- Can we leave the children with you?
- Of course.

575
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:54,914
Nino had already told me
everything about you.

576
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:58,715
But I'm a bit jealous.

577
00:43:58,794 --> 00:44:00,595
Not because you're clever.

578
00:44:02,075 --> 00:44:04,115
You've known him forever and I haven't.

579
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:08,394
I'd like to have met him
when I was a kid,

580
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:11,675
know what he was like at 11.

581
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:16,914
What was his voice like as a kid?

582
00:44:17,794 --> 00:44:19,675
What was his laugh like?

583
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:23,834
Thankfully Albertino's
his spitting image.

584
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:28,675
- Will you wait while I try it on?
- Sure.

585
00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:34,235
I trust you.

586
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:50,595
What are you doing, Lenù?

587
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:52,394
Have you seen yourself?

588
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:04,528
