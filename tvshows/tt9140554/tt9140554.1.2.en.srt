00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,917
<i>On behalf
of the Time Variance Authority,</i>

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,042
I hereby arrest you
for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,875
<i>Long ago, the all-knowing
Time-Keepers emerged,</i>

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,708
<i>creating and organizing
the Sacred Timeline.</i>

5
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,750
<i>Sometimes, people like you
veer off the path.</i>

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>We call those Variants.</i>

7
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,000
Laufeyson, how do you plead?

8
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,667
- I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.
- How long have you been here?

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>I don't know. It's hard to say,
time passes differently here in the TVA.</i>

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,125
Now, you parade about

11
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,667
as if you're the divine arbiters
of power in the universe.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,208
Infinity Stones?

13
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,000
Some of the guys
use 'em as paperweights.

14
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,042
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

15
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:58,583
<i>- I can't go back, can I?</i>
<i>- I can't offer you salvation,</i>

16
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,458
but maybe I can offer
you something better.

17
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:04,333
<i>A fugitive Variant's been killing
our Minutemen.</i>

18
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,417
And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?

19
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,167
<i>Why me?</i>

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,417
<i>The Variant we're hunting is...</i>

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,542
You.

24
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,625
Hi! What's going on?

25
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,042
You guys aren't dressed right.

26
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,833
I... So...

27
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,250
Variant detected, Commander.

28
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:39,750
Let's move.

29
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,167
Some of us need this, you know.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,667
No nexus energy yet, ma'am.

31
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,875
It's a trap.
Watch your backs!

32
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,167
<i>My lords, my ladies, welcome</i>

33
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,542
<i>and thank you for joining us,
here at the castle.</i>

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,500
<i>Please, settle into your seats
for a great battle is about to commence.</i>

35
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,667
<i>The prize? Our princess.</i>

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,375
<i>Will evil prevail,
or are we holding out for a hero?</i>

37
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,417
Commander?

38
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:55,292
<i>Where have all the good men gone</i>
<i>And where are all the Gods?</i>

39
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,708
<i>Where's the streetwise
Hercules to fight...</i>

40
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,083
What are you doing?

41
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,583
Having some fun.

42
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:08,125
<i>Isn't there a white knight
Upon a fiery steed?</i>

43
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:14,792
<i>Late at night, I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need</i>

44
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,083
<i>I need a hero</i>

45
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,583
<i>I'm holding out for a hero
Till the end of the night</i>

46
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,125
<i>He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast</i>

47
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,417
<i>And he's gotta be fresh from the fight</i>

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,250
<i>I need a hero</i>

49
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:34,042
<i>I'm holding out for a hero
'Till the morning light</i>

50
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,125
<i>He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon</i>

51
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,417
<i>And he's gotta be larger than life</i>

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,833
<i>I need a hero!</i>

53
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,542
Okay, y'all,
let's review what we've learned.

54
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,667
What happens when a nexus event
branches past red line?

55
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,250
Very bad things.

56
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,667
Come on, Loki. What is it?

57
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:23,208
It's when the TVA can
no longer reset a nexus event.

58
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,208
Okay? Boring.

59
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,500
Right. And that would lead
to the destruction of the timeline

60
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,208
and the collapse of reality as we know it.

61
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,292
Can you hear me?

62
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,708
Are you a recording? Or are you alive?

63
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,000
Uh, sorta both.

64
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,083
Ah.

65
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,333
Watch it! Where's your manners?

66
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,875
Oh! Hey! Quit it!

67
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,167
That is not nice. Jerk.

68
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,184
- You can't hide...
- Training goin' well?

69
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,708
- Yeah.
- Is that my jet ski magazine?

70
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:52,917
Put it down. Gear up.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,542
There's been an attack. Let's go.

72
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,792
Put it on.

73
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,083
Good. Yeah. Smart.

74
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,292
C-20 and her team went dark

75
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,292
shortly after they jumped
into the 1985 branch.

76
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,292
All signs point to another ambush.

77
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,542
We've grabbed enough temporal aura
to know it's our Loki Variant.

78
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,875
But which kind of Loki, remains unknown.

79
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,000
They're the lesser kind, to be clear.

80
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me see
the back of that jacket.

81
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:34,667
Hmm.

82
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,042
Very subtle. Well done.

83
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,792
I don't want anybody out there
to forget what you are.

84
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,555
Oh, your only hope
of capturing a murderer?

85
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,375
No. A cosmic mistake.

86
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,125
- That's enough.
- Lovely.

87
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,208
Here's the deal.

88
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,625
When we get out on the branch,

89
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,583
we're not just
looking for a Time Criminal.

90
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,000
We're looking for a Loki.

91
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,500
A variation of this guy.

92
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,917
A type we should
all be very familiar with,

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
because the TVA
has pruned a lotta these guys,

94
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,083
almost more than any other Variant.

95
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,667
And no two are alike.

96
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,125
Slight differences in appearances,
or not so slight.

97
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,708
Different powers, although,
powers, generally include

98
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,833
shape-shifting,
illusion-projection, and my favorite...

99
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,833
Duplication-casting.

100
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,542
Illusion-projection.

101
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,542
No, they're two
completely different powers.

102
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,708
How?

103
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:28,375
Illusion-projection involves depicting
a detailed image from outside oneself,

104
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,375
which is perceptible
in the external world,

105
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,708
whereas duplication-casting
entails recreating

106
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,250
an exact facsimile of one's own body
in its present circumstance,

107
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,833
which acts as a true holographic mirror
of its molecular structure.

108
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,667
But you already knew that.

109
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,625
Okay, take a breath. Noted.

110
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:51,208
We're gonna break into two teams,
including myself and Professor Loki.

111
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,333
Why?

112
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,167
Because whoever this Variant is,
we haven't been able to find him.

113
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,000
So let's bring in an expert.

114
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,375
That's me.

115
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,375
- Do I get a weapon?
- Nah.

116
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,208
Well, I'll have my magic back.
Is no one concerned about that?

117
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,167
- Of what?
- Me betraying you.

118
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,458
- No.
- Why not?

119
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,875
You know that we can catch you.

120
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,167
And how's betraying us gonna get you
any closer to the Time-Keepers?

121
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,792
An audience
with the Time-Keepers is on the table?

122
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,208
Keep that focus.

123
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,000
Apex of nexus signature located, ma'am.

124
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,250
Let me ask you this,

125
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,708
why don't we just travel
back to before the attack,

126
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,333
when the Variant first arrives?

127
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,292
Nexus events destabilize the time flow.

128
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,625
This branch is still changing and growing,
so you gotta show up in real time.

129
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,083
Did you watch any of the training videos
you were supposed to?

130
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,958
Well, as many as I could stand.

131
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,000
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.

132
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,292
And what do these do?

133
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,625
Reset charges prune the affected
radius of a branched timeline,

134
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,500
allowing time to heal all its wounds.

135
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,792
Which sounds like a nice way

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,292
of saying disintegrate
everything in its vicinity.

137
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,833
He's on it.

138
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,375
I watched the videos.

139
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,625
I mean, some of them.

140
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,792
So he's taking hostages now?

141
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,167
The Variant's never
taken a hostage before.

142
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,601
Maybe he's upping his game.

143
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,000
Or he pruned her.

144
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,364
A Loki couldn't
have gotten the jump on C-20.

145
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,000
I think you underestimate, actually...

146
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,750
Fan out and search for her.

147
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,833
And hurry up,

148
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:27,417
we're at three units until red line.

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,460
- Let's go. She's right.
- Come on.

150
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,250
Wait...

151
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,125
If you leave this tent,
you'll end up like them.

152
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,125
What do you see?

153
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,625
I see a scheme,

154
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,167
and in that scheme, I see myself.

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,667
We have a saying in Asgard,

156
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:02,542
"Where there are wolf's ears,
wolf's teeth are near."

157
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,167
It means to be aware of your surroundings.

158
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,125
Which is absurd, because my people are,
by nature, gullible fools.

159
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,833
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,

160
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,625
exploited time and time again
simply by listening.

161
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,167
My teeth were sharp,
but my ears even sharper.

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,458
We're running out of time, Mobius.

163
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,042
Hold it. Just give him a chance.

164
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,042
You remind me of them.

165
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,583
The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

166
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,042
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

167
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,500
Those you underestimate will devour you.

168
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,000
You underestimate me,

169
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,042
just as you
underestimate this lesser Loki.

170
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,083
Which is why, you walk into
one wolf's mouth after another.

171
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,917
Two units. He is wasting our time.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,917
Okay. Come on, Loki,
make a long story short.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,476
We need to look for C-20.

174
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,333
That's exactly what
the Variant wants you to do.

175
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,917
It's a trap.
He's waiting for you outside this tent.

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,458
Should I secure the reset charges?

177
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,667
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.

178
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,958
- He knows that I'm stronger.
- Almost one unit.

179
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,292
And he rightly believes that together
we can overthrow and rule the TVA.

180
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,167
But that's not what I want.
I have a new purpose.

181
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,792
I'm a servant of the Sacred Timeline.

182
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,792
And knowing
what I now know about his tactics,

183
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,083
I can deliver you the Variant,

184
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,542
but I need assurances.

185
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,625
Yeah?

186
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,042
Assurances that I won't be
completely disintegrated

187
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,083
the moment the job has been done.

188
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,375
Right...

189
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,643
We'll need to speak
to the Time-Keepers at once.

190
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,125
They're in graver danger than we realized.

191
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
He's lying. Just playing games.

192
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,917
There's no one out there.

193
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,333
Reset the timeline.

194
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,250
You had me for a second.

195
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,792
My ears are sharp too.

196
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,167
Is it just me, or does this office
keep getting better and better?

197
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,917
Where'd you get that one, the snow globe?

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,042
I love those.

199
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,333
I don't remember bringing back that case.

200
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,708
You're not the only analyst
working for me.

201
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,333
But, would you say,
maybe, I'm your favorite one?

202
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,333
And why do you get to keep all
the trophies from my cases in here?

203
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,625
You don't think I'd love
having that roller skate

204
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,417
there sprucing up my cubicle?

205
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,375
Because I approve the missions.

206
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,208
Good point.

207
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,625
Speaking of which,
let's talk about the one you just botched.

208
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,708
You might need this for our discussion.

209
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,250
I hope it's a double.

210
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:21,292
This Variant is...
"Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable."

211
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,125
Sounds like someone else I know.

212
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,750
I was just thinking
it sounds like someone I know.

213
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,042
- Mobius?
- What?

214
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,542
Those rings were already there.

215
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,333
And they're all from you.

216
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,417
Maybe it's from
your other favorite analyst.

217
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,458
Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry.

218
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,958
I realize that my, you know,

219
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,583
methods with this Loki
are controversial, but...

220
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,958
Towing a dangerous Variant
into the field is controversial.

221
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,583
Yeah, it didn't go exactly
the way I wanted it to today,

222
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,292
but here's what we did find out.

223
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,208
The Variant likes to stall for time,

224
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,083
and, eventually, we'll catch
the other one doing the same thing.

225
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,708
Because understanding
this Loki helps me get closer

226
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,625
to the one we're chasing. Right?

227
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,583
Look, I know you have
a soft spot for broken things.

228
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,208
- I don't think so.
- Yes, you do.

229
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,250
But Loki is an evil, lying scourge.

230
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,792
That is the part he plays
on the Sacred Timeline.

231
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,417
Maybe he wants to mix it up.

232
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,625
Sometimes you get tired
of playing the same part.

233
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,833
Is that possible? He can change?

234
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,917
Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it.

235
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,000
And then, it shall be so.

236
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,875
And how are the old Time-Keepers?

237
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,000
How do you think?

238
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,250
I don't know.
'Cause I've never met 'em.

239
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,208
Thankfully. Although,
I shouldn't say that.

240
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,333
That one looks...

241
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,167
The Time-Keepers are monitoring
every aspect of this case.

242
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,167
I've never seen them so involved.

243
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,375
They want that Variant caught.

244
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,958
So do I.

245
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,875
And this is the last chance
you're gonna get with this Loki.

246
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,083
Great. That's all I'm gonna need.

247
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,792
Thank you, R Slayer.

248
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,417
I don't remember this.

249
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,500
This must be from that analyst
you keep on the side.

250
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,750
Stay focused.

251
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,333
Eyes on the road.

252
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,083
Mobius?

253
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,417
I was almost gone.

254
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,750
You really believe in this Variant?

255
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,167
Mmm... Luckily, he believes in himself
enough for the both of us.

256
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,000
And, hey, if it doesn't work,
I'll delete him myself.

257
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,458
He's really arrogant.

258
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,875
You're probably wondering
what happened out on the mission.

259
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,458
That was your first lesson
in catching a Loki.

260
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,500
Expect the expected.

261
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,125
Half the fun of being a trickster

262
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,708
is knowing everyone knows
you're a trickster, and then,

263
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,667
many of your tricks
can come from exploiting

264
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,750
- the fact that you know that they know...
- Okay. Just shut up!

265
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,417
Please. What happened
to the guy I met on the elevator?

266
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,167
Who didn't like to talk. Remember him?

267
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,458
Now I'm stuck with this guy

268
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,083
who won't stop yacking away
about what makes a Loki tick!

269
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,375
What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?

270
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,042
No. I don't care what makes you tick.

271
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,833
You're here to help me catch
the superior version of yourself.

272
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:05,917
- That's it!
- Hang on.

273
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm not sure "superior"
is actually quite the right word.

274
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,292
See? There it is. Right there.

275
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,875
I believed, stupidly,

276
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,667
that insecure need for validation
would motivate you to find the killer.

277
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,542
Not 'cause you care about
the TVA mission or bein' a hero,

278
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:24,083
but because you know this Variant
is better than you and you can't take it.

279
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,792
Very nice.

280
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:34,792
I mean, it is adorable that you think
you could possibly manipulate me.

281
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,417
I'm ten steps ahead of you.

282
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,833
I've been playing a game
of my own all along.

283
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,750
What, charm your way
in front of the Time-Keepers,

284
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,417
hustle them, and seize control of the TVA?

285
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,083
Am I getting warm?

286
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:51,542
A double cross
by history's most reliable liar.

287
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,583
Okay. Why are you in there
sticking your neck out for me?

288
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,792
I'll give you two options,

289
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,750
and you can believe
whichever one you want.

290
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,625
A, because I see a scared
little boy, shivering in the cold.

291
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,000
And you kinda feel bad for that ice runt.

292
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,708
Or B, I just wanna catch this guy,

293
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,042
and I'll tell you whatever
I need to tell you.

294
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,208
I don't need your sympathy.

295
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,167
Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.

296
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,958
What's this?
Next step of your manipulation...

297
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,083
This is the final step.
Your last chance.

298
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,958
Oh, and what does my desperate
last chance require?

299
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,167
Work.

300
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,375
Work?

301
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,500
I need you to go over each
and every one of the Variant's case files,

302
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,375
and then, give me your... How do I put it?

303
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,708
Your unique Loki perspective.

304
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,167
And who knows?
Maybe there's something that we missed.

305
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,792
Well, you're idiots.
I suspect you probably missed a lot.

306
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,500
That's why I'm lucky
I got ya for a little bit longer.

307
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,958
Let me park ya at this desk.

308
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,500
And don't be afraid
to really lean into this work.

309
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,000
Here's a good trick for you.

310
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,792
Pretend your life depends on it.

311
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,083
I'm gonna get a snack.

312
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,708
Oh, my goodness.

313
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,375
Don't tell me the Variant ambushed
and killed another team of Minutemen.

314
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,208
And stole
their reset charge as well.

315
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,833
Shh.

316
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,458
Shh.

317
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,000
Hi.

318
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,000
Hello?

319
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,125
Can I help you?

320
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,708
Yes. I'm on some important TVA business.

321
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,875
Follow-up to a field mission.
You know how it goes.

322
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,208
We red lined near the apex, and...

323
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,750
Well, it's never good.

324
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:42,583
Um, I'd like all files pertaining
to the creation of the TVA, please.

325
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,500
Those are classified.

326
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,792
Okay. I'd like all files pertaining
to the beginning of time then.

327
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,833
- Those are classified.
- Okay, the end of time.

328
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,208
- Those are classified.
- Okay, what files can I have?

329
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:03,875
Happy reading.

330
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,708
I found something.

331
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,583
No, I said, "Don't bother me
until you've read all the files."

332
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,792
- I have.
- Every file?

333
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,250
- Yes.
- Pertaining to the Variant?

334
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,750
The answer isn't in the files,
it's on the timeline.

335
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,333
He's hiding in apocalypses.

336
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,458
Which apocalypse?

337
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,958
Any time in history?
There's, like, a million of 'em.

338
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,083
Ragnarok. Are you familiar?

339
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,083
Yes. The destruction of Asgard
and most of its people. I'm sorry.

340
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,750
Yes, very sad.

341
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,167
Anyway, it got me thinking...

342
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Go ahead.

343
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,458
Nexus events

344
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:58,833
happen when someone does something
they're not supposed to do, right?

345
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,458
Well, it's a little more
complicated, but, yeah.

346
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,375
Great. And then that thing
they're not supposed to do,

347
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,000
cascades into a whole range of other
things that aren't supposed to happen.

348
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,792
And so on and so forth, until eventually,
a new timeline branches. Yes?

349
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,458
Chaotic alterations
of a predetermined outcome.

350
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,625
- Exactly. So, let's just say...
- Mmm-hmm. What are you doing?

351
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,917
...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.

352
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,542
- It's not Asgard, that's my lunch.
- It's a metaphor.

353
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,265
- Just hang in there.
- I want that salad.

354
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,125
And I could go down to Asgard

355
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,042
before Ragnarok
causes its complete destruction

356
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,792
and I could do anything I wanted.

357
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:37,625
I could, let's say,
push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.

358
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,833
- There he goes.
- The salt's Hulk?

359
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:44,625
And I could also...
Set fire to the palace.

360
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,917
No, just stop.
Don't set fire to the palace.

361
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,167
Okay? I can do whatever I want to do,
and it would never matter.

362
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,625
It wouldn't go against the dictates
of the timeline because...

363
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,833
- Excuse me?
- Oh, God!

364
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,042
- You!
- Nice to see you.

365
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,167
I just need this for a second. Thanks.

366
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,500
Because the apocalypse is coming.

367
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,667
Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy
Asgard no matter what I do.

368
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,208
No, don't do...

369
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,250
- There's the apocalypse.
- That's the apocalypse?

370
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,083
Ragnarok obliterates the salt.

371
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,250
Ragnarok.

372
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,208
There it is.

373
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,542
What am I lookin' at?

374
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,500
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor.
But you see what I mean.

375
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,500
It doesn't matter.
It could be any apocalypse.

376
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,917
It could be a tidal wave.
It could be a meteor.

377
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,167
It could be a volcano, a supernova.

378
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,167
If everything and everyone around you
is destined for imminent destruction,

379
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,208
then nothing that I say or do will matter,

380
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,417
because the timeline's not gonna branch.

381
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,875
'Cause it gets destroyed.

382
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:01,167
Hence, the Variant could be
hiding in the apocalypse

383
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,000
and do whatever he wants,
and we wouldn't know!

384
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,042
Not bad.

385
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,917
Take me to a real apocalypse,
to Ragnarok, I'll show you.

386
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,125
Yeah. So you can run away
back to your homeland? No.

387
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,083
No, I'm not going home.
We can go anywhere.

388
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:19,125
I'm not taking you for a stroll along
the promenade, much less an apocalypse.

389
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,750
Oh, Mobius, come on!

390
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,167
What could possibly go wrong?

391
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,875
We gotta properly test this theory.

392
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,417
Well, here's a fun theory.

393
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,125
You lure me out into the field,
and stab me in the back.

394
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,125
And that's a theory I don't wanna test.

395
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,958
I'd never stab anyone in the back.

396
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,875
That's such a boring form of betrayal.

397
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,000
Loki, I've studied almost
every moment of your entire life.

398
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:40,167
You've literally stabbed
people in the back, like, 50 times.

399
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,292
Well, I'd never do it again,
because it got old.

400
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,417
Okay.

401
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,167
Okay, look, you don't trust me,
you can trust one thing.

402
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,292
I love to be right.

403
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,250
- Here we go.
- Shh, any minute now.

404
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,125
Until this entire town
is wiped off the face of this planet.

405
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,792
Imagine. All that volcanic ash...

406
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,625
I know. We don't want to get too giddy.

407
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,167
Oh, come on! It's cool.

408
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,833
No, it is cool, but it's just
not in good taste because...

409
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,458
They're all gonna die anyway.

410
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:32,333
I know. Now listen, I'm gonna watch
the TemPad for any variance energy.

411
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,542
- Okay.
- Okay, because we gotta be careful.

412
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,875
If you're wrong,
and there's a good chance you are,

413
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,375
anything we do can create a huge branch.

414
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,375
Oh, Mobius! You make even
the end of the world sound boring.

415
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,750
Listen! Okay, we're not meant to be here.

416
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,458
- Okay?
- Okay.

417
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,667
Anything we do can impact
the course of history.

418
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,125
- Do you get that?
- Yes. Yes.

419
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,500
So we're gonna start
with very small disturbances.

420
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,500
- Very small.
- Can you make bird noises?

421
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,667
Bird noises?

422
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,417
Yeah. Bird noises.
Like some, like, whooshing noises.

423
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,208
Oh.

424
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,333
Loki! Loki!

425
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:09,292
Go!

426
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,375
Be free, my horned-friends, be free!

427
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,018
We are
from the future, right?

428
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,125
What is the TVA?
I mean, it's from the future.

429
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,583
It sounds from the future.
It's pretty future-y.

430
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,417
Right on cue!

431
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,458
Enjoy your last meal while you can!

432
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,625
Nothing matters!

433
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,792
Nothing has any consequence!

434
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,167
Dance while you still can!

435
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,833
Whoo-hoo!

436
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,583
How'd we do?

437
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,792
I don't believe it. Zero variance energy.

438
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,500
No branching in the timeline.

439
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,750
The TVA would never
even know we were here.

440
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,250
If it were me, this is where I would hide.

441
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,708
Doomsdays. The Variant's been
ambushing our soldiers

442
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,792
and hiding out in doomsdays
to cover his tracks.

443
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,875
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

444
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,958
For this theory to hold,
the disasters have to be

445
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:32,958
naturally-occurring,
sudden, no warning, no survivors.

446
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,042
- How many could there be?
- I don't know.

447
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,125
We're gonna find out.

448
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,333
Hey?

449
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,167
Come on, let's take a walk.

450
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:58,542
By the way, at your desk, that magazine?

451
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,958
Yeah. The one on jet skis?

452
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,333
Yes.

453
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,792
Why do you have that?

454
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,292
Because they're awesome.

455
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,167
- I suppose they are.
- Yeah.

456
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,667
You know, some things... Actually,
most things in history are kinda dumb,

457
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,417
and everything gets ruined eventually.

458
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,250
But in the early 1990s,
for a brief, shining moment,

459
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:24,417
there was a beautiful union
of form and function,

460
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,250
which we call the jet ski,

461
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,625
and a reasonable man cannot differ.

462
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,625
You ever been on one?

463
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,208
No... No.

464
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:39,000
I think a TVA agent showing up
on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline,

465
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,042
that would create a branch for sure.

466
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,292
It'd be fun, though.

467
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,875
Yeah, it'd be really fun.

468
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,583
So, why read about them?

469
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:53,000
Just helps remind me
of what we're fighting for.

470
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,792
I mean, you really believe
in all this stuff, don't you?

471
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't get hung up on,
"Believe, not believe."

472
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,208
I just accept what is.

473
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,250
- Three magic lizards...
- Time-Keepers.

474
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,542
- ...created the TVA, and everyone in it...
- Right.

475
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,750
- ...including you?
- Including me.

476
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,875
Every time I start
to admire your intelligence,

477
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:16,583
- you say something like that.
- Okay, who created you, Loki?

478
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,958
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.

479
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,375
And who raised you?

480
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,667
Odin of Asgard.

481
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,000
Odin, God of the Heavens.

482
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,375
Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars.

483
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,958
- Frost Giants. Listen to yourself...
- It's not the same.

484
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:31,362
- It's completely different.
- No.

485
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:33,833
- It's not the same.
- It's exactly the same thing.

486
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,625
Because if you think too hard
about where any of us came from,

487
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,375
who we truly are,
it sounds kinda ridiculous.

488
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,292
Existence is chaos.

489
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,458
Nothing makes any sense,
so we try to make some sense of it.

490
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:48,833
And I'm just lucky that the chaos
I emerged into gave me all this...

491
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,542
My own glorious purpose.

492
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,500
'Cause the TVA is my life.

493
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,708
And it's real because I believe it's real.

494
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,333
Fair enough. You believe it's real.

495
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:03,792
Yeah.

496
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,583
So everything is written.

497
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,833
Past, present, future.

498
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,708
There's no such thing as free will.

499
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:13,250
Well, I mean, you know,
it's an oversimplification...

500
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,833
So, in fact, in a way,

501
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:21,208
you and I here at the TVA,
we're the only ones who are actually free.

502
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,667
Where are you going with this, Loki?

503
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,208
How does it all end?

504
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,875
That's a work in progress.

505
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:31,917
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers.
What are they waiting for?

506
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,208
<i>Au contraire.</i>

507
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,750
No. Because while we protect
what came before,

508
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,417
they're toiling away in their chamber,

509
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,792
untangling the epilogue
from its infinite branches.

510
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,167
Ah, I see. So, when they're finished,
what happens then?

511
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,583
So are we.

512
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,292
No more nexus events.

513
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,417
Just order.

514
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,125
And we meet in peace at the end of time.

515
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,708
Nice, right?

516
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,250
- Only order?
- Mmm-hmm.

517
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,000
No chaos? It sounds boring.

518
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,792
I'm sure it does to you.

519
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,667
You called me a scared little boy.

520
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,208
I called you a lotta things.

521
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:09,458
You did.

522
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,708
You're wrong, though.

523
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,250
You see, I know something children don't.

524
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,625
What's that?

525
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,583
That no one bad is ever truly bad.

526
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,167
And no one good is ever truly good.

527
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:27,833
Scared little boy.

528
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,958
Yes, it was quite patronizing.
I thought it was a bit too far, actually.

529
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,792
You're very clever.

530
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,167
I know.

531
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,833
The Variant left something
behind at an old crime scene.

532
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,875
A cathedral. A candy box.

533
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,250
An obvious anachronism.

534
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,000
I gave it to Analysis,
but they couldn't find anything real.

535
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,667
- Why does that matter?
- 'Cause now we have two variables.

536
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,833
Apocalyptic natural disasters and...

537
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,292
- Kablooie.
- What's that?

538
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,792
Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?

539
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,292
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.

540
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,750
No wonder you're so bitter.

541
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:14,833
Okay. Kablooie was only sold
regionally on Earth from 2047 to 2051.

542
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:18,000
We need to cross-reference
that with every apocalyptic event.

543
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,167
I'm gonna give you half.

544
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,833
Have a competition, see who finds it.

545
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,417
- Sure.
- You wanna bet something?

546
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,875
- Yeah.
- Gentleman's bet.

547
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,958
Yeah, let's play for pride.
Okay. May the best man win. Go.

548
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,000
- Anything?
- Uh...

549
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,458
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.

550
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,667
Or the tsunami of 2051.

551
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,708
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

552
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,208
2050.

553
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,750
The extinction of the swallow...
Is that a thing?

554
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,750
Completely screwed up the ecosystem.

555
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,208
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.

556
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,500
No Kablooie.

557
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,083
God, it's just one damn thing
after another, isn't it?

558
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,333
- Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods...
- Got him.

559
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:58,708
- That's where he is.
- Alabama, 2050.

560
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:02,833
You're gonna take my job
if I'm not careful.

561
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,833
You want me to approve deployment
of a fully-armed task force to...

562
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,958
- Yeah.
- ...the Variant's potential hiding spot?

563
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,833
Haven Hills, Alabama,
corporate town

564
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:14,208
owned by Roxxcart until
it's wiped out by a hurricane.

565
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,792
All the food and supplies you need.

566
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,458
If he likes it, there's no reason

567
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,333
he can't keep going back
and just camping out, over and over.

568
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,625
And this is all based
on a theory from the Variant

569
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,667
- who just blew your previous mission?
- Yeah, he's doing great.

570
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,417
Mobius, as your friend,

571
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,625
I have to tell you that trusting
this man is not a good idea.

572
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,625
No. I know.
But maybe he's worth the trouble.

573
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,667
He just uncovered
a huge hole in our security.

574
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,292
That's what concerns me!

575
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,125
I can handle him. Trust me.

576
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,750
This is where we get our guy.

577
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,417
You, I trust, but him.

578
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Listen, Ravonna,
every instinct is telling me

579
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,417
this is where we nail the Variant.

580
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,333
Come on. You don't see me
usually this worked up, right?

581
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm excited.

582
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,083
I'm chomping at the bit.

583
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,542
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

584
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,833
- But, Mobius?
- Yeah?

585
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,417
There's not much I can do
if it doesn't work out.

586
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,875
For all time.

587
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,417
Always.

588
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,583
Okay.

589
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,833
We're on.

590
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,458
We are doing some good work today.

591
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,667
I thought so too.

592
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,333
I'm tellin' you.
You actually help us catch this Variant,

593
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,958
and who knows, my friend.

594
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,750
What, good enough for a face-to-face
with the Time-Keepers?

595
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,833
I didn't say that.

596
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:37,333
- One step at a time.
- All right. One step at a time.

597
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,583
- Just in case.
- Yeah, don't those feel...

598
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,208
Absolutely not.

599
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,667
Gather around for a briefing.

600
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,750
Roxxcart is a vast superstore
common to the era.

601
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,333
It consists of a series
of sprawling sections,

602
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:55,583
including a large warehouse.

603
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:59,833
This warehouse is being used by civilians
as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm.

604
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,750
Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse.

605
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,833
While the Variant
shouldn't know we're coming,

606
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,833
he could be hiding anywhere
and should be considered hostile.

607
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,417
So stay alert.

608
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,625
Every time there is an attack,
the Variant steals a reset charge.

609
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,125
He's planning something.

610
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,542
We just don't know what.

611
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,000
So keep an eye out
for the missing charges,

612
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,667
and if you see a Loki, prune it.

613
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,167
The bad Loki, preferably.

614
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,792
Anything?

615
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,083
Nothing yet. Move out!

616
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,667
The hell was that?

617
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,625
That was me using magic to dry my clothes.

618
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:31,375
So I don't announce myself with every
squeaky footstep like the rest of you.

619
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,583
Take both teams
and sweep the storm shelter.

620
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,351
- Yes, ma'am.
- Loki and I are gonna

621
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,042
check out the Green House. We'll meet...

622
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,250
- No.
- No?

623
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,167
You go with D-90. He stays with me.

624
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,292
What are you...
He's under my supervision.

625
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,917
This is my field op, Mobius.

626
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,542
- If he's not a threat, then...
- Of course he's a threat.

627
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,185
- Remember the Time Theater?
- Mobius...

628
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,417
- I want him with me.
- You are welcome to go back

629
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,250
to the TVA and litigate
with Renslayer, but right now...

630
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,875
We're here. We're not going back.

631
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,750
- The Variant is here.
- Mobius, it's fine. It's fine.

632
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,833
You can trust me.

633
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:10,000
I understand
I have to earn that, so, I will.

634
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,917
Why is it the people you can't trust
are always saying, "Trust me"?

635
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,833
Okay, try to hang on
to your Time Collar this time.

636
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:22,583
We'll see you in the showroom.

637
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,958
I am glad we're getting
to spend this time together.

638
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:02,042
Quiet.

639
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,925
- I'm saying we got off on the wrong...
- Shh.

640
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,083
Hey!

641
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,958
Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

642
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,458
What are you doing?

643
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,292
Shopping for plants.

644
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,583
In this storm?

645
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,792
It's a hurricane sale.

646
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,667
Azaleas are half off.

647
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,542
Could that be you?

648
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:38,250
I mean, I probably would have
worn a suit, but, yes, maybe.

649
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,625
Is he dead?

650
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,292
No. They usually survive.

651
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:07,667
So, you're the fool
the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

652
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:13,625
Me, I presume.

653
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:18,125
Please. If anyone's anyone, you're me.

654
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,792
How nice to meet you.

655
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,917
<i>For the past hour
we have seen winds intensifying.</i>

656
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,667
<i>Again, if you're just tuning in...</i>

657
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,958
Check the bags
for the reset charges.

658
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,833
You guys FEMA?

659
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:35,958
National Guard?

660
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:37,917
Could be any one of them.

661
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,333
Well, hey, if you got
a 'copter or other transport,

662
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,583
now is the time to use it.

663
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,250
We got women and kids,
and that weather ain't playin'.

664
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,833
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

665
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,750
Well, how the heck did you get here?

666
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,667
What are you doing?

667
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,833
Hey! These people are scared.

668
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,250
They're about to die.
They should be scared.

669
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,625
Okay. Not of us.

670
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,375
- Sir!
- Take it easy.

671
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,875
What is it?

672
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,792
It's real. It's real. It's real.

673
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:15,750
It's real. It's real. It's real.

674
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,333
Enchantment is a clever trick.

675
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,792
Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.

676
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,458
Almost as cowardly as working for the TVA.

677
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,333
I'm working for me.

678
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,417
You really believe that,
don't you?

679
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Yeah.

680
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,958
And here I was worried
that they'd found a better version of me.

681
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,208
Hi, are you guys looking
for the disaster shelter?

682
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,375
No.

683
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, bless.

684
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,958
Are you going to call your little friends
for help?

685
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,250
What's the matter?

686
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,792
You too scared to meet me face-to-face?

687
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:18,875
Show yourself.

688
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,417
You know, gaining their confidence
was no mean feat.

689
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,667
Oh, my God.

690
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,250
You went undercover.

691
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:36,500
If you could possibly sheathe
your smarm for a moment,

692
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,708
I have an offer for you.
That's why I found you.

693
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,125
Go on.

694
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

695
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:50,625
And, uh, cards on the table,

696
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,750
I could use a qualified lieutenant.

697
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,083
And I assume you mean... Me?

698
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,292
What say you...

699
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,042
Loki?

700
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:06,667
Ugh. Don't call me that.

701
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,167
You can call me...

702
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,500
Randy.

703
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,875
God. Now I understand
why Thor found this so annoying.

704
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:18,625
Enough with your games.
I've been trying to help you.

705
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,417
I kept them vulnerable
at the Renaissance Fair for some time.

706
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Oh, gosh,
and that was just so nice of you.

707
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:28,042
But after eight to ten seconds
of consideration,

708
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,583
the answer is no.

709
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,917
I'm not interested in ruling
the Time Variance Authority.

710
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,000
It's real. It's real.

711
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,125
It was real. It was real.

712
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,833
- What's real? What's...
- It's real.

713
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:47,542
- She's off the dial.
- It's real.

714
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,458
- Look at me.
- It's real.

715
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:50,542
I wanna go home.

716
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,583
We're gonna get you there.

717
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,292
Call the TVA, let the infirmary know...

718
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,333
No, no, no. I gave it away.

719
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,583
- I gave it away.
- What did you give away...

720
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,500
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

721
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,083
I gave it away how to find them.

722
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,250
B-15, what is your status?

723
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:14,375
<i>B-15, come in. What's your status?</i>

724
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,333
<i>B-15, do you copy?</i>

725
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,750
If you don't wanna rule the TVA,
then what do you want?

726
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,542
It doesn't matter. You're too late.

727
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,667
I think you'll find
I'm well ahead of schedule.

728
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,500
I found your hiding place like that.

729
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,333
I'd say that makes me
the superior Loki, wouldn't you?

730
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:50,042
I see. That's your plan.

731
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,333
Lure us all here
so you can blow the place up.

732
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,583
I miss Randy.

733
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,083
Thank you for helping me stall for time.

734
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:14,333
You really do love to hear yourself talk.

735
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:17,083
You're the first person
to tell me that.

736
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,500
I would never treat me like this.

737
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,375
Hi.

738
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:37,500
Oh, come on. Stop hiding.

739
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:55,042
Loki, if you had any honor
you'd fight me as yourself.

740
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,500
I have shit to do.

741
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,958
Enough!

742
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,434
- Mobius.
- Where is he?

743
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,167
- I lost him.
- What happened?

744
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,292
I...

745
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,250
Looks like your favorite
Loki betrayed you.

746
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,417
Just move!

747
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,875
What do you want from me?

748
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,250
What is this about?

749
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,625
Brace yourself, Loki.

750
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,625
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

751
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,417
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

752
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,208
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

753
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:05,542
<i>What is this about?</i>

754
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:06,917
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

755
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,083
<i>What is this about?</i>

756
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,458
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

757
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,125
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

758
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,958
<i>What is this about?</i>

759
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:17,292
<i>What is this about?</i>

760
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,250
This isn't about you.

761
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:23,667
Right.

762
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,250
Where they going?

763
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,792
That's not possible.

764
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:15,083
This is Analyst 1182-E,
uh, reporting a code, uh, 000.

765
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,208
Branches rapidly forming at a slope...

766
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,333
Somebody just bombed the Sacred Timeline.

767
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,292
Loki!

768
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,833
Loki, wait!

769
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:14,208
Wait! Loki, wait!

770
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,458
No! Wait, Loki!

771
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:21,958
Damn it!

771
00:48:22,305 --> 00:49:22,310
