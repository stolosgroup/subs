1
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,328
Aah!

2
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:16,132
Our work isn't done, child.

3
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:21,295
It's only just
begun.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,760
Where am I?

5
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:29,272
And what are you?

6
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:34,817
I am the one who pulled you
from the abyss of death.

7
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,421
I chose you for
a special purpose

8
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,692
And to give you
what you desire.

9
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,359
Ah!

10
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:47,029
You're going to make me...

11
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,831
A titan?

12
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,033
Yes.

13
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:54,637
And you will do something
for me.

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,038
Aah!

15
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,241
Where are you taking me?

16
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:02,101
To show you
who I really am.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,917
I am invictus.

18
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,320
And this is my prison.

19
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:15,458
You, my child,
will help me escape.

20
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,593
How?

21
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,262
Find mooncake.

22
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:22,198
Ah. You've gotta be
kidding me.

23
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,867
The more energy I absorb,

24
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,669
The more power I'll have

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,472
To break free
of these chains

26
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:34,077
And consume life
across every dimension.

27
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,679
Agh! Bleh!

28
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,882
One small problem...
Kinda dying here.

29
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,419
I can restore you.

30
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,742
Then do it already!

31
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:49,275
Ah!

32
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,738
I feel so...

33
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:59,902
Good!

34
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:03,455
Find mooncake.

35
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,719
Ah...

36
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,113
Eh!
I'm doing it already.

Which one of you is going to
tell me where mooncake is?

41
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:56,306
How about you, avocato?

42
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,507
Argh.

43
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,109
Ah, that's fun.

44
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:00,577
This is also fun.

45
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:02,779
Aah!

46
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:04,381
Leave my son alone!

47
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:09,319
I can't believe you still give
so much for someone so little.

48
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:10,387
Let him go!

49
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:13,057
Where is mooncake?!

50
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,591
nothing?

51
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:18,328
Then how about a little
small talk to loosen you up?

52
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:22,399
I know!

53
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:26,203
Avocato, why don't you tell
your boy how we first met?

54
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:29,139
He's gonna<i> love</i> that one.

55
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,440
No!
Oh, yes!

56
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,543
You can't tell me anything
I don't already know.

57
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:36,680
Are you sure you know
everything?

58
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:39,549
Because I wouldn't be
so sure,<i> boy.</i>

59
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,952
screw it!

60
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:45,004
Let's make your father tell
us the story.

61
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,226
Ah!

62
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,630
No! No! Ugh, no!

63
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:57,501
On ventrexia,
wars never end.

64
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,103
I hated war.

65
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:00,837
The problem was...

66
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,239
There was no one better
at it than me.

67
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:11,381
<i>Sir, we should fall back.
We're advancing too far.</i>

68
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:13,183
We push forward.

69
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,320
- Look out!
- It's a trap!

70
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:17,854
Ambush!

71
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,990
We were surrounded.

72
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:22,659
And then in a flash,
they were vaporized.

73
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:31,602
And that's when I saw you
for the first time.

74
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:34,204
Bow to me!

75
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:58,162
<i>Approaching mooncake's
location in t-minus 84.</i>

76
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,497
Gary, I'm really worried
about the others.

77
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:01,898
Me too.
But the good news is, look,

78
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,567
We... we know where
mooncake is.

79
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,636
Yeah, but what about
everybody else?

80
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,103
We are totally gonna
find them,

81
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:09,173
Now that we have
this awesome ship!

82
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,308
The dragon hawk 5.

83
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:13,910
God, it just rolls off
the tongue, doesn't it?

84
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:16,337
Still shopping that, huh?
Oh, we're at the check-out.

85
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:18,915
And it's entering
the brown bag right now.

86
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:21,852
look what we have here!

87
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,054
It's our super-deluxe nest.

88
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:28,258
Actually, I think separate
rooms is a better idea.

89
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,727
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Totally.

90
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,729
Did I make things awkward
between us?

91
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,798
Because it feels like
I just did.

92
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,333
what?

93
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,134
No way!

94
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:41,338
No way. I love the idea
of never sleeping,

95
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:45,676
Napping, or canoodling
together<i> ever.</i>

96
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,744
Don't even sweat it.
Don't sweat it!

97
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,013
I did.
I know I did.

98
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:50,547
I'll find a room
down the hall.

99
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:53,566
I'll get a shower in
or something.

100
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:59,289
Oh, it's getting worse.

101
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:03,360
And the person I most want
to tell in the world,

102
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:04,744
I can't.

103
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:10,367
The fortress
of the titan oreskis.

104
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:11,568
- Chookity?
- Yes!

105
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,237
It's time for revenge.

106
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:18,375
This dick bag stole
my first love, jill.

107
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:21,311
And for that,
we<i> murder</i> him.

108
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:22,913
Oreskis, show yourself!

109
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:26,032
I know you know
the sound of my voice.

110
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:30,921
Bolo, I see your
dimensional keys

111
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:34,124
Did the trick of freeing you,
old friend.

112
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,659
Old friend?

113
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,929
You left me to rot
within that prison for eons!

114
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,798
You betrayed your kind.

115
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:44,134
You've been blinded
by invictus.

116
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:45,669
No, old friend.

117
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,938
My eyes are clear.

118
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:51,475
You just failed
to be inspired.

119
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,009
You know why I've come.

120
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,011
Is this about jill?

121
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:57,281
Hell, yeah,
it's about jill.

122
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:59,015
Has she mentioned me?

123
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,420
Maybe she has,
maybe she hasn't.

124
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,221
You die now!

125
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:09,293
And when I'm done,
I will kill invictus.

126
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:11,495
You must be the mooncake.

127
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:12,829
Pok!

128
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:15,099
We've heard so much
about you.

129
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:18,835
You're very,
<i>very</i> special.

130
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,105
Mmmmmm.
Enough!

131
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:23,373
Let the fight begin!

132
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:26,258
Arghhhhhhhh!

133
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:29,846
<i>Gary, we will be at
mooncake's location</i>

134
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,048
<i>In t-minus 63.</i>

135
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,384
<i>And you are almost out
of cold water.</i>

136
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,186
Why did I push, ya know?

137
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,455
I did...
Quinn hates when I push.

138
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,656
I should have flowed.

139
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,858
Oh, if only
you'd flowed, gary.

140
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:43,794
You'd be nestled in her arms
right now in the privacy

141
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:46,262
Of your very own
garden of eden.

142
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:48,599
Scrubby scrubby!
Lemme get in there.

143
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,667
I'm gonna count
to three, kvn.

144
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,269
Three.
Ah! Ah!

145
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,473
I hate myself for this,
but I must admit it.

146
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:58,609
I'm desperate.

147
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:00,477
Shhh, don't talk.

148
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,279
I've longed to nibble
on your oblong body,

149
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:08,418
But an impenetrable barrier
blocks me from you.

150
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:11,037
Unlock your throbbing gates.

151
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:14,024
Ugh! Ah!

152
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,493
Son of a cookie wife!
That hurt!

153
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:18,228
Open! Agh!

154
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:19,496
Open! Aaaah!

155
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,431
Opennnnn!

156
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:22,633
Owwww!

157
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:25,502
Ahhhh!

158
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:28,305
How the hell did you?

159
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,507
I can't break
through to<i> anything!</i>

160
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:42,118
Hey.
Hey.

161
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,855
We'll be at mooncake's
location soon.

162
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,924
You want to talk about
the separate rooms thing?

163
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,660
There's not... there's nothing
to talk about

164
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:51,662
Because I... I love...
I love being in

165
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:54,531
The separate rooms thing.
It's... well, who knew?

166
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:56,066
<i>Interesting.</i>

167
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,868
<i>I was monitoring your
heart rate, gary,</i>

168
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,135
<i>And you are lying.</i>

169
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:00,737
That's a lie!
I love it.

170
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:03,007
No human contact
is <i>awesome</i> incredible.

171
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,141
<i>No.
That's a lie, gary.</i>

172
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,943
Stop monitoring me, h.U.E.

173
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:09,880
<i>Unauthorized life form
detected on board.</i>

174
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,748
Shouldn't you have picked
that up sooner, h.U.E.?

175
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,283
What's the danger level,
h.U.E.?

176
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:14,351
<i>Unknown.</i>

177
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:19,289
That guy?
Oh, come on!

178
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:21,958
You wouldn't shoot
a tiger tiger would you?

179
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,494
I can't hide on this ship
any longer!

180
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:25,762
It's killing me!

181
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,231
Why aren't you two
sleeping together?

182
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:28,699
What are you even
doing here?

183
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,967
I stowed away.

184
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,502
Hahaharawrawwrar!

185
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:34,170
Oh, boy, it's fun,
it's fun!

186
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:36,373
We're having fun.
Is it just you two?

187
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,441
Where's everybody else?

188
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,376
Where's the furry
fantasy dad guy?

189
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,577
Where's he at?

190
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,778
He's probably partying...

191
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:43,113
- No!
- ...And snacking.

192
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:44,981
Snacking?
No way!

193
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:47,784
Yeah.
He's a lucky, partying,

194
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,319
Snacking guy.

195
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:51,588
Ahhhhhh!
Ahhhhhhh!

196
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,390
Stop!
You're hurting my dad!

197
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:58,595
This can all stop when you
tell me where mooncake is.

198
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,996
We don't know
where he is!

199
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
Shame.
I don't believe you.

200
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,736
So let's continue.

201
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,206
Ugh! After the battle,
you summoned me.

202
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,810
I should have been
grateful to you.

203
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:18,415
But instead,
I just hated you more.

204
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,751
Tell me avocato,

205
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,420
Do you have a family?

206
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:26,156
I used to.
A boy.

207
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,492
Is that what
you fight for?

208
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,360
I fight for ventrexia.

209
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:35,565
Tell me, what is so special
about ventrexia?

210
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,571
It sends its people to fight
a thousand-year war for what?!

211
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:41,972
I don't know anymore.

212
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:46,042
So then they have you kill
for no reason?

213
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,244
I kill because I...

214
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:52,716
You kill because
you're good at it.

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,252
You're right.
I know I'm right.

216
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:57,187
And now
I'm gonna give you

217
00:10:57,271 --> 00:11:00,324
The greatest gift
anyone has ever given you.

218
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:04,861
I am gonna change you
from the<i> butcher</i> you are

219
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:06,997
Into a master,

220
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:10,667
By giving you a cause.

221
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:15,071
What if, together,
we could create a universe

222
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:19,476
Where death could
no longer be found?

223
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,011
Does that even exist?

224
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:24,815
With your help, it can.

225
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,551
I've heard the cries
of this galaxy.

226
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:32,222
They yearn for a savior,
and with you as my number two,

227
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:36,360
I will finally
reveal myself to them!

228
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:38,895
There will be those
who'll resist,

229
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:40,764
Which is why I need you.

230
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:45,101
Ventrexians are the fiercest
warriors in the galaxy.

231
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:48,772
And you, avocato,

232
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:51,591
Are the fiercest
of them all.

233
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:55,912
Where do we begin?

234
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,182
Give me ventrexia.

235
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:03,320
I want the bodies
of the king and queen!

236
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:16,600
Mooncake, now!

237
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:18,402
Chookity pok!

238
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:19,737
Ugh!

239
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,059
- Tight.
- Ah!

240
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:31,014
Hoo-wah! Ugh!

241
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,817
How did you become
invictus' lap dog?

242
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,285
Ugh! Ugh!

243
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:38,822
Invictus liberated us
from our bonds.

244
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:42,359
We built<i> all</i> of this
by our backs.

245
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:45,695
We laid dimension
after dimension.

246
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:46,764
For what?

247
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:48,698
So life could thrive.

248
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:51,217
Ugh! Ugh!

249
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,906
The arachnitects were
enslaving us.

250
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,508
Wake up!
Ugh!

251
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:02,045
Why cant you see
what invictus has done for us?

252
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:05,315
All you've done is traded
one master for another.

253
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,586
It seems there is
no convincing you.

254
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,122
Ugggggh! Aah!

255
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:15,659
Then through death
you<i> will</i> join us.

256
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:16,927
Ugh! Ugh!

257
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:18,644
Ughhhhh!

258
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:23,733
<i>I am detecting
massive energy spikes</i>

259
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:25,535
<i>From mooncake's location.</i>

260
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,072
<i>If I had to guess, mooncake
and bolo are fighting a titan.</i>

261
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,608
Did you say a titan?

262
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:33,743
What the hell has gotten
into mooncake's head?!

263
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:39,549
Gary, I haven't told you
everything I've wanted to.

264
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:40,950
Please!

265
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:44,954
I've been so afraid to push,
but I can't take it anymore!

266
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,890
Hey gary!
I got a question.

267
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:49,359
Are you content
with the amount of

268
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:52,562
Non-sexual affection
in your relationship?

269
00:13:52,646 --> 00:13:56,500
Like hugs, hand hugs,
fist bumps, and whatnot?

270
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:57,835
You're not all
up there are you?

271
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,837
Raawwwwwrr!
Right.

272
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,038
We should get ready.
Wait, quinn.

273
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:02,906
Wait, quinn!
Quinn, wait!

274
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,175
Dang it!
Way to go little dude.

275
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:08,160
I was this close to
breaking through to quinn.

276
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:11,515
Don't start with me.
Don't start.

277
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,918
Ugh! Ugh!
You know, avocato,

278
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:18,788
This can all end
before your boy finds out.

279
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:21,791
Ugh!
Just tell me what I want.

280
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,060
Yes?

281
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,063
Aah! Will you quit
spitting in my face?!

282
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:28,798
Avocato did you dirty
there!

283
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:31,601
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

284
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,203
I gave you an out,

285
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:37,074
But now it's time
to finish the story.

286
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:39,543
Aaaaaah!

287
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,148
Are you scared?
Trust.

288
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,750
We're going to make it.

289
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,818
Hurry! Let's go!

290
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:50,620
How can you be sure?

291
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:53,156
Because avocato
fights with us.

292
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:07,037
Look.
There's avocato now.

293
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,648
Dad!
You killed them?

294
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:19,516
It wasn't your fault.

295
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,451
That hose bag
mind freaked you.

296
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:24,188
I know.
But I pulled the trigger.

297
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:25,522
How could you?

298
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:28,258
I'm sorry.
I'll never forgive myself.

299
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:30,660
And you shouldn't either.

300
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:32,195
But I promise you,

301
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,399
I've tried to right that wrong
in ways you'll never understand.

302
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:40,938
You really<i> don't</i> know
where mooncake is, do you?

303
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,788
Argh!

304
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:49,213
What in the bloody hellscape
is this?

305
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:53,216
This...
Is our destination

306
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,755
For your rendezvous
with invictus.

307
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,963
Gary, you know when biskit
brought up sleeping together

308
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:08,098
And it got<i> super</i> awkward?

309
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:09,299
I do remember that vividly,

310
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:12,102
Which is why
biskit must go asapp.

311
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,370
I just want you to know,
it's not that

312
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,238
I don't see a life together.

313
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,441
It's just...

314
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:18,576
What?

315
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,311
What if one of us dies
before that ever happens?

316
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:25,115
Hey, we made it this far,
so I think we're good.

317
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,850
I don't mean us.

318
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:28,452
I mean me.

319
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:30,720
What are you saying?
I don't know.

320
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,322
Maybe I'm just worrying
too much.

321
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:34,458
You worry?
I worry all the time.

322
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:37,394
And I never tell you
because I'm too busy worrying.

323
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:40,530
What I'm saying is that I'm here
for you if you need me.

324
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:42,666
But you must verbally
let me know,

325
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,736
Because I am terrible,
<i>terrible</i> at signals.

Oh, I know.

327

Maybe if you did, like,
a "caw-caaaawww!"

328
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,544
Or, like, the sound
of a butterfly

329
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:56,680
Playing an angelic harp,
ya know?

330
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:58,348
what does that sound like?

331
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,083
Screeee-scroooooh-oooooo!

332
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,752
It's k-kinda like that.
Wow.

333
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:04,154

351

My revenge blinded me.

352
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:10,287
It was the only way I knew
mooncake would leave your side.

353
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:12,422
We want the same thing,
gary.

354
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:14,692
To defeat invictus.
No, we don't!

of final space.

Stay the hell away from us.

some time to cool off, huh?

Don't you quit on me.

You do you,
and we're gonna go find

369
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:44,254
Avocato and the others.
I'll go...

Uh, continue weakening
invictus' army.

371
