00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,068
Gary...

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:06,975
H.U.E.,
ready the medical bay.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,917
I am close.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,833
I want answers!

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,808
Ash!

7
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,624
We need to lightfold now.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,337
Hang on, Quinn!

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,567
Hang on!

10
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:26,638
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

11
00:00:26,723 --> 00:00:27,758
New at this, H.U.E.!

12
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:29,011
What am I doing?
What am I doing!

13
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,681
<i>Place Quinn in the pod, Gary.</i>

14
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,527
<i>That's all we
can do for now.</i>

15
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:33,595
Okay. Alright!

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,863
Oh, dang! Oh. Oh!
Oh!

17
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,999
I'm so sorry.
You trying to kill me?

18
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,001
Not funny, Quinn!
Okay, that... that... that...

19
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:40,818
Okay, that wasn't half bad.

20
00:00:40,903 --> 00:00:42,612
I learned from the best.

21
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:47,279
Quinn...

22
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:49,270
Quinn. Quinn!

23
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,694
H.U.E.,
tell me she's sleeping.

24
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:54,468
<i>Yes, Gary.</i>

25
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,158
<i>Just sleeping.</i>

26
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,976
Ah! Come to KVN.

27
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,594
Oh. Ohh.

28
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:06,082
You Bury this memory.

29
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,410
Bury it deep, and then...

30
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:10,956
Delete it forever.

31
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:13,187
But then I'll have nothing
to rewatch

32
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:15,801
After you die and all your
bones turn to dust. Right?

33
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,786
So you stay pretty
and let me do the thinking.

34
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:20,637
So cute!

35
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:25,943
Gary is hurting.

36
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,517
We may not be able
to stop Quinn from dying.

37
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:29,585
I know.

38
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:31,787
What would Gary's
best friend do?

39
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:32,989
He would get him a rebound.

40
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:34,590
A rebound, you say?

41
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:36,283
I like it.

42
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,593
But who?
You know who.

43
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:38,661
I do know who!

44
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,262
Wait!
Wait a second...

45
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,397
How did
you know I knew who?

46
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:42,398
Because I'm you.

47
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:43,932
Oh, right.
Heh heh heh.

48
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:47,151
Now to get Gary
a second chance at love.

49
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,843
She's baaack!
Beth!

50
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,987
No, kvn!

51
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,189
Avert your eyes.

52
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:56,940
She's Gary's.

53
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,684
Update me, H.U.E.

54
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:03,485
What do we know about this
final space poisoning?

55
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,087
Gary? Over here.

56
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:06,088
Gary?

57
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:07,823
<i>Think of it like
stagnant water...</i>

58
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:10,399
<i>A breeding pool for disease.</i>

59
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:12,494
<i>When final space
was sealed away</i>

60
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,148
<i>From the flow of the universe,</i>

61
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:18,954
<i>Space-time itself stagnated,
poisoning all organic matter.</i>

62
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,905
Alright, then,
what's the cure?

63
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,376
<i>Oh, there isn't a cure.</i>

64
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:29,686
Chookity.
We tried everything!

65
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:31,488
Whoo!
Why is this so hard?

66
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:35,645
If only we had better,
more rectangular woman to love.

67
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,429
Right, Gary?

68
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,517
Will you shut up?!

69
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,052
Who... me... Or Beth?

70
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:47,644
Figure it out, H.U.E.
Please.

71
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:51,499
No, Beth.

72
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,879
Gary is not ignoring you.

73
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:57,649
Has anyone ever told you
you have magnificent eyes?

74
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,500
Well... You do.

I-I wish I knew
what she was going through.

79
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,623
<i>It would not have helped, Gary.</i>

80
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,224
How do you know?

81
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:41,761
<i>Because I did know
what she was going through,</i>

82
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,296
<i>And there was nothing
that I could do about it.</i>

83
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,832
Wait. You knew Quinn was sick,

84
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,168
And you didn't tell me?

85
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,636
<i>It did feel wrong.</i>

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,573
<i>But then for some reason,
I did it anyway.</i>

87
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:58,243
<i>Gary, is that what being
human feels like?</i>

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,518
Hang on, Quinn.

89
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,590
The resistance lives.

90
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:14,726
We win here, quatro,
we liberate the oppressed!

91
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,395
We restore hope!

92
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,929
Sí, papa!

93
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:20,666
Okay, Lewis and Clark...
Attack!

94
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,601
Attack, my beautifuls!

95
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:24,603
God,
I love riding these things.

96
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,215
First death.

97
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,466
And then light refreshments.

98
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,221
Take that!
And this!

99
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:44,223
And that!
And this!

100
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:45,357
Why won't you die?

101
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,026
I'm shooting you repeatedly.

102
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,028
Why are you attacking
the weak?

103
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:53,765
Only the strong survive
in this expanse of space.

104
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:54,900
Double take that!

105
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,768
Oh, heavens,
that's a good answer.

106
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:59,104
Well, I have news.
The resistance is here.

107
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:02,241
And I, tribore,
am its leader, so...

108
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:03,509
Tribore?!

109
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:04,776
Can it be?

110
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,445
We know of you.

111
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,114
We know of your legend.

112
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:10,731
Oh, heavens.

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,186
<i>Excuse me. Sheryl?</i>
Yeah, H.U.E.?

114
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,655
<i>Have you ever tried
your very hardest,</i>

115
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,858
<i>But it's just not good enough?</i>

116
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:22,194
Ugh,
story of my life, mate.

117
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,063
<i>How did you handle it?</i>

118
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:26,131
By going on benders
and peeling my skivvies off

119
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:28,800
For any man who
gave me a second look.

120
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:31,336
You know what I mean,
don't ya?

121
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,605
<i>That is unhelpful and sad.</i>

122
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:36,208
Oh, actually, it was big fun
until it wasn't.

123
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:39,611
The one thing that could've
worked, I was too afraid of.

124
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:41,547
<i>And that one thing was?</i>

125
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,014
Asking for help.

126
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:45,617
<i>I've never asked
for help before.</i>

127
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,419
<i>I don't even think I know how.</i>

128
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:49,889
Uh, you're barking up
the wrong tree for that, doggo.

129
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:52,892
Ask someone
who's actually done it.

130
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,359
<i>Hmm.</i>

131
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:56,896
<i>Ruminating, considering...</i>

132
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,764
Why don't you give
Kevin Van Newton a call?

133
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:00,566
He knows everything.

134
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,439
Wait! What the...
<i>Hello, Kevin.</i>

135
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:09,575
<i>It's H.U.E.</i>
<i>From the</i> galaxy two.

136
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,776
<i>We met before on the...</i>

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,777
It's H.U.E.
From the<i> galaxy two.</i>

138
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,246
What the hell do you want?

139
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,048
<i>I'm calling for... Help.</i>

140
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:19,050
<i>Huh.
That wasn't so bad.</i>

141
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,720
<i>How have you survived this long</i>

142
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:23,122
<i>Without contracting
final space poisoning?</i>

143
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,190
Celenium.
It absorbs everything,

144
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:27,993
Including the nasty stuff
we're breathing here.

145
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:29,528
But don't get too excited.

146
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:32,464
It's one of the rarest elements
in the universe.

147
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:35,200
<i>Hmm.
I think I can work with that.</i>

148
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:37,068
<i>Thank you.</i>

149
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:40,472
<i>I believe we can create
a celenium implant.</i>

150
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:42,474
<i>Throughout the half-life
of the isotope,</i>

151
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:45,744
<i>It would absorb the poison
in Quinn's bloodstream.</i>

152
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,279
<i>Perhaps something like this.</i>

153
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,081
That looks like
nightfall's chip.

154
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,350
<i>Ideally, the chip would be
positioned near</i>

155
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:53,152
<i>The anterior cerebral arteries</i>

156
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:56,422
<i>To prevent further
psychotic episodes.</i>

157
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:59,158
<i>Like that.</i>

158
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:02,561
And Quinn
becomes nightfall.

159
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,896
Full freaking circle.

160
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,231
Or rhombus?

161
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:09,234
Yeah.
It's a full freaking rhombus.

162
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:11,771
<i>Oh.
There is one major problem.</i>

163
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,905
<i>Perhaps
I should've led with this.</i>

164
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:17,242
<i>The celenium is on a comet
that is traveling 91,000 miles</i>

165
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,577
<i>Per hour.</i>

166
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:22,648
<i>Surface temperature...
100 degrees below zero.</i>

167
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:25,116
<i>Brrrrr!
That's chilly, yo.</i>

168
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,987
How do we land on a rock
that's hurling through space

169
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:31,457
At a bazillion gazillion
miles per hour?

170
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,724
Problem solved!

171
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:34,526
We could do
a hook and grab.

172
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,127
Yeah,
done it plenty of times.

173
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:38,730
We harpoon it with a grappling
hook, zip-line over to it,

174
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:40,265
Mooncake blasts us down...

175
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,135
Ah. Okay, so obviously
this is foolproof.

176
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:46,071
Worse plans have succeeded,
and better plans have failed.

177
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:49,941
Besides, it's for Quinn,
Gary.

178
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:53,612
Mom, thank you.

179
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,280
Let's get to it then!

180
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:00,285
Aah!

181
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,292
Aah! Aah!

182
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,843
Aaaahhhh!

183
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:14,140
Invictus!

184
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,300
Where are you?!

185
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:19,438
Darker.
Leave the light.

186
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm waiting there.

187
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:28,447
Return to me and speak.

188
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:29,781
Show yourself!

189
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:32,117
Darker still.

190
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:36,255
Go where
the light is broken.

191
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,589
Where are you?!

192
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:39,525
Ohh!

193
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:42,794
You're close now.

194
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:45,064
So very close.

195
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,331
Gaahhh!

196
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:48,934
Aah!

197
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:52,754
Open your eyes, child.

198
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,408
Invictus.

199
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,616
Okay, how do you know me?

200
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,818
And before you speak,
have you checked your facts?

201
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:10,422
Because quatronostro
is a hard pisces

202
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,373
And he is in a mood.

203
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,964
You are of the prophecy!

204
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:21,366
A legend spoken from
a hallucinating,

205
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,971
Late-stage alcoholic soothsayer,
who said a savior would appear

206
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,440
Who would sprout
into a fire elemental

207
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:30,576
With magnificent wings.

208
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,845
I must compliment you
on your beautiful checked facts.

209
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,447
Please continue to proceed.

210
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,718
The soothsayer has spoken
of you many times.

211
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,986
He wore a long gown.

212
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,256
Not too summery,
not too wintery.

213
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,392
The hemline was not
from this world.

214
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:48,794
Did he mention
where he got it?

215
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:50,529
No.

216
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:51,931
They never do.

217
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:54,531
But he did tell me his name.

218
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:55,735
Tim belts.

219
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:57,869
Tim belts?!
Tim belts?!

220
00:09:57,953 --> 00:09:59,070
But I thought
he was dead.

221
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:00,539
He<i> is</i> dead.

222
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:02,742
He said, "I am very dead,

223
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:05,344
But I have a message
for tribore menendez."

224
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,347
Tell me, checker of checked
facts, what was his message?

225
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:10,950
He said he can only
speak it to you.

226
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:13,352
That's so Tim belts!

227
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,155
We must travel to
the temple of krask.

228
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:21,093
Spirits speak freely there to
the worthy and unworthy alike.

229
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:22,962
Oh, heavens!
Then what are we waiting for?

230
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,363
To the temple of krask!

231
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,048
Al templo de krask!

232
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:32,838
You're home, my child.

233
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:35,106
So this is
what you look like.

234
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,643
The monster hiding
in the darkness.

235
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:43,131
I am the shadow cast
and the light beyond.

236
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:49,454
Your very breath
and the choices you make...

237
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:53,592
Are my gifts.

238
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:56,911
I am in all life.

239
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:03,935
You're a parasite,
infecting everything around you.

240
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,937
You took fox!

241
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,606
Give my brother back!

242
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,543
You will be reunited soon.

243
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:12,944
Now!

244
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:16,948
I am protecting him
from the fool

245
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:20,285
Who died a thousand deaths,

246
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:26,625
Preventing me
from escaping this prison.

247
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,760
The Gary.

248
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:30,229
Gary is good.

249
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:32,097
<i>You're</i> the cosmic psycho.

250
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:35,835
How blind you are.

251
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,507
He is a crusader
who's saved no one.

252
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:42,908
A jackal that will

253
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:47,979
Kill everything
in his path including...

254
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:51,717
Your brother.

255
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,052
I...

256
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:54,653
I don't believe you.

257
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:55,987
Gary wouldn't.

258
00:11:56,071 --> 00:12:00,992
You will see my words live.

259
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:05,997
The Gary
will kill your brother.

260
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:22,081
Well, I've done some entirely
crazy things in my day,

261
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,216
But this is
going in my top 10.

262
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,751
Let 'er rip, H.U.E.

263
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:29,621
<i>Shooting anchor in 3, 2, 1.</i>

264
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,611
Catos, you're good to go.

265
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:40,031
This thing
looks very mean.

266
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,300
It's just a comet, buddy.

267
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:42,167
Oh!

268
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,569
Holy hell!

269
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,571
I-I take it back.

270
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:46,954
Let's lock up!

271
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,509
Incoming!

272
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,719
Keep it quick, boys!

273
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:12,464
The celenium deposit is
a mile below the surface.

274
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,800
Mooncake,
blast us down, buddy.

275
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:15,935
Chookity pok!

276
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,076
Uh, there's cracking?!
Do you see the cracking?

277
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,677
I see it!
Come on!

278
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,346
Where are they, H.U.E.?

279
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,014
<i>They are on the comet.</i>

280
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,816
And Quinn?

281
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,752
<i>Her bio readings
are getting weaker, Gary.</i>

282
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:36,021
<i>There is no assurance
this will succeed.</i>

283
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,556
Just give us some more time,
H.U.E.!

284
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,826
<i>Gary,
time is not mine to give.</i>

285
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,428
<i>It belongs to none of us.</i>

286
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,971
We need to hurry.

287
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:57,777
 Got it.

288
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:09,721
Watch it! Aah!

289
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:18,513
We're trapped.

290
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,067
The temple of krask.

291
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,735
It's kinda ugly.

292
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:27,673
They better have
vending machines.

293
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,810
I'm not even there yet,
and I am already exhausted.

294
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,081
Where is Tim belts?

295
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,549
I seek his spirit.

296
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,085
I want to commune with him.

297
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:41,887
Respect the dead,
heathens.

298
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:45,156
The dead only speak to people
with appointments.

299
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,027
But I could maybe
bend the rules...

300
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,228
For that fabulous cape.

301
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:50,629
No, papa!

302
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,565
If this is what it takes
to get to Tim belts,

303
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,234
Then take it.

304
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:57,036
Pero, papa!

305
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,374
That was fast. Tim?
This is Tim.

306
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,177
Uh, who disturbs
my eternal slumber?

307
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:06,846
It's tribore menendez.

308
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,848
Ah, of course.

309
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:10,916
Hey, uh...
Is your progeny with you?

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,918
Si, Tim belts.

311
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,319
Quatronostro es aquí.

312
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:15,855
Speak this legend.

313
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:19,658
Now, the time has come for you
to liberate the forsaken

314
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:23,328
And lead them
out of final space.

315
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,264
When you say "you"
do you mean me

316
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,998
Or quatronostro?
Yes.

317
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:33,272
For I have foretold,
you are the great liberator.

318
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:35,741
Again.
By "you," do you mean me or

319
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:36,876
Quatronostro?

320
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,144
Yes.

321
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:40,895
Okay!
Bye-bye now!

322
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:47,553
I'm beginning to remember
why we fell out of touch.

323
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,093
Avocato?

324
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:55,895
Little cato?

325
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:03,369
Sheryl!
Oh!

326
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,304
I thought you boys
might be dead.

327
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:07,373
Do you have the stuff?
Got it.

328
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,108
But we need you to come
and pick us up.

329
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:10,710
We won't make it back
the way we came.

330
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:13,579
 On it.
Alright, do it, mooncake.

331
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:15,381
Do that thing you do,
baby!

332
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:17,382
Chookity pok!

333
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,890
Celenium
in the med bay, yo!

334
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:13,038
<i>Celenium... Smelting.</i>

335
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:14,906
<i>Chip... Fabricating.</i>

336
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,508
<i>Drill operative.</i>

337
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:19,178
Hurry, H.U.E.!

338
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:20,712
H.U.E., what's happening?!

339
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:24,984
<i>Her body is too weak
to withstand the fusion.</i>

340
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:26,385
C'mon, H.U.E.

341
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:27,919
There's got to be
something you can do.

342
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,856
<i>This procedure requires
Quinn to be conscious.</i>

343
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,926
<i>Any chemical interference
can jeopardize the fusion.</i>

344
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,995
<i>But there is...</i>

345
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,596
<i>One way.</i>
Anything!

346
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,931
<i>We can fuse her pain receptors
with yours.</i>

347
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:44,203
<i>But, Gary, you will feel all of
the pain that Quinn is feeling.</i>

348
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:46,538
I don't care.
Do it.

349
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,474
<i>Link established.</i>

350
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:50,075
I don't feel... aah!

351
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:00,085
Raise it more.

352
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:02,688
<i>Gary, that is something
I do not recommend.</i>

353
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:07,359
<i>- Cardiac arrest in progress.</i>
- Come on.

354
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:09,028
Come on, buddy.
Come on, Gary!

355
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,963
Aah! Aah!

356
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,766
Ugh! More, H.U.E.

357
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,635
<i>Your troponin levels
are critical.</i>

358
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,237
<i>Any more, and you may...</i>

359
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:20,239
Quinn would do it for me.

360
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,907
Do it!

361
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:27,979
Oh, my god!

362
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:29,248
Gary?

363
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:31,316
Gary!

364
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,385
<i>Celenium implant complete.</i>

365
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:35,521
<i>Blood filtering.</i>

366
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:37,839
<i>Life signs stabilizing.</i>

367
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:42,528
How am I gonna break this
to Beth?

368
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,463
She's gonna be pissed.

369
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,671
You're okay.

370
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:55,274
You look like hell.

371
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,008
So...

372
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,726
Tell me
about your sister.

373
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,081
No.

374
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,815
I know you're lying.

375
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:05,551
Gary would never
kill my brother.

376
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,953
These are my words.

377
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:09,955
They will follow.

378
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,360
And you will watch,
with both eyes open.

379
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:17,162
Both?

380
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:29,441
Become your full self.

381
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:37,249
Something's wrong.

382
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:41,387
You've become you.

383
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,390
No,
no one should have this.

384
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:51,663
Take it back!

385
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:56,984
You have two paths
ahead of you, my child.

386
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:04,143
Stay with the Gary
to your doom.

387
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:10,349
Or join me and burn
this universe to nothingness

388
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:17,289
So that all of us
can begin again.

389
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:27,299
Three days
to choose your path.

390
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:30,436
My power is increasing.

391
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,055
Soon nothing
will hold me back.

392
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:44,115
Ahhhhhhhh.

393
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:53,725
Ash?

394
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,434
I'm back.

394
00:20:56,305 --> 00:21:56,773
