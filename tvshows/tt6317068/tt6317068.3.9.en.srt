1
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:04,454
You've proven to be
quite a letdown.

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:06,577
Ahh!

3
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:10,797
My chorus grows louder
with each new life.

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:13,847
But we're still
missing the key.

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,275
Mooncake!

6
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:19,408
He resides with
the Gary.

7
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:20,974
The Gary?

8
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:24,297
I've killed him
many times.

9
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:25,498
Not this one.

10
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:27,167
He still eludes you.

11
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:31,571
My Patience with you
grows weak.

12
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:32,772
Ahh!

13
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:34,174
Bring him to me.

14
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:37,309
Or meet the fate
of the ones

15
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:40,827
I find useless.

16
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,852
Where are they?

17
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:49,783
I feel the presence
of ash.

18
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:54,185
What we seek
is on earth.

19
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,391
Ehh?

20
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:56,748
Ahh!

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,681
Ohh!

22
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:08,474
Hey,
how you holding up?

23
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,818
Okay, I guess.

24
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:13,239
And ash?

25
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,271
I'm not sure,
but I think there's hope.

26
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:18,775
Hey guys! What are you
talking about?

27
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,110
- Me?
- Ahh!

28
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:22,218
Do you really think
that crackpot Van Newton

29
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:23,356
Can get us
out of here?

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,059
Time to find out!

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,938
H.U.E., take us in.

32
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,805
<i>Coordinates received.</i>

33
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:34,770
Whoa!

34
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:36,590
Take us in.
<i>In.</i>

35
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:39,171
We're going in. In.
In is where we're going!

36
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:42,150
In. Not out.
In. In-wards.

37
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:44,444
In-side.
In-victus.

38
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:46,498
Wait!
Why did I say that?

39
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:48,089
Delete!

40
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:56,541
Wonderful!
<i>Wonderful!</i>

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,395
What the heck was that?

42
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,796
The quakes have been
growing stronger

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,466
For the past
three days!

44
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,734
Is the hyper-transdimensional
bridge up and running?

45
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:09,738
Well, yes...
And no.

46
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:11,203
Hmm. Which is it?

47
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:12,460
You got me, no.

48
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:13,940
Ha!
See, I knew it!

49
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,773
Wait! What...
What do you mean, no?

50
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:18,026
Remember that wrinkle
I told you about?

51
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,225
The summer khaki wrinkle,
or the space-time wrinkle?

52
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:22,245
Both.
My biggest fear.

53
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,848
That's as wrinkly
as it gets.

54
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:26,384
Have you made
<i>any</i> progress?

55
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:28,384
A little, yeah.

56
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,240
Ohh...

57
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:35,790
Slap my thunder nipples!

58
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,264
That's big.

59
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:42,667
Where does that lead
to? That's the problem.

60
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:44,468
Right now, it's not
connected to anything.

61
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,871
Oooh! Genius.
I love it!

62
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:48,338
Well, how do we
get it to work?

63
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:51,496
By connecting it to the doorway
on the other side.

64
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,811
That's just lovely!

65
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,345
Oh boy!
Let me just get this straight.

66
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:59,149
We have to contact someone
outside of final space

67
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,160
And get them to turn this on,
or we're screwed?

68
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:03,697
Newton says...

69
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:05,033
Yes.

70
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,170
Yes,<i> and.</i>

75
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:40,725
Alright, who do we know
that doesn't live on earth

76
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,927
That we can contact
to activate the... the...

77
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:44,328
The hyper-transdimensional
bridge?

78
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:45,596
Yes, that.

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,598
All my friends are dead. Same.

80
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:49,867
Oh!
I got... Uh.

81
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,070
No, yeah.
No, they're all dead.

82
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:52,870
Oh, come on.

83
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:55,205
Well, what about...

84
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,741
Clarence.

85
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,943
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

86
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:02,012
Okay, I would rather
be swallowed by my own colon

87
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:05,549
Than to ask that sulfurous
fart nozzle for help!

88
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,085
Okay, I would. I really would.

89
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,086
He could do it.

90
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,687
And who is he?

91
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,119
He was my dad...

92
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:13,385
At one point.

93
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:15,747
I guess in some weird way,
he still is.

94
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:17,087
He wanted to marry me.

95
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,165
It's a long story,
but he betrayed us and you!

96
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,901
He really is the actual worst.

97
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:26,704
He is
the actual worst.

98
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:29,772
Do any of you have
someone else in mind?

99
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:31,838
Besides...

100
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,309
He deserves to
know about fox.

101
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:35,904
Oh, man.

102
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:38,041
Okay.
Clarence it is.

103
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,711
I only have enough power
to relay<i> one</i> message

104
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:42,714
Out of final space.

105
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:44,714
We have one shot, people.

106
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:48,271
I get it.

107
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,139
Clarence, incoming wide
band unsecured transmission.

108
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:05,357
Well, tell them
I'm not here.

109
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,545
You may want to hear
this message.

110
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:11,015
No one cares about me,
am-me.

111
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,904
And why should they?
Delete it.

112
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,420
<i>Clarence?</i>

113
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:18,395
<i>It's... it's me. Ash.</i>

114
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,667
<i>Ash?</i>

115
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,470
Is it really you?

116
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,737
<i>Yeah.
Listen, um...</i>

117
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,030
<i>I don't know
where you are,</i>

118
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,445
<i>And... frankly,
I don't really care.</i>

119
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:30,969
That hurts,
but it's fair.

120
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:34,236
<i>Before I get to what
I'm calling you for, um...</i>

121
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,635
<i>You should
know that fox is, um...</i>

122
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:38,767
<i>Fox is dead.</i>

123
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,842
Ohh. Oh.

124
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:44,938
<i>Listen, we made it
to final space.</i>

125
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:46,466
<i>Gary found Quinn,</i>

126
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,651
<i>And now we're trying
to come home.</i>

127
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:51,121
<i>That's a strange word
for me nowadays.</i>

128
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:54,658
<i>Look, I'm calling you
because we need your help.</i>

129
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:56,927
Me?
You really need me?

130
00:05:57,011 --> 00:05:58,462
<i>We need you to
activate a bridge</i>

131
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:01,529
<i>Located on a planet
called kalden 1.</i>

132
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,451
<i>I've never asked
anything of you.</i>

133
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:05,120
<i>Ever.</i>

134
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:08,928
<i>So if there is one shred
of a decent person in you,</i>

135
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:12,529
<i>Do this,
for me.</i>

136
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,589
I can do it.

137
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,464
I<i> will</i> do it.

138
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:17,615
<i>And hurry up, yo!</i>

139
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,011
Shut it, primate!

140
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:24,022
Clarence, every person in the
galaxy heard that transmission.

141
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:25,989
Ah, here we go.
Oh, this is it.

142
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:27,392
What are you doing?

143
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:29,285
Going to save
my daughter.

144
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:31,559
Yes!
That's all of them.

145
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:33,179
Oh no, it was
the back pocket.

146
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:34,600
Yes, there it is.
Here!

147
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,003
The place is yours.

148
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,072
You're giving me...
All of it.

149
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:41,167
Everything I own
on 67 worlds,

150
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:44,704
Including my world's greatest
artisanal toffee brand

151
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,385
"Clarence's nuggets".

152
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:47,587
Full disclosure...

153
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,123
They're not
the "world's greatest".

154
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,585
They're
not even nuggets.

155
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:52,521
You're not
coming back?

156
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:55,003
But you built
all of this.

157
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,376
It's just stuff.

158
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:12,336
Kalden 1!

159
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,520
That's not far
from here at all!

160
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,696
<i>Tribore, you better
be on the way.</i>

161
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,563
Sure am.
Just tying up some loose ends.

162
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,943
Ready to do
some liberating?

163
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:30,792
Si, papa.

164
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,093
Oppressed peoples
of the quadrant of...

165
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:39,812
Where the hell are we?
Quatro, where are we?

166
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:41,299
Oh, heavens,
not there.

167
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:43,101
Those people were
too stupid to be saved.

168
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:46,036
Them I liked, they had
excellent slippers,

169
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,362
But they did not
like me.

170
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:48,565
Screw it.

171
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:51,759
Oppressed peoples
of here and there!

172
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,585
Freedom is not a gift.

173
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,310
Freedom is your right!

174
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,322
Consider yourself liberated.

175
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,829
For I, tribore, am
the great liberator!

176
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,744
Mnh-mnh. No, papa.

177
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,399
Oh, heavens.

178
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:18,136
Let's get clarity on this from
the great Tim belts himself.

179
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,270
Everyone,
be ready to bounce!

180
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,620
We'll be back in
a hip thrust.

181
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:26,727
Let's get right to it,
Tim.

182
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,463
Am I the great liberator
or is quatro?

183
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:30,484
And make it snappy.
I've got people waiting.

184
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:35,216
Yes! The time has come to
unbound the chained!

185
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,021
Uh, to raise up the...

186
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:40,034
Oh, shut the hell up
and pick one already!

187
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:44,363
<i>You</i> are the great liberator.

188
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,090
Yes!
Or is it me?

189
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,158
Uhh,<i> yep.</i>

190
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,674
He's absolutely
useless.

191
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,888
Uh-huh!

192
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:54,572
Okay, this is how
it's gonna work.

193
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,903
Mondays, wednesdays
and sundays,

194
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,362
You're
the great liberator.

195
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:01,912
Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Fridays, it's me.

196
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:03,714
Papa!
Quatro!

197
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,449
Yeah!

198
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,186
Uhh, uhh-uhh!

199
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,428
Uhh, muh-huh.

200
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:19,730
<i>Gary, the tremors
are getting worse.</i>

201
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:22,733
Oh, this is bad.
This is fascinatingly bad.

202
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,935
They're coming
from the earth's core.

203
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,005
<i>At this rate, earth
will break apart in...</i>

204
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,208
<i>Calculating, facticulating...</i>

205
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,341
<i>Four hours.</i>

206
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:32,810
What's
causing it?

207
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,478
Nothing I've
ever seen before.

208
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,494
Excuse me, small question.

209
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,221
London.
London. Interesting.

210
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:44,689
How's the shopping?

211
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:46,356
Everyone is dead!

212
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,825
Good!
So, no lines, then.

213
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,293
Be there in a couple
hip thrusts.

214
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:51,696
And by the way,
I'm bringing guests.

215
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,963
Did you say "guests"?

216
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,900
Did I? I did.

217
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:57,501
Putting... gah.
Boy.

218
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:59,503
I'm just gonna say
this out loud...

219
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:03,107
Putting all of our eggs in the
Clarence basket was a bad idea.

220
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:05,375
Why didn't we save
a non-Clarence basket

221
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,568
To put the eggs in,
or half the eggs?

222
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:08,553
He'll do it.

223
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,766
He'll turn on
the bridge.

224
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,183
I know he will.

225
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:22,511
Kalden 1.

226
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:41,204
That must be it.

227
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:52,962
Back away,
Clarence!

228
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:54,244
Todd?

229
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:58,081
I'm going to give you
a choice, Clarence.

230
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:01,598
Either you stop
what you're doing,

231
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,689
Or this becomes
your grave.

232
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,551
O-or perhaps,

233
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:12,944
Can I interest you
in a nugget?

234
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,335
Full disclosure...

235
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,205
They're not
the "world's greatest".

236
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,926
They're not
even nuggets.

237
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:27,158
You're not
going anywhere!

238
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:28,759
Do we know each other?

239
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:29,960
No, we do not!

240
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,029
But I know
Gary goodspeed.

241
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,165
He murdered
my sweet Melanie

242
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,682
And wore her flesh sack
like a poncho.

243
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:41,972
I lost my job
because of that guy, Gary!

244
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,575
I used to be
time swap Sammy.

245
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,427
Now I'm just
spare some change Sammy!

246
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:49,009
Ahh!

247
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:51,478
And you're ours,
Clarence!

248
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,918
Oh, come on!

249
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:58,175
We're gonna cut off your junk
and wear it as a necklace!

250
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,583
Get out of my way!
He's mine!

251
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,783
Here are
the divorce papers!

252
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,730
I'll happily sign them!

253
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:05,129
Yes, you will!

254
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:07,256
With your own blood!

255
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:12,743
Clarence!
Fraskenhauer?

256
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,271
How have you been,
friend?

257
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:15,806
I haven't seen you
in a minute!

258
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,210
Now look, I'm turning
on this bridge!

259
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:22,010
Over my dead body!

260
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:27,885
Ahhh!

261
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,418
Ahh!

262
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:38,563
Oh.

263
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:39,764
Impossible!

264
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:41,830
I'm invincible!

My god!

269
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:57,915
You are a smoking
hot stack of woman.

270
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,051
And what a thick
piece of meat you are.

271
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,252
I'm getting
divorced.

272
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:02,787
Marry me!

273
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,320
You had me at divorced!

274
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,124

I didn't see
that coming.

I lived a life hinged
on stealing and dealing.

290

In that
kind of life...

291

of what you've become.

00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,408
<i>Bridge connection is stable.</i>

329
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,015
Yes!
Yeah!

330
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:52,417
We're going home.

331
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,685
<i>I am detecting massive
energy signatures</i>

332
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,353
<i>Coming towards the bridge.</i>

333
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,222
<i>Gary, you should see this.</i>

334
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:03,608
Oh snap, let's peep it!

335
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:10,701
Reclaim your dignity!
And reclaim your freedom!

336
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:12,169
And as always, remember,

337
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:14,772
You don't have
to floss all of your teeth.

338
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:16,907
Just the ones you want to keep.

339
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,710
Strong freakin' finish,
tribore.

340
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:22,577
Strong freakin' finish,
man.

341
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:29,520
I know I don't always appreciate
all of you as much as I should.

342
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:33,858
But to be fair, you've given me
precious little to work with.

343
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:35,392
Okay, so long.

344
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:36,433
That's it?

345
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:38,347
I was kinda hoping that was
going to end with a compliment.

346
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:39,675
Look to the titan's
wiener.

347
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,999
I'm not... what? No!
I'm not looking to the titan's...

348
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,668
If it points north,
I will be south.

349
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:45,344
If it glitters
in the west...

350
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:48,605
I'm not looking at a glittery
titan's wiener, alright?

351
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:52,543
Quatro, you need to fly
through the bridge, too.

352
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:55,506
And as hard as I know
this is to hear...

353
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:58,468
I will be going with you.

354
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:01,001
Okay, let's go!

355
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,963
Welcome to
my dimension.

356
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:14,165
Priority one?

357
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:16,633
Matching windbreakers
and moccasins.

358
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,813
The rest will take
care of itself.

359
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,395
Huh.

360
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,507
What is a windbreaker?

361
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:25,500
Oh, my sweet child!

362
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:28,117
I have so much
to teach you.

363
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:31,916
Bridge is stable.

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,918
What the hell are
y'all standing around for?

365
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:35,320
Leave! Go!

366
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:37,054
Alright!
Grab what supplies you can.

367
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:39,619
We're leaving in
5 minutes!

368
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:41,544
Ah!

369
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:43,906
Unhh.

370
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:48,605
The kvn net?
What is this?

371
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:49,934
It doesn't matter.
You're leaving.

372
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:51,333
Hurry up!

373
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,007
This is...

374
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:58,475
- This is a weapon, isn't it?
- Yes!

375
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,596
This weapon is why I made
the kvns to begin with!

376
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,014
Originally, the kvns were
designed to protect earth

377
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,751
From attacks of
an extradimensional nature.

378
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,753
Like what?
Oh, donkey birds!

379
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,755
Like what?
Like titans!

380
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,688
This thing is powerful enough
to kill titans!

381
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,228
What the hell
did I just hear?

382
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:19,696
Kevin just said
kvn can kill titans.

383
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,031
I can kill titans?

384
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:22,967
<i>You</i> can't!
<i>That</i> can!

385
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:24,701
It's really too bad,
too, since you're

386
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,371
Getting the hell
out of this place.

387
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:28,505
It was never
quite activated.

388
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:31,506
Would've been nice to rid
the universe of those monsters.

389
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:36,781
Right!
Everyone on the ship!

390
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,278
Wait.
We can't go.

391
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:40,255
What are you talking about?

392
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,053
We can take out the titans
once and for all,

393
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,856
And that just might be
enough to cripple invictus.

394
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,392
We'll never have
this chance again.

395
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,060
The bridge is open!
We can leave right now!

396
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:52,576
We can escape
final space.

397
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,131
Home is
right there.

398
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:56,320
Gary's got a point.
We came here to get you.

399
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,189
That's done. Now let's go.

400
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,123
And then what?

401
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:02,139
What happens when invictus
breaks free

402
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:04,344
With this
army of titans?

403
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,814
How many people
will die?

404
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:08,547
This isn't over.

405
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:11,197
Not until all of us
are dead

406
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:13,367
Or all of them are.

407
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,871
Where you go...

408
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,179
I go.

409
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:44,778
Always.

410
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:48,897
Oh, come on!

411
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,185
You're staying and taking out
the titans now?

412
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,634
Every last one of them.

413
