2
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:33,016
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

3
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:39,362
You're no titan,
and you never will be!

4
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:42,635
Mm! Mmm.

5
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:47,071
No! Get out of here, now!

6
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:49,473
Bolo!

7
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:50,627
Aaah!

8
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:01,018
And just like that,
bolo falls.

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,592
I thought you'd give
more of a fight.

10
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,217
bolo.

11
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:09,427
Peace out.

12
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,710
Bolo.

13
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:32,715
He killed bolo!

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,618
This... this can't
be happening!

15
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:36,553
Believe it.
It's happening.

16
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:37,978
We need to go, go, go, go!

17
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:39,183
He killed bolo!

18
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:41,280
Mom!
On it.

19
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:42,374
Ah!

20
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:43,790
But the kvn net!

21
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,149
Quinn, it's gone.

22
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:46,437
Get us out of here, now!

23
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,413
here we go.

24
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,245
There is no escaping.

25
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:13,074
You end here!

26
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,154
No.

27
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:19,447
Lightfold.

28
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:21,901
Ahh!

29
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,826
Lord commander.

30
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:39,799
you were supposed
to bring me mooncake!

31
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:42,669
sorry to inform you,

32
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,625
But there's
been a change in plans.

33
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:49,222
You defied me.

34
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:52,226
You swore to
make me a titan!

35
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:55,682
Now you've kept your word.

36
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:59,018
This is not
a promise kept.

37
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:04,162
This is
a rebellion started.

38
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:11,534
Let me remind you
who I am.

39
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:15,317
Well, get on with it!

40
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,605

42
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:46,733
I know what you're
all feeling right now

43
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:50,203
Because I'm feeling it, too.

44
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,894
So I'll just say it.

45
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,325
Bolo's dead.

46
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,543
Chookity pok.

47
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,688
He was
a really good dude.

48
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:00,568
Yeah.

49
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:03,031
He was.

50
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,883
And he will be missed.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,358
Don't forget, the lord commander
is now a titan.

52
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,026
I nearly did.

53
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,622
What a relief that I remember
that nugget of information.

54
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:17,364
Thank you.

55
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,509
The hyper-transdimensional
bridge is also lost

56
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,978
Somewhere in space.

57
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,246
That's also a big one.

58
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,206
And the kvn net's
destroyed.

59
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:29,283
And invictus is still out there
and getting more powerful.

60
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,904
I can feel it.

61
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:33,712
I get it, we're screwed!
We're totally screwed!

62
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:36,115
We're unbelievably screwed!

63
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,553
And yet...

64
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:41,010
And yet what?

65
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,057
I'm not sure. I was hoping if
I started the sentence,

66
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,261
Somebody would finish it off
in a really smart way.

67
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:49,598
I got nothing.
Anybody else?

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,865
No? Okay.
Yeah, we got nothing.

69
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,066
H.U.E., please.

70
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,069
<i>I got nothing, Gary.
Sorry.</i>

71
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,336
So that's everything.

72
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,005
Then what
are we gonna do?

73
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,140
Yeah, what
do we do, Quinn, hmm?

74
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:03,210
Uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

75
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:05,879
The only reason we're still here
in final space

76
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:07,863
Is because of you.

77
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,351
Look, we can't fall apart
now, alright?

78
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,153
Let's get started with repairs
on the ship

79
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:18,091
And get the dragon hawk 5
back to 100%.

80
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:19,893
Sound good, team squad?

81
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,694
You heard the man.
Get to it.

82
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:23,963
Avocato, get over here
and plug these holes.

83
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,032
Little cato, I need you over
here. Fix this!

84
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,901
you see this? Fix it.

85
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,369
Ash, you terrify me.
You stay put and do nothing.

86
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,305
okay.

87
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,107
Sheryl, get over here
and compliment me.

88
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,175
Nope.

89
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:38,207
I expect this all done
in 20 minutes, people.

90
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,558
Chop, chop!

91
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,992
And this one, and this one!

92
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:55,862
Oh, boy.
All of these have got to go!

93
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:57,730
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

94
00:05:57,814 --> 00:06:00,600
You can't just rip
energy transfer piping out.

95
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:02,469
Oh, yeah, I can!

96
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,137
Oh, it's just a cluster.

97
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,273
Oh, a nest. Oh, wow!

98
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:09,346
Oh, you
really are insane.

99
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,819
Hey, ash.

100
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:30,343
You good?

101
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,910
Ash?

102
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,169
You know, this is
the first thing you've said

103
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,570
To me in a while.

104
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:40,573
Well, I'm not much
of a socializer.

105
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:42,509
But I can always tell

106
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:45,512
When someone
has something on their mind.

107
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,447
So?

108
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:48,915
So what?

109
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,784
What's
on your mind?

110
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:55,671
Have you ever felt torn
between two worlds?

111
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,393
I have, actually.

112
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:02,595
What side did you choose?

113
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:06,114
Looking back on it,
the wrong one.

114
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,044
I don't know if I belong
here anymore.

115
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:13,844
You do.

116
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,520
And what if this
is the wrong side?

117
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,884
Ash, I'm worried
about you.

118
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:27,620
You sure you're okay?

119
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:29,571
Never better.

120
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:37,041
That doesn't look right.

121
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:39,720
Invictus found us.

122
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,907
Red alert!
We've got company!

123
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:51,578
I am close, my child.

124
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,453
What is it?

125
00:08:00,537 --> 00:08:01,988
It's another swarm
of you.

126
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,657
<i>We now have
multiple hull breaches.</i>

127
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:07,060
<i>I would strongly advi...</i>

128
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,128
Oh, crap,
they killed the power.

129
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:12,065
H.U.E.'s offline.
They're sabotaging the ship.

130
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,532
We got to wipe them
out fast.

131
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:16,403
Wow, this just keeps
getting better and better.

132
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:17,737
Okay, break up
in groups.

133
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,658
I'm with avocato.
Let's go.

134
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:20,607
great.

135
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,075
We'll get them
off the hull.

136
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,476
Alright, okay.

137
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,744
You're with me, son.

138
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,613
Oh-ho, sick.
I know it's sick!

139
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:28,347
I'm gonna be
on team biskit!

140
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,816
A solo special-op squad

141
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,685
Populated exclusively
by this guy!

142
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,222
Because when I hunt,
I hunt alone.

143
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,156
Team biskit is also
a lifestyle brand

144
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,692
With t-shirts available
at the gift shop.

145
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:41,561
Waaaaoow!

146
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:44,097
Wait, guys, where...
Where's ash?

147
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:46,633
I was just with her.
I'll go back for her.

148
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:47,767
All right,
let's make this quick.

149
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,168
Search and destroy.

150
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:51,704
And then...

151
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,355
Destroy some more.

152
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,258
nice job.

153
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,460
Oof!
What the hell?!

154
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:14,994
You've been
at me all day.

155
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,330
You got a problem?
Say it to my face.

156
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:20,133
Yeah, you know what?
I<i> do</i> have a problem with you.

157
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:24,071
I'm gonna die here with my son,
and it's all your fault!

158
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:26,539
You could have left.
You didn't.

159
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:27,941
That's on you.

160
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,625
Ugh.

161
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,418
You always have to
play the Messiah, don't you?

162
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:40,687
What the hell?

163
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:43,556
"I'll patch the breach!
I'll save the world!

164
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,158
We have
to kill the titans!"

165
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:47,026
And the alternative
is what?

166
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,695
Living!

167
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:05,845
We got it.

168
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,447
Got what?

169
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,717
Final space poisoning.

170
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,720
You and little cato?

171
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:16,589
No, Quinn. All of us.

172
00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:17,857
Gary, too.

173
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,330
I didn't know.

174
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,131
Now you do.

175
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,009
You know what?
It's, uh...

176
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,611
It's been a minute
since we've had a one-on-one.

177
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:40,079
Yeah, it has.

178
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:41,948
How you holding up,
spider cat?

179
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,417
I've been better.

180
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,802
Let me see it.

181
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,623
It's still early.

182
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:51,824
And what about you?

183
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:53,626
Hey, don't
worry about me.

184
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:57,230
What is that?

185
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:59,098
All right,
I'm gonna flash my flashlight

186
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,233
Down the hallway.

187
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,701
It's gonna
light it up, right?

188
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,236
And we're gonna...
And we're gonna see.

189
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,239
We're gonna see
what's down there.

190
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:06,505
Wait.
Gah! What?

191
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,107
What if something bad's
down there?

192
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,642
Well, then, we kill it.

193
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:11,178
oh. Yeah.

194
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,913
Diggin' the math.
Nice and simple.

195
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:16,165
Okay.

196
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,988
Oh, that's where
the gift shop is.

197
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,790
oh, hey, ready?

198
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,340
Ready.

199
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:35,451
Whoa, snap! Fire!

200
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,009
Oh, crap! Run!

201
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,868
Ash?

202
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:59,693
Oh, poor girl.

203
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:01,427
Come home.

204
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,897
Ash?

205
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:09,369
No! Ugh!

206
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:11,104
Think of it, ash.

207
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,573
A world without death.

208
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,108
Ash, help... help me!

209
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,244
Where you and fox
can be together again.

210
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,647
Aaah!

211
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:27,587
Let them all die, my child,
so all of us can live.

212
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:28,855
Gah!

213
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:30,390
Yes.

214
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,058
Ash!

215
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:39,465
No!

216
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,267
Ash!

217
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,602
Come on!

218
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:52,361
Gary.
Quinn!

219
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:55,415
No.

220
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:58,418
Yeah, that,
um, just showed up.

221
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:00,402
I've doomed us all,
Gary.

222
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:04,940
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

223
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,898
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:13,767
Don't be.

225
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:16,302
We should get to the engine room
and get the power back on.

226
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,053
Let's go.

227
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,708
Gary, they're tampering
with the engine.

228
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,778
They're trying to leave us
dead in the water.

229
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:26,913
What's the plan?
Guns blazin'.

230
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:28,514
Fat and thick, baby.

231
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,166
My kind of plan.
Let's do this, buddy.

232
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,392
Aaah!

233
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:42,396
Oh! Oh!
Gugh... oh, come on!

234
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,468
<i>H.U.E. Is back online.</i>

235
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,404
H.U.E., locate
the rest of the Garys.

236
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:51,938
<i>Locating.</i>

237
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,539
<i>They're on the bridge.</i>

238
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:54,540
Aah!

239
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:57,226
This just keeps
getting better!

240
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,908
No!

241
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,401
Chookity pok!

242
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,206
Chookity pok!

243
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,128
Normally, team biskit is
an individual slice

244
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:49,663
Of fighting excellence,

245
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:52,932
But I like you,
so I'm gonna make an exception.

246
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,651
Eat cookies!

247
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,622
I live for this!

248
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,815
Come on and get 'em!
I've got plenty more!

249
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,884
Mrrroooowwr!

250
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:12,752
Spool the engines,
h.U.E.

251
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:14,688
H.U.E.<i> Got it.</i>
<i>Spooling now.</i>

252
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:15,755
Aaah!

253
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:19,959
Cheers.

254
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:21,161
Get us
the hell out of here.

255
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:24,012
Yep, with pleasure.

256
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:30,636
Ash, kill it.

257
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,637
I can't.

258
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,707
That's invictus.
Kill it.

259
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,175
Wait, ash.

260
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,110
Can you pull the invictus
out of him?

261
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:38,512
Why?
Yeah, why?

262
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,915
He might know something.
A clue.

263
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,250
A clue?
Yeah, a clue.

264
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,651
A clue to what?

265
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:48,788
Everything.
An all-in-one everything clue.

266
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:49,989
Those exist?

267
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,525
Oh, they're rare,
but, oh, yeah.

268
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:54,594
I mean, if we can get
an everything clue, yass!

269
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:58,865
All right, ash, can you
blast invictus out of the Gary?

270
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,014
Aah!

271
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:16,682
Oh, snap, it worked!

272
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:18,818
Who are you?

273
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:19,953
Ugh.

274
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:22,137
Gary.

275
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:24,958
Goodspeed.

276
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,560
How did you get here?

277
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,764
I closed the breech.

278
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:35,501
And then, I found myself
drowning in an ocean of space.

279
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:38,821
okay.
I died.

280
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,842
And the other Garys?

281
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:45,044
the same!

282
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:48,514
Every timeline flows
into final space.

283
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:53,920
Every one of us
sacrificed our lives.

284
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:55,637
Except me.

285
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:01,261
Quinn.

286
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:03,997
I've...

287
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:06,332
I've been
trapped here...

288
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,202
For so long.

289
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:12,071
And you never...

290
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,256
Came for me.

291
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,817
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,686
But...

293
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:32,292
But you're here now.

294
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:34,910
You didn't give up on me.

295
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,966
And I never will.

296
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,766
He's dead.

297
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:01,855
Did anyone tape that?

298
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:04,057
Because I could play that over
and over and over

299
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:05,874
And over and over.

300
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:13,800
It's strange knowing that
in every timeline...

301
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,402
I gave my life.

302
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:20,006
Every timeline
except my own.

303
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,478
Gary, they only stopped
the titans temporarily.

304
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,329
You're the one who's gonna
finish invictus off.

305
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,685
Hell, yeah!
I just got chills.

306
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:34,970
Uh, hey, guys.
You're gonna want to see this.

307
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,958
Holy...

308
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,227
H.U.E., what are those?

309
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,713
<i>They appear to be
multiple earths, Gary.</i>

310
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,973
H.U.E.<i> Fascinating.</i>

311
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,576
<i>With every Gary that
closed the breech,</i>

312
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,181
<i>There was an earth that got
pulled into final space.</i>

313
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,719
Wait, does that mean inside
every one of those

314
00:19:05,803 --> 00:19:08,321
Is a titan
ready to hatch?

315
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:11,791
Ooh.
Chookity pok.

316
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,194
So, that's why
they wanted earth.

317
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,863
To build an army.

318
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,933
H.U.E.<i> That would be</i>
<i>a terrifying thought.</i>

319
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:34,748
H.U.E.,
change of plans.

320
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,883
Scan for the
hyper-transdimensional bridge.

321
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,552
What?
We're getting out of here.

322
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,820
What about the titans
and invictus?

323
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,488
That plan failed.

324
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:44,023
From now on,
everything is about

325
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,960
Keeping us alive
and together.

326
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:49,763
Yeah, got to say,
I like that plan.

327
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,297
It's an excellent
plan.

328
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,817
I am seeing nothing wrong
with that plan.

329
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:58,504
Ash, what do you say?

330
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,039
Honestly,
it's the opposite

331
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:01,575
Of what nightfall
would do.

332
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,099
She never would have run
from a fight.

333
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:09,515
I disagree. I mean, who
would know better than Quinn?

334
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,066
Yeah.

335
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,589
H.U.E.

336
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,393
<i>Calculating multiple
locations for the bridge.</i>

337
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:23,129
<i>But there's no guarantee
it's still functioning.</i>

338
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:33,188
Ah!

339
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,829
Ahh.

340
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:46,852
Ah.

341
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:49,202
Invictus!

342
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:56,303
Now, to remind you
of who I am!

342
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:57,566
