00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,079
Funeral time, everyone!
Let's make this special.

3
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:24,921
Fox doesn't die everyday,
you know!

4
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:26,990
I promised I wouldn't break.

5
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:28,191
I'm not breaking.

6
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:32,465
oh, god, he's dead!

7
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:35,207
So, are we doing this
or what?

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,611
Ash?

9
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:38,910
You want me to say something

10
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:41,926
To make you all feel better
about what Gary did?

11
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,785
I don't think so.

12
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,463
Who is this even for?

13
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,132
All of us.

14
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,235
<i>Crew means family, ash.</i>

15
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:52,455
<i>We loved him, too.</i>

16
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,390
What do you know
about love, h.U.E.?

17
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:56,406
You're a freaking robot.

18
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,331
What's there to say?

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,781
None of you
knew my brother.

20
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:03,512
And then you killed him.

21
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:07,482
I I was trying to save
your life, and... and...

22
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:08,859
Yeah?

23
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:11,357
Well, instead you ruined it.

24
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,071
Ash, wait.

25
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:23,993
Where are you going?

26
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:25,729

Everybody now!

37
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:23,748
Shouldn't we
wait for Ash?

38
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,458
I've been around
a funeral or two.

39
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,460
I don't think
she's coming back.

40
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,864
She'll be back,
I know it.

41
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:33,067
But we need
to finish this.

42
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,111
We'll give fox a send off
she'll be proud of.

43
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:39,319
<i>Gary? Quinn?
Oh, this a bad time?</i>

44
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:40,419
- Actually...
<i>- Great!</i>

45
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:42,058
Because I have news!
It'll be quick.

46
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,969
No, no, no, no, no.

47
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,305
It's<i> not</i>
going to be quick.

48
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,908
Can you get to it
already?!

49
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,252
I am!

50
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,525
Get ready to...

51
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:50,934
Get ready to what?

52
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:53,069
<i>Uh, his bloody audio
cut out!</i>

53
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,139
Hello!
We can't hear you!

54
00:02:55,223 --> 00:02:57,364
<i>That's some pretty
fantastic news, eh?</i>

55
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:58,966
We missed the news!
Say it!

56
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,256
<i>I can't hear you! Uh.</i>

57
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,987
<i>Uh. There we go!
Hear you now.</i>

58
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,015
<i>Come to earth as fast
as you can!</i>

59
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,698
<i>We're leaving
Final space!</i>

60
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:08,367
You got the
hyper-transdimensional bridge

61
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:09,837
- To work?
<i>- Yes! Kind of!</i>

62
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,308
<i>Almost.
It's close.</i>

63
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,088
<i>It's...
It's kinda almost close.</i>

64
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:14,891
We've got to
tell tribore.

65
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,384
We can't leave him here!

66
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:18,454
<i>I'll conference him in.</i>

67
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:19,656
Who is that?

68
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,993
Earth's greatest
visionary!

69
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,394
Well I have a vision
for him.

70
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:25,063
It's called a haircut.

71
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,934
Tribore,
meet us on earth.

72
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,443
We're going home.

73
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:31,392
Tribore?
Where did you just go?

74
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,342
<i>Nowhere.
I just changed my background.</i>

75
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:36,016
<i>- What do you think, quatro?
- Me encanta.</i>

76
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,104
<i>We'll be there.

77
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:39,761
<i>Okay, hugs and kisses.</i>

78
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,547
Okay.

79
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,788

What the...

83
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:21,630
Okay, what the hell?

84
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:26,723
Okay, what do you want?
Wow. What do<i> I</i> want?

85
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,926
I never<i> ever</i>
thought about that!

86
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,160
I guess I want...

87
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:32,034
To mess stuff up!

88
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:36,174
You mean
like destroy stuff?

89
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:40,264
Yeah! Let's absolutely
totally destroy something!

90
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:43,913
anything in particular?

91
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:46,562
Whatever we see first
we blow it up!

92
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:49,458
Huh. That actually
sounds awesome.

93
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:56,130
Hey, look at
that stupid moon.

94
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,861
Let's bust it up!

95
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:00,268
Come on,
let's do this!

96
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,676
Wait! Stop! Stop!
What?

97
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,487
I just kinda like it.

98
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:16,466
It kinda looks like a snowflake,
ya know?

99
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,466
Like a dead,
twisted snowflake.

100
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,555
Yeah...
I see that.

101
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,844
Let's leave it, okay?

102
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:24,574
- Yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

103
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,405
Hey, where are you going?

104
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:34,164
Hey, have you ever seen
the hidden lights?

105
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:35,899
- No.
- You wanna?

106
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,627
It's gonna be cool.

107
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:40,762
Come on don't you trust me?
Trust me! Come on!

108
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:42,395
I'm fun! I'm adventurous.
Come on!

109
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,731
I would never lead you astray.
Let's go!

110
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:45,530
We can keep messing stuff up,
right?

111
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:46,932
Uh, are you crazy?!

112
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,340
Always! Let's go!

113
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,159
Alright, then.

114
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,486
One, two...

115
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,718
Wow, so that's it?

116
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,500
We're just gonna heave him
into space?

117
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:18,918
Okay, uh,
then before we do,

118
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:20,189
I...

119
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:22,208
I just want to say...

120
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,957
Fox, I admit it.

121
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,374
I... I used to dip my paws
into your mouth

122
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,763
When you were sleeping so
you'd wake up with hair balls.

123
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:34,767
Why not, right?

124
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:37,802
Ventrexians hate tryvulians.

125
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,775
Except, um...

126
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:42,888
Why?

127
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:45,101
For the short time I knew you,

128
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:50,243
You showed me hating for
no reason is just stupid.

129
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:54,574
So, I don't want
to say goodbye.

130
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,362
I want to say...

131
00:06:56,597 --> 00:07:01,129
Thank you for teaching me
curse words in tryvulian.

132
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,989
They are truly disgusting.

133
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:06,790
Uh,
thank you for saving my life,

134
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:10,762
And most of all,
thank you for teaching me

135
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,690
You can be
a great warrior...

136
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:15,004
Without being a killer.

137
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,886
Goodbye, fox.

138
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,982
We all just got a little
smaller without you.

139
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,171
Look!
There's my secret spot.

140
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:56,521
Come on.

141
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:07,641
Close your eyes.

142
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,218
Turn that way.

143
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:11,664
Now open them.

144
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:14,140
Whoa.

145
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:15,821
I call them
the hidden lights.

146
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:18,766
They say it was the last thing
the star lighters lit up.

147
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:20,704
The star lighters?

148
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,841
Yeah.
Every star.

149
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:24,526
Every light they lit up.

150
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,938
It's pretty cool, huh?

151
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:33,543
Yeah.

152
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:35,254
Wanna destroy it?

153
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:36,546
W-What?! No!

154
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,438
I got ya good!

155
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:43,868
Uh, do you have a name?

156
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:45,151
Ash.

157
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:46,534
Do you?

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,760
Nope.
Seriously.

159
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,816
I just found out
about those.

160
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,697
- Really?
- Yeah, no one ever gave me one.

161
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,894
So give yourself one.

162
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:57,402
Okay.

163
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,417
Uh?
How about...

164
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:00,485
Ash?

165
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:01,754
That's my name.

166
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,690
Riiiiggghht.

167
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,365
Right. Right.
Yeah, yeah, okay.

168
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,882
How about Evra?

169
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,779
I like it.

170
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:12,197
Oh! You do?
Okay, cool!

171
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:14,080
Yeah.

172
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:16,487
Hello, Evra.

173
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:17,831
Why, hello.

174
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:19,455
I'm... Evra.

175
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,883
Oh, my god!
Say hello again!

176
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,074
Say hello again!

177
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:24,943
Hello, Evra.

178
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:26,079
Hello, Ash!

179
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,348
I'm Evra!

180
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:45,516
- Hey.
- Yeah, what's up?

181
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,448
Gary could use a friend
right about now.

182
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,118
He does!
He has me!

183
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:51,788
Not you, kvn!

184
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:53,344
You.

185
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:58,795
Alright, but, uh,
I don't think I've ever had

186
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,686
One of these things where
I didn't make things worse.

187
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,724
Yo. Uh, hey, buddy.

188
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,993
What's up?

189
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,064
Quinn, uh...
Uh, she thought

190
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:13,544
You could, uh,
use a friend.

191
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:14,811
She would be wrong.

192
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:16,214
Look, you did
the right thing.

193
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:17,884
You got to stop
beating yourself up, man.

194
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:20,620
It's the only thing I'm good at.
I just can't.

195
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,754
I can't stop replaying

196
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:25,964
That moment in my head.

197
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:28,690
I know the feeling.

198
00:10:28,774 --> 00:10:32,272
You killed someone that
you and everyone loves?

199
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,744
Just saying...
I'd trade yours for mine.

200
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:37,613
- Any day.
- No way.

201
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:38,969
I'm telling you, man.

202
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,052
y-you're not listening.

203
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:43,149
- Seriously?
- You don't want to know.

204
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,152
Yeah. I do.

205
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:48,106
Please just
tell me<i> something,</i>

206
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,990
So I don't feel the way
I feel right now.

207
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,013
I, uh...

208
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,487
I...

209
00:10:56,682 --> 00:10:59,489
I killed the king and
the queen of ventrexia.

210
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,784
But that's not even
the worst of it.

211
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,581
They had a...

212
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:07,008
They had a, uh...

213
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,318
They had a, uh, child.

214
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,576
A son.

215
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,183
So I took him in.

216
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,872
To try and make up
for killing his parents.

217
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,340
To give him
the love he'd...

218
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:20,081
H-he'd never get unless
I raised him as my own.

219
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:22,273
- You're not...
- Yeah.

220
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:23,680
Little cato?

221
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:26,279
I'm not.
That's right.

222
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:28,485
I'm not little cato's
real father.

223
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,954
What the hell are you even
saying to me right now?!

224
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:35,344
You... Killed
little cato's parents?

225
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,479
Yeah.

226
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,508
You killed his parents!

227
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:41,049
No. No.
No, no, no.

228
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,566
Gary, listen... please,
tell me this is a joke.

229
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,143
Please tell me
this is a joke! Please!

230
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,988
It was war. I had...

231
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,829
Listen to me, Gary!

232
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:55,500
What can you possibly say
that can make this any better?!

233
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:58,048
There isn't! Just listen!
I just...

234
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,718
You're a coward.

235
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,944
Don't call me that!

236
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:04,708
What?
"coward" gets you worked up?

237
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,225
Go walk in there

238
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:10,470
And tell the boy that
you killed his parents!

239
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:15,075
That you aren't even
his real dad!

240
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:16,708
I...

241
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:18,249
That's what I thought.

242
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:20,393
You're a coward.

243
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:23,067
And<i> you</i> murdered fox!

244
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,489
It wasn't me!
Invictus did it!

245
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,289
Get up! Get up!

246
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,162
Dah! Alright!

247
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:45,562
Time-out!
Ahhh!

248
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:47,844
Ah! Ah! Time-out!

249
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:50,468
Okay! Time-out.

250
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,310
Alright! Time in!

251
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,645
How do they
make you feel?

252
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:04,581
So... Small.

253
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,419
In a... Good way?

254
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:08,188
In a<i> great</i> way.
Like...

255
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:11,360
How can what I'm going through
be the end of the world

256
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:13,350
When all of that's
going on?

257
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:16,393
I know! It's like,
"hey, you do your thing,

258
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,995
But I'm going to keep
being ridiculously beautiful

259
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,331
No matter what, okay?"

260
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:23,338
Yeah.

261
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:29,865
This m-might be too personal
a question, but, um...

262
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:31,874
Just ask.

263
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,389
Are you uncomfortable
with me?

264
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:36,863
What? No. Why?

265
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,615
Because you keep
changing shapes.

266
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,253
So I-I just thought maybe
you're nervous or something.

267
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,575
Ahhh!

268
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm trying to find
a shape that you'll like.

269
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:49,692
Oh. That's, uh...
That's nice.

270
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:51,813
Anything come to mind?

271
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:54,231
Um, yeah.

272
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,053
Can you...

273
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:27,864
Whoa.
What was that?

274
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:30,605
My brother. Fox.

275
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:35,893
Is he okay?

276
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,416
Yeah. He is now.

277
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:50,955
Pok. Pok.

278
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:54,865
I should get back
to my ship.

279
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,049
Will I see you again?

280
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,958
Not sure! Evra doesn't
do times and places.

281
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,361
But ya never know!

282
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:05,009
Yeah.
You never know.

283
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,320
Thanks, Evra.

284
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:16,012
Bye!

285
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,718
- You give up?!
- No.

286
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:23,914
I said...
Do you give up?

287
00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:25,722
Never. Unh! Eh!

288
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,374
Okay.

289
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:28,859
Okay, what?

290
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:31,640
I... Give... Up.

291
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,587
You should've never
brought me back.

292
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,195
You should've
left me for dead.

293
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:39,699
It... it would've been a whole
hell of a lot easier.

294
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:41,773
Well, unfortunately,

295
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:44,690
You don't get to take
the easy way out.

296
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:48,837
You know, I had, uh...

297
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:51,495
I had the best dad
in the world once.

298
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:53,502
I did.

299
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:57,080
Always felt safe
around him.

300
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,749
And in a flash,
he, uh...

301
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:04,526
Was taken from me.

302
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:09,218
I wouldn't wish that
on anyone.

303
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,666
Not even my worst enemy.

304
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,303
Maybe kvn.

305
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:17,039
You think your crime

306
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,896
Was killing
little cato's parents.

307
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:21,898
But it wasn't.
It wasn't.

308
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:26,830
Your crime was getting
into that kid's heart.

309
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:30,597
Because I know he thinks
the world of you.

310
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:36,245
And I really,<i> really</i>

311
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,070
Want to hate you.

312
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,197
You should.

313
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:42,878
Because I know
that kid, man, and I...

314
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,094
He's my son.

315
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,567
And I know this is
going to destroy him.

316
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,375
I know.

317
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:54,077
Look, I'm not gonna
pretend to know

318
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:56,250
Why the universe
sucks the way it does,

319
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,883
Why it robs you of the things
that you love the most.

320
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,952
Or, why,
for whatever reason,

321
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:05,894
It put me and you
into this kid's life.

322
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:08,431
But we're his dads now.

323
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:12,508
And our job
is to protect him.

324
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:15,139
We can't change the past,

325
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:18,979
But we<i> can</i> write
a new future,

326
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:21,044
One that's better for<i> him.</i>

327
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,660
You still want anything
to do with me?

328
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,702
It's back to back.

329
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:29,246
For life.

330
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,916
No! No, man!
Don't forgive me!

331
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,466
I don't deserve it.

332
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,640
Then prove to me
that you're worth it.

333
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:44,265
Like I have to
prove it to Ash.

334
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:53,813
Hey!

335
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:57,263
I didn't mean what I said
about you murdering fox.

336
00:17:57,486 --> 00:18:00,543
And I'm one lucky guy
to have you as a friend.

337
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:11,912
Have you been
waiting for me?

338
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:13,986
waiting? No.

339
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:16,742
I've got a ton of reading
to catch up on. You know.

340
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:19,232
New ship, tech specs.

341
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:22,452
Yeah. I couldn't think straight
till I knew you were safe.

342
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,126
I'm safe.

343
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,503
Uh... This is...

344
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:29,674
Is awkward but, um...

345
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,155
You're not... you're not here
to kill Gary, right?

346
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,730
Uh, not as far
as I know.

347
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,404
Right. Got it.

348
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:39,319
But, uh...
Right. 'Cour...

349
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:41,234
But... got it. Ugh.

350
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:44,189
Why would... why would you?
But, you know...

351
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:47,327
Um, I'm gonna need
something

352
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:50,197
A little more...
Concrete.

353
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:53,149
No, I did not come back
to kill Gary.

354
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:54,505
Good news!

355
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,261
S-so... Where'd you go?

356
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:00,364
Have you ever seen
the hidden lights?

357
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:02,111
No.

358
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:04,926
I have.

359
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:06,982
Oh!
I just remembered!

360
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:11,925
I have to go some place
that isn't this room now.

361
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,707
You good?

362
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:20,578
Looks like you got into a fight
and lost like four times.

363
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,786
Yeah. I'm good.

364
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,456
Hey! Uh...
I love you, kid.

365
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,501
What's that for?

366
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:33,360
I just, uh... just
wanted you to know that.

367
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,147
- Hey.
- Hey.

368
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:46,213
I don't know if there's...
A word in existence

369
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:51,118
That would describe
how terrible... I feel

370
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:52,736
For what I did.

371
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:58,466
I am<i> so</i> very sorry, Ash.

372
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,758
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

373
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:06,836
But I just wanted you to know
that I loved the big guy.

374
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,325
I did.

375
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:11,108
And I would love it
sometime if, uh...

376
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:12,531
You would...

377
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:15,015
If you were able to
tell me more about him.

378
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:19,552
Okay.

379
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,442
Well, I'll leave you,
uh, alone.

380
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,650
You want to know
about fox?

381
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:29,756
Yes. I mean...
I mean, hell yeah.

382
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,094
Did you, um...

383
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:33,696
Ever hear about the time
he got coramite leeches

384
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,966
All over his body
from fentrex seven?

385
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,167
no way!

386
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:39,436
Those are the itchiest leeches
in the universe!

387
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,772
Yeah! It was the best.

388
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,761
We, uh... we went there
for the beaches,

389
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:46,573
But... apparently we stayed
for the coramite leeches.

390
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:49,218
<i>Ash is back, quinn.</i>

391
00:20:49,302 --> 00:20:51,704
<i>And I mean truly back.</i>

392
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:55,217
Set a course for earth.
