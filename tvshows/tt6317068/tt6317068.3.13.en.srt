<i>Previously on
"Final Space," yo...</i>

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:05,857
 Invictus is where I
should have been all along.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,109
 Little Cato!

4
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:11,073
 Don't forget, Lord
Commander is now a Titan.

5
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:14,362
 The hyper-transdimensional
bridge is also lost

6
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:15,841
somewhere in space.

7
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:17,843
How far are you willing to go?

8
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:19,758
All the way.

10
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,400
You ready to get
this party started?

11
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:53,749
What the hell is that?

12
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,752
It's a T-X14 Boltrunner.

13
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:59,537
One of the fastest
ships to ever exist.

14
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,539
And I've added two surprises.

15
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,716
The first one being this.

16
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,981
The Dragon Hawk Five.

17
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,722
She lives.

18
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:13,551
Kevin Van Newton always said
life is like a minefield.

19
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:15,771
Some people stay back
because they're too afraid

20
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,207
that something bad will happen.

21
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,383
But for the brave who
attempt to cross it,

22
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:23,126
there's nothing stopping them
from blowing up and dying.

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,042
Gary, Avocato... you
are those people.

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,307
I really thought that was
going in a different direction.

25
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,613
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

26
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:32,938
What's tha... that
second surprise?

27
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,224
- What is it?
- Not telling.

28
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,921
You think everything's
for you, don'tcha?

29
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,575
Well, it's not.

30
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,229
Chookity pok? Pok,
pok, pok, pok, pok.

31
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,796
Okay, okay, look.

32
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:43,015
I need you to help Quinn
get the bridge back online.

33
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,321
Can you do that for me?

34
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,149
Chookity Pok.

35
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:49,239
 Goodspeed.

36
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:52,242
This isn't goodbye.

37
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:53,983
But if it is...

38
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:56,116
Quinn, we'll be back.

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,248
Just get the bridge online.

40
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,945
I will.

41
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:16,266
<i>Maybe there's
room for one more?</i>

42
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,355
Get the
hell in there, H.U.E.

43
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:10,190
You ready to do this?

44
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,017
Ah, you're serious.

45
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,237
Oh, no, I'm not ready.

46
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,631
Which is why I brought this...

47
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:19,199
Oh.

48
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:22,027
Nightfall's helmet.

49
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,855
Do you believe in destiny?

50
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,075
No, I believe in luck.

51
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,729
You're gonna need
more than luck.

52
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,861
This thermogenic
power core ruptured

53
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,037
because the green polka
dot overcharged it.

54
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,343
Chookity pok-pok.

55
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,929
Without that core,
there isn't enough power

56
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,694
to create a stable connection.

57
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,609
There's got to be
a way to fix it.

58
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,264
Well, if we had a
thermogenic power core,

59
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:44,224
then <i>maybe we could
talk business.</i>

60
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,443
Oh, is <i>that all we need then?</i>

61
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,271
It's been fun.

62
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,143
So... there's no hope?

63
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,062
<i>You should know by now...</i>

64
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,369
<i>Salvation comes in
the blink of an eye.</i>

65
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:00,805
Nightfall?

66
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,416
How is this possible?

67
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,157
<i>I'm sure you're asking,
how is this possible?</i>

68
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,376
<i>Because I'm you.</i>

69
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,596
<i>And</i> we <i>think of everything.</i>

70
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,384
<i>If I had to guess, you need
a thermogenic power core.</i>

71
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,908
<i>You don't survive
apocalypses without one.</i>

72
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:19,389
<i>It's right here. In
the helmet's eye.</i>

73
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,651
<i>You'll have to put it on.</i>

74
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:22,436
<i>A retinal scan will release it.</i>

75
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,658
What is it?

76
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:31,619
If I put this on,
I'll no longer be me.

77
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:34,926
<i>Quinn, you're not
becoming someone else,</i>

78
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,582
<i>this is the next
evolution of you.</i>

79
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:40,280
Okay, that is very
impressive timing

80
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,760
for a pre-recorded message,
am I right, people?

81
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,592
Every choice, every sacrifice
we make creates our future.

82
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:52,292
This is your future, kid.

83
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,815
I like that.

84
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,228
Get to work.

85
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,621
We got a bridge to fix.

86
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,449
Rawrrrr!

87
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,000
You're safe now.

88
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,351
What is that?

89
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,712
Welcome home, my child.

90
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:07,671
You were right about everything.

91
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,934
And I want to join you.

92
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:14,417
Yes-s-s-s-s-s-s-s.

93
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,681
This... This doesn't feel right.

94
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,858
I-I don't feel right.
Please take me back, Ash.

95
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:23,426
Take you back?

96
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,297
To them?

97
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,518
Avocato murdered
your real parents.

98
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:31,434
Gary killed my brother.

99
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,524
Quinn is the shell of
what Nightfall was.

100
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:38,267
They devour everything
in their path.

101
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,877
But we...

102
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,402
We can be a family.

103
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,925
You and I.

104
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:58,896
<i>We have now arrived at
Little Cato's last known coordinates.</i>

105
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,943
I don't see him.

106
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:05,207
- She took him in there.
- The black hole?

107
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,472
H.U.E., set a course
through the black hole.

108
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:10,778
We're going in.

109
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,432
<i>Course set.</i>

110
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,492
<i>That is Invictus.</i>

111
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:32,147
Twist my nipples raw.

112
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>I am detecting Little
Cato's energy signature.</i>

113
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,766
Alright, we may only
get one chance at this.

114
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,508
We grab him, and we get
the hell out of here.

115
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,597
Let's go.

116
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,773
Hell yeah.

117
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,216
Little Cato!

118
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,832
Ugh, Gary.

119
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:11,012
Ahhhhh, The Gary has
come for the boy.

120
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:14,145
Little Cato, don't forget.

121
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,886
They don't deserve you.

122
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,279
They never will.

123
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,500
Did you <i>really</i> do it?

124
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,284
Did you kill my parents?

125
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,331
From your mouth.

126
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,858
Tell your son what you did.

127
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,339
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,993
I'm so sorry.

129
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,779
Did you do it?!

130
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,044
Yes.

131
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,840
Ash: I told you.

132
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,017
You can't go back.

133
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:02,454
It's me and you forever now.

134
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,674
Little Cato, don't
listen to her.

135
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,416
Shut your mouth.

136
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:11,028
We'll never be the
parents you deserve,

137
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:13,553
but we're here at
the gates of hell

138
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:17,252
because we... we love you, kid.

139
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:20,472
Why did you do it?

140
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,039
I'm a killer.

141
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,041
It's what I do best.

142
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,783
Why didn't you kill <i>me?</i>

143
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,613
Because when I found
you in that wreckage,

144
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,747
in that instant you
gave me purpose.

145
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,707
I may have killed
your parents, but you

146
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,317
you saved my life.

147
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,332
Stop.

148
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,121
Being your father is the
<i>only </i>thing I e<i>ver </i>want to be.

149
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,386
I said... stop!

150
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:17,442
We're not going anywhere
without Little Cato.

151
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,009
Nice words,

152
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,446
but it's all too late.

153
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,931
Ash?

154
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,455
What?

155
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,153
I'm sorry we failed you.

156
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:36,766
<i>Alright, H.U.E.</i>

157
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,942
<i>You ready for
surprise number two?</i>

158
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:42,293
<i>Are you saying that
surprise number two is for me?</i>

159
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,967
<i>What the heck do you
think I've been working on</i>

160
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,819
<i>this entire time, huh?</i>

161
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:48,125
<i>Get your steel buns down there</i>

162
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:50,432
<i>and show 'em what it can do.</i>

163
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:03,097
You live by the sword,
you die... by me.

164
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,710
H.U.E.? H.U.E.?

165
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,495
Ha! Yeah-h-h-h-h-h!

166
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,062
<i>Sorry I'm late, Gary.</i>

167
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,977
<i>Oh, hello there, Ash.</i>

168
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:17,415
I will take care of them.

169
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:52,233
Invictus!

170
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,414
Okay, now you got the
thermogenic power core, Quinn.

171
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:00,720
You're gonna make your way,

172
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,547
and you gotta just
get it in there.

173
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,853
<i>Rarrrwww!</i>

174
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,289
Before we dive right in,

175
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,378
I just wanna say
thanks for including me

176
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,032
sometimes I don't
feel I belong and...

177
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,034
Alright, Biskit.
Talk me through.

178
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,080
- 'Nother good talk.
 <i>Okay. Okay.</i>

179
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,647
<i>Just put the core thing
in the bridge thing</i>

180
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,911
<i>and the green thing
will do its thing.</i>

181
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:20,043
-Chookity. <i>
-And don't overcharge it.</i>

182
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,872
-Pok. <i>
-I'm serious.</i>

183
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,961
-Is that duct tape? <i>
-Well, you try and create</i>

184
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:28,486
<i>a thermogenic power core
in four-and-a-half minutes.</i>

185
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,053
<i>Rawwwrr!</i>

186
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,055
<i>Sorry. Biskit is very hangry.</i>

187
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,796
Okay. Let's do this.

188
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,755
Mooncake, give us a blast.

189
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,061
Pok.

190
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,802
Mmmmmmm.

191
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,369
Chookity pok!

192
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:46,983
Okay, it's looking good.

193
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,419
Charge is at 90

194
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,247
98... 99

195
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,771

196
195
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,511
105! No!

197
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,301
Uh...

198
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,826
Mooncake, no.

199
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,697
I'll stop him.

200
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:11,921
Hey, stop.

201
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,924
Ooh, ah, hoo, ah! Ahhhhhh!

202
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,274
Oh, oh, 103

203
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,493

204
203
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:20,669
100%!

205
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,325
Ahhhhhh!

206
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,327
KVN, you did it.

207
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,025
I sure did.

208
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,988
Biskit: Activating bridge.

209
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,559
Wait. What's happening?

210
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:46,216
Ah, yeah, sorry love, but
you're still gonna have to

211
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,654
find someone to reactivate the
bridge from the other side.

212
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,308
Oh, come on.

213
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:52,962
Is anyone out there?

214
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,485
We need someone to activate

215
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,750
a hyper-transdimensional
bridge on Kalden 1.

216
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:01,014
Anyone. Please.

217
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,538
Please.

218
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,670
Is anyone listening?

219
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:14,331
Lord Commander?

220
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,898
Now, now.

221
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,988
Am I interrupting something?

222
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:23,253
I could have shown you
what real power was.

223
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:28,519
But you are nothing more
than an worthless heretic.

224
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,173
No.

225
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:34,917
I am the Lord Commander.

226
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:37,877
You broke my hands.

227
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,835
It's time to return the favor.

228
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,117
<i>Uh, we should go?</i>

229
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,119
Yes. Very much so.

230
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,264
Go, go, go, go!

231
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,445
Lightfold.

232
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,974
Link me through to Quinn.

233
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,976
<i>Consider yourself linked, Gary.</i>

234
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,456
<i>Gary?</i>

235
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,086
Quinn, is the bridge
ready for us to leave?

236
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,591
No. There's no one out there
to turn on the other side.

237
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,767
Gary

238
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,769
we're not getting out.

239
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,162
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

240
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:47,424
Oh, okay.

241
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,470
Um, uh...

242
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:50,950
I wanted you to know something.

243
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,952
I-I...

244
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,257
What?

245
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,651
I love you.

246
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,261
<i>Yeah.</i>

247
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,089
<i>You don't have to say
it back or anything.</i>

248
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,336
<i>I just...</i>

249
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:05,442
That's right, she doesn't
have to say it back.

250
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,617
Tribore?

251
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,967
Howdy.

252
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,969
<i>Hola,</i> Quinn. <i>Como esta?</i>

253
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,015
You should know by now,
I'm always listening.

254
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,277
I wish I could stop listening,

255
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,149
but I'm just too
dang good at it.

256
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,628
Can you turn on
the hyper-trans...

257
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,195
Shhh-shhh. It's
already been done.

258
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,155
Gotta go. This cape isn't
gonna de-lint itself.

259
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,989
Everyone, back on the ship now.

260
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,689
<i>Gary, the bridge is up.
We're going to make it.</i>

261
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:37,039
You did it. We're on the way.

262
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,351
- Mmmmwwwaaahhh.
- Gary.

263
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,542
- Mm-hmm!
- Gary.

264
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,939
Chookity pok.

265
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:51,544
Let's get the hell
out of Final Space.

266
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,361
- We're lined up.
- Do it.

267
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:59,409
Ash:

268
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:09,941
Mmmm.

269
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,031
Mmmm. Chookity.

270
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,858
Mooncake! Mooncake!

271
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,429
Mmmmmm! Choookity pok!

272
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,051
Chookity.

273
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,271
How does it feel not to
be the strongest anymore?

274
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,359
Mooncake!

275
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:38,970
Mmmmm... chookity!

276
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:42,235
For me, it feels great.

277
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,368
Ash, please let him go.

278
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,414
He never hurt you. Please.

279
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,807
You took so many things from me.

280
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,595
Chookity.

281
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,597
And now I'm going
to return the favor.

282
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,382
Chookity pok!

283
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,602
No!

284
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,741
The key is yours, Invictus.

285
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:12,352
You're free now.

286
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:17,313
Yes-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s.

287
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:50,694
I want you to rot
away for an eternity.

288
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,808
Good.

289
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:21,072
<i>Quinn, if we're going
to leave, it has to be now.</i>

290
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,205
Mooncake! No! No!

291
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,207
Please don't!

292
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,514
- Lightfold.
- No!

293
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,358
Mooncake.

294
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,902
My God. What have we done?

296
