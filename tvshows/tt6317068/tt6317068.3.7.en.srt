1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,006
Am I becoming...

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,136
Nightfall?

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,746
Because if I'm her, then...

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,476
I no longer exist.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,876
You're whatever
you decide to be.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,816
I just want to be Quinn.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,616
I'm sorry I shut you out.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,816
I should have told you
what was happening to me.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,886
Nah, it's good.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,556
We're good.

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,496
<i>Gary?
Uh...</i>

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,426
<i>Ash is back.</i>
Oh.

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,766
Oh, snap! Really?

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,966
I'll be back.

15
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,620
Ohhhh, boy!
Ha ha ha ha!

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,436
Yo, Avocato.
Did you hear Ash is back?

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,636
Yeah, and that's why
I have these, baby.

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,376
Yo, cool those thrusters, okay?

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,236
This is Ash we're talking about.

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,306
Look, man, she flew
into a black hole after

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,246
Invictus, survived it,
and came back.

22
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,200
That is true.

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,186
Hey. So.

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,516
Uh, don't get weird.
Okay.

25
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,126
You just made it weird by
saying, "don't make it weird."

26
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,856
Yeah, it's, uh,
pretty weird now.

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,596
Well, Ash is uh, uh, uh...

28
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,796
Diff... different now.
She was already different.

29
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,806
Wait, are you saying she's even
more different than before?

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,536
Uh, she... yes.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,430
Oh, god, that might be
too different.

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,006
Heeey...

33
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,170
Ash?

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,346
Hey.

35
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,040
It's me.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,074

37
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,186
You've done something
with your...

38
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,986
Hair.
Her hair?

39
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,326
She's an adult.

40
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,586
Gary, uhh... I think
we should go get a cookie.

41
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,596
Follow me, buddy.
Come here.

42
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,796
Oh, yeah, it's always
a good time for a cookie.

43
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,866
If you could feel
my danger glands right now.

44
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,406
Yes, I mean, like, how did she
get a haircut in a black hole?

45
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,676
Like, how?!

46
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,676
I got an idea.

47
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,806
I gently ask her is she good,
right?

48
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,746
Like, "hey, hey, you good?"
ya know, what about that?

49
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,476
Yeah, it's simple but effective.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,816
Hey...
Hey, you good?

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,146
Good?

52
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,486
My brother is still missing,
or have you forgotten?

53
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,086
I haven't forgotten.

54
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,426
If you must know,

55
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,026
Invictus and I
are working things out.

56
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,226
Working things out.
Okay, one second.

57
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,626
Working things out?

58
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,766
That doesn't sound
very promising.

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,366
Oooh, a team huddle.

60
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,106
Iiiiiiiii like it.

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,306
I mean, is she even on our side?

62
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,176
You have a comment?

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,036
Tell me to my face.

64
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,106
Oh, hi. Yeah, we were
just saying how terrified

65
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,316
We are of you right now.

66
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,846
Especially these guys.

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,246
We were just, uh... ha ha.

68
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,916
We were just talking about,
bah-ohhhh...

69
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,386
Avocato's pecs.

70
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,916
Yeah, they're
just like crystal balls.

71
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,726
I mean, I-I can look inside,
and I can see the future.

72
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,386
I mean, look!
Yes! Yes!

73
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,526
Future things!
Yes!

74
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,396
Oh, things are happening.
I see it!

75
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,526
Get the hell off of me!

76
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,066
You don't have to be
scared of me.

77
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,536
Okay. I believe you.

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,866
Then we're glad you're back.

79
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,806
<i>Alert.</i>

80
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,676
<i>Incoming energy signature
approaching this location.</i>

81
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,530
Oh, double snap!
Let's go!

82
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,816
Where is it, H.U.E.?

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,546
Oh, I see it!
The blue ball, right there!

84
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,946
Oh, where, son?
Oh, yeah, I see that.

85
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,970
Really? Where?!

86
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,286
Oh!

87
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,886
Oh! Oh, oh, guys!

88
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,350
I see it, I see it!

89
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,896
You're late! Again!

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,896
Oh, no. What? Ohh!
Why are you here?

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,106
Oh, god!

92
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,366
Why are you so sassy?
Why?

93
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,506
You came here...

94
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,506
Oh! Gah! Oh! Gah!

95
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,106
What the hell,
you discarded milk dud?!

96
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,376
It's about Bolo.

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,576
He's in trouble!

98
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,440
Trouble, I tell you!

99
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,586
What's going on?

100
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,256
Nightfall? You're back?

101
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,116
No, Nightfall is dead.

102
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,126
Are you...?

103
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,326
Ash. Yeah.

104
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,996
Which means, you're...

105
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,596
I'm Quinn.
Just Quinn.

106
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,196
Can everyone
stop introducing themselves

107
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,666
To people they already know?!

108
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,806
We have to save Bolo!

109
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,290
Right... Now!

110
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,816
H.U.E., where the hell
did this idiot face take us?

111
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,146
<i>We have been transported
five sectors away.</i>

112
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,156
<i>We are now inside
a class 9 nebula.</i>

113
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,880
Bolo?

114
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,626
Bolo's mind is lost.

115
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,096
He's gone crazy!

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,366
Crazy, I tell you!

117
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,166
Yeah, I don't think we're
catching him at a great time

118
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,436
In his life right now.

119
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,890
Yeah, I mean, honestly,
he looks okay to me.

120
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,046
Oh, okay.
Just rip your arm off.

121
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,446
Great.
Thanks, Bolo.

122
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,846
Thanks for making me look bad.

123
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,516
Ooh!
Space crazies!

124
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,700
Iiiiiii like it!

125
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,266
How the hell did
this happen to Bolo?

126
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,596
A wound, I think.

127
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,866
It's gone bad, but not too bad.

128
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,666
Bad enough to rip your arm off!

129
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,996
This is bad!

130
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,266
Is this bad?
It's bad.

131
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,266
Yes, it is bad.

132
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,476
Very bad.

133
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,206
Uh, I think he's looking at us?

134
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,946
Um, oh, yeah, it's bad.

135
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,806
Okay, that right there
is no good!

136
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,616
You know what?
My eyes are locked with him,

137
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,486
And I am going to
telepathically send him

138
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,816
A powerful message of peace.

139
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,486
I think he's...

140
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,156
No! No, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

141
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,440
Let's get the hell out of here.

142
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,156
If we don't cure Bolo,
he will be lost to us!

143
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,696
What do we do?

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,566
And quickly, before he hits
a home run with us.

145
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,496
We need to travel into his mind.

146
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,766
There, we can find
his last spark of sanity.

147
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,906
With that, we can expel
the madness within.

148
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,906
This is just another delay.

149
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,906
Fox is out there!

150
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,376
We need to be looking for him.

151
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,916
Look, we will find Fox.
I promise.

152
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,316
Alright, new plan, everybody.

153
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,646
Help Bolo, find Fox,
and then we're gonna talk about

154
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,316
Ash's very sudden,
weird transformation.

155
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,786
And then...

156
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,386
We're gonna get the hell
outta final space.

157
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,510
Together.

158
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,056
Alright. Sit tight.
Ready, love?

159
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,720
Let's go!

160
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,666
Alright, milk dud, open him up.

161
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,460
Why are you giving me
this kind of sass?

162
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,400
Lightfold!

163
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,076
My god.

164
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,016
This is a horror show.

165
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,286
Where are we?

166
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,486
We've entered the deeper part
of Bolo's mind.

167
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,356
Darkness has begun to seep in.

168
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,756
Be careful.

169
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,096
It's possible to lose yourself
in such a place.

170
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,166
Oooh, sounds amazing!

171
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,496
I've been wanting
to lose myself forever now!

172
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,236
Alright, show us, guide us.

173
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,566
Nurture us...

174
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,390
Idiot face.

175
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,376
Wait, where's Ash?

176
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,376
Ash?

177
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,576
Chookity!

178
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,116
H.U.E.,
is Ash aboard the ship?

179
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,516
<i>I'm not detecting
her life signs aboard.</i>

180
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,716
Where could she have gone?

181
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,256
The mind is a place
of infinite space.

182
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,056
She could be anywhere.

183
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,326
Oh-ho-ho, the sass!

184
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,796
Feel this.

185
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,526
Holy Archimedes!
Told ya.

186
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,326
Don't ever let me
touch that thing again.

187
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,196
Gary.

188
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,890
You guys done?

189
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,676
There are a lot Bolos.

190
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,546
But only one of them is sane.

191
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,806
We have to find it!

192
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,570
We must hurry!

193
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,746
Aah!

194
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,886
Aah! Aah!

195
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,570
Aaaaaahhhhh!

196
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,836
Where are the others?

197
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,896
Hello?

198
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,036
Don't worry, Ash.

199
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,766
I will guide you.

200
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,236
Bolo?
'tis I.

201
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,306
Gotta say, you're sounding
pretty put together for a guy

202
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,376
Who just tore his own arm off.

203
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,316
Even in the depths of madness,
a spark of sanity endures.

204
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,586
I am that spark.

205
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,116
What do we have to do
to fix you?

206
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,126
Follow me to where
the troubles began...

207
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,480
To the chamber of doubt.

208
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,836
You think Ash is okay out there

209
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,166
In the infinite unknown
of Bolo's mind?

210
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,706
Yeah, just as about as good
as any of us.

211
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,906
Yeah, and I got to say,
this is pretty trippy.

212
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,316
Leave my nightmares alone!

213
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,846
Jill, tell me you and oreskis
aren't sleeping together!

214
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,516
Don't leave me here!
Please!

215
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,916
I beg of you!
Anyone!

216
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,116
Someone
find the dimensional keys!

217
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,256
These are all fractured
pieces of Bolo's mind.

218
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,656
Whoa. Oh, my god!

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,396
It's a cookie head Bolo!

220
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,736
That's new.

221
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,936
In his younger years,
he was experimenting

222
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,806
With hallucinogenic stars.

223
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,606
I told him not to.

224
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,876
Oh, no. Wait.
I gave them to him.

225
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,006
When the sands of time explode,

226
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,546
Piercing the veil
of tomorrow's hug.

227
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,486
Uh, whoa!

228
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,546
That made no sense.

229
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,886
But... It's kinda deep.

230
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,156
Well, his head
<i>is</i> made out of a cookie.

231
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,626
Hey, yo! Cookie head!

232
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,110
We gotta hang out sometime!

233
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,550
Dude blows my mind.

234
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,166
Gary is no hero.

235
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,036
His father was.

236
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,896
You will be the death of
everything!

237
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,106
Oh, he doesn't mean that.

238
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,106
The stars will fall
dark because of you!

239
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,176
That's rude.

240
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,906
You will silence
everything and everyone.

241
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,670
The tone of this is beginning
to change quite a bit.

242
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,636
Bolo, how did this
happen to you?

243
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,976
A parting gift from
my old friend oreskis.

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,176
Trapped in my cell for eons,
it was easy to maintain clarity.

245
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,316
But with freedom comes change,
and with change comes...

246
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,716
Confusion.

247
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,116
Confusion? About...

248
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,256
Invictus?

249
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,596
I have lived many
of your lifetimes.

250
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,596
There are constants.

251
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,926
Light, dark, life, death.

252
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,066
As I am consumed from within,

253
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,806
I realize these constants
are in flux.

254
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,606
The scales must be
balanced again.

255
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,006
Where are you taking me?

256
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,870
To meet someone that can help.

257
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,616
Fox?

258
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,356
Look at you.

259
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,486
You're all grown up.

260
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,756
Is it...

261
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,286
Is it really you?

262
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,626
You tell me.

263
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,096
What do you see, with both eyes?

264
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,636
If you're really Fox,
tell me the story again.

265
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,306
The one you only told me.

266
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,636
You sure?

267
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,860
You hate this story, baby sis.

268
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay, but no tears this time.

269
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,716
Like so many tryvulians,
I was a child of war.

270
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,186
We were a peaceful people once.

271
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,796
A culture
that nurtured life and art.

272
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,796
And that's all I wanted, Ash...

273
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,750
To play music and share
that joy with others.

274
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,220
But they took that from me.

275
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,606
What did they take?

276
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,276
My dream.

277
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,346
My music.

278
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,570
My arm...

279
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,286
Fox...

280
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,896
Don't cry, Ash.

281
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,096
I didn't get
to the sad part yet.

282
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,496
They took my hand
so they could orchestrate

283
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,836
This symphony of war.

284
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,106
The dirge of tryvulia.

285
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,790
The anthem played
on this instrument of death.

286
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,670
They destroyed me
from the inside out.

287
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,856
And I was never even
given a choice.

288
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,126
I am so sorry.

289
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,466
But we do have
a choice now, Ash.

290
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,396
We can choose to make
our oppressors pay.

291
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,136
You know then,
where my powers come from?

292
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,406
Doesn't surprise me.

293
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,276
I knew you were special
since the moment we met.

294
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,946
You don't think
that makes me disgusting?

295
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,876
No! Proud.

296
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,486
Invictus chose you.

297
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,546
Invictus wants me to join you.

298
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,156
<i>I</i> want you to join us.

299
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,956
I love you, little sis.

300
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,356
What about Gary?

301
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,756
Everything that man
touches dies or breaks.

302
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,496
I won't let him break us, too.

303
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,590
- But...
- Trust me.

304
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,236
What the hell are upipiums?

305
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,836
Scuba divers do it underwater!

306
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,706
My summer house is a dodecagon.

307
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,670
I am not your hypotenuse
to triangulate.

308
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,316
What is that?

309
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,926
It's the spark!

310
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,880
The last spark of sanity!

311
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,876
Okay, is it just me,
or is he beginning to dim?

312
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,616
He's for sure getting dimmer.

313
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,216
Spark!

314
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,086
What do we have to do
to save your mind?

315
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,286
There's only one who can.

316
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,686
Ash.

317
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,296
Ash isn't here.
We don't know where she is.

318
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,566
The chamber of doubt,
I can feel her there.

319
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,026
Along with it...

320
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,366
Argh!
She's being deceived.

321
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,566
By who?

322
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,096
Invictus.

323
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,166
Get to the chamber of doubt.

324
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,306
Before it's too late.

325
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,506
Yo!
Can you get us there?

326
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,106
I don't have access.

327
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,106
He changed his passwords.

328
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,106
Uh, pink squirrel 89.

329
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,116
Uh, 84 is the best.

330
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,940
Oooh, the sass of it!

331
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,526
Now you do.

332
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,950
Do it, yo.

333
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,806
Us against the world,
just like old times.

334
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,076
What do you say, ashy?

335
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,700
<i>Hold on.</i>

336
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,826
I'm going!
Gary!

337
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,226
Ash!

338
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,910
Ash, come back.
It's invictus!

339
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,930
Nooo! No! No!

340
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,470
Uh!

341
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,300
Gary!

342
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,540
You will lose, the Gary.

343
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,220
Oh! Aah!

344
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,066
She belongs to me now.

345
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,536
You lost the moment
you let her go.

346
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
No! Invictus!

347
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,006
Don't make me do this!

348
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,346
No! No! No!

349
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,570
No!

350
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,036
Ashy?

351
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,060
I-I just wanted to be
a family again.

352
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,870
Fox...

353
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,120
Fox!

354
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,866
Gary!

355
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,806
What did you do?!

356
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,676
I-I didn't.

357
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,370
You killed my brother!

358
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,886
It's gone.
Invictus has left.

359
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,756
That's unsassy.

360
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,286
Why would it do that?

361
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,640
It got what it wanted.

362
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,200
<i>May I offer you a cookie, Gary?</i>

363
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,940
<i>Sometimes, cookies help.</i>

364
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,886
Fox...

365
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,356
Your pain is real, Ash.

366
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,956
But know this.

367
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,156
Fox was already dead.

368
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,156
He seemed pretty alive to me.

369
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,426
Invictus inhabited him.

370
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,366
Invictus also inhabited
Gary and Avocato and you.

371
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,036
And all of you are alive.

372
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,036
This was different.

373
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,306
Stop!

374
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,906
I want my brother's body.

375
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,130
And you shall have it.

376
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,740
Fox.

376
00:20:55,305 --> 00:21:55,173
