<i>But I am still unable
to locate the rest of the crew.</i>

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:09,805
Chookity pok.

4
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:12,591
H.U.E., how do I
put this politely?

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,528
You've been out of the ai game
a while.

6
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:21,067
Do you think maybe
it is possible that...

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,534
<i>Go ahead and say it, Gary.</i>

8
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:24,203
<i>That I'm incompetent?</i>

9
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:26,539
Aaah! Oh, god.
Oh! H.U.E.!

10
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:29,007
Did you just uppercut me
with a monitor?

11
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:29,973
<i>Oops.</i>

12
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:32,611
<i>I guess I'm still
getting my groove back.</i>

13
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:35,614
<i>Cheerio from old blighty,
constable goodspeed.</i>

<i>Ha! I'm making some progress
here in london,</i>

15
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:41,220
<i>But these jx10 trans-vector
plasma coils are really...</i>

16
00:00:41,304 --> 00:00:44,223
<i>...Well, "snogging
my bum," as the brits used to say.</i>

17
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:47,626
Yeah, you should definitely
stop saying that, okay?

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,295
But do you think
you can get it to work?

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,698
<i>Yep. I'm hoping in
four to five days, tops.</i>

20
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:53,900
We'll be there.

21
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:56,969
<i>Have you found
the others yet?</i>

22
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:58,036
Not yet.

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,638
<i>oh! Uh, gotta run!</i>

24
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,441
<i>Remember Gary, uh,
9 to 38 days, tops.</i>

25
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:03,642
'Scuse me?
What? What?

26

<i>Newton out!
And goodspeed? God speed.</i>

27
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,252
The souls of
these prisoners strengthen me.

28
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:16,455
But they are not enough.

29
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:20,058
I need the key.

30
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:24,797
I need mooncake.

31
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:30,402
Well, I wish we could've
spent more time together,

32
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,204
But since you all failed

33
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:34,406
To tell me where
mooncake is,

34
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,143
You can rot here
like trash.

35
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:40,479
Except<i> her.</i>

36
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:41,680
uh, sorry.

37
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:43,215
I thought you were
talking about me.

38
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,084
Are you?
Yes. You.

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,622
Let them go!

40
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:53,692
Soon, you'll join
the voiceless chorus

41
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:56,228
And bend to invictus.

42

Ahhhh! Ahhhhh!

00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:07,573
Oh, and just how did you think
that was gonna go, girl?

45
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:12,311
I am the lord commander.

46

Come on, ash!
Kill him!

47

Aaaaaahhhh!

00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,993
Agh!
Intriguing.

Okay, good, okay.

You just got back,

61
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,587
Quinn and I have been
a little distant, okay.

62
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:29,922
Hmm.
Separate rooms and...

63
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,857
Mm-hmm.
...Y-you get the idea...

64
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:34,593
Ohhhhhhhh,
chookity pok.

65
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:37,529
Maybe I'm just not...

66
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:38,931
Mysterious enough.

67
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,532
I've read the manuals,
okay.

68
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:44,002
Like, a lady like quinn
needs intrigue.

69
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,604
A mustache!

70
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:46,873
Excitement!

71
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:48,807

What?

72
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:50,476

Mmmwow!

Chookity.
Oh, my.

76

36 hours?

00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:47,065
Ugh. Ah.

99
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:51,003
H.U.E., no one finds out,
especially Gary.

100
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:54,340
<i>But, quinn, keeping secrets
is not part of my protocol.</i>

101
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,676
Whatever happened to
doctor-patient confidentiality?

102
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,678
<i>Uh, I am not your doctor.</i>

103
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:01,213
You just said,
"doctor's orders."

104
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:04,683
<i>Ah! It appears you won
this argument.</i>

<i>Maybe ol' h.U.E.

107
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,157
I need that.

108
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:14,493
I need to make these last
moments with my Gary count.

109
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:23,169
We gotta help her.

110
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:24,370
Ugh. How?

111
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,839
These chains are impossible
to get out of.

112
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:28,374
Yeah, see you later,

113
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,709

Get us out of here.

114
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:31,710
No time, hon,

115
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,245
Not even for
a pash and dash.

116
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:34,580
Would you believe it?

117
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:36,915
There<i> is</i> time.
Ample time. Please!

118
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,785
No, no! Ugh.
And there she goes.

119
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:41,988
I admire her independence,
but...

120
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:44,056
She just bailed on us,
right?

121
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,392
Thanks for
rejoining the party.

122
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,260
But she's comin' back,
right?

123
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:51,913
Uh, what's the answer
that you're looking for?

124

00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:58,070
Eh.
Mm!

126
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,206
Do not "eh" me.
I will not be "eh"ed!

127
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,875
I uncorked my baby hole
for you, mister.

128
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,211
I will not be ignored.

129
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:06,448
Eh.

130
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,736
Whoever said parenthood
was a roll in the hay

131
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:10,177
Doesn't know what hay is.

132
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,356
We need to bond.

133
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:15,621
Would a fatherly swaddle
do the trick?

134
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:16,889
It would.

135
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,225
Did I know that
all along?

136
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:20,842
I did.

137
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,831
Swaddle!
<i>No sere envuelto!</i>

138
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,565
Oh, well.
Then it's on!

139
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,952
Cha!

140
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:33,439
Ha, ha!

141

<i>Quizás eres mi padre
pero yo soy tu superior!</i>

142
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,445
I don't know what
the hell that means,

143
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,113
But it sounds
very continental.

144
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:43,782
Oh, heavens!
You are strong, my child.

145
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:46,118
As we tumble
on the ground mightily,

146

Man to man.

147
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,925
An undiscovered
new civilization?

148
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,460
They'd better
have shopping.

149
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,063
<i>Si.</i>
Mm-hmm.

150
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:59,598
Remember, don't buy

151
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:02,134
And<i> never</i> pay full price.

152
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:13,612

153
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,553

00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:54,186

164
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:03,729
<i>Empty, Gary.
Still no sign of the crew.</i>

165
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:05,664
Hey! Uh...

166
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:06,665
...You look nice.

167
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:07,800
Thanks.

168
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,668
Oh, my god.
You smell nice!

169
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:11,176
Why do you smell so nice?
Why do you...

170
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,606
I mean, uh, so extra nicer

171
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,141
Than the normally
natural nice?

172
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:16,875
I mean ah!

173
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,344
Pits! There's...
There's... I...

174
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,746
I'm sensing some pits
of lavender.

175
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,348
Did I save it?
I saved it, right?

176
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,549
Saved it?

177
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,551
You never lost it.

178
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,753
<i>Love truly is blind.</i>

179
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,088
I don't know what the hell
is going on,

180
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,291
But it's<i> nice.</i>

181
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:35,093
It's real nice.

182
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:35,894
Ah!

183
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:38,364
<i>Incoming transmission, Gary.</i>

184
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:39,365
Play it.

185
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:40,812
<i>One moment, Gary.</i>

186
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:44,503
<i>Biskit, what exactly are you
doing with my pristine temple?</i>

187
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:45,571
That's my business.

188
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,373
<i>That was my golden chariot.</i>

189
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:49,775
Play the dang message.

190
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,177
Gary, can I be honest
with you?

191
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:53,646
You're just letting
your robot arm go to waste.

192
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,847
Mind if I just cut it off

193
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,715
And attach it
to my h.U.E. Project?

194
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,116
<i>If Gary's cool with it.</i>

195
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,986
<i>Gary, are you cool with it?</i>

196
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,388
Oh!
That's my arm, okay?

197
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:03,722
And I... wait.

198
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:05,591
What do you mean,
my arm is going to waste?

199
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:08,126
can it do things?

200
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,663
H.U.E., will you please
play the message?

201
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:13,399
Two seconds. I want to hear
more about my sweet robot arm.

202
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,669
If you haven't figured it out
by now, there's no hope.

203
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:18,136
No hope?

204
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,405
What... what is...
What is that suppos...

205
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,808
You know what? Just...
H.U.E., play the dang message.

206
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:24,210
<i>Gary, we're in trouble.</i>

207
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:27,145
<i>Come asap.</i>

208
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:28,815
That's it?
Any more to that?

209
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,083
Mnh-mnh.
That's disappointing.

210
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,352
Whatever.
Lock onto her location, h.U.E.

211
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,153
Lightfold.

212
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:43,762
You're so much more
than you know.

213
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:45,698
I could make you whole.

214
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:49,035
All your fear, weakness...
Gone.

215
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:52,504
Become my..."prote-gzege."

216
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:55,841
Ha ha! It's pronounced
"protégé," ya dink!

217
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:57,376
That's what I said.

218
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,511
"Prote-gzege."

219
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,046
Nah, ya dingus.

220
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,848
It's pronounced "protégé,"
like matinee.

221
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:04,717
wait!

222
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,452
Are we roasting
a speech impediment?

223
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,587
No, I think he's just
mispronouncing "protégé."

224
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,922
Does it make a difference?

225
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:12,458
Totally!
In one version I'm the dick.

226
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,860
In the other...
You're the cool rebel dude,

227
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:16,062
Taking down the man!

228
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:18,064
exactly.

229
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:22,601
Ash, your powers
are beyond these fools' comprehension.

230
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:27,473
I can show you the way up,
the way to<i> true</i> power.

231
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,875
I never wanted them.

232
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,143
They were a gift.

233
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:32,478
A gift?

234
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:35,481
I couldn't save my sister
from being sacrificed.

235
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:36,749
I killed my parents.

236
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:41,553
And yet, against all odds,
here you stand,

237
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:42,755
Alive.

238
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,024
Aren't you even
a little curious why?

239
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,426
I don't want to know why.

240
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,098
Because deep down
you already know, don't you?

241
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,966
You're still here

242
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,370
Because you're one of us.

243
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,639
Leave it to a market
in final space

244
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,575
To sell a crocheted sweater.

245
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:03,776
Is this peach?

246
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,312
Because it better
not be fuchsia.

247
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,981
We are in great danger,
outlander.

248
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:12,318
Our enemies draw closer
with each passing moment.

249
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,587
Our people live in fear.

250
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,589
Help us, please!

251
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:17,990
Shut the hell up.

252
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:19,325
You don't know what danger is
until you've read

253
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:21,327
My customer satisfaction
survey.

254
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:24,597
Now, how much
is the frock?

255
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,668
they approach!

256
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:32,538
Ew. Bug thugs.

257
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,608
To be fair, if I looked
like that, I would be mad, too.

258
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:38,945
I mean, what kind of
frankenstein nonsense is this?

259
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,930
Be something,
or be nothing.

260
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,218
Whoa!

261
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:48,287
But those were
just the scouts.

262
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:51,423
Their army won't rest
until they destroy us all.

263
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,025
Please, stay!

264
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,493
Fine, you win.

265
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:55,628
What do you win?

266
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:57,296
World's worst shopkeep.

267
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,864
That's what you win.

268
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,640
I think we're next.

269
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:11,710
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

270
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:16,715
Dad? When invictus
took you over, did it hurt?

271
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,651
Yeah.

272
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,725
But not as much
as hurting you.

273
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,399
You lost one.

274
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:34,483
Ughhhh!

275
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:39,438
<i>Gary, your mother's
signal emanated</i>

276
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:41,573
<i>From this quadrant
of the asteroid field.</i>

277
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:43,424
Alright,
let's set her down.

278
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:52,318
Mom?

279
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:55,054
Where the hell are you?

280
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,723
Gary.

281
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:58,858
Oh...
Oh, I... oh.

282
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,326
Okay, I'm just...
Ah!

283
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,927
Ah.

284
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,663
Well, I mean,
we're new to this, Gary.

285
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:05,197
Sorry, I... ah, whoops.
Didn't mean to...

286
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:06,532
sorry.
Yeah.

287
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:08,467
Well that was just
horribly awkward.

288
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,402
Yeah!
It's a Gary thing!

289
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:11,871
Uh, you know...

290
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:13,472
...We could just stop.

291
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,607
Ah, thank you.

292
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:16,608
Gary, listen,

293
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:20,946
The lord commander
has returned.

294
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,682
And he has the others.

295
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,350
What?

296
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:25,284
He's back.

297
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:28,287
This time
we kill him.

298
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,821
Mmmmm.

299
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,157
Don't worry,
mooncake.

300
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,892
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

301
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:35,427
<i>You just tell h.U.E.
What you need, Gary.</i>

302
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:36,696
Guns.

303
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,098
Lots of guns.

304
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:40,766
<i>Hell yeah, dawg.</i>

305
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,483
Hell yeah!

306
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:45,104
H.U.E. Oh... o-okay.
We're good.

307
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,906
Okay, you can stop now!

308
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,440
Okay, okay, h.U.E.
H.U.E.!

309
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:50,843
<i>You want guns?
I give you guns.</i>

310
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:52,444
By the way, quinn,
I'm not just

311
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:54,980
In the excitement
distribution business.

312
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:57,183
I don't even know
what that means.

313
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,451
It means I bring it.

314
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:03,189
Then maybe we should do it
already, goodspeed.

315
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:05,457
It's about to be brought,
ergon.

316
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,192
The warning horns.

317
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:11,063
The slyban army
draws near!

318
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:14,066
Save us, please!

319
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,401
<i>Please!</i>

320
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:19,605
What is this?
A burlap sack of horror?

321
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:20,606
One star.

322
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,208
Outlander,
we're all going to die!

323
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:24,476
Do I want to help?

324
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,078
Yes, I do.
Will I?

325
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:28,680
That depends on how fast
you can say the magic word.

326
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:33,219
Would you say, you want us
to help you...<i> Resist</i> them?

327
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:37,156
Mm. I'd say more like,
uh, fight back.

328
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,625
Are you absolutely married
to that phrasing?

329
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:43,162
For instance, could the help
you require be characterized

330
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:44,630
As a<i> resistance?</i>

331
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:48,634
Could we maybe discuss
the wording later?

332
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,385
Honestly? No.

333
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:53,439
Agh!
Sure, whatever!

334
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:54,974
We'll call it
your thing.

335
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:56,108
Just help us!

336
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:57,309
Just say the word, hon.

337
00:14:57,393 --> 00:15:00,446
Will you<i> please</i> lead
the resis...

338
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,647
Shh!

339
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,249
Tribore already knows.

340
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,651
Quatro, to arms!

341
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:13,259
♪ Whoa-ohhhh ♪

342
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:17,930
♪ whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

343
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:21,482
♪ whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ♪

344
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:26,738
And now quatronostro
and I will take our leave...

345
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:30,142
And that frock.

346
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:33,279
And this helmet.

347
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:35,147
Oh, heavens.
Never mind.

348
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:37,082
The helmet remains
with your people.

349
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,284
Take us with you.

350
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:41,621
Wherever you go,
we will follow.

351
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:43,689
That's a very big
responsibility.

352
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:46,358
How the hell am I supposed to...
Yes, I'll do it!

353
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:49,629
Tribore, and to a much lesser
extent quatro,

354
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:51,831
Will lead you
out of final space.

355
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,514
Now, cheer for me.

356
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:58,103
Cheer!

357
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,443
I am<i> not</i> one of you!

358
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,912
My child.

359
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:10,850
Are you certain?

360
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:14,253
Such dark power.

361
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,327
Ahhhh! No!

362
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:25,713
At last you can see
who you truly are.

363
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,135
Now stop fighting.

364
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:32,071
You're finally home.

365
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:41,881
What have we here?

366
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,898
The Gary!

367
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:47,219
H.U.E., take him out!

368
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:48,287
<i> On it, Gary.</i>

369
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:50,956
Your taquitos are here,
jack!

370
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,760
No, mooncake, you stay.

371
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:56,562
Huh: Pok! Pok! Pok!

372
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,913
I'm sorry,
but that's an order.

373
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,686
Eat lasers, jerk-face!

374
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:06,821
Agh!

375
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,841
Oh, my craaaaaappppp!

376
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:13,645
Never thought
I'd see you again.

377
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:17,583
But you just
keep showing up,

378
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,851
The Gary.

379
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,653
It's just Gary!

380
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:26,726
agh! Ah! Ah!

381
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,927
Chookity pok!

382
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,196
<i>No, mooncake,
Gary is too close.</i>

383
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,331
Dieeeee!

384
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,599
Agh! Ugh!

385
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:35,134
Do it!

386
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:37,203
Arggggghhhhhhh!

387
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,138
Your robot arm, Gary!

388
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,006
Use it!

389
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,208
Come on!

390
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:44,009
Come on!

391
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,745
Turn into something!

392
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,879
Diiiiieeeee!

393
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:49,481
It's not working!

394
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,683
It's just a hand.

395
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,086
Oh!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!

396
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,222
What? Ah!

397
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:59,158
Oh, my siiiiick!

398
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:01,360
Ugh!

399
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:03,095
Did you see that?!

400
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,430
Yes!

401
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:08,033
This is tight!
I can do things!

402
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:10,502
Look!
I so told him.

403
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,238
You were there when
I said it, right?

404
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:14,039
You were there.

405
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:15,507
Oh! It's a sword!

406
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,709
Oh, how did I
not know this?

407
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,312
Goodspeed?
You brought it.

408
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,317
Okay, that's new.

409
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,918
Run!

410
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,859
Hang on! Fox!

411
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:35,060
Goodbye, dad.

412
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,395
Always short of tomorrow.

413
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,863
Ash, get out of here!

414
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,398
I'm not leaving you.

415
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:42,734
There is no escaaaape.

416
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:43,603
Ash, go!

417
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,486
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

418
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:48,073
Bring them up, kvn.

419
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,408
You calling me in, coach?

420
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,277
I'm not your coach, kvn.
Pull them up!

421
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,744
But you have to
call me in.

422
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:55,496
Okay, you're in.
Kvn is in!

423
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,635
Agh.

424
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,706
Whoo!
You right on time, baby!

425
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,011
Peace out, dickweed.

426
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,765
Gary!
I need your help with fox!

427
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,034
Don't worry, fox.
We got you.

428
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,435
Let's cut these things
off you.

429
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,838
It's gonna be okay.

430
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,039
No! Ash!

431
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:21,307
Get out of here!

432
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,441
It's too late!

433
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,311
You're mine now!

434
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,513
- Watch out!
- No! Fox!

435
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:30,916
Aaaaaaaaaaaaahh!

436
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,185
No! Fox!

437
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:39,925
Ash!
Blast invictus out of him.

438
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,794
Ah! I can't!

439
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:45,464
Alright! Everyone,
back to the ship.

440
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:47,132
We can't leave him!

441
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:49,268
We stay, we die.

442
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:04,150
Oh, I have much more
in store for you

443
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:06,085
Than death.

444
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:12,424
Chookity poooooooookkkkk!

00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:14,159

Lightfold!

448
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,973
You let the key escape.

449
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:32,311
I never should have
trusted you with this.

450
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:35,314
bring me my ship.

451
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,122
Fox.

452
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:46,058
Fox.

453
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:47,927
