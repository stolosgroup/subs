CHATTERING

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,559
My truck is running low on fuel,

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,599
so the rest must be the same.

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Permission to bring
up the fuel trucks?

10
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,079
Tobruk is in 120 miles.

11
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,079
We need to refuel.

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,719
Yes...

13
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,439
..I know.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,760
Right. So you should give
the order to bring up.

15
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,239
Oh, please tell me that we
brought petrol trucks with us

16
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,920
on this convoy.

17
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,679
As a matter of fact, we didn't.

18
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,639
I've been watching my own fuel gauge
moving inexorably toward empty,

19
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,079
and I worked out that
what it must be, you see,

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,639
is that the convoy has been
fuelled with just enough petrol

21
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,760
for a journey of 500km.

22
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,959
Right.

23
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,879
But the journey
from Cairo to Tobruk

24
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,800
is 500 miles, old boy.

25
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
Indeed.

26
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,079
There are Frenchmen, you see,

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
in the Transport Department.

28
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,159
Frenchman. Right.

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,560
That'll be it.

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,239
So, we will not reach Tobruk

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,079
and the siege of Tobruk
will not be relieved

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,359
and the bombs and the
shells will continue to fall

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,960
and hundreds more men will die?

34
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,200
Yes.

tonight because of the rain.

76
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,839
Ah.

77
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,079
Ah, invited to feel regret,

78
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,159
he felt no regret.

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,639
I like you.

80
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,279
You know why?

81
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,919
Because if I tell you a joke,
you pretend that it's funny.

82
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,120
So here goes, "Why did the chicken
not reach the end of the road?"

83
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,239
Because...

84
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,879
..it was a chicken who had
volunteered for the Commandos,

85
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,999
the British Commando Regiment.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,599
So the order came down from GHQ

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,999
for the chicken to
set off down the road.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,359
The fucking road. CHUCKLES

89
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,319
And so the chicken
packed up his equipment,

90
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,599
wanked off his reckless urges,
prayed to God, got in his vehicle,

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,839
set off down the road,
and then they're ahead,

92
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,199
right ahead,

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,639
at exactly 120 miles...

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,399
..outside of Tobruk

95
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,680
was the punch line of this
very, very funny joke.

96
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,160
What's punch line?

97
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,679
Oh, it's a British
military secret.

..again.

101
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,599
So the chicken stays in
Cairo, it goes to the races,

102
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,879
it rains and the
girls didn't make it.

103
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,199
And you know something?

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,479

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,239
..then mad...

170
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,800
..wild.

171
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,319
You even seen action?

172
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,039
Repeatedly stood
down, I'm afraid.

173
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,759
Well, we've seen action.

174
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,759
Oh, I'm sensing resentment.

175
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,999
You fucking asshole.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,359
And I understand it.

177
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,119
When one has faced danger,

178
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,079
oh, it takes a long time
to lose the animal rage.

179
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,239
He talks like a
fucking typewriter.

180
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,959
The rain always does this to people.
Why don't you leave him alone, huh?

181
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,959
Yeah?

182
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,520
We lost two good men.

183
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,280
Theft.

184
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,839
Well, I'm afraid theft is
something I cannot tolerate.

185
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,599
But...

186
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,599
..if we are going to engage,

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,879
first, let me give
you a small warning.

188
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,319
I am a particular
kind of soldier,

189
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,679
a commander. I trained
with other men like myself,

190
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,919
some live only to fight
and kill the enemy,

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,679
others are careless of uniforms

192
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,439
and will fight anyone at all.

193
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,399
There are mercifully few of us,

194
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,200
but in war, we are allowed
to be the beasts that we are.

195
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,479
We are taught to kill silently,

196
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,999
and it becomes instinctive,

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,479
almost like swallowing.

198
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,079
And the cursed thing
is, once learned,

199
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,000
you can't unlearn it.

200
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,800
Do you understand?

201
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,879
You shake hands with a
man and you can't help

202
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,679
but glance at his throat.

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,960
WHIMPER

335
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,039
Did you sleep well?

336
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,719
I was exhausted with the
work we did, sir, but...

337
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,680
..satisfied with
our achievement.

338
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,960
Slept on my boots.

339
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,560
I always sleep well, sir.

340
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,320
We have spent 112 days
defending this place...

341
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,960
..amidst the rats and the
scorpions and the flies.

342
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,239
We must continue
to show fortitude.

343
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,600
NEARBY EXPLOSION

344
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,480
RAGGED BREATHING

345
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,319
Command are sending another
convoy to relieve us.

346
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,879
Our beloved friends at GHQ
might this time remember

347
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,759
to fill the armoured cars with
enough petrol in the tanks

348
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,959
to reach the destination.

349
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,320
They can be quite forgetful.

350
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,599
RAGGED BREATHING

351
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,879
In the meantime, tonight, I
will be taking a flight to Cairo

352
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,599
on urgent business.

353
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,479
If THQ can't relieve us,
I'm formulating a plan

354
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,160
that might just get
us out of this mess.

355
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
Move out the way!

356
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,920
Move!

357
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,280
Move those fucking camels!

358
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,000
Get out the way!

359
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
GUNFIRE RATTLES

360
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,160
SHOUTING

361
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,879
Sir. Permission to steal donated
food rations from the Australians?

362
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,480
Permission granted.

363
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,359
So what is it we're
looking for, sir?

364
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,839
I got a message from
one of the dockworkers

365
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,759
who I bribed with hashish.

366
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,400
I asked him...

367
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,159
..to keep an eye out

368
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,679
in the swirling chaos of equipment
and supplies for parachutes.

369
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,240
And lo...

370
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
..a set of parachutes
have appeared.

371
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,399
And... who do they
belong to, sir?

372
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,719
EXPLOSION, SHOUTING

373
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,919
This is the British Army.

374
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,879
No-one owns anything.
No-one knows anything.

375
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,599
Nothing is certain.
Nothing is as it seems.

376
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,120
And whatever the fuck you have
in your hands belongs to you.

377
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,679
And what use do you have
for parachutes, sir?

378
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm going to jump out
of aeroplanes with them.

379
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,559
And do you know
parachutes, sir? Do you...?

380
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,039
"Do you know parachutes?"

381
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,680
I know you strap them to
your back, you jump...

382
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,720
..the thing becomes enormous.

383
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,480
And you land safe.

384
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,920
Catch the damn thing before it
blows into the sea, Almonds.

385
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,080
Put it back in.

386
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,720
How, sir? How the
hell should I know?

387
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,640
I think it's meant to be
a very precise procedure.

388
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,159
Then be precise.

389
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,879
Have them all loaded onto a
truck and sent to the airstrip

390
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,439
for tonight's flight.

391
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
EXPLOSION

392
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,479
Oh, and you will be on that
flight as well, Sergeant.

393
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,679
Along with Riley.

394
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,040
I've decided you are
the right kind of men.

395
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,720
The right kind of men for what?

396
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,039
In a world where there
are no rules, no order,

397
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,679
no organised plan,

398
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,120
certain men are identified by war
itself as its natural executors.

399
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,360
Those natural executors take
matters into their own hands.

400
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,320
I've decided to form
a parachute regiment.

401
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,480
You've decided?

402
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,039
Our generals still think we are
fighting the First World War.

403
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,239
They dither and debate
every order, and all this

404
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,479
while the Nazis,
whose conviction

405
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,919
cuts through us like
fucking steel blades...

407
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,079
We are chased across
the fucking desert.

408
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,799
Comedy.

409
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,319

of their ideology.

The devil sent me
those tins of beef.

413
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,760
God sent me those parachutes.

414
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,759
I'm going to give it a whirl.

415
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,439
I am bringing together men

out of drill for a few days.

Last night there was an

438
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,399
He wanted to know if the dysentery
report of two weeks ago was genuine.

439
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,119
They think you are malingering.

Of course.

THEY LAUGH

449
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,239
Oh... so what did he
actually ask you about?

450
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,159
I've been in the dark, so
it's all a bit unclear.

451
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,679
He had a message from a
Lieutenant Jack Lewes in Tobruk.

452
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,959
Jock Lewes.

453

Whatever. My God, you

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,239
So what did Jock Lewes say?

461
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,559
HIGH-PITCHED: Ah, here.

462
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,679
Go to the Empire Club
tonight, meet Paddy Mayne,

463
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,519
and bring him to
the Tipperary Club

464
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,559
for a reunion of the
Three Musketeers.

465
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,040
What the fuck does that say?

466
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,160
Just says "parachutes".

467
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,840

Welcome home.

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,800
No.

470
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,960
Were you arrested?

471
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,040
Detained.

472
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,439
Were you identified?

473
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,239
No. I said my name was Mr
Hyde, and I had no papers.

474
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,440
He gave me a ten-shilling fine
for not having identification.

475
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,559
They were going to hang
me, as a matter of fact.

476
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,360
For having no ID?

477
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,159
No, for seeking justice.

478
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,079
What is this soup?

479
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,560
It's the gazelle you shot.

480
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,800
Oh, it's very nice.

481
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,080
Thank you.

482
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,119
Now..

483
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,160
..eventually, of course...

484
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,600
..you are going to
get yourself hung.

485
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,519
They say it is an
exquisite death.

486
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,040
Though who the people are
that know that is unrecorded.

487
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,279
You were supposed
to be in hospital.

488
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,760
Why did you leave?

489
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,159
Well, I don't so much
have malaria any more

490
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
as much as share a bed with it.

491
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,119
My only symptom now is soaking
the sheets every night.

492
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,519
I sweat so much, I'm
embarrassed to have the nurses

493
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,760
come wring them out.

494
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,960
So I went and sweated
in a nightclub instead.

495
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,519
And somebody got my goat.

496
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,680
There's no more to it than that.

497
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,999
Mm.

498
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,239
Last night, someone
was here with a message

499
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,959
from a Lieutenant
Jock Lewes in Tobruk.

500
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,959
Something about parachutes.

501
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,239
You're due at the Empire tonight
to meet a fella called Stirling.

502
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,600
To reunite the Three Musketeers.

504
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,320
Help you tonight, sir?
Not tonight, dear.

505
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,880
No, no, no, no.

506
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,240
I'm afraid not.

507
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,479
I don't know what a red
flower on the table signifies

508
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,319
in the language of Cairo,

509
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,199
but I'm not looking
for a brief accord,

510
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,119
if that's what you're thinking.

511
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,839
"A brief accord"?

512
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,279
You are a poet.

513
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,880
As a matter of fact, I am.

514
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,639
And I'm a journalist.

515
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,400
"I'm a journalist,"
said the spy.

516
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,479
Of course I am a spy.

517
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,319
In war, we must all repurpose

518
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,399
our professional
talents. Sorry, old chap.

519
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,440
Fuck!

520
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,280
And what is your purpose?

521
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,879
I am an intelligence officer
who reports directly to

522
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,880
the free French government
in exile, General de Gaulle.

523
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,959
From his bar stool in
a pub in Dean Street.

524
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,400
How are you enjoying
Cairo, Paddy Mayne?

525
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,879
How do you know my name?

526
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,759
Lieutenant Mayne, your victory over
the Vichy French at the Litani River

527
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,719
was the first piece of good news
for the French who oppose Hitler

528
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,240
in a long time.

529
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,679
I would like you to give me
an assessment of the morale

530
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,719
of pro-Nazi French soldiers
that you came into contact with

531
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,759
so that I can file a
report to the general.

532
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,999
All the pro-Nazi French soldiers

533
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,400
I personally came into
contact with are dead.

534
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,600
So...

535
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,480
..their morale is pretty
poor, I would say.

536
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,439
My father was a brigadier.

537
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,319
He taught me to ride, shoot,

538
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,119
and kill.

539
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,719
Kill with cutlery if necessary.

540
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,719
Well, if you're in need of cutlery,
I'd go and find another table.

541
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,480
I'm here to attend a meeting.

542
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,519
Very well. Apologies.
Ah, no, fuck it, no.

543
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,159
Do you know what? I'll go.

544
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,199
Didn't want to be here anyway.

545
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,839
I only came to politely say no.

546
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,399
Would you wait for him and
pass on a message from me?

547
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,039
Wait for who? Just tell him

548
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,119
Paddy Mayne says no because
he has decided to go to Burma

549
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,199
to fight the Japanese instead.

550
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,759
It'll be a very tall man who
will be drunk or will get drunk.

551
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,399
And when you give him my
message, he might get angry,

552
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,840
so you should leave.

553
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,120
Just tell him Paddy
Mayne says no.

554
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,200
All right?

555
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,160

GASPS I'm sorry,
this table is booked.

562
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,599
You crept up on me.

563
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,679
You'll have to go, I'm afraid.

564
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,239
I have a message for you.

565
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,599
Ooh. A message from who?

566
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,119
Paddy Mayne.

567
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,479
He was here, but he said he
has decided he's going to Burma

568
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,119
to fight the Japanese.

569
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,839
The...

570
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,320
Right.

571
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,040
He said you would be angry.

572
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,560
No, I'm not.

573
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,799
Was he sober?

574
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,399
I think so.

575
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,359
But he was quite
odd. Yes, he is.

576
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,919
Drink, sir? Whisky.

577
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,080
Yes, sir.

578
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,879
He was right.

579
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
You are tall.

580
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,839
Who the fuck are you?

581
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,239
I'm the deputy head of French
military intelligence in Cairo.

582
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,879
Oh, so you're the head of French
military intelligence in Cairo?

583
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,400
Because I know your boss...

584
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,559
..and he's always drunk.

585
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,319
Are you new?

586
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,279
To Cairo, yes.

587
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,560
In every other way, I'm not new.

588
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
Mmm.

589
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,000
Listen, in other times...

590
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,759
..I would love to stay and make
conversation, but right now beauty

591
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,320
is not a currency I value.

592
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,199
Oh, apologies.

593
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,519
That sounded like an attempt
to be charming, didn't it?

594
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,919
It wasn't meant to be.

595
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,079
It wasn't taken as
charming at all.

596
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,720
Not even remotely.

597
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,319
Sometimes the French and the
British misunderstand each other.

598
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,080
It's like the difference
between kilometres and miles.

599
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,960
The result can
be... unfortunate.

600
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,399
You heard about that.

601
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,600
You will learn that I tend
to hear about everything.

602
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,279
Whisky.

603
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,240
I need a car. Where to, sir?
Tipperary fucking Tea Club.

604
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,800
Lieutenant Stirling.

605
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,679
For the avoidance of doubt,

606
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,639
I share your impatience
with the conduct of the war,

607
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
and I intend to do
something about it.

613
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,400
Well?

614
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,359
Did you go and meet him?

615
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,440
I did.

616
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,160
There were red flowers
and French spies.

617
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,160
And?

618
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,879
What did you tell him?

619
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,319
I didn't tell him anything.

620
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,680
I left him a message to say
I'm going to the Far East.

621
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,239
You are?

622
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,399
So whatever it is he and
that mad martinet Lewes,

623
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,199
whatever it is they're planning,

624
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,079
they can do it without me.

625
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,759
Who are they, anyway?

626
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,400
Just men I trained with.

627
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,320
Stirling, you could
dismiss as a drinker.

628
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,199
Gambler.

629
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,399
One of those toffs, you know,
who climbed through the ranks

630
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
on the branches of
their family tree.

631
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,560
Lewes, you could say, is a
bully with a bitter little mind.

632
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,719
You could dismiss him, too.

633
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,759
But you don't dismiss them.

634
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,840
No.

635
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,760
No, because when the moment
comes, they are not themselves.

636
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,720
None of the above is who
they are. They are...

637
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,520
They are dead man...

638
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,520
..just awaiting confirmation.

639
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,320
LAUGHS Like me.

640
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,360
But as I say, I'm
going to the Far East.

641
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,919
Ship me somewhere east of Suez,

642
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,239
where the best is
like the worst.

643
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,119
The Far Eastern theatre
will be a grand show

644
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,640
when it starts, you know.

645
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,879
Here, do you want
to come as well?

646
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,120
I'm putting together a unit.
I can request you if you want.

647
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,479
Yeah.

648
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
Fuck it.

649
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,440
Why not?

650
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,600
Thank you very much.

651
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,919
Ah.

652
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,479
Ah!

653
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,479
Where's Mayne? You were
supposed to bring him.

654
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,719
Mayne says he's going to
Burma to fight the Japanese.

655
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,319
They're not at war
with Japan yet.

656
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,640
No, but if Paddy's going,
we will be quite soon.

657
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,439
There's tea. Oh,
enjoy it, old man.

658
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,439
It's for you.

659
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,119
No, it's not.

660
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,080
It's not my tea.

661
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,999
I have an idea for you.

662
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,399
A map!

663
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,999
Oh, goodness, this
must be serious.

664
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,760
Yes, it's actually a very
large map, which is a nuisance.

665
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,679
Excuse me, gentlemen.

666
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,959
I'd like to use this
table for a demonstration.

667
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,879
How long will you be?
It's a tournament.

668
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,519
We're going to be
here all night.

669
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,479
And if you're going to
stand there staring,

670
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,199
we will charge you admission.

671
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,319
THEY LAUGH

672
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,039
Yes. I'm afraid I have a rendezvous
at the Kit-Kat Club later

673
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,959
and I don't have all
night, gentlemen.

674
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,439
I've just got back from
a deep desert patrol

675
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,120
and I am mad as fuck.

676
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,559
What's he doing?

677
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,799
Grenade!

678
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,879
Out! Quickly!

679
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,919
SHOUTING

680
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,240
Out of the way!

681
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,559
My men are bored. They
make these little novelties

682
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,599
to brighten their day.

683
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,679
This one's excellent if you
can't get a seat on a train.

684
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,919
You haven't changed,
then, Stirling.

685
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,279
No. You haven't
grown up or anything.

686
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,919
I'm still about 12.

687
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,239
Stink bombs and bike sheds.

688
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,440
Set.

689
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,199
Except now the stink
is dead bodies.

690
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,680
Oh, if that's what
you're proposing, yes.

691
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,919
You drew this yourself?

692
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,519
GHQ maps are inaccurate
and outdated.

693
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,319
That's because the Germans keep
advancing while we fold our arms

694
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,839
and say, "Not ideal,
unattractive, gloomy."

695
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,919
Do you know any general that
doesn't speak like a nursery nurse?

696
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,679
The Germans have advanced
800 miles in six weeks.

697
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,719
Everywhere it's Rommel
this and Rommel that.

698
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,879
But in my opinion,
he's made a mistake.

699
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,279
He's moved too fast.

700
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,840
Look at this supply line.

701
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,039
Hmm. It's around
300 miles too long.

702
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,079
So far, we have been attacking
the German convoys from the sea.

703
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,639
That is why we are
always expected.

704
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,399
Right. And you
have a better idea?

705
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,440
Yes.

706
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,920
A doctor stoned on laughing gas
said something about parachutes.

707
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,799
Instead of attacking
from the sea,

708
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,599
we should be attacking

709
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,120
from the sea of sand.

710
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,559
We parachute units of
selected men into the interior

711
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,319
and then attack Rommel's
supply line from the desert.

712
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,999
A disciplined group of
men. Ah, discipline.

713
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,199
You see, I myself would consult
quickly with Johnnie Walker

714
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,359
before each engagement.

715
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,799
How would that be with
your idea of discipline?

716
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,280
Is that important to you?
It's an indicative example.

717
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,239
I once had this idea in
a sweaty dream one night

718
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,039
that all regimental
discipline is horseshit.

719
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,199
Each man should be a chess piece
that can move in any direction.

720
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,119
His idiosyncrasies
are his own business.

721
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,759
The most important
thing is courage.

722
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,479
The most important thing is wit,
in every sense of that word.

723
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,999
Anything expected fails. Never
be where you are meant to be.

724
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,319
Actually, the first thing
we would need to do is prove

725
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,239
that the principle of a
parachute drop is sound.

726
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,079
No-one has ever parachuted
in the desert before.

727
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,519
Whatever.

728
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,599
When a vulture spreads its wings
out there, it goes up, not down.

729
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,640
Hmm.

730
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,040
So someone would need to try it.

731
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,320
Yes.

732
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,639
Just us.

733
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,159
You and I.

734
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,439
I was hoping Mayne would join
us, but we can do it without him.

735
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,199
We prove it can be done,

736
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,959
and we prove to each other
that we are committed.

737
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,920
No-one to stand us down.

738
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,840
No-one to stand us down.

739
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,360
What should we call ourselves?

740
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,760
So you're in?

741
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,880
Stirling. Are you in?

742
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,279
You steal the parachutes.

743
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I will steal an aeroplane.

744
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,719
There's just no
way. There is no...

745
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,199
Ah, Lieutenant. This man claims

746
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,119
he has authority to
commandeer my plane.

747
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,639
At ease. He has permission.

748
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,519
I've already explained
this is war work

749
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,959
and we have a licence
to behave badly.

750
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,839
I'm a fucking postman, you know.

751
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,599
I deliver military mail.

752
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,799
I want to know what's going on.

753
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,159
I want to know who you are
and the name of your unit.

754
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,040
Ooh, did you think of
a name? No, not yet.

755
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,039
If you're even considering using
my plane to make a parachute drop,

756
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,239
you're not going anywhere
in this weather, you know.

757
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,199
Forecast has this
blowing over in one hour.

758
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,319
No-one parachutes in the desert.

759
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,439
We know.

760
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,599
And your parachutes have
static lines. They have what?

761
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,119
They have static lines.

762
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,719
Look - these lines have to
be clipped to a steel cable

763
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,439
attached fore and aft.

764
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,279
My plane is a De Havilland.

765
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,799
It doesn't have a cable. Mmm.

766
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,239
Well, we'll use the seats.

767
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,479
Yes, we'll tie the parachute
cables to the seats.

768
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,679
The legs of the passenger seat.

769
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,439
How much actual parachute
training have you had?

770
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,879
We spent three weeks
jumping from scaffolding

771
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,079
and moving vehicles. And
rolling forwards and sideways.

772
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,199
And the door opens to the wind?

773
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,839
Almonds, take the
door off. Yes, sir.

774
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,719
But by the time this weather
blows over, it will be dark.

775
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,679
So how will you find your
way back if it's dark?

776
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,200
..Lewes?

777
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,839
The stars. The stars. Yes.

778
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,079
Sir, with this storm and the failing
light, why don't we think again?

779
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,799
Lewes, it sounds like your sergeant
is suggesting that we stand down.

780
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,719
We do not fucking
stand down any more.

781
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,239
That should be the
name of our unit.

782
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,159
The men who refused
to stand down.

783
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,999
I believe, on the grounds of
hazard, I could refuse to take you.

784
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,159
If you don't want to fly...

785
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,279
..I flew a crop for him once.

786
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,079
I'll fly that thing myself.

787
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,919
Good God, he's American.

788
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,280
Even so, he's OK.

789
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,759
You're all fucking mad.

790
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,800
At last! He gets it.

791
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,560
I need a piss.

792
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,439
Chop-chop.

793
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,800
