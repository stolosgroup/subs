I want to tell you something.

174
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,767
I'm a big fan of what
you did with Lafayette.

175
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,769
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

176
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:52,572
I hope you carved
that turkey nice and slow.

177
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:57,151
Yeah, I did what I had to do.

the same thing.

behind Kostya's back.

490
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,127
Call him.

491
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,464
Would you mind?

492
00:30:23,013 --> 00:30:23,937
BOAZ:<i> Sí.</i>

493
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:26,982
Ohh...I'm getting old.

494
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:37,167
I tell you what, then.

495
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:39,911
You bring
that motherfu--er to me.

496
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,422
We'll find out
what he knows.

497
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,334
Everything all right?

498
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,587
Yeah.

499
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:51,974
Everything's fine.
I got it under control.

500
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:01,066
DURAND: It's done.

501
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:04,477
He'll meet you here.

502
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:07,364
And you should know,
he's rather crazy.

503
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:11,201
Call off your men.
You're coming with us.

504
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:18,325
That Vermeer was fake.

505
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,160
So I'm taking the mask

506
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:24,006
as a payment for the molly
you stole from me.

507
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,222
Shall we?

508
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:35,058
<i> </i>

509
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,609
Got here as soon as I could.

510
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:50,449
Pa

511
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:53,577
<i> Para</i> Javier.

512
00:31:57,607 --> 00:32:01,576
Teresa...sent a<i> ------ gringo</i>
to spy on me.

513
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,246
She's having the East Coast
product from Colombia

514
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,424
sent directly to New Orleans.

515
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,134
Bypassing us?

516
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,339
I wasn't sure

517
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:16,716
until this<i> ------ gringo</i>
showed up on my doorstep.

518
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:20,011
GEORGE:
<i> Tranquilos.</i>

519
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:21,438
-Mornin'.
<i> -¿Entiendes?</i>

520
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:22,481
Hey.

521
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:25,517
You look like shit.

522
00:32:25,593 --> 00:32:29,104
Yeah, well, I like
to match how I feel.

523
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,948
Did we go streaking
last night?

524
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:33,108
You did.

525
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,442
Tiger's not happy.

526
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,736
Ah,<i> El Tigre.</i>

527
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,288
My cousin Angel
from Mexico.

528
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,299
He's gonna be
hanging out with us.

529
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:52,636
What's up, buttercup?

530
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:55,213
You should try
some of that tripe.

531
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:58,299
It'll make you
feel better, homie.

532
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,761
You know what, I'm gonna pass.

533
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,722
But I will take ten aspirin.

534
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:06,599
Bathroom down the hallway
to the left.

535
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:10,237
Cheers. You enjoy that.

536
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:27,379
Keep an eye on him.

537
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:39,307
He'll be here.

538
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,495
So it's true.

539
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,714
A woman runs a cartel.

540
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,720
Doesn't say much about
the men of Mexico, does it?

541
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:22,100
We're here to do business,
not trade insults.

542
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,387
Something has been bothering me
ever since Durand called.

543
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,232
What's so special
about this molly

544
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,851
that someone would wanna
pay such a price?

545
00:34:31,928 --> 00:34:36,356
You're either very desperate
or very stupid.

546
00:34:36,432 --> 00:34:39,317
Are we doing this deal or not?

547
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:41,078
I want triple the price.

548
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,697
I did tell you
he was crazy.

549
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:47,408
Why are we haggling?

550
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,577
You already agreed
on the amount.

551
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,329
I won't negotiate.

552
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:53,665
Is that what happened
to Rocco de la Peña?

553
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,467
He wanted to negotiate?

554
00:34:56,503 --> 00:34:58,169
You were in business with him.

555
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:00,421
Maybe you're responsible
for his death.

556
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,382
I had nothing to do with it.

557
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,218
-Who is this de la Peña?
-Nobody.

558
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:07,887
TERESA: Get the money.
Let's go.

559
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:09,889
We're not leaving
without my molly.

560
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:13,268
Silly little girl.

561
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,603
Do you have
any idea who you're...

562
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:22,420
Is this it?

563
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:24,422
Thank you.

564
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:25,473
Let's go.

565
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:41,573
.

566
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:43,533
Sorry I lost it back there.

567
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,693
Are you good with Kostya?

568
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,871
-Yes.
-Good.

569
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:53,284
Send him in, please.

570
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,545
I have someone
to introduce you to.

571
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:59,290
Teresa.
So good to see you.

572
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:01,551
You told me to call
when my business was in order.

573
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:05,222
Thank you for coming.
This is Oksana Volkova.

574
00:37:05,298 --> 00:37:07,340
Oksana, Oleg Stavinsky.

575
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:08,716
Nice to meet you.

576
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,678
TERESA: Oksana has the best
molly on the market,

577
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,846
and we're looking
to expand into Europe.

578
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:16,399
I'm sorry.

579
00:37:16,476 --> 00:37:18,643
There must be some confusion.

580
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:20,979
I came here to make
a deal with you, Teresa.

581
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:22,572
I'm Polish,

582
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:24,574
and I don't
do business with Russians.

583
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,662
That's the only way
I'll sell to you.

584
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,491
I don't like to be leveraged,
Teresa.

585
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:36,369
But...

586
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:41,549
How can I refuse?

587
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,669
We'll put our nations'
differences aside

588
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:46,346
for the sake of commerce.

589
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,591
To business.

590
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,978
To business.
We'll be in touch.

591
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:59,359
Did you know Rocco was dead?

592
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:02,020
I heard he met
an unfortunate demise.

593
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:03,855
Why do you ask?

594
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,690
Now you can tell your friends

595
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:07,659
I'm open for business
in Europe.

596
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:11,362
Please set up some meetings.

597
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:14,449
I know a guy
who might be interested.

598
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,367
Isidro Navarro.

599
00:38:16,402 --> 00:38:19,671
heavy hitter who supplies
most of Western Europe.

600
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:22,007
Looking forward
to meeting him.

601
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,635
Good to see you.

602
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:30,473
Teresa.

603
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:34,385
You didn't have to do that.

604
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,721
Now you have something
of your own.

605
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:39,024
Thank you.

606
00:38:58,694 --> 00:39:00,828
Beautiful, right?

607
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,464
Yeah.

608
00:39:05,118 --> 00:39:07,344
Say it.

609
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,589
We're working in
Eastern Europe now?

610
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,892
I thought too much money
was the problem.

611
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:17,020
The plan is to get
too big to fail.

612
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:18,521
How big can we get?

613
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:20,640
The bank's already
refusing our money.

614
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:23,485
Then we'll buy the bank.

615
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,943
Congratulations on becoming
a hotel owner.

616
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:34,445
Honestly, after
everything that's happened,

617
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,581
I'm surprised
you're even interested.

618
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,084
I wish you luck.

619
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,882
Congratulations.

620
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:48,501
First step to legitimacy.
And don't worry.

621
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:50,962
On paper, this hotel
will be very, very busy.

622
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:52,889
Good.

623
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:55,466
Oh, also, I found a top-flight
lawyer in New York City

624
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:58,803
that's willing to take
on Dumas's case.

625
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:00,721
That's great news.

626
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,640
I just want you to know
I'm focused.

627
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:04,559
I promise, this baby
will not be a distraction.

628
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,144
I'm gonna work twice
as hard to prove it.

629
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:08,780
I don't want you to work
twice as hard.

630
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,899
I think you're doing
an excellent job.

631
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,953
We can hire a few law firms
for you just to oversee.

632
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,642
-Where the hell we going?
-You'll see.
