1
00:00:01,957 --> 00:00:03,656
My name is Teresa Mendoza.

2
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:06,682
I run the biggest drug empire
in the Western Hemisphere.

3
00:00:06,823 --> 00:00:09,687
My life wasn't supposed
to be anything like this.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,090
So now that you're out
of a job, comin' with us?

5
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:23,790
You don't know me, Teresa.

6
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,323
Guero's dead. Get out of the house now.

7
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:30,657
Stop the car.

8
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:37,169
Where do I know you from?

9
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:38,528
I was Guero's girlfriend.

10
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:40,590
I'll deliver the drugs
that your mule didn't.

11
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,490
You have proven
you can be relied upon

12
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:44,090
to do what I need.

13
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:45,566
They're starting
to dissolve. Come on.

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,990
You have to. Three more.

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,990
I want to be part of the business.

16
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:53,823
- Would you die for me?
- I'll survive for you.

17
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:55,399
Look, you shouldn't
have come back for me.

18
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,257
But you didn't leave me behind,
and I won't forget it.

19
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,123
What is this?
I never signed these papers.

20
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:01,490
Camila's trying to set you up

21
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:03,449
to take the fall for her business.

22
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:06,015
My life is on the line
with El Santo.

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,205
Are you aware of the word Moyocoyotzin?

24
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:12,123
It is time for you to create yourself.

25
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,390
In the morning,
we're gonna go back to Dallas

26
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:16,023
and take what's rightfully mine.

27
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:19,590
Everyone has the right to
the throne if they can take it.

28
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:22,023
There can only be one queen.

29
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:25,757
You're gonna live
the rest of your life

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,957
as a fugitive from your own country.

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,357
I'm sending you into exile.

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,623
48 hours ago, we didn't have a supplier.

33
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:36,107
Now we own the corridor all the
way from Sinaloa down to Phoenix.

34
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,390
Salud.

35
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:39,123
Selling on the dark web,

36
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:40,357
cutting out the middleman,

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,700
and turning product into champagne.

38
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:42,929
We did it.

39
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:45,723
30,000 square feet
of commercial property.

40
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:46,923
Our future.

41
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:48,390
You want to build a mall?

42
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:50,723
I want us to own legal businesses.

43
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:53,190
We won't have to work with
people like Castel and Boaz.

44
00:01:53,223 --> 00:01:54,757
- I'm driving?
- It's your car.

45
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,628
Tony!

46
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:01,623
We're going to kill them all.

47
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:03,399
I'm not gonna let you
give birth in handcuffs.

48
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,590
I don't want that either,

49
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,423
but that is not your decision to make.

50
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:09,957
- What decision?
- I... we...

51
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,559
We're pregnant.

52
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,823
We just took over Miami.

53
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:15,657
Why move so fast with the Russians?

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,057
I would like you to introduce me

55
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,057
to your cousin, Kostya.

56
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,423
If Kostya pays you
a surprise visit,

57
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:23,790
he's the last person you will ever see.

58
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:25,557
You want me to stop
selling to Kostya?

59
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,657
No, I want you to kill him.

60
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,757
We allow people like you to exist

61
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,957
so that when we call on you
for the greater good,

62
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,423
you answer.

63
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,957
I'll take your business after I kill you

64
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,390
and all of your people.

65
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,057
But you're already dead.

67
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,257
- I love you.
- I love you.

68
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,623
We're getting out
of the business.

69
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,623
I'm only legit
until Devon decides I'm not.

70
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:00,923
We're going to Belize.

71
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:02,623
One more thing you need to take care of.

72
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,123
Teresa isn't a threat.

73
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:07,223
Nobody gets out.
You know what has to be done.

74
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,590
We had just landed

75
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:30,423
a few minutes before it happened.

76
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,190
Teresa seemed so happy.

77
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:38,990
Belize was supposed to be
a new beginning.

78
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:41,990
The last thing she said
before she went upstairs is...

79
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:45,190
Today is the first day
of the rest of our lives.

80
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,690
That was the last time I saw her alive.

81
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:56,657
You remember hearing the gunshot?

82
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:01,990
Samara?

83
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:08,023
I remember a pop.

84
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,757
The sound of glass shattering.

85
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,017
What do you remember
after the pop?

86
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,223
Screams.

87
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,790
Teresita!

88
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,523
Teresa!

89
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:28,357
I'll never get them
out of my head.

90
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,990
Did you see her body?

91
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,557
She was lying on the floor.

92
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,023
Pote was standing over her.
There was blood everywhere.

93
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:43,557
Teresita.

94
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,523
Did he say anything to you?

95
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:48,290
Teresi...

96
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,357
He saw me come in and...

97
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,057
Get out! Get out!

98
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,157
He stayed in there,
guarding her body

99
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,023
until they took it away.

100
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,390
That was when I knew
Teresa Mendoza was dead.

101
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:18,885

102
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,823
Talked to George's people in Belize.

103
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:47,590
Everything is set. They're expecting us.

104
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,257
To George coming through
for us even in death.

105
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,657
Salud.

106
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,023
You know, he loved you like a sister.

107
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,490
We didn't get to bury him.

108
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:06,335
I know.

109
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:11,190
- He wanted to be buried at sea.
- Yeah.

110
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,511
When we die,

111
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:19,357
our ashes should go to Culiacán.

112
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,110
Come in.

113
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,857
The police have what they need from me.

114
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:44,690
So I came to say goodbye.

115
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,057
What's this?

116
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,340
A little something
to help you get on your feet.

117
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:02,016
Thank you.

118
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,646
What will you do now?

119
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:09,857
I'm gonna take Teresa home

120
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,070
and spread her ashes in
the dahlia fields of Culiacán.

121
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:17,257
Isn't Mexico dangerous for you?

122
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,023
Yes.

123
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,957
But I couldn't protect her in life.

124
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,657
The least I could do
is carry her wishes in death.

125
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,623
I've been around men
like you my entire life.

126
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:33,236
You'll do more than
carry out her wishes.

127
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,801
The less you know, the better.

128
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,553
Good luck.

129
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,723
You, too.

130
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,990
I love you.

131
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,157
Are you okay?

132
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,057
Well, I'm just over here
sitting in the dark,

133
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,590
and I grab my gun every time
I hear a car go by, but.

134
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:54,090
I know you're scared.

135
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,957
I'm just worried about you
going to Mexico.

136
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,425
We talked about this, Kelly Anne.

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,136
This is what Teresa wanted.

138
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:07,590
This is how we get closure.
I need to do this.

139
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,351
I know.

140
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:12,023
Let me go with you, then.

141
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:13,923
If something happens,
at least we're together.

142
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:18,157
You know I can't do that.
It's too dangerous.

143
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,523
We need to stick to the plan.

144
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:22,357
If something happens to me

145
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,523
I know.

146
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,890
No one knows where you are.

147
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,023
Did you move the car?

148
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:32,099
Yeah. I parked it down
the street just like you said.

149
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:36,690
That's good.
Everything is gonna be okay.

150
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,223
I love you.

151
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:41,557
I love you, too.

152
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,823
I'll call you from Mexico.

153
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,690
It wasn't enough to buy her house?

154
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:46,657
Now you're selling your own tequila?

155
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,160
Welcome.

156
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:54,123
It's a message, like the house.

157
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,990
There's a new king in town.

158
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:02,590
Sleeping in Teresa's bed isn't
the same as filling her shoes.

159
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,427
Teresa's shoes led her to the grave.

160
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:08,971
I'll find my own path.

161
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:10,766
You know, Teresa was successful

162
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,933
because she flew under the radar.

163
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,157
Yet she didn't fly low enough
to dodge your bullet.

164
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:21,657
I didn't survive this long
without being cautious.

165
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,323
You're worried about Pote.

166
00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:26,157
As long as he's alive, I'll be
looking over my shoulder.

167
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,123
That shouldn't be much longer.

168
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:30,690
You know where he is?

169
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,690
- I have a man tracking him now.
- Only one?

170
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:34,390
He's very good at his job.

171
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:36,323
Yeah, so is Pote.

172
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:39,590
And with Teresa dead,
he's got nothing to lose.

173
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:41,523
- And then, maybe...
- It's handled.

174
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:44,190
You just make sure
the train's running on time.

175
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:48,323
This isn't Sinaloa.

176
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:44,483
Thank you for coming.

177
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,987
I still can't believe she's gone.

178
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,623
She's in a better place.

179
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,203
Anything from James yet?

180
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,290
Devon must have got to him.

181
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,423
Him or Boaz. He's in NOLA.

182
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:06,857
- Cabrón.
- It's only been two days.

183
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,023
He's not wasting any time.

184
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:18,857
I still have friends in Mexico.

185
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,936
And enemies.

186
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,590
Think it's enough?

187
00:13:24,623 --> 00:13:27,923
If we don't get spotted by Boaz's men,

188
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:29,290
but it's more than enough

189
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:32,114
to get a few of those cabrónes
down with us.

190
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,762
Let's go.

191
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:43,285
People of Color Chamber of Commerce

192
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,157
is a support system for local
business owners of color

193
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,922
to network and share ideas.

194
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,757
Yes, I know.

195
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,923
I was exonerated.
All charges were dropped.

196
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,490
Now, Councilman, this would
be a boon for your area...

197
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,457
Yeah.

198
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,063
I understand. Thank you for your time.

199
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,823
You think those old white men
gonna let you into their club?

200
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,490
What are you doing here?

201
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,323
I got good news.

202
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,723
Teresa's dead.

203
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,207
And you're takin' over NOLA.

204
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,857
I want you to make
the necessary introductions.

205
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,214
Give me the lay of the land.

206
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:33,467
Be my local boy.

207
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:36,790
No.

208
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:44,269
I understand you're upset
about how things went down.

209
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,423
But what's done is done.

210
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:50,526
I'm out of this business. Retired.

211
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:54,690
All I have is my bar, P-triple-C.

212
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:55,990
That's it.

213
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:58,033
Yeah, bullshit.

214
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:01,048
That PC pendejada crap.

215
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,039
It's a good cover.

216
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,823
- But I know you.
- Hey.

217
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:12,991
You don't know shit.

218
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,387
I'm out. Period.

219
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:23,190
So you go and do whatever it is you do.

220
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,102
I won't get in your way,

221
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,223
but I won't help your ass, either.

222
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:30,691
It's too bad.

223
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:34,403
You gonna walk the line

224
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,590
you better walk it straight

225
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:41,190
because if I hear of anything
different, cabrón

226
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,205
pow!

227
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:54,339
This is it.

228
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:12,790
Wait here. Keep a lookout.

229
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:06,457
Where are you?

230
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,190
I'm in Sinaloa,
just outside of Culiacán.

231
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:10,957
Pote's taking a huge risk.

232
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,590
It's what Teresa wanted.

233
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:15,790
I don't suppose he'd take
that risk if she weren't dead.

234
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:17,357
No.

235
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,923
So it's done.

236
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:21,490
Yeah, it's done.

237
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,976
And so are we.

238
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,784
I want to hear you say it.

239
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,829
Yes.

240
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:32,557
We're done.

241
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:02,523
Finch is coming for you
and Kelly Anne.

242
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,464
He knows where she is.

243
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:10,990
- Hello?
- Devon's men.

244
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,923
- They're coming for you.
- What?

245
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,723
They know where you are, Kelly Anne.

246
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:17,184
You need to run.
Leave everything. Go... now!

247
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,857
- My God.
- We're gonna meet

248
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,757
at the Sunset Motel just off the I-10.

249
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,557
If we're not there by 3:00 a.m.,

250
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,957
you need to disappear.

251
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,890
- Do not look back.
- What about you?

252
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:29,690
We're gonna get out of this.
You, me, the baby.

253
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:32,157
But right now, I need you to be strong.

254
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,357
- Yeah.
- We'll see you at the motel.

255
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,990
Okay. I love you.

256
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:37,557
I love you, too.

257
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,090
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

258
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,090
Sí.

259
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,023
I got eyes on him now.

260
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,136
Vámanos.

261
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:19,590
Shit.

262
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,757
Shit.

263
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,557
Move, cabrón! Move!

264
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:44,541
Vamos!

265
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:08,309
Conyo!

266
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:10,242
Vamonos.

267
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:24,171
Get out! Move!

268
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,709
Okay, okay. Hey!

269
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,209
Hey, girl.

270
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,342
Watch it!

271
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:24,724
Is he coming?

272
00:24:25,742 --> 00:24:27,310
We're good.

273
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:43,942
We got a spare, but no jack.

274
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:46,709
See if someone will lend you one.

275
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,011
Need a hand?

276
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:05,476
Thank you, officer.
I already called AAA.

277
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,942
How long
they tell you it would take?

278
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:10,076
They said they're gonna
send someone immediately.

279
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,509
Out here, that means two hours.

280
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,118
You got a jack, I'll have you
on your way in ten minutes.

281
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:16,009
Actually, I don't one, sir.

282
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,142
Well, lucky for you, I have one.

283
00:25:18,176 --> 00:25:19,857
Give me a sec, and we'll
get you all squared away.

284
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,875
I don't want
to trouble you, officer.

285
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:23,366
No trouble at all.

286
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:26,876
Grab the jack.

287
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:32,142
I used to have a ol' piece
of crap Toyota in high school.

288
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:35,276
Between you and me,
I lost my virginity in it.

289
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,042
Attention,
all patrols. We got a 215.

290
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:38,709
Two armed suspects in a gray Toyota.

291
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:41,442
Texas license Charlie,
Echo, Seven-Niner...

292
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:44,742
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

293
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,096
Put your hands behind your head
and interlace your fingers.

294
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:49,509
Do you have any weapons on you?

295
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,609
I do. I'm permit.

296
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:53,042
Got him?

297
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:55,548
Cuff him.

298
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:41,542
Diga.

299
00:26:41,576 --> 00:26:43,509
Hi, it's me.

300
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,709
It's 3:00 a.m.,
and I don't know where you are

301
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:47,176
so please call me.

302
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:02,042
Shit.

303
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:11,206
A little bit longer.

304
00:27:22,576 --> 00:27:25,446
I talked to the manager. She's in 140.

305
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:30,342
Let's do it.

306
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:01,985
Kelly Anne?

307
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,485
I'm sorry.

308
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:09,684
I got to her motel room, she was gone.

309
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:11,242
Kelly Anne!

310
00:28:16,242 --> 00:28:18,076
Devon's people grabbed her.

311
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:21,709
You told her to disappear.
Maybe she did.

312
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,009
Maybe they got to the motel
and she was already gone.

313
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:26,242
I hope to God.

314
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,709
What about James?

315
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,542
I made some inquiries.
Checked around like you asked.

316
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:35,975
Nothing.

317
00:28:40,142 --> 00:28:43,309
I'm taking a plea deal
on the carjacking.

318
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:45,276
Five years.

319
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:47,885
Lawyer says I can get out
in three to four years

320
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:50,490
for good behavior.

321
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:53,826
If I survive.

322
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,746
Can I do anything for you?

323
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:58,829
I can keep looking for Kelly Anne.

324
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,208
No.

325
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:02,742
If she did get away,

326
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:05,505
I don't want to risk you
leading someone to her.

327
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,634
She's better off without me.

328
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,022
Take care of yourself, Chicho.

329
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:45,576
You always show up unannounced, cabrón?

330
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,742
You're not on the books
for any meetings.

331
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:50,591
Can't you see I'm busy?

332
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:54,976
I can see that.

333
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,442
Yeah. Your man failed.

334
00:29:57,476 --> 00:30:01,342
So I took matters into my own hands.

335
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:03,142
It's clear you have no intentions

336
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,648
of running your business like Teresa.

337
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,809
But at least try to be discreet.

338
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:11,988
I was discreet. I cut out his... tongue.

339
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:15,042
So the neighbors
wouldn't hear his scream.

340
00:30:16,476 --> 00:30:19,576
Turns out he didn't know
where to find Pote.

341
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,581
He's been arrested.

342
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:25,042
He's being transferred to the
state penitentiary this week.

343
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:26,711
Good.

344
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,297
Soon as he lands, we'll hit him.

345
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:33,609
He'll bleed out in the shower
like the pig he is.

346
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:35,742
Is that not discreet enough for you?

347
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:40,003
Actually, I want you to stand down.

348
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:45,676
I thought you wanted
all of Teresa's people dead.

349
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:48,242
- Pote isn't a risk.
- Bullshit.

350
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:49,552
He could've talked, given us up,

351
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:51,042
gone into Witness Protection.

352
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,276
But he didn't.

353
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,509
If he's murdered now,

354
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:59,009
or worse, if your plan fails
like the last one,

355
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:00,842
it could push him to talk.

356
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:03,414
You work for the... CIA.

357
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,509
The moment he talks,

358
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,076
you can make him disappear
in five seconds.

359
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,756
This isn't a request.

360
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:15,051
Stand down.

361
00:31:29,142 --> 00:31:31,009
This looks like solitary.

362
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,542
It's protective custody.

363
00:31:32,576 --> 00:31:35,176
Warden got a tip
about a threat on your life.

364
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,242
How long am I gonna be here for?

365
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:39,076
Till the threat goes away.

366
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,842
Cell 348 loading.

367
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:43,609
348 loading.

368
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:46,642
So my whole sentence, then?

369
00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:49,742
The warning came from high up.
Someone's looking out for you.

370
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:51,504
I'd be thankful.

371
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:01,610
Lock it down!

372
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:04,035
You heard him. Stand back.

373
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,809
- Lights out!
- Lights out.

374
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:36,132
It's open.

375
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:50,176
Look at you, all flaco.

376
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:53,476
Yeah, that food was a disgrace.

377
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:55,751
We got to get you some new clothes.

378
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:58,076
No, you got to get me
in front of a stove first.

379
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,076
Gonna make myself some carnitas,

380
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,283
and then we kill Boaz.

381
00:33:06,942 --> 00:33:08,809
That's a nice surprise.

382
00:33:08,842 --> 00:33:10,209
Yeah.

383
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,276
Pote was released from prison today.

384
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:17,009
Yeah. Nobody's seen him.

385
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:20,309
He's with Chicho.

386
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,409
Old white man never let you
into his club?

387
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:27,176
Do you want him or not?

388
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:30,253
How much?

389
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:31,786
Well, that depends.

390
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,753
How much is it worth to you?

391
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:36,025
Not having to look over your shoulder?

392
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:40,853
You'll get a million and your life.

393
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,659
Tonight.

394
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,745
My bar. He'll be here.

395
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,811
Got you a present.

396
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:15,657
Welcome home, cabrón.

397
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,390
No mames, guey.

398
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:25,490
That's a beauty. Gracias.

399
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,757
De nada.

400
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,933
I know you didn't want me
to look for Kelly Anne,

401
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:30,557
but I did.

402
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:32,957
Couldn't find a trace.

403
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,523
It's Dumas.

404
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,423
You look good. You slimmed down.

405
00:34:53,457 --> 00:34:55,890
I'm at my fighting weight now.

406
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,796
Oof. Times have changed.

407
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,723
Chicho told me you lost the business.

408
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:05,823
Yeah.

409
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:08,659
Hard to make a living
on whiskey and music alone.

410
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,990
Might as well go out with a bang.

411
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:15,183
Boaz is coming by the bar tonight.

412
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:19,542
- We finish it, then.
- Yeah.

413
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,823
Go, go! I'll cover you! Go!

414
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:41,817
Chicho!

415
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,853
We got to go, Pote.

416
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,623
Chicho!

417
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:53,790
It's a death trap! We got to go now!

418
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:56,957
Come on!

419
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,590
Let's go.

420
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,623
We lost some good men.
Everyone else is laying low.

421
00:36:04,657 --> 00:36:06,490
Boaz knows you tried to set him up.

422
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:08,290
He's not gonna stop coming.

423
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:10,990
Yeah. I still got my people in Atlanta.

424
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:13,723
We can chill there
till things cool down.

425
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,323
But we're out of options here.

426
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:18,723
Nah, there's one more play.

427
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,482
I throw myself to the wolves.

428
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,323
When I came to town, I left you alone.

429
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,290
I didn't come after you or your family.

430
00:36:33,323 --> 00:36:35,721
And this is how you repay me?

431
00:36:36,357 --> 00:36:38,357
Where's your little, putito friend?

432
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,557
I'm here, cabrón!

433
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,052
Yeah. I knew you had the balls, cabrón.

434
00:36:52,157 --> 00:36:54,490
'Cause you just showed up
to your own funeral.

435
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:57,852
Came here to settle this
once and for all.

436
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:01,490
Tenderize this bitch.

437
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,723
Yeah.

438
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:17,957
Parese.

439
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,357
We can do it mano a mano?

440
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,794
Sinaloa-style.

441
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:26,657
The sicario code, puto.

442
00:37:27,857 --> 00:37:31,023
Nah, I should have killed you
a long time ago.

443
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:35,723
Pote was a legend in Sinaloa.

444
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,390
If you don't accept his challenge...

445
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:53,257
Orale.

446
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:58,023
Carve you like the pig you are, puto.

447
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,057
Let's dance.

448
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:30,023
Pote!

449
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,116
Pote!

450
00:38:41,657 --> 00:38:44,223
Hey!

451
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,023
You ready, cabrón?

452
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,690
Son of a bitch.

453
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:10,057
- Pote!
- For George!

454
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,257
Kelly Anne!

455
00:39:15,323 --> 00:39:16,930
For Teresa.

456
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,657
Ven, Chico.

457
00:39:47,214 --> 00:39:49,457
Aah...

458
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:18,535
Sorry I'm late.

459
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:21,468
I had to wrap some business in town.

460
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:23,508
How you feeling?

461
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:26,635
I'm okay. You?

462
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:29,255
I'll live.

463
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,261
Guessing this is goodbye.

464
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:36,153
I'm going to disappear.

465
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,864
But before I leave.

466
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:42,034
I wanted to give you this.

467
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:45,829
I had to wait until Boaz
was out of the picture.

468
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,448
- What is it?
- It's a gift.

469
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:50,292
And a reminder

470
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:53,208
that after what you and Teresa
went through,

471
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:56,382
she still considered you family.

472
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:08,281
The bar is yours again, Chicho.
Just like Teresa wanted.

473
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:11,767
Adios, amigo.

474
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,355
I won't see you again?

475
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:16,110
Don't look for me.

476
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:33,035
What is it?

477
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:37,589
She left me the waterfront property.

478
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:42,720
And all the money
to complete the project.

479
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:52,563
I'm gonna need some help.

480
00:41:58,006 --> 00:42:00,506
We'll build the headquarters
of the P-triple-C.

481
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:02,322
Penthouse maybe.

482
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,946
That's a pretty castle.

483
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:37,900
You know what your castle needs?

484
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:41,273
A little soldier to protect it.

485
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:46,506
Look, I carved this myself.

486
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:49,873
- Gracias.
- De nada.

487
00:42:49,906 --> 00:42:52,906
Mommy, look what that man gave me.

488
00:42:59,306 --> 00:43:01,273
My God!

489
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:14,573
I missed you so much.

490
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:17,659
Look at you.

491
00:43:17,684 --> 00:43:18,881
You left half of you in the States.

492
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:21,805
- You like?
- I don't not like it.

493
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:26,389
Lena baby, this is your papi.

494
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,673
Papi?

495
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:31,139
That's right. I am your papi.

496
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:34,039
And I'm sorry
that I haven't been around.

497
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:38,873
But I will never leave again. I promise.

498
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:51,739
Can you build me a dog for my castle?

499
00:43:52,873 --> 00:43:55,006
I can build you whatever you want.

500
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:57,020
You want to show him?

501
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,273
So a little toy soldier?

502
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:01,839
You were hoping for a boy, still?

503
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,039
Nah.

504
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,906
I love my beautiful daughter.

505
00:44:13,773 --> 00:44:16,239
I have some burritos
inside we can share.

506
00:44:16,273 --> 00:44:18,473
That's so nice.

507
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:20,339
How long has it
been since you had a burrito?

508
00:44:20,373 --> 00:44:23,506
Over four years.

509
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,139
Go play inside.
Okay. Go, go, go.

510
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:32,139
What took you so long?

511
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:43,639
What's going on out here?

512
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,706
It's James.

513
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:55,373
Is Pote with you?

514
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:56,973
No. We need to leave right now.

515
00:44:57,006 --> 00:44:58,706
Okay.

516
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:08,239
Thank you for saving
Kelly Anne, brother.

517
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:10,406
Of course, brother.

518
00:45:11,005 --> 00:45:12,738
Welcome home.

519
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,394
Teresita.

520
00:45:20,145 --> 00:45:21,839
Hola.

521
00:45:21,873 --> 00:45:23,106
You look good.

522
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:25,039
You look different.

523
00:45:25,901 --> 00:45:27,673
Four years.

524
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:31,673
It's better late than never.
Your plan worked, Teresita.

525
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:35,306
You know that Devon is not
just gonna let you walk away.

526
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,273
People don't do that in this business.

527
00:45:37,306 --> 00:45:40,139
It's either prison or death,
the only way out.

528
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:42,125
I'm not going to prison.

529
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,873
Devon's gonna ask James to kill me,

530
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:46,630
and he's gonna say yes.

531
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:49,299
You're gonna disappear?

532
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:53,406
Prison or death. It's the only way.

533
00:45:54,346 --> 00:45:57,049
Orale. What's the plan?

534
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:00,406
Samara's gonna come with us.
She'll be a good witness.

535
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:05,873
Teresa!

536
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:08,806
Get out. Get out!

537
00:46:11,473 --> 00:46:13,439
The officials
in Belize will help sell it.

538
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:15,180
They're gonna get paid

539
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,173
and Devon will get the proof
that he needs.

540
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:36,273
From there, I'll escape by sea.

541
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:39,173
I already bought a boat
along with the captain.

542
00:46:39,206 --> 00:46:41,473
He's been on standby for two years.

543
00:46:41,506 --> 00:46:44,173
You need to take Teresa's ashes
to Mexico

544
00:46:44,206 --> 00:46:45,706
to convince Devon she's dead,

545
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,873
then I'll meet you
and Kelly Anne at Texas.

546
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:49,773
We leave the U.S. from there.

547
00:46:51,106 --> 00:46:53,239
You thought of everything.

548
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:56,305
I'm sorry you missed so much
time with your daughter.

549
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:00,073
If something had to go wrong,
rather be in my end.

550
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:02,939
So Teresa's plan worked, and we're safe.

551
00:47:03,415 --> 00:47:05,106
Only if it's finished.

552
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:06,506
Boaz is dead.

553
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:08,206
What about Marcel and Chicho?

554
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:09,806
They don't suspect a thing.

555
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:10,839
Now...

556
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:13,139
Put me in front of a kitchen.
Put me to work.

557
00:47:13,592 --> 00:47:15,506
Actually,

558
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:17,679
I'm cooking for you tonight.

559
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,306
I know!

560
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:22,073
A lot has changed in four years.

561
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:23,373
You have a daughter,

562
00:47:23,406 --> 00:47:24,973
she's been taking cooking lessons,

563
00:47:25,006 --> 00:47:27,545
and this one surfs.

564
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,973
Well, we're living a quiet life.

565
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,473
You should rest. I'll start on dinner.

566
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:35,939
Will you mírala, mírala?

567
00:47:35,973 --> 00:47:38,206
Just because you know
how to scramble a few eggs

568
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,160
doesn't mean you're gonna
get rid of me again.

569
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:44,673
I'll never make the mistake again, ever.

570
00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:49,539
Finally got her to go to sleep.

571
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:51,406
She was just so excited to see you.

572
00:47:51,439 --> 00:47:53,839
Aww. She's gorgeous.

573
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:55,273
I know.

574
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,573
Is this the widow's soup
that I was trying to learn

575
00:47:57,606 --> 00:47:59,439
when we were in Malta?

576
00:47:59,473 --> 00:48:00,806
It looks good.

577
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,432
Let me see.

578
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:08,673
Gracias.

579
00:48:08,706 --> 00:48:11,006
You got to teach me how to do this.

580
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:12,406
I will.

581
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:13,773
Luckily Teresa took to cooking

582
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:15,246
'cause if it were up to James and I,

583
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:16,382
we probably would have starved.

584
00:48:16,406 --> 00:48:19,173
That's true.

585
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:22,106
You know, I just realized

586
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:25,406
this is the first time that
we have all sat down together

587
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,249
to eat as a family.

588
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,173
We're so happy to have you back.

589
00:48:30,206 --> 00:48:32,339
It's good to be back.

590
00:48:32,373 --> 00:48:34,173
Isn't she beautiful?

591
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,273
Yes, she is.

592
00:48:57,446 --> 00:48:59,072
You okay?

593
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:00,740
Yeah.

594
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:09,239
A toast.

595
00:49:12,878 --> 00:49:15,606
- To a new life.
- To a new life.

596
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:17,106
- Salud.
- Salud.

597
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:27,767
So what do you think?

598
00:49:29,406 --> 00:49:32,373
Not exactly what you expected, right?

599
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:36,473
I wasn't lying when I said
I would be dead in 30 seconds.

600
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,321
That Teresa did die.

601
00:49:39,706 --> 00:49:43,408
But she wasn't murdered
by an enemy or a rival.

602
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,077
She was killed by me,

603
00:49:46,573 --> 00:49:48,830
a money changer from Culiacán,

604
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:52,167
who defied all odds to survive.

605
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:57,547
They said that prison or death
were my only options.

606
00:49:58,473 --> 00:50:00,425
But what do they know?

607
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:03,970
I chose life.

608
00:50:04,305 --> 00:51:04,613
