Queen of the South...

2
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:11,104
You are the kindest,

3
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:12,814
sweetest man I've ever met.

4
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,482
You deliver 30 million,

5
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:15,984
and New Orleans
will have herself

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,652
a new correctional facility.

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:18,987
Marcel isn't answering.

8
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:20,905
We need to find him
before Lafayette does.

9
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,991
Why would the judge
wanna frame Dumas?

10
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:25,285
Good to see you, Marcel.

11
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,245
Lucien, This woman
is a major player.

12
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,997
Together, we got a shot.

13
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,674
I thought I taught you
better than that, boy.

14
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,843
After all these years, you're
just going to topple the judge?

15
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:36,129
You handed over my<i> primo</i> to the.

16
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:37,297
I want his head.

17
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,840
He killed my godson.

18
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,967
If I can wait, so can you.

19
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,511
There's been a second offer
on the waterfront property.

20
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:46,014
The realtor just gave us
48 hours to counter.

21
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,850
Did Epifanio ever work
with anyone in New York?

22
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,769
Someone who could handle
this kind of weight?

23
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:52,145
I can handle the weight.

24
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:53,438
Can you handle the heat

25
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:54,814
that will come down
from the Russians?

26
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:57,317
You jeopardized your business
with my cousin.

27
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:59,600
It's time for me
to meet him face to face.

28
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:04,875
I've seen these tats before.

29
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,786
<i>We got a serious problem,
Teresa the Russians.</i>

30
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,976
Pote, turn around.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,074
-==[ www.OpenSubtitles.com ]==-

32
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:49,744
Gracias, Luis.

33
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,080
How did you find
these men so fast?

34
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:54,374
James. They're ex-Mossad.

35
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:57,335
The Russians have an army.
You do, too, now.

36
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,111
I'm Avi, ma'am.
Follow me, please.

37
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:11,850
I set up 24-hour patrol
on premises.

38
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:14,185
I personally vetted
every man on my staff.

39
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,436
You're in very good hands.

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,105
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

41
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:19,691
Oksana wants to know
what happened in New York.

42
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:22,610
Maybe you should
give her a call.

43
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,121
Silence make people nervous.

44
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,970
Not until I talk to James.

45
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,248
Who are they?

46
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:38,418
Ex-FSB. Russian military.

47
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:42,213
The question is,
who are they working for now?

48
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:45,258
Must be Kostya. Who else?

49
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:46,718
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

50
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:48,261
The agent just called
and wants to know

51
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:50,471
if we're still gonna make a
counteroffer on the waterfront.

52
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:51,806
Have you spoken to the banker?

53
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,808
Yeah, she set up the account,
but we're still

54
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,269
$100 million short
of the down payment.

55
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:58,980
Why doesn't she just give us a
loan for the rest of the money?

56
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,107
Well, 'cause that's not
how money laundering works.

57
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,660
So we send her money, and she
gives it back to us in a loan.

58
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,071
If we want the down payment,
we need to get her the cash.

59
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:09,282
Bankers are<i> banditos.</i>

60
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,826
Yeah.
So, Kostya has already paid us.

61
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,494
If we're not gonna send him
a second shipment,

62
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:14,996
how are we gonna come up
with an extra

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,187
$100 million in one day?

64
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,259
Teresa.

65
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:31,688
You stood Kostya up after
I pushed for your meeting.

66
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,454
<i>Do you know the position
that you put me in?</i>

67
00:03:47,302 --> 00:03:48,529
What is this?

68
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,448
These men came to kill me.

69
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:53,106
Do you recognize them?

70
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:59,499
I can tell
by your silence you do.

71
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:01,000
Teresa, I don't...

72
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,210
Are you coming after me?

73
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,045
I'm sure
there is an explanation.

74
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,881
<i>I don't need an explanation.</i>

75
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:10,415
Tell Kostya we're no longer
in business.

76
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,347
It doesn't make any sense.

77
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,808
Kostya was happy
with the first shipment.

78
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:17,809
Maybe Oksana's
telling the truth.

79
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,728
I mean, she sounds as surprised
as we were.

80
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:22,063
She's either setting you up,

81
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:24,263
or Kostya's making a move
and not telling her.

82
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:27,986
It's George.

83
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,364
Kostya's next load
is on the truck.

84
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:33,825
What do you wanna do, Teresita?

85
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:38,026
You wanna keep it here
or send it to Miami to Boaz?

86
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:42,083
Send it to the Dominicans.

87
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,919
To Kostya's competition?

88
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:48,265
We can't lose the waterfront.

89
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,591
Kostya had his chance.

90
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,719
I'm done playing games.

91
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,762
<i>Orale.</i>

92
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:57,296
We're gonna need more Mossad.

93
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,893
How are you feeling?

94
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:23,800
Not bad, considering.

95
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,135
I want to thank you.

96
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,900
You risked your life
by coming back.

97
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:28,493
You didn't have to.

98
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,496
Yeah, I did.

99
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,911
So, what are your plans?

100
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:42,248
I figured I'd start by checking
out the security system.

101
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:43,917
That's not what I meant.

102
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,390
Are you staying?

103
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,686
Do you want me to stay?

104
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,932
You've done enough.
I can't ask for more.

105
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,837
You didn't ask.
And this is different.

106
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,402
These Russians are animals.

107
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:06,689
Yeah.

108
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,744
You should go.

109
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:17,376
Okay. I'll pack my bag.

110
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,132
Take care of yourself.

111
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,554
You too.

112
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,801
<i>Jefa.</i>

113
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:38,230
We have a problem at the bar.
It's the judge.

114
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:59,084
I'm here for Dumas.

115
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,994
I haven't seen him.

116
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,329
You told me to keep my distance.

117
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,541
Well, I've changed my mind.

118
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:10,670
Dumas trusts you.
You can draw him out.

119
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:13,840
And why would I do that?

120
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,844
You bring me Dumas,

121
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,014
or you'll be the next Mexican
I set on fire.

122
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:29,230
It's time for him to go,
Teresita.

123
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:30,565
Pote's right.

124
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,617
He's reckless.

125
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:35,361
He's gonna try and hurt us
however he can.

126
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:38,123
I have a nice plastic sheet
waiting for him.

127
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,436
Not yet.

128
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,461
First, I want to take away
his power,

129
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:46,915
expose how corrupt he is.

130
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:49,801
Destroy him.

131
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:52,637
Then we kill him.

132
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:53,967
Where are we
on tracking his money?

133
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:57,954
I thought we stopped paying him
after he kidnapped Oksana.

134
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,456
We did.

135
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,889
And then two months ago,
he hit us up for $30 million.

136
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:05,725
He said it was a onetime fee,
but Teresa figured

137
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,819
maybe he needed it
for something specific,

138
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:13,700
so I hid a few traceable
$100 bills in the judge's cash.

139
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:15,994
It's how banks catch robbers.

140
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,808
That's smart.

141
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,075
So we find out
where the money goes,

142
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,244
then we know
who the judge paid off.

143
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,838
We got him by the<i> cojones.</i>

144
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:31,084
I'll call our banker.

145
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,297
I need to talk to Marcel.

146
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:39,017
Make sure he knows
we're on the same side.

147
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:41,761
He's gone underground, Teresita.

148
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:44,013
We haven't been able
to reach him.

149
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,269
I need to get him a message.

150
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:56,276
I know you're in contact
with Marcel.

151
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,538
I would like to speak with him.

152
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:02,657
Are you here for you
or Lafayette?

153
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:03,853
I'm here for me.

154
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,119
But he's pressuring you, right?

155
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:08,454
His boys can't get my people
to rat out Marcel,

156
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:10,498
so you're his proxy.

157
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,959
I'm only here to help him.

158
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:15,053
You gave up
your own man to the judge.

159
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,866
They burned him alive.

160
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,341
How do I know you won't do
the same to Marcel?

161
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,135
You better
watch yourself,<i> cabrón.</i>

162
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,851
Marcel grew up at my knee.

163
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,477
I taught him everything
that he knows,

164
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:34,647
but when you started
whispering in his ear,

165
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,649
he forgot his own history.

166
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:39,722
He was tired of being
under Lafayette's thumb.

167
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,530
Lafayette always wins
in this town.

168
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:45,491
Which is why you are here.

169
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:48,086
And Marcel is not.

170
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:50,663
If I didn't know better,

171
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,071
I'd think you're calling me
an Uncle Tom.

172
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,971
Please give him my message.

173
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,009
Thank you.

174
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,542
Where you going,<i> cabrón?</i>

175
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:39,554
I got places to be, Pote.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,595
First, you have
a tequila with me.

177
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:51,483
I never thanked you
for sparing Kelly Anne.

178
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:57,467
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

179
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,699
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

180
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,501
Teresa must have been pissed
we disobeyed her order.

181
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:12,453
I took some heat.

182
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,249
But some<i> sicarios</i>
came after Tony.

183
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:17,583
You're kidding.

184
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,492
Long story,
but Kelly Anne saved his life.

185
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,161
So Teresa let her stay.

186
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,520
And then what happened to him?

187
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:31,931
I dropped my guard.

188
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,934
Thought that we can be
like normal people.

189
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:41,844
Sorry. You two were close.

190
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:47,539
Tony became like a son to me.

191
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:50,125
He was a good boy.

192
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:58,791
But this world
is not for a child.

193
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,760
They make you weak
and vulnerable.

194
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,966
And I promise you, never again.

195
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,728
After I lost Tony,
everything changed.

196
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,518
So, what you gonna do now?

197
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:19,571
Just get lost for a while.

198
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,814
Get these hands clean, you know?

199
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,155
You risked your life to be here,

200
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,200
and you're gonna leave
just like that?

201
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:38,901
She doesn't want me to stay.

202
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:43,094
She might not want you
to stay,<i> cabrón,</i>

203
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:46,598
but she needs you.

204
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:16,869
Man, all done, Shorty.
How's school going, man?

205
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,079
- Good.
- Yeah?

206
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,580
- Getting them good grades?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:20,657
Good man, good man.

208
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,134
Hey!

209
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,809
Hey Shorty, this is Frankie.

210
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:33,623
I started cutting his hair
when he was about your size.

211
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,625
And now he's on the dean's list
at Rutgers.

212
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,627
- Cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

213
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,393
Study hard.
You could be like him.

214
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,653
Now get on home, man.

215
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:43,905
- Thanks, man.
- Straight home.

216
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,900
Now jump in the chair.

217
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,046
Let me tighten you up
for the ladies.

218
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,414
I don't know who
you've been seeing, bro,

219
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,810
but ain't doing you right, man.

220
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,500
It's an embarrassment, man.

221
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,579
<i>Polanco.</i>

222
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:00,891
Yeah, everything is set
with the banker.

223
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:03,291
Good. You'll get the truck soon.

224
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:07,795
Listen, we could have problems
with the Russians.

225
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,159
Hey, you let me worry
about that, okay?

226
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,301
You just keep
those trucks coming.

227
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:15,761
We'll talk soon.

228
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,972
Now that Polanco's on board,

229
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:21,526
we have the extra cash to
make enough for the waterfront.

230
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,439
Yeah.

231
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:47,218
Your mother.

232
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:58,374
Welcome to New Orleans, boss.

233
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,140
You're hard to find, Bogdan.

234
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,975
We've been working.

235
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,403
Kostya sent us to watch
the Mexican woman.

236
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,908
<i>Da,</i> a week ago.

237
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:13,161
You on vacation, Bogdan?

238
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,490
Getting shit-faced
on Kostya's time?

239
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,756
Relax, Bogdan.

240
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:27,091
It's good you're still in town.

241
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:29,502
We have a problem
with our Mexican friend.

242
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,407
What kind of problem?

243
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,744
She's selling to Dominicans.

244
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,509
Kostya wants blood.

245
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,128
So, our banker came through?

246
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:49,355
I had to twist her arm
a little bit, but yeah,

247
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:51,023
she found our guy.

248
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,192
His name is Gordon Wheeler,
and he's the chairman

249
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:55,569
of a dozen prisons
scattered throughout the South.

250
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:58,864
Why would Wheeler launder
30 mil for Lafayette?

251
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:01,771
He's not laundering it.
He's investing it.

252
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,940
Lafayette sends people
to prison.

253
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,608
Why not his own?

254
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,417
Yeah, state pays up to 60,000
per inmate a year.

255
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:11,135
That can't be legal.

256
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:12,448
It's not.

257
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,786
You need to find Wheeler
and get the proof.

258
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,477
That's how we finish him.

259
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:21,479
Okay.

260
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:24,816
Thank you.

261
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:30,104
What is it?

262
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:34,784
I called Miami.
Boaz hasn't shown.

263
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,905
- You want me to find him?
- No.

264
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,668
I'll deal with Boaz.
Stay on Lafayette.

265
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:45,336
<i>Orale.</i>

266
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,090
Tequila.

267
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,392
Here you go.

268
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,676
Teresa protected that Russian
bitch over her own blood.

269
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,074
She gave Javier to that judge...

270
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,582
Not to mention
you do all the work.

271
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:37,096
I don't need you all up
in my ear with that shit.

272
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,944
I guess if you won't do it...

273
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,525
You ain't gonna do shit.

274
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,744
Teresa may be the boss
of this cartel,

275
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,122
but I'm still
the boss of this family.

276
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:15,209
Now, if you move this camera
20 degrees,

277
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:16,669
you'll cover all lines of fire.

278
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,546
Okay, I'll take care of it.

279
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,506
You're still here?

280
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,216
Yeah.

281
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:23,434
I decided to have a look

282
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:26,345
at your security system
before I take off.

283
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,264
Thank you.

284
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:33,194
It's Oksana.

285
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:35,187
Yes?

286
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:38,427
I'm in New Orleans.

287
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,077
I have something to show you.
It'll explain everything.

288
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,413
<i>Text you the address.</i>

289
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,772
She wants to meet in a motel

290
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,204
in the Ninth Ward.

291
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:54,110
You know what I think.

292
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,083
I want to hear
what she has to say.

293
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,345
Fine. But do it my way.

294
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:02,306
Okay.

295
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:18,063
Hey.

296
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,066
We're locked down.
There's no surprises.

297
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:24,403
Except what's behind that door.

298
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,248
It is fine. He's been paid.

299
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:32,837
Why are we here?

300
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:34,413
When the judge kidnapped me,

301
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:37,653
Kostya knew nothing about you.

302
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:42,755
He wasn't sure
you would save my life.

303
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:46,684
He sent his men to New Orleans
in case they had to intervene.

304
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,854
But there was something
about them that he didn't know.

305
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,647
What?

306
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:56,338
These men were traitors,

307
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,604
plotting against my cousin.

308
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:02,608
Once you saved me,
they targeted you.

309
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,346
They knew that losing
your cocaine

310
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,746
would make Kostya vulnerable.

311
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,865
You didn't answer my question.

312
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,217
Back up.

313
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:26,307
Christ.

314
00:20:32,923 --> 00:20:34,014
Thanks to you, Teresa,

315
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:37,068
we found the cancer
in my family.

316
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:39,320
And removed it.

317
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,699
What the hell was that?

318
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,722
Dimitri was the last traitor

319
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:51,393
in the sleeper cell
that betrayed Kostya.

320
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,659
My cousin is sorry, Teresa.

321
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:56,254
He put you in the middle
of family conflict,

322
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,541
and he will do whatever
it takes to make amends.

323
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,544
Forget it. We're done here.

324
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,879
You need to buy
an extra shipment.

325
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:25,702
The Russians love
psychological warfare.

326
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,401
They spread chaos
to confuse you,

327
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:28,614
to take you eye off of matters.

328
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:31,196
Killing her men in front
of you, it's just a mind game.

329
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,936
That's why we're selling
to the Dominicans.

330
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,604
I want to make sure
we're covered

331
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,411
if we can't trust the Russians.

332
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:38,746
You think she's lying to you?

333
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:40,247
I don't know.

334
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:43,250
But we need to continue
our business until we find out.

335
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,448
Oscar.

336
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,972
<i>The Russians shot up my shop.</i>

337
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,307
They hit two of my men.

338
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,453
<i>- When?</i>
- I don't know when!

339
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,385
I want them dead, okay?

340
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,628
<i>Coney Island, Little Odessa,
you name it.</i>

341
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,297
You're playing into his hands.

342
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,896
Good, good, 'cause he's getting
what's coming to him.

343
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:06,899
Hitting them back
will cost you even more.

344
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:09,660
I'm coming to New York.
I'll fix this.

345
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:29,463
Kostya started a war
with the Dominicans.

346
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,140
Yes.

347
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:42,976
Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

348
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:45,863
Thank you so much
for meeting with me.

349
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,273
I got your number
from Cecil Lafayette.

350
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,775
It's Gordon.

351
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:52,787
Any friend of the judge's
is a friend of mine.

352
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,196
If I remember our call,

353
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,032
your client is interested
in a discreet investment.

354
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,463
She is.

355
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:13,632
Though you're already
in business with her.

356
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,394
You took 30 million
of her money from the judge

357
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,303
to build your prison
by the rail yards.

358
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:19,304
Come again?

359
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,140
So, we'll pay you
30 million more to help us

360
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:23,183
expose the judge's corruption.

361
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,405
In cash or wired offshore,
whichever you prefer.

362
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:30,190
You're either the dumbest Fed
I've ever met

363
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:32,743
or the ballsiest woman
on the planet.

364
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,029
Well, I'm not a Fed.

365
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:38,249
Well, either way,
we're done here.

366
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:39,486
Okay, just real quick,

367
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,412
how do you think Lafayette
got $30 million in a day?

368
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,069
What kind of people do you think

369
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:51,545
have access
to that kind of cash?

370
00:23:51,622 --> 00:23:53,547
We don't want you, Gordon.

371
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:55,215
We want Lafayette.

372
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:58,343
All we need is proof
of his involvement

373
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,349
and, like, a land title
or articles of incorporation.

374
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,778
I heard you out,
so now you hear me.

375
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:10,092
You can tell whoever it is
that you work for

376
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,783
to stick their money
up their ass.

377
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,119
Ronnie, get in here.

378
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,602
Last chance, Gordon.

379
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,744
I'd take the money.

380
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,037
Go to hell.

381
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,964
Wrong answer,<i> cabrón.</i>

382
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:35,784
Morning,<i> jefa.</i>
Your jet is ready.

383
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:40,478
Thank you, Chicho.

384
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:41,419
I'm gonna come with you.

385
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:44,293
Pote's not here.
You need some security.

386
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,128
You're still hurt.

387
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:51,146
I'm a quick healer,
and I'm already packed.

388
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:59,446
Talk,<i> cabrón.</i>

389
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:00,614
Talk!

390
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:07,649
That old bird is tough.

391
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,791
Maybe he's more afraid
of the judge than he is of us.

392
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,488
His mistake.

393
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,990
You dumb bitch.

394
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,658
You don't know
who you're messing with.

395
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,995
No? Who?

396
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,333
He knows the head
of the FBI, the DEA.

397
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,398
Which means your ass is toast,
mother...

398
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,436
Where are your friends now,
<i>cabrón?</i>

399
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:38,610
Kelly Anne, you okay?

400
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,113
Yeah, I'm okay.

401
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:43,615
Maybe you should go outside
and get some air.

402
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:45,918
I'm fine. Keep going.

403
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:51,423
You heard the lady. Talk.

404
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:58,033
The next one is
in your skull,<i> cabrón.</i>

405
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,967
Zip drive in my safe.
47, 19, 66.

406
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:41,340
Teresa.

407
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,601
I assume you want to discuss
the situation

408
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:45,344
with the Dominicans.

409
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,888
I made Kostya no promises.

410
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:50,182
I can sell to whoever I want.

411
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:53,088
Of course.
But now, this is turf war.

412
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,688
War's expensive for everyone.

413
00:26:56,723 --> 00:26:59,617
Then what if you sold
exclusively to us?

414
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:02,598
Say, 30,000 a kilo?

415
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,288
No.

416
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:06,435
You've already made that offer
to Kostya.

417
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:10,869
We only get to stay in business
if there is no war.

418
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:13,205
If Kostya kills
another Dominican,

419
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,749
I will only supply Polanco.

420
00:27:15,826 --> 00:27:17,250
He's my cousin.

421
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:19,378
That would definitely mean war.

422
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:21,421
Then there will be a war.

423
00:27:21,498 --> 00:27:24,925
But if he wants to hear my plan,

424
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,219
he should come
to my hotel tonight.

425
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:33,934
Why didn't you ask
for my advice, Teresa?

426
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,395
We could have prevented
this mess.

427
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,301
Because I don't need
your advice.

428
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,992
And I know how to run
my business.

429
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,455
Let me know.

430
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:52,586
<i>Gracias,</i> Chicho.

431
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:04,923
Who are these boys?

432
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,426
Boys the judge sent to juvie.

433
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,520
We paid him 5 grand a case.

434
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:12,334
State paid us $45,000 a year
to lock them up.

435
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,433
He gave them maximum sentences.

436
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:18,696
Yeah, so you can make
maximum money.

437
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:20,981
Y'all have been doing this
for decades.

438
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:24,985
So you and Lafayette have
made millions off these kids.

439
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:28,447
They're no angels.

440
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:32,951
They're poor.
They never had a chance.

441
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:36,997
I didn't make the system.

442
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:39,361
But you got rich out of it!

443
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,168
You said
you only want the judge.

444
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:43,554
I changed my mind,<i> pendejo.</i>
I'll see you in hell!

445
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:59,186
You think Oksana will call?

446
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:04,241
If she doesn't, Polanco will
go to war with Kostya.

447
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:07,486
Why didn't you accept his offer?

448
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:10,822
You get the money you need,
avoid a war you can't win.

449
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,365
We need competition.

450
00:29:12,442 --> 00:29:15,535
Kostya wants to be
my only customer.

451
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:18,663
It gives him leverage.
He can set his own price.

452
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,374
That's why you're selling
to Polanco.

453
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:25,212
With the Dominicans,
we have a free market.

454
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:27,389
Pote warned me that you changed.

455
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:33,845
It's the only way
to survive in this life.

456
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,315
Amen.

457
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:40,444
Is that why you're pushing hard
for New York?

458
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:43,855
You already supply Phoenix,
New Orleans, Atlanta, Miami.

459
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,427
Isn't that enough money?

460
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,026
It's not about the money.

461
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:49,953
It's what money can buy. Safety.

462
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,600
But you're not safer now.

463
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,791
You're in business
with Russian psychopaths.

464
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:57,118
When have I not been
in business with psychopaths?

465
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,299
Right.

466
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:07,212
Selling to the Dominicans
and the Russians

467
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:10,808
will double the profit
and cut the time line in half.

468
00:30:10,884 --> 00:30:13,051
Your waterfront project.

469
00:30:13,086 --> 00:30:15,887
It'll bring jobs to New Orleans,

470
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:17,889
which means political support.

471
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:22,435
Once we start, we can borrow
against it, get investors.

472
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:24,104
You wanna go legit.

473
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,773
You think I'm crazy.

474
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,826
Smart.

475
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:31,236
That's the only way
to get to a place

476
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:34,873
where people can't touch you.

477
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:40,245
Or who you love.

478
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:43,790
You deserve that.

479
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:08,574
He's on his way.

480
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,499
Where is Kostya?

481
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:28,376
Are you kidding me with this,
Teresa?

482
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:34,299
This is not
how he does business.

483
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:36,843
But he will be with us.

484
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:54,694
We're here because I have
the best product,

485
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:57,864
and you control
the world's largest market.

486
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:02,160
Together we can control
the supply and the demand,

487
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:05,205
which means we can set the price

488
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:07,736
and double our business.

489
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,238
But a war will kill everything.

490
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,803
So I have a proposal.

491
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,603
Thank you.

492
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,514
As you know, these are
the five boroughs of New York.

493
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,276
We will divide the city
and make clear boundaries.

494
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:28,256
Kostya will keep Brooklyn

495
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,230
and the lowest part
of Manhattan.

496
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:31,990
Everything below 14th Street.

497
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,744
They get the Village,
SoHo, and Wall Street?

498
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:40,240
You'll get the micro markets
in Midtown,

499
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:42,125
the nightclubs
in Hell's Kitchen,

500
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,035
and the hotels in Times Square,

501
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:47,275
plus the rest of Manhattan
and the Bronx.

502
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,375
Whoa, that's 2/3 of New York.

503
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,712
- We get Queens, yes?
- No, you split it.

504
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,548
Polanco gets LaGuardia,
Kostya gets JFK.

505
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,924
That is not equal, Teresa.

506
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,103
I don't think I agree with that.

507
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,310
Both of you will charge

508
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:02,457
the same price per kilo.

509
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,724
And if either of you
undercuts the price

510
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,393
or sells in territory
that isn't theirs,

511
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:10,729
I'll cut them off.

512
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:13,064
Fine.

513
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:16,067
But I demand that Kostya
compensates me for my men.

514
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:20,475
You demand?
You don't demand anything here.

515
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,575
For the ones he murdered
and their families.

516
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,245
- Then we have no deal.
- Then I will compensate him

517
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:30,340
by sending his
first shipment for free.

518
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:38,631
And if Kostya kills
more of his people,

519
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:41,760
I'll send<i> sicarios</i> to New York.

520
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:45,313
- Teresa.
- These are the terms.

521
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:49,601
We can double our business,

522
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:52,103
or we can go to war.

523
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,538
That's Kostya.

524
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:07,619
He agrees to the deal.

525
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,135
If you ever change
your mind about them,

526
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:28,139
your coke and my muscle

527
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:31,359
will make us
the gods of New York.

528
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:33,987
We'll talk soon.

529
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:53,826
It's clean.

530
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:58,378
I'm sorry about Wheeler,
Kelly Anne.

531
00:34:58,454 --> 00:35:00,555
I lost my temper.

532
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:07,354
I saw those boys,
and I thought of Tony.

533
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:12,183
Yeah.

534
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,757
All those lives he destroyed.

535
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:19,691
Man like that has it coming.

536
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:21,429
You're not upset?

537
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,037
No.

538
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:28,625
I'm pregnant.

539
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:44,549
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

540
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:47,686
- How long?
- A few weeks.

541
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:52,765
I took a pregnancy test
this morning.

542
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:56,778
I took five of them, actually.

543
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,787
You have something on your face.

544
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,169
Is this blood?

545
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,415
We're gonna be parents?

546
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:30,645
The Sun is coming up now.

547
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,974
We better go.

548
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:37,769
I still have a few more hours
to finish the job.

549
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:39,270
I'll drop you off at the house.

550
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:41,198
No.

551
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:44,034
I've come this far.

552
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,652
Are you sure?

553
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:00,959
<i>Orale.</i> Let's go.

554
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:03,127
Okay.

555
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,987
Can I have a drag?

556
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,161
I want you to stay.

557
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:44,335
I'd like that.

558
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:48,890
But you and me...
It can't happen.

559
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,647
Maybe in some other life,
but not this one.

560
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:02,687
I hope you understand.

561
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:28,079
Hey, we won the bid.

562
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,140
I'm just working
on the contracts.

563
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:32,954
Now we only need 900 million
more to pay for it.

564
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,054
Well, we're on target after you
closed that deal in New York.

565
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,733
Now, there's another risk
you have to consider.

566
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:39,599
This is a public transaction.

567
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:42,101
How?
We're using shell corporations.

568
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:43,987
Well, of course,
but it means you're gonna own

569
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,633
a big old chunk
of the Mississippi River,

570
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,940
and the cat's
gonna get out of the bag.

571
00:38:48,017 --> 00:38:49,776
It'll bring attention
to your business.

572
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:51,736
So, last chance
before the ink dries.

573
00:38:51,771 --> 00:38:53,141
You wanna back out,
or you wanna pull the trigger?

574
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,614
Do it.

575
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,450
- Okay.
- He's here.

576
00:38:57,527 --> 00:38:59,410
You sure you wanna do this now?

577
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,173
We don't know where the judge
has stashed the kickbacks

578
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:04,749
from Wheeler, so we don't
exactly have a smoking gun yet.

579
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:08,669
He doesn't know that. Let's go.

580
00:39:13,501 --> 00:39:14,801
Where's Dumas?

581
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:17,136
I have something else.

582
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:19,806
This draft contains a database

583
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:22,100
that's been tracking
the millions in kickbacks

584
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:23,768
you've been getting from sending

585
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:27,530
over 2,000 boys of color
to jail.

586
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:29,482
Knowing, obviously,
if they go to juvie,

587
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,014
they're twice as likely to
end up in prison as an adult.

588
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:36,517
Your new prison.

589
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,708
And they say crime doesn't pay.

590
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:41,786
Interesting theory.

591
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:43,880
But you can't prove any of that.

592
00:39:43,957 --> 00:39:47,458
Your partner, Gordon Wheeler,

593
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:50,220
kept very detailed records.

594
00:39:50,296 --> 00:39:55,800
Names and court dates
and dollar amounts

595
00:39:55,835 --> 00:40:00,513
and well, we have them.

596
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,518
What do you want?

597
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:07,882
A press conference.

598
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,190
You're going to clear Dumas
for the murder of your son.

599
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:13,054
And if I don't comply?

600
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:18,656
We'll go to the press
and the FBI.

601
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:20,825
After that, I suppose
you want me to resign.

602
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,662
No. You work for me now.

603
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:27,902
When I call,
you answer on the second ring.

604
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,877
You do exactly what I say,

605
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:33,763
or I'll destroy
the only thing you have left.

606
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,757
Your family's name.

607
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,333
Thank you.

608
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:06,370
We've said all there is
to say, Ms. Mendoza.

609
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:08,276
I have a message for Marcel.

610
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,750
Lafayette has been
taken care of.

611
00:41:10,826 --> 00:41:12,919
Really? How's that?

612
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:15,283
He's going to say
he made a mistake.

613
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:18,475
He'll clear Marcel's name.

614
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,885
I'll believe that when I see it.

615
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:23,721
Watch the news tomorrow morning
and let him know.

616
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:34,065
The press conference will be
at my office at 8:00 a.m.

617
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,609
I'll explain everything then.

618
00:41:40,356 --> 00:41:41,356
What the hell?

619
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:44,784
Get in. Now.

620
00:41:45,305 --> 00:42:45,476
