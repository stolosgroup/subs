You need to look inside yourself

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,635
and figure out what kind
of man you want to be.

4

'Cause lately, what you've
been, it needs fixing.

Where did you get that?

6
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:12,536
What matters is that we might
be able to save Coulson

7
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,773
by combining that
with my mom's DNA.

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,375
This is my ship.
S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't welcome here.

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,512
- We're here to rescue you.
- Rescue me?

10
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:23,247
I'm the one that's gonna save us.

Your mind will clear shortly.

22
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:22,389
- Where am I?
- A neutral location,

23
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:24,792
perched near
the edge of the galaxy ...

24
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:27,594
safe, I assure you.

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,597
Allow me to introduce myself.

I am the firstborn Taryan,

master of the house Kasius.

00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:41,275
- Kasius?
- Please, just hear me out.

29
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:46,330
You are Inhuman.

30
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:49,433
I always knew the tales
of the experiments were true.

31
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:52,269
Okay, for the record, we don't
love to be called experiments,

32
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:53,303
just moving forward.

33
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:57,274
No, I imagine your people
treated you unkindly.

34
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:00,277
- I've worked through it.
- You deserve better.

35
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:04,481
All Inhumans do ...
something better elsewhere.

36
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,152
Where are my friends ...
May, Coulson?

37
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:14,358
You mustn't worry about them.
They are your past.

38
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:16,927
I am your future.

39
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,330
You are now prisoners of war.

40
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:23,403
I suggest you use your time to consider

41
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,637
- the disrespect you've shown me.
- Suggest all you want.

42
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:29,957
Your just the villain of the month,
and you're going down,

43
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,375
just like all the rest.

44
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,945
And how do you plan to stop me?

45
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:37,381
With Earth weapons?

46
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:45,889
The tools of cowards.
We Remorath earn our kills.

47
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:48,792
That is how we earn our rank.

48
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:52,329
With humans,
it's not about earned power.

49
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:54,364
It's about the gun.

50
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:58,702
It allows the weak
to pretend to be strong.

51
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,907
I don't need a gun to stop you.

52
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,710
I have several Ionizer Missiles

53
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:09,212
aimed at
your Lighthouse right now.

54
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:14,518
If you or your people do anything,
I will release them.

55
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:17,865
Since you like weapons so much.

56
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:25,762
Will they be held indefinitely
or scrapped?

57
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:29,366
That depends on whether
or not they push you to it.

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,937
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

59
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,340
We are both
about to get everything we need.

60
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,710
All I need is Gravitonium.

61
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,512
Oh, I know someone who
may be able to help us out.

62
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:45,005
<i>It's all a bit
unpleasant, isn't it?</i>

63
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:50,587
Oh, try not to think about it.

64
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,024
- Do you think it will work?
- Daisy's plan? I don't know.

65
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:56,727
Frankly, the Centipede serum
is terrifying to me.

66
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:59,730
Yeah, let's ... let's ...
let's walk through

67
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,399
- the simulation one more time.
- Yeah.

68
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:07,738
The Centipede serum
forces new cellular pathways,

69
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:09,539
like biological infrastructure.

70
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:12,609
In doing so, it can also
carry any element we feed it.

71
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,745
For example, giant's healing DNA,

72
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:19,583
which we could deliver to, say,
Coulson's ailing cells.

73
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:24,421
- Should work. It's just...
- What Yo-Yo said ... the danger.

74
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:28,492
- Yeah.
- Well, I've been thinking about that,

75
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:31,495
and her warning was that

76
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:35,332
trying to save Coulson
ends the world, right?

77
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:39,836
But what if ... what if ...
what if we don't just try?

78
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:43,340
What happens if we actually succeed?

79
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:46,409
Jemma, what if there's
another way to frame this?

80
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:50,113
Coulson wasn't there in the future.

81
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,448
You're saying we break the loop

82
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,851
not by allowing someone to die
but by making sure they live?

83
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:58,288
What if all we have to do
is not fail?

84
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,157
That's quite an audacious leap,

85
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:04,361
especially from someone who once
believed time cannot be changed.

86
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:09,266
Maybe it's time to be audacious.

87
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:17,607
You got to be kidding me.
That is totally nuts.

88
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:19,876
No, no joke.
It really happened.

89
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:22,979
Good thing, too, otherwise,
Aida would've killed me.

90
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:24,881
I've had to hear this story enough.

91
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,517
Yeah, but that's the most
incredible story I've ever heard,

92
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:29,186
and I'm the same age
as my grandparents.

93
00:05:29,187 --> 00:05:30,754
I'm done, by the way.

94
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:34,357
All right,
oxygen's been re-routed

95
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:36,059
from non-essential parts of the plane.

96
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,394
Oh, then I guess
we can breathe easy, right,

97
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:41,761
wait for the stalwart team to get back?

98
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,735
Did you hear that?

99
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,982
Damn.

100
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:19,502
I've spent some time on this plane.
Quinjet is this way.

101
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:36,419
Okay, come on.
How do I get this thing working?

102
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:38,855
_

103
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,457
The warnings were right.

<i>Zephyr to Lighthouse.</i>

105
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,560
<i>Mack, anyone.
Mack, are you there?</i>

106
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:45,595
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

107
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:46,730
Talk to me.
What's going on?

108
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,565
<i>Uh, things have gone a little crazy.</i>

109
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,299
Yeah, I know.
It's all over the news.

110
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:52,769
N-No, Talbot.
It's ... He ... He's ... He's boarded us ...

111
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,471
him and his new Remorath friends.

112
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,839
<i>Talbot.
Did he see you?</i>

113
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,775
No, and that's a good thing.
Agent Kim wasn't so lucky.

114
00:06:58,809 --> 00:06:59,976
Talbot killed Kim.

115
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:01,478
<i>Very, very much.</i>

116
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,446
The General's not
on our side anymore, okay?

117
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:07,517
He ...
Oh, no.

118
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:15,625
Stand down.
I don't need the jet so I can fly.

119
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,662
I need it so I can breathe.

120
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:32,607
He's leaving.
And I think he's coming down to you.

121

~ Addic7ed.com ~ </font></i>

122
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:41,493
I don't understand.
If he's flying the Quinjet,

123
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,562
I should be reading
its signature somewhere.

124
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,998
Not if he's figured out a way
to go dark.

125
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,234
If he's not relying
on the Quinjet's own power,

126
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,236
- then that means ...
- Then the signature wouldn't show up.

127
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,407
Okay...
What if I force it by remote?

128
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,445
- You can do that?
- Oh, I can do many things.

129
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,416
If we can find Talbot,
maybe we can talk him down

130
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,451
and end this
before anyone else gets hurt.

131
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,888
Yes. Maybe.

132
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:16,494
Prison cells are all the same, no
matter what species builds them.

133
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:20,432
If there's a way in...
there's got to be a way out.

134
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,635
So, we're just not
gonna talk about him?

135
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,139
- "Him" who?
- Phil, come on. Talbot.

136
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,644
- Oh. That "him."
- Look, I hate it, too,

137
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,480
but I've seen a man
go rotten overnight.

138
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,581
He might be lost.

139
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,583
You don't have to feel like
you're responsible.

140
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,686
Of course I do.
After all our ups and downs,

141
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,654
Talbot got shot in the head,

142
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,990
and he waited for us
to rescue him from Hale.

143
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,026
- We were a little busy.
- Yes, but even after we didn't come,

144
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,096
even after
Hydra messed with his brain,

145
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,965
he still put himself in that machine.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,302
- He did that for us.
- We didn't ask him to.

147
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,134
We didn't have to.

148
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:07,345
- What?
- The first time we met him.

149
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,482
When he told us about
the peacekeeping force

150
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,950
he was sending to the Hub?

151
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,752
I mean, imagine back then
if someone had told us

152
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,531
that someday we'd be worried
about Glenn Talbot.

153
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:22,694
I know.
But things evolve.

154
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:27,532
They change.
People change.

155
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,968
Yeah, they do.

156
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,671
And sometimes, even then,
you can't save them.

157
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,642
But you still have to try.

158
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:47,485
Back to work.

159
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,236
- Mr. Creel.
- General...

160
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,338
How you feeling?

161
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:13,978
- What are you wearing?
- Well... choices were limited.

162
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,749
It's the new me, but I'm here
to talk about the new you.

163
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,586
It's all right, soldier.
Relax.

164
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,357
You've been through a lot.
It's good to see you, Carl.

165
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:31,729
- It's good to see you, too, sir.
- I know what it's like.

166
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,765
You're trapped in this hospital bed,

167
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,770
- noggin's not working right.
- I know you do, sir.

168
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,574
But I also got through it,

169
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,577
and I can help you.

170
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,780
The two of us are stronger together.

171
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:56,454
General, you seem...
You all right?

172
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,859
Right as rain.
Never felt better.

173
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:09,267
I did come in contact
with Gravitonium,

174
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,971
- just like you.
- No.

175
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,939
It's okay.
It's all right.

176
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,208
Soldier, I'm fine.

177
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,046
As a matter of fact,
I've learned a few things.

178
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,782
Do you still hear the voices?

179
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,724
What if I told you
I know how to control them,

180
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:37,595
silence them?
I can silence them for you, too.

181
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,800
You are formidable,

182
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,303
but your strength
has been going to waste.

183
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,304
Come with me,

184
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,841
and I can show you
how to unleash your power.

185
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,944
- As your weapon.
- As my disciple.

186
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,848
Oh, God. What is with your
family and this God complex?

187
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,484
- What do you know of my family?
- Plenty.

188
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,653
Well, then you know

189
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,088
that I am from a long line
of inventive thinkers.

190
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:08,660
I have ideas, methods,
which don't, shall we say,

191
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,664
- mesh with those of my breed.
- That's not completely chilling.

192
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:17,468
I'm merely saying that
I understand what it is

193
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:22,140
to be on the outside,
as I'm sure you are ...

194
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,711
different,
hunted by lesser humans.

195
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,680
You deserve better than that.

196
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,883
Look, yeah, some people
have given me a hard time.

197
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,385
Humans are ...
are complicated.

198
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,388
They disagree.
Sometimes it comes to blows.

199
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,524
Only, sometimes, it's a person

200
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,360
who risks everything
for their friends

201
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,531
even though she lost her limbs.
Hypothetically.

202
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,901
We fight, okay,
but not with a lack of respect,

203
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,070
and that's something I don't
think you're quite understanding.

204
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:57,475
Oh, no matter. You will come
with me, willingly or not.

205
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,677
I'm gonna have to choose "not."

206
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,184
Problem?

207
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,921
What is this?

208
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:14,592
- Why can't I...
- Because you're not conscious yet.

209
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,529
- Not conscious?
- I'm not a fool.

210
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,133
I know how strong you are,
and I have to make sure

211
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,104
that you are thoroughly broken in

212
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,506
before you're brought to me.

213
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,287
Fitz, it's done.

214
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:47,125
- This could change everything.
- Change everything about what?

215
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,261
Uh... Daisy asked us
to run some tests.

216
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,463
Looking for a way to revive
Coulson's necrotic tissue.

217
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,019
Jemma thinks it could work.

218
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,936
Oh, okay, that's...
that's good to know.

219
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:03,207
- That's really good.
- What do you need, Mack?

220
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,980
It's Talbot. The Gravitonium
is becoming a problem.

221
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,882
He's racking up a body count.

222
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,430
- No...
- Yeah. There must be something

223
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:16,454
you can do to reverse the machine.

224
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,756
Something else that needs fixing?

225
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,294
Right now, Talbot's out there.
He's dangerous.

226
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,830
If there's a solution,
we need it fast, okay?

227
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,832
Or none of this matters.

228
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:32,904
- Okay, we're on it.
- Thank you.

229
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,011
He and I will work it out.

230
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,513
There.

231
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,484
Circuit panel.
Good.

232
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,686
Remorath tech
wasn't exactly my major,

233
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,789
but let's assume the circuitry
still creates an electric field.

234
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,524
I use the charge from my arm,

235
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,327
- maybe I can short it out.
- And the door opens.

236
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,030
- That's the theory.
- At this point, I'll take theory.

237
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,499
I mean, we still have to
face the guard outside,

238
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,335
but we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

239
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,474
Hey, guys.

240
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,711
You ever notice these schmucks
are really hard to beat up.

241
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,881
- We're glad to see you.
- Yeah, likewise.

242
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,050
We just had a tiny adventure
with Talbot

243
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,319
and ended with a man down.
I figured I'd better start looking

244
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,989
- for you on the prison level.
- Good thinking.

245
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:27,325
Where's Daisy?
She's not here?

246
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,894
No. Qovas handed her
off to his warriors.

247
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,229
We got to find her next.

248
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,967
- You see where Talbot went?
- Sort of. You're not gonna like it.

249
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,338
These voices...

250
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,007
I thought I was stuck with them.

251
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,911
You don't have to be.

252
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,048
Let me help you.

253
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,091
- You have it in you. I ...
- It's okay, son.

254
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,895
I'm telling you the truth.

255
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,097
This will make everything better.

256
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,837
Join me.

257
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,929
What do you feel?

258
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:45,470
Peace.
So much quieter.

259
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,905
Wait...

260
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,707
This part isn't gonna be great
for you, Carl...

261
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:51,576
- No!
- ...but it will be over quickly.

262
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,712
I promise. The two of
us are stronger than one,

263
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:59,317
and your suffering,
it's over now.

264
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,993
Thank you, Carl.

265
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,756
<i>Thank you, Carl.</i>

266
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,924
So, he can do that.

267
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,861
He must've gotten Creel's location
from the Quinjet's flight log.

268
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,996
We knew Talbot was killing people,

269
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,199
but to see him do that
to Creel, I just...

270
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,039
- I ever tell you about Isabelle Hartley?
- Yeah, a little.

271
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,742
- I know she was your friend.
- Mm.

272
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:45,613
- I know Creel killed her.
- Yeah.

273
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,850
I wanted him dead.
I thought I'd never forgive him,

274
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:55,856
but once he was deprogrammed,
and once I got to know him,

275
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,125
he was a decent man.

276
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,097
- I'm glad I had the chance.
- I'm sure he was, too.

277
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,769
You have an amazing capacity
to forgive people, Mack.

278
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:13,240
Yeah...

279
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:16,243
But the bodies are still
piling up, aren't they?

280
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:20,781
- He has to be stopped no matter what.
- Yes. Maybe for good.

281
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:26,454
If it comes to that,
I'm the one who does it.

282
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,489
Understood?

283
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:39,233
Our Astralscope projects
your consciousness here.

284
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:43,170
Physically,
you're being brought to me,

285
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,174
but rest assured,
you are already mine.

286
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,176
You know
I have a little experience

287
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,747
- getting out of stuff like this, right?
- I'm afraid this is different.

288
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:55,816
You already lost all sense

289
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:59,420
of how long you've been here,
haven't you?

290
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:04,959
I find that people outside of
physical space, when they lose time,

291
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,828
when they get hungry
but they can't eat,

292
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:12,366
when they get tired
but they can't sleep,

293
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,635
they break.

294
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:19,840
So I already know
what your future holds.

295
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,277
Hmm. Funny.
I see the future, too.

296
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,981
And you have two despicable sons

297
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,116
who wear even dumber makeup
than you,

298
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,273
and they die like cowards
stabbed in the back.

299
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,792
When I get out of this,
I'm stronger than you know.

300
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:44,365
- Everyone thinks that.
- Mm. But in my case, it's true.

301
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:49,503
I'm the Destroyer of Worlds.

302
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,821
I don't see a way
to reverse the effects

303
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:11,492
of the Gravitonium on his system
or even neutralize it.

304
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:14,061
How are you doing?
Give me some good news.

305
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,030
Uh, I finally got
the compound right.

306
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,832
Should only take a few days
to synthesize.

307
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,434
It's funny, isn't it?

308
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:23,771
The Centipede serum
was part of our first mission,

309
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,006
and now it's the key
to curing Coulson.

310
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:30,077
- We've come full circle.
- Just in time for the end of days.

311
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:34,014
You ever think it would be Talbot?

312
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:35,749
I don't want to think about it.

313
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:42,056
He was one of the good guys.

314
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,159
Yeah, I know.
I don't know what he is anymore,

315
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,962
but he needs to be stopped,
even if that means ...

316
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:50,931
Even if it means finding
a terminal solution.

317
00:20:56,137 --> 00:21:00,774
I mean, if there are no other options,

318
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,277
we ... we could try the Odium.

319
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:07,381
How do we get him to take it?

320
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:11,285
Drinking it might not even
be strong enough.

321
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:15,956
We could use the Centipede serum

322
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,492
to deliver it straight into his cells.

323
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:33,907
It's a little too quiet in here.
That make anyone nervous?

324
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,809
Maybe it's Remorath nap time.

325
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:39,179
Then we need to wake
one up and ask for directions.

326
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,549
- All these hallways look the same.
- That's the same writing

327
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,018
that was in the Lighthouse
in the future.

328
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,021
- What's it say, Deke?
- How would I know?

329
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,323
Because you lived there.

330
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,660
Well, they don't teach you the
language. I can count to five.

331
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,496
You lived there for decades,
and you know five numbers?

332
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,599
I also know zero,
so, no, I know six numbers.

333
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,434
I'm amazed
you were able to survive.

334
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:03,003
You know, I found you, didn't I?

335
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,806
And I can lead us back to the
Zephyr, so I'm doing my job.

336
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,175
- You're the ones who lost Daisy.
- We didn't lose her.

337
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:10,427
Just do your best, Deke.
It won't be long before

338
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:13,180
they figure out we're gone,
so just pick a direction.

339
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:19,353
This way.

340
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:24,491
Wait.
Not that way.

341
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:28,262
- We can fight or we can run.
- Fight.

342
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,673
Daisy.
Are you okay?

343
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,175
Did ... Are you ... Did they
hurt you, or whatever?

344
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:44,845
I'm fine. Just had a little
head trip with Father Kasius.

345
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:46,647
Father Kasius?
What, you mean his dad's here?

346
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:49,349
- Here but not "here."
- Well, that's just another reason

347
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,552
that we need to get to
the Zephyr and fly out of here.

348
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,654
We're not going ... not yet.

349
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,189
What? What ...
What are you talk...

350
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,691
You can't escape without,
you know, escaping.

351
00:22:57,726 --> 00:23:00,327
Qovas has a couple of Ionizer
Missiles aimed at the Lighthouse.

352
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,196
If we try to leave, he'll fire them.

353
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,164
- The Lighthouse can handle it.
- Maybe.

354
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,166
But the people of River's End
might not be so lucky.

355
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,938
We can forget about
finding the Quinjet.

356
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,274
- Then how do we find him?
- I don't know. We have to think like him.

357
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,709
He's a man we all knew,

358
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,912
a man that had a lot of stars
and stripes on his uniform.

359
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,743
What's he want to do now
that he has all this power?

360
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:22,783
Death and destruction.

361
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:25,219
- That's what they all want.
- Nah, I'm not so sure.

362
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,554
He risked his life to save us
from the Remorath.

363
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:30,891
And then he went on a killing spree.
He's in full villain mode.

364
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:32,960
Yet everyone's the hero
in their own story.

365
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,196
- And what's his? "Macbeth"?
- Nah, I mean it.

366
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,733
Did he say it anything before
he went into the machine?

367
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,205
He kept saying, "I can fix this."

368
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,076
- What's he fixing?
- I don't know.

369
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,945
His mistakes, his reputation?

370
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,947
Maybe he's trying to prove

371
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,916
that he's still a good soldier,

372
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,587
- a good man.
- A good dad.

373
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,590
<i>Unprecedented levels of destruction</i>

374
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:05,325
<i>rivaling even that
of the Chitauri invasion.</i>

375
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,327
<i>First responders are on the scene.</i>

376
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,909
Hello, George.

377
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:24,311
Daddy's home.

378
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,926
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongues?

379
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,660
I'm just surprised.

380
00:24:37,662 --> 00:24:39,329
With everything going on
in the world,

381
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,131
I-I didn't know...

382
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:44,968
- You look, um...
- Like a million bucks.

383
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,904
You're okay?

384
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,773
Yeah. Fit as a fiddle.
Never better.

385
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:52,543
I'm a new man ...
clear-headed and healthy.

386
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:58,549
- Why are you dressed so funny?
- Well...

387
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:02,886
this is my new uniform, son.

388
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:07,224
Your dad's a superhero now,
just like those Avengers.

389
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:11,061
And guess what. I even
have my own superpowers.

390
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:23,774
That's just a taste.
I can move buildings and cars.

391
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:25,558
And you want to know
something else?

392
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:27,010
I can even fly.

393
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:29,580
And I don't need a hammer
or an iron suit to do it.

394
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,415
- Can I fly with you?
- Absolutely.

395
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:38,422
Things are gonna be different
from now on.

396
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:40,457
Your daddy's all better.

397
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:43,994
And I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you

398
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:45,496
or anyone else.

399
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:48,365
I'm gonna chase those invaders
out of town.

400
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,067
- Now, you ready to go for that flight?
- George, honey,

401
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:56,073
why don't you go up to your room and
play so your father and I can talk?

402
00:25:56,074 --> 00:25:57,808
Not now, Carla.
We're having fun.

403
00:25:57,842 --> 00:26:02,346
Glenn, please.
We need to talk.

404
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,848
I heard about the accident.

405
00:26:04,883 --> 00:26:06,149
What the hell
are you talking about?

406
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,819
- S.H.I.E.L.D. called, and ...
- S.H.I.E.L.D.

407
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,127
Sorry.

408
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:20,731
- Look what you made me do.
- I'm really sorry, Glenn.

409
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:23,000
They're just worried about you.
That's all.

410
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:27,337
And so am I.
George, please, honey, go upstairs.

411
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,311
I'm sorry, George.

412
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,213
I can fix it, though.

413
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:41,985
Better yet, I can take you
to a real spaceship.

414
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,054
What do you think
about that, partner?

415
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,926
They are fools if they think
they'll get off this ship.

416
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,296
Bring me the powered one.
She belongs to Kasius.

417
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:56,433
As for the others, they do not
deserve a warrior's death.

418
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:59,102
Kill them with their own weapons.

419
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:02,185
Let them die in shame and dishonor.

420
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:14,551
We're getting close
to the bridge.

421
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,119
We have a clear path
to the Zephyr from here.

422
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,754
We might not get that chance again.

423
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:20,557
- We're not leaving till we finish the job.
- Yes, you are.

424
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,843
- May?
- I'll deal with the missiles

425
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:24,027
and get back to the base.

426
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:27,130
You and Daisy get to
the Zephyr and go home.

427
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:30,200
- Loving this plan. Good luck, May.
- You're with me.

428
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,402
I need you to set the
coordinates for the trip back.

429
00:27:32,437 --> 00:27:36,006
Right, because numbers.
Yay.

430
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:39,709
No, it's too risky.
We do it together.

431
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:46,383
I'll take care of it.
Go home, Phil ... now.

432
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,441
Are you giving me an order?
'Cause that sounded like

433
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:50,120
- you were giving me an or...
- Yes, I'm giving you an order!

434
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:53,090
You're just gonna slow me down,
so zip it and get to the ...

435
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:23,987
Thought that might shut you up.
Now go.

436
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:30,327
- Uh...
- Not a word, Agent Johnson.

437
00:28:30,328 --> 00:28:31,962
That's an order.

438
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:35,699
Copy that, Hot Lips.

439
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:40,137
It's a really big ship,
and it's full of these crazy aliens.

440
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:43,874
But don't worry.
They're my friends.

441
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:46,209
And I have a friend for you, too.

442
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:50,047
- Put her down, Dad.
- I can't do that, son.

443
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:52,349
She's not on our side anymore.

444
00:28:52,383 --> 00:28:57,187
That's not true.
I love you.

445
00:28:57,221 --> 00:29:01,058
- I would do anything for you.
- Oh, really, Carla?

446
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:04,127
Like when you helped Hydra
brainwash me,

447
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:05,880
or when you worked with S.H.I.E.L.D.

448
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:08,098
- to conspire behind my back?
- That's not true.

449
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:10,233
"Your compliance will be rewarded."

450
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:12,903
Any of that ring a bell?
Do you remember that? Do ya?!

451
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:15,172
They said it would help.

452
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:18,742
I'm sorry, Carla,

453
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:23,480
but the only way I'll ever trust
you again is if you join me.

454
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:45,268
Welcome to the neighborhood.

455
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:46,903
We don't want to hurt you, Talbot.

456
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:49,272
- We just want to talk to you.
- Where's Coulson?

457
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:53,243
- What did you do to them?
- They're prisoners of war.

458
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:55,245
We're not at war with you.

459
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,548
They declared war
when they tried to stop me.

460
00:29:58,583 --> 00:29:59,983
Stay right there.

461
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:05,188
Go ahead, cowboy.

462
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:40,958
Stop! Stop!
Hold your fire!

463
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:46,763
Take cover!

464
00:30:57,108 --> 00:31:01,278
- Qovas has ordered the launch.
- Excuse me, fellas.

465
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,437
Just looking for the men's room.

466
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:06,047
You know
if there's one close by?

467
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:09,653
You know what?
On second thought?

468
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:12,464
I'm actually just gonna find
a corner somewhere.

469
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:42,118
Ugh, what are you doing?

470
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:45,689
Weapons ...
in case more show up.

471
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:49,159
Don't just stand there.

472
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:51,194
Start transferring
the missile-target numbers

473
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:53,872
- to the Teleporter.
- Right, because ...

474
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:56,166
because the Lighthouse is the target,
so the coordinates are ticket home.

475
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,834
That's ...
That's good thinking, May.

476
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:01,438
- But which one's the launch system?
- I don't know! Pick one.

477
00:32:08,412 --> 00:32:11,047
Nope.
That's navigation.

478
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:16,489
I'll take that just in case.

479
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,224
Okay, got it.
Weapons system.

480
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:24,394
And I-I found the launch codes.
Do I deactivate the missiles?

481
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:26,229
We're not deactivating them.

482
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:28,231
Well, then what the hell
are we doing here?!

483
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,433
We're giving them a new target.

484
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:35,171
Now do you see what I am,
what I've become?

485
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:37,657
I'm a superhero,
and I plan on doing

486
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:40,410
- what needs to be done.
- You're not a hero.

487
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:43,313
George...
It's okay, George.

488
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:45,248
They're the bad people.

489
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,083
They're trying to stop me.

490
00:32:48,286 --> 00:32:50,387
I need to get him out of there.

491
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:07,637
I can't get near him.

492
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:10,740
You're the bad one.
You want to hurt them.

493
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:12,494
No.
No, I don't.

494
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:14,549
No, I'm just giving them
a warning. That's all.

495
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:20,250
So that they'll understand that
I'm the one who's gonna save them.

496
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:24,321
I just need to get a little more
fuel in my tank first,

497
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:29,326
and then I can do it.

498
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:31,061
You'll see.

499
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:39,669
You keep watching the news, son.
You'll see.

500
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,622
Close it up.
Let's get this bird ready for liftoff.

501
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,460
They're here.

502
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:07,364
Davis, we're back.
Is everything o...

503
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:09,632
<i>...under attack.</i>

504
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:12,502
<i>Two of them.
Dark.</i>

505
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:14,437
Can't lose our pilot again.

506
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:54,344
Thanks.
I owe you a life debt.

507
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:56,146
Nice try, but I'm good.

508
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,516
- I hate those things.
- Tell me about it.

509
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:02,519
- Coulson, you're bleeding.
- I'll survive.

510
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,022
Agent Davis, fire up the engines.
Time to go home.

511
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:08,058
Go home?
What about Agent May and Deke?

512
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:11,394
They're taking the express train.

513
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,229
Okay... Okay, the one
that looks like the ...

514
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:14,631
the house with the broken roof?

515
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:17,267
- I think that's a three.
- Uh, uh-huh.

516
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:19,436
And then ... and then it's,
uh, uh, like, a ...

517
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,239
like, a ... like, a chair with ...
with, uh, some wavy lines.

518
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:28,611
- Got it.
- All right, give me the next one

519
00:35:28,646 --> 00:35:30,413
so we can get off this ship.

520
00:35:30,448 --> 00:35:32,849
You will never get off this ship.

521
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:37,520
Watch me.

522
00:35:43,094 --> 00:35:46,596
I will watch you bleed.

523
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:52,234
- Deke.
- Whoa. Thanks.

524
00:35:58,605 --> 00:35:59,972
Okay!

525
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:04,545
- Oh, Okay, okay!
- Any day now!

526
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:06,880
Hey, I'm trying. Okay?

527
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:09,115
Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

528
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:13,319
Um... uh...
there's a crooked something...

529
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:16,956
s-something.
Ugh. Damn it!

530
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:22,128
Few stitches ...
I'll be fine.

531
00:36:22,162 --> 00:36:25,315
So...

532
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:29,302
- You made out with May.
- Did I?

533
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:30,570
Oh, yeah.

534
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:32,705
Oh. People see
what they want to see, I guess.

535
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:35,374
- And?
- We're ready for liftoff.

536
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,095
Strap yourselves in.
This could get bumpy.

537
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,881
How do you think she's doing?

538
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:45,618
Having the time of her life.

539
00:36:45,652 --> 00:36:47,987
Almost done!

540
00:36:51,024 --> 00:36:57,606
Okay.
Crooked teapot and, um...

541
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:06,205
And now you'll learn respect.

542
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,844
Okay, that's it.

543
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,379
You have just sealed the fate
of everyone in your base.

544
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:41,874
And now you will die.

545
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:45,678
Well, one little thing.

546
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:48,272
We changed the target.

547
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,958
Told ya I didn't need a gun to stop you.

548
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:02,962
- How?
- I know zero.

549
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:22,802
<i>- Coulson.
- Tell me you have them.</i>

550
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,485
<i>What's taking you so long?</i>

551
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,188
<i>Mack and Yo-Yo just got back,
as well. We'll all be together.</i>

552
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:33,492
- Where were they?
- Um... they went after Talbot.

553
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:35,228
<i>He killed Carl Creel,</i>

554
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:37,463
<i>turned him to Gravitonium,
and consumed him.</i>

555
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:39,421
<i>He killed others, as well.</i>

556
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:41,430
<i>I'll brief you as soon
as I have all the details.</i>

557
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:43,621
<i>- Get back safe.
- We'll see you soon.</i>

558
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:50,466
I don't think we can treat him
with kid gloves anymore.

559
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:51,879
He's dangerous and delusional.

560
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:55,948
- If he finds more Gravitonium, he's gonna ...
- Coulson, what the hell?

561
00:38:55,983 --> 00:39:00,385
I-I-I don't understand.
It was...

562
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:05,858
Davis! Call base!

563
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,591
We need a Med Team
to meet us when we land!

564
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:10,596
- On it.
- Coulson, stay with me, okay?

565
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:11,797
<i> Stay with me.</i>

566
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:14,609
<i> You fight, okay?
You fight.</i>

567
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,335
<i>I'm gonna get you home.</i>

568
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:59,011
He is not going to die ...
not yet, at least ...

569
00:39:59,012 --> 00:40:03,416
but his condition is worsening...
and accelerating.

570
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,051
What about the treatment
we talked about?

571
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:07,153
We have something we think will work.

572
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:09,055
It will just take some time
to combine it

573
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:11,824
- with the Centipede serum.
- Time we don't have.

574
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:14,393
- We're doing everything we can.
- What about Talbot?

575
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:17,281
You find a way to stop him?
He's worse, too.

576
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:21,150
Yeah, we think so. Unfortunately,
it's not a cure. It's more...

577
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,536
It's more terminal.

578
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,539
If we can combine the Odium
with another dose

579
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,133
of the Centipede serum, it should
be able to penetrate his cells.

580
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:31,277
That's not possible.

581
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,413
Well, yeah, it's entirely possible.
We ran a simulation ...

582
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:37,583
That's not possible.
There is no more Centipede serum.

583
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:40,186
What I brought back,
that's the last of it.

584
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:52,831
- So we either save Coulson...
- Or we save the world.

585
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:06,668
<i>We'll return in a moment.</i>

586
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:16,669
Don't worry.
These fellas don't bite.

587
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:20,707
At least, I don't think they do.
You don't bite, do ya?

588
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:26,846
- Who's flying this plane?
- Gravity.

589
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:30,083
It doesn't just make you
crash and burn, darling.

590
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:32,085
It also makes you ascend...

591
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,655
- to the heavens.
- What do you want from us?

592
00:41:42,196 --> 00:41:47,967
You drew me.
You see me in your head, don't you?

593
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:54,441
You ever see me
tearing the Earth apart,

594
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:57,177
bringing something up
from the ground?

595
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:08,354
Good.
Now tell me...

596
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:10,416
where.
