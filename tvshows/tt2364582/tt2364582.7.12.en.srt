1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,615
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:02,617 --> 00:00:04,617
And every outcome where
we don't come out on top

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,085
has one thing in common.

4
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:07,088
Fitz.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,290
And now you're gonna take us to him.

6
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:10,023
Sibyl dropped Kora in my lap

7
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:11,663
because they knew I'd want to save her.

8
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:14,466
The thing is, I already
have a sister to save.

9
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:16,052
Her name is Jemma Simmons.

10
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:17,088
Where are you?!

11
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,093
- I don't want to forget you.
- Please. It's gonna be okay.

12
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,992
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

13
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:23,361
I'm guessing from his attitude
that he didn't find Fitz.

14
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:25,163
Fitz?

15
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,800
Who's Fitz?

16
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:30,166
Your mother died protecting
Daisy from him.

17
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,876
To all Chronicom vessels,

18
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:34,746
you may fire whenever you want.

19
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:39,078
They're doing it.

20
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,215
They're destroying S.H.I.E.L.D.

21

22
00:00:57,164 --> 00:00:59,431
Are those space lasers?

23
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,333
Just lasers that happen to be in space.

24
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:02,701
But they're weapons, right?

25
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:04,069
100%.

26
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,531
But they don't seem to be aimed at us,

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,073
which means they
probably don't see us yet.

28
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:09,975
Hope that's still true after I do this.

29
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,811
Alright, we got less than a minute

30
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:15,046
before we dock with the Zephyr...

31
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,548
or the other thing's gonna happen.

32
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,316
Let's say we manage
to dock with the Zephyr

33
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,218
and somehow rescue Simmons and Deke.

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,686
Then what?

35
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:24,055
One problem at a time.

36
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:26,057
Here we go.

37
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,692
Three...

38
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:29,194
two...

39
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:30,428
one.

40
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,415
Nice flying, Tremors.

41
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,183
I thought it was "Quake".

42
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:56,421
What was that? Are we hit?

43
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:57,555
No.

44
00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:00,392
I think they've locked on to the Zephyr.

45
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,963
So...

46
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:40,332
I guess this is the next problem.

47
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,513
Is it possible they're
on the other side,

48
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,617
doing the exact same thing?

49
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:59,344
Let's scan their ship, see
if we can find our team.

50
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:17,328
This is your last chance
to give up Fitz's location.

51
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,730
The Chronicoms won't be so...

52
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:19,864
Amateurish?

53
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:20,932
Pedestrian?

54
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,468
Ham-fisted?

55
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,639
We have a more precise
method of retrieving information.

56
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:27,705
Aah!

57
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:29,674
Hey!

58
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:44,123
Well, look at you.

59
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,759
I was gonna say "in the flesh",

60
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:51,763
but I suspect it's more
like a space-age polymer...

61
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:53,131
or something.

62
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,899
Either way, it's super-impressive.

63
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,634
Everything is.

64
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,837
And what a triumph.

65
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,245
All S.H.I.E.L.D. targets destroyed.

66
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,775
Except for the Lighthouse.

67
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:05,410
Straight to the point.

68
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,744
I like that.

69
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:07,979
You've been inside.

70
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,485
You know that the Lighthouse was built

71
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:11,783
to withstand any external attack.

72
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:15,153
Which is why we're taking
a different approach.

73
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:17,922
None of it matters if
Leopold Fitz is alive.

74
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:22,060
As long as he lives,
our future isn't secure.

75
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:24,963
Jemma Simmons has effectively
erased him from her memory.

76
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,132
In fact, based on what I saw,

77
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:29,400
there's a good chance
he isn't even alive.

78
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,102
I'm not leaving it to chance.

79
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:33,538
The injection I gave her
will dissolve her implant.

80
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,308
We'll learn whether she's
truly forgotten Leopold Fitz...

81
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,479
or whether it's simply
masking the truth.

82
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:45,617
It looks like every
S.H.I.E.L.D. base is gone.

83
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,418
Even the Triskelion.

84
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,754
Are you okay?

85
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:52,056
I will be.

86
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:55,293
It's just... a lot.

87
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:57,263
You can feel all those lives lost?

88
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,600
Why weren't we attacked?
Sibyl knows where we are.

89
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:03,968
She's smart.

90
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,336
She knows the Lighthouse would survive

91
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:06,437
a conventional assault.

92
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,406
She must have other plans.

93
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:14,345
Where's that coming from?

94
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,381
What are the Chronicoms doing now?

95
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,449
I can't stop it.

96
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,485
Why don't you two
implement lockdown protocols

97
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,020
while I figure this out.

98
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,798
Why didn't you tell me you were
working with the Chronicoms?

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,533
I'm not working with the Chronicoms.

100
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:37,669
They're working for me... for us.

101
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,304
It's part of my plan.

102
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:41,807
Was killing my mom a part
of your plan, as well?

103
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,443
I saw her body.

104
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,979
I know it was you.

105
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,515
I did that for you.

106
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:51,583
To protect you.

107
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,850
I didn't ask for that.

108
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:54,852
Because you're a good person.

109
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:57,455
You don't see the evil in others.

110
00:06:57,457 --> 00:07:00,491
If you'd only heard some
of the things she said...

111
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,160
that you were a mistake,

112
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,963
that she was sad you were even born,

113
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:07,398
how you needed to be put down.

114
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,667
Jiaying was never interested
in being your mother.

115
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:12,904
She only wanted to control you.

116
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:16,074
She resented you.

117
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:19,478
But I'm here to set you free.

118
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:24,984
To show you how powerful you can be.

119
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,419
It was terrible,

120
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:31,522
seeing her on a table like that.

121
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:33,558
I know.

122
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,693
I'm making sure her body is buried

123
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:38,363
and that everyone who tried to hurt you

124
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:39,631
will be buried with her.

125
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:48,439
Breaker, breaker one-nine.

126
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,275
This is the Big Bad Wolf.

127
00:07:50,277 --> 00:07:51,909
I'm in the henhouse.

128
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:54,078
Time to fry some chicken.

129
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:16,146
I have a tingle right here.

130
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:17,281
It's probably the implant.

131
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:22,852
The bio-implant that
blocks your memories...

132
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:24,188
of you-know-who.

133
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,261
Of Fitz.

134
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,530
I know that name.

135
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,231
Yes. You do.

136
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,499
Um, I...

137
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,269
Maybe this will help, okay?

138
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:40,738
Uh...

139
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:44,007
Um, uh...

140
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,776
I'm the man you love.

141
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,376
Uh, uh... We're a team.

142
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,045
You're bio, I'm tech.

143
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,247
My name is...

144
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:52,550
- James Bond.
- 'Kay. No.

145
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:55,188
But that's not entirely... surprising.

146
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,191
Never mind.

147
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,161
Um... I don't know. Maybe...

148
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,531
Maybe the thing that they injected
you with is doing something.

149
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,265
Maybe it's destroying the implant

150
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,267
or it's scrambling your
thoughts and your memories

151
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:05,501
and your synapses all together.

152
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,637
Why would they do that?

153
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,572
Because they think
that you have a secret.

154
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,408
I do have a secret.

155
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,711
I can feel it.

156
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,946
It's in there, and everything's...

157
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,351
... swirling.

158
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,553
Maybe that's their plan.

159
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:25,521
They're gonna pour everything out

160
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,324
until they find what they need.

161
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:31,327
It's okay. I got you. Just rest.

162
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:39,570
That's a lot of Chronicoms.

163
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,207
We just have to find...

164
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:46,222
There.

165
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,311
Now, you see how those two are warmer?

166
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:50,346
I'm pretty sure that's Simmons and Deke.

167
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,349
What about that one... there?

168
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:55,286
Kora.

169
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:58,511
How'd she get up here?

170
00:09:58,513 --> 00:09:59,879
I don't care.

171
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,181
She's not gonna stop me
from getting back Simmons.

172
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,349
And Deke.

173
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,184
Sure.

174
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,852
So, how are we gonna do this?

175
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:07,955
Well, they don't know we're here,

176
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:10,390
so I'll infiltrate the ship
and I'll bring them back.

177
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:12,425
Okay.

178
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:17,396
I'll figure out a way to
get the hangar doors open.

179
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:19,165
Seems they're our only way out.

180
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,599
I can help with that.

181
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:22,034
Great.

182
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:23,436
I'll be back.

183
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:30,576
Daisy.

184
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:32,344
Yeah?

185
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,589
Didn't know I was gonna do that.

186
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:44,991
I'm glad you did.

187
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,918
Um... I'll see you when I get back.

188
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,496
- Yeah.
- Okay.

189
00:10:58,306 --> 00:10:59,538
Impressive.

190
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,974
Thank you.

191
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,777
Turns out I speak fax.

192
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,078
This isn't fax.

193
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,513
Garrett's here.

194
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,253
That's down on the lowest level.

195
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,322
Well, we knew they'd be coming for us.

196
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:17,691
Zoom in on that.

197
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:22,928
I'll say it if no one else will.

198
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,463
That's a Chronibomb.

199
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:26,765
Enough of those strategically
placed around the base,

200
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,901
he'll be able to flatten
the entire Lighthouse.

201
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:30,500
Any progress on that
gadget to contain him?

202
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:31,503
Yeah.

203
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:32,738
Mack gave us a hard drive.

204
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,973
It has specs of a device

205
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,108
that trapped Gordon in our old timeline.

206
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,476
I remember that room.

207
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:38,777
It cost you a hand.

208
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,613
Seemed like a big deal at the time.

209
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:42,448
Now look at me.

210
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,949
Fitz built these panels.

211
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:46,619
They prevented Gordon
from teleporting out.

212
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,921
I'm working on something that
might replicate that trick.

213
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:50,789
I'll need your help to pull it off.

214
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,259
I hope it involves punching.

215
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,577
Did you really think you could
sneak onto one of my ships?

216
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,546
Well, you gotta admit, you
didn't see that coming.

217
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:18,951
I'll grant that your appearance
is a statistical improbability.

218
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:22,655
But whatever advantage you
hoped to gain is irrelevant.

219
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:25,291
I didn't see you coming
because it is meaningless.

220
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:26,892
You're too late.

221
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,595
Every S.H.I.E.L.D. base
has been destroyed.

222
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:31,664
The war is over.

223
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,366
And you've lost.

224
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,604
Let's just kill them now.

225
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,706
My team can finish them in no time.

226
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,943
You know nothing of time.

227
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,047
Take care of the humans on their ship.

228
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,351
Do not interfere with Daisy Johnson.

229
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,053
I don't like this idea.

230
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:58,324
I need confirmation that
Leopold Fitz is dead.

231
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,693
The odds of discovering
the truth about him

232
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:03,962
are 11% higher

233
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:08,069
if we allow Daisy Johnson to
reunite with Jemma Simmons.

234
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,239
Be patient.

235
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:18,611
It can't be true.

236
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,013
I'm sure it's not.

237
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,148
We didn't come this far to fail.

238
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,750
Not like this. Not to a bunch of...

239
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:26,185
Robots.

240
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:32,191
She has to be lying.

241
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:33,592
Lighthouse can survive anything.

242
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:36,328
We just need to get
back down to it, regroup.

243
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,663
It's too late for that.

244
00:13:37,665 --> 00:13:40,221
We owe Daisy, Simmons,
and Deke a way out of here

245
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,657
when they get back.

246
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,771
Yeah.

247
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:47,606
We do owe them that.

248
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:49,742
There's no reason to be quiet anymore.

249
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:50,944
Let's make some noise.

250
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,079
Let's blow those hangar doors to pieces.

251
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,548
_

252
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,898
What else do we have?

253
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,300
I was surprised that my sister is here.

254
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:18,638
Never underestimate
the depth of her hate.

255
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,406
That woman is a walking time bomb.

256
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,974
Is she really that powerful?

257
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,576
In the other timeline,
she quaked the world apart.

258
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:26,044
There is no end to her hate,

259
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:28,381
to what she's willing to destroy.

260
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,053
But you know who's
more powerful than her?

261
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:35,354
Us.

262
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,289
That's right.

263
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,791
S.H.I.E.L.D. are the bad guys.

264
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:41,493
It's why we're destroying them.

265
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:42,861
But after they're gone,

266
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:45,631
we'll be able to take over the planet.

267
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,466
There'll be chaos and anarchy,

268
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,736
and then you and I are
gonna come save the day.

269
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:52,604
'Cause we're the good guys.

270
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:55,741
There's only one person
who could ruin that.

271
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,476
- Daisy.
- That's right.

272
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:00,345
She's very bad.

273
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:04,783
I don't care what Sibyl says
about percentages or waiting.

274
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:06,919
We need to finish Daisy off.

275
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:08,153
Now.

276
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,462
That's pretty specific.

277
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,866
Hmm.

278
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:23,302
It's based on the
schematics Fitz designed.

279
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:24,670
I think it'll work.

280
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:27,406
I'm still getting used to
the idea of you as a techie.

281
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,444
I'm still getting used to
the idea of me as just "tech".

282
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,447
You really believe that?

283
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,717
No. Not really.

284
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:41,654
Still... figuring it out.

285
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,257
Me too.

286
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:48,894
We're not the same people we were.

287
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:51,797
Pretty sure everyone
would agree on that.

288
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:55,734
I'm wondering if we
change the timelines or...

289
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:57,336
if they change us.

290
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,004
The Melinda May I know

291
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:02,708
would never ask these
philosophical questions.

292
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,777
Which is the point.

293
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:08,281
How did I become this me?

294
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:13,685
I don't know.

295
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,754
But I like this you.

296
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:18,690
And if I'm completely honest...

297
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:20,827
I like this me, as well.

298
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:28,968
Well, hey, buddy.

299
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,603
What's with the "X"?

300
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:33,872
Based on the structural
integrity of the Lighthouse,

301
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,974
I determined you'd
appear right about there

302
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:37,109
to plant one of your bombs.

303
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,044
And did you think
I was gonna just teleport

304
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,612
straight into those?

305
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:41,980
No, I thought it'd be way cooler

306
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:43,782
to have them teleported onto you.

307
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:45,104
Well, that would be a neat trick.

308
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:51,572
Well... I'd love to stay and chat,

309
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:53,797
but there's some very impressive
explosives about to blow,

310
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,427
so ta-ta.

311
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:04,736
That hurt.

312
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:12,010
Tell us how to deactivate these.

313
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:14,746
I can't. Not from here.

314
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:17,015
I didn't think I'd need to.

315
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:19,418
How many bombs total?

316
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,852
An even dozen.

317
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:23,288
Gonna pancake this whole puppy.

318
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,858
Unless you want to get
pancaked with us, call it off.

319
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,833
Thought you'd be back by now.

320
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:36,935
Those bombs are gonna
blow in a minute or two.

321
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,870
Funny story. That's
what I'm calling about.

322
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:41,573
I'm gonna need you to
deactivate those bad boys.

323
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:44,876
Wow. You know, I'd love to,
but that's not what the plan is.

324
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:47,946
The plan is for you to
demolish the Lighthouse.

325
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:50,383
100%. Totally on board with that.

326
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:54,586
I just need a little more
time... 10 minutes tops.

327
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:57,322
Otherwise, if this baby
blows, I'm gonna blow.

328
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:59,291
Then I'm gonna take this opportunity,

329
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:00,692
in case I don't see you again,

330
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:02,794
to thank you for your service.

331
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:06,933
Son of a bitch.

332
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,898
There's no time to get to the surface.

333
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:21,087
May?!

334
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:22,589
Coulson?!

335
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:26,158
Hello?!

336
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,061
I need a hand... over here.

337
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,247
Help me with May.

338
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:51,550
Can you stand?

339
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:54,086
Yeah.

340
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:05,064
Thanks.

341
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:07,333
I moved all the bombs to one place,

342
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:10,036
hoping the whole structure
wouldn't collapse.

343
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,135
What about Garrett?

344
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,723
We need to stop the bleeding.

345
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:32,192
Do we?

346
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:38,065
He's our best chance to
help our friends in space.

347
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:42,922
When I asked if you had something else,

348
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:45,471
I meant something...
bigger and more powerful.

349
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:48,507
Well, I don't see you coming
up with any brilliant ideas.

350
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,409
Wish I could disagree.

351
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:53,609
Hey, look, for a guy who was
ripped from his own timeline,

352
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,612
who ended up on a
spaceship full of robots,

353
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:57,615
you're not doing half bad.

354
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,344
Follow my lead.

355
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:06,416
We are here to take your faces.

356
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:07,483
Oh.

357
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:08,986
Lord knows you could do a lot better

358
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:10,586
than the ones you're wearing now.

359
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:13,356
I'm pretty sure they
don't understand sarcasm.

360
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,559
They'll understand this.

361
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,373
If that wasn't egg in your beer.

362
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,546
How many more of those do you have?

363
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:38,949
That's it.

364
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:44,120
We just have to hold
them off long enough

365
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,422
for Daisy to get back
with Simmons and Deke.

366
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:47,457
And then?

367
00:20:49,827 --> 00:20:51,794
One problem at a time.

368
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:08,177
That's not creepy...

369
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:19,922
He should make it.

370
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:21,423
Don't sound so thrilled.

371
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:23,626
Yo-Yo.

372
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:28,316
What happened?

373
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,535
It was dark.

374
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,637
Speared myself with a piece of rebar.

375
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:37,273
And there's a lot of rebar.

376
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,441
As far as I can see,
we're trapped down here.

377
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:41,791
All the exits are blocked
under a ton of rubble.

378
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:45,548
Son of a bitch.

379
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,250
Have a little respect for the
people who saved your ass.

380
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:50,586
I meant Nathaniel Malick.

381
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,588
Bastard left me here to die.

382
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,990
What ever happened to team loyalty?

383
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:03,632
I was shown a future where
S.H.I.E.L.D. abandoned me.

384
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:06,168
How come it's playing
out the exact opposite?

385
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,237
Malick showed you an old timeline.

386
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,572
This one's different.

387
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:11,407
Nothing's written.

388
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:14,211
It's not too late to be on
the right side of history.

389
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:18,447
Looks like I'm wearing a
white hat from now on.

390
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:23,485
Hey.

391
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:24,553
Buddy?

392
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:26,689
Interesting.

393
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:28,925
I'm hearing a pattern in the sounds.

394
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,600
Hi.

395
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:40,669
Daisy.

396
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:42,504
- Oh, finally.
- Ohh.

397
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:44,306
Okay. We have to go.

398
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:45,375
Jemma.

399
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:48,477
What's going on?

400
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,945
They injected her with something.

401
00:22:49,947 --> 00:22:51,313
It's blurring her memories.

402
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:54,516
I think the Chronicoms are
trying to get intel on Bobo.

403
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:55,985
This is Daisy.

404
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:58,087
She's gonna help us
get out of here, okay?

405
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,022
She doesn't even remember me?

406
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:01,457
It comes and goes.

407
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:02,791
She was talking about
stars a minute ago,

408
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:05,728
and then she went off on
cuttlefish and chromatophores.

409
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,097
Jemma, we... we're gonna
get you somewhere safe,

410
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,331
but we have to go, okay?

411
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,433
Why are you wearing that costume?

412
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:14,169
It's... It's not a costume.

413
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:15,671
It's for protection.

414
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,339
Can I have one?

415
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:18,475
U-Uh...

416
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:21,510
- Yes.
- Yes.

417
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,679
Come on. Follow me,
and you will get one.

418
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,521
Wait. How did you get in here?

419
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:35,117
It's the weirdest thing.
Nobody tried to stop me.

420
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,926
It was like they wanted
me to find Simmons.

421
00:23:36,928 --> 00:23:38,661
- And me.
- Sure.

422
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:41,664
Is this the future or the
past? They look so similar.

423
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:42,765
Is this a secret time?

424
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:45,367
Yes, yes. Everything
has to be kept secret.

425
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:47,095
It's so hard, trying to remember

426
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:49,072
what's a secret and what's not.

427
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:55,044
The device in Jemma Simmons'
brain has been dissolved.

428
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:57,180
She has no protection.

429
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:01,150
Where is Kora?

430
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:02,319
Resting.

431
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:05,587
What if Simmons doesn't
tell us what we need?

432
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:08,590
She will have no choice.
The truth will pour out.

433
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:10,756
We will learn whether
or not Fitz is alive,

434
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:12,761
and if he is...

435
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:14,630
we will have his location.

436
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:16,298
And the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

437
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,566
Their ship is trapped.

438
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:19,843
They lack the firepower
to defend themselves,

439
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:21,837
let alone escape.

440
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,106
We will do with them as you wish.

441
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:42,958
Deke reconfigured these shells

442
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,760
with an electrical disruption charge.

443
00:24:44,762 --> 00:24:47,129
A single shot should drop a Chronicom.

444
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:48,230
Great.

445
00:24:48,232 --> 00:24:49,499
How many shells do we have?

446
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:50,899
Maybe 50.

447
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,701
50?

448
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:54,137
Wow. That's real peachy.

449
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,272
Did you just say "peachy"?

450
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:58,474
Yeah.

451
00:24:58,476 --> 00:24:59,808
Oh.

452
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,544
If we get out of here, I gotta
get you some new words.

453
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,646
And don't let Daisy
hear you talking like that.

454
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:06,316
Why? Does it mean something bad now?

455
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:09,719
No, it's...

456
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:12,788
Never mind.

457
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,656
It's a fine word.

458
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:16,325
And you're a fine man.

459
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:21,096
I just can't believe it's gonna be...

460
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,099
robots that take us out in the end.

461
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:25,667
If this really is the end,

462
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,704
shouldn't we take out as
many of them as possible?

463
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,707
Even more than 50?

464
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:34,676
Back at Area 51,

465
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:36,979
the Chronicoms tried to turn
Helius into a nuclear bomb

466
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,416
using just one of their robots.

467
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:46,756
What kind of damage could
we do with these six?

468
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,660
A helluva lot.

469
00:26:01,372 --> 00:26:02,704
You're right... definitely weird.

470
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:04,741
I keep forgetting... where are we going?

471
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:05,808
Home.

472
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,842
Home.

473
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:08,210
I have a home.

474
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:09,411
And I'm married.

475
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:10,946
I remember being married.

476
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:12,815
Is that a secret?

477
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:14,584
Who did I marry?

478
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:17,019
I can smell his hair,
but I can't see his face.

479
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:18,120
We'll talk about this later.

480
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:19,456
But isn't this later?

481
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,424
It's about being married,
joining together, join...

482
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:26,096
I can do it, even if I don't know why.

483
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,800
Here it comes.

484
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,435
Marriage is the key.

485
00:26:33,437 --> 00:26:35,270
Heart in hand... and singing.

486
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:36,738
Can a key sing?

487
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,007
After we're joined, we're unstoppable.

488
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:41,376
But I'm afraid we stopped.

489
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:42,379
Oh, God.

490
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,313
Okay, Simmons, let's just...
let's just keep going, okay?

491
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:45,414
We're almost there.

492
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:53,088
What have you done?

493
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,723
What are you talking about?

494
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:55,958
Kora.

495
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,427
She's going to ruin it.

496
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,834
Hello, sister.

497
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,906
Kora, we don't have to do this...

498
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,073
not here.

499
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:15,276
Let's get off this ship and talk.

500
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,946
You knew our mom was dead,
but you didn't tell me.

501
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:20,781
That was a mistake.

502
00:27:20,783 --> 00:27:22,350
I was trying to protect you.

503
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:24,418
I don't need protection!

504
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:32,259
Get Simmons back to the Zephyr.

505
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:33,561
Don't wait for me.

506
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:36,397
Go.

507
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,598
See?

508
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,566
I can take care of myself.

509
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:41,963
Having a power is not the same thing

510
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,270
as taking care of yourself.

511
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:46,473
You sound like Mom.

512
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:47,908
I wouldn't know.

513
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,377
She was a monster.

514
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:52,346
You don't believe that.

515
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:55,349
Don't... tell me what I believe.

516
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,518
Okay.

517
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,620
Then I'll tell you what I believe.

518
00:27:59,622 --> 00:28:02,490
I believe that Jiaying loved
you more than anything.

519
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:04,825
But she didn't know how to help you.

520
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,860
She was afraid of me.

521
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:08,495
She was afraid for you.

522
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:11,298
Twisting words again.

523
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,772
I'm not gonna use my power to fight you.

524
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:20,908
Then you're going to die.

525
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,776
Then that's your call to make.

526
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,411
Look...

527
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,982
I didn't have a sister in my timeline.

528
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:31,385
I didn't even know I had a
mom until it was too late.

529
00:28:31,387 --> 00:28:33,020
You're better off without one.

530
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:35,522
No. I wasn't.

531
00:28:35,524 --> 00:28:36,991
And the only reason she had me

532
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:40,395
was out of love and
grief over losing you.

533
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,796
Come with me.

534
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:45,065
It's too late.

535
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,668
S.H.I.E.L.D. is destroyed.

536
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:50,271
We've won.

537
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:53,874
Nathaniel and I are
gonna rule over everyone.

538
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,510
Is that what you want?

539
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,579
Or is that what he wants?

540
00:28:58,581 --> 00:29:01,882
We can still change this timeline.

541
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:03,617
Will you help me?

542
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:07,788
It's an 0-8-4.

543
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,557
Well, technically, it's the
location of an 0-8-4.

544
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,925
So, the message came from
S.H.I.E.L.D., not the Chronicoms.

545
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:14,528
What's an 0-8-4?

546
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,497
An object of unknown origin.

547
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:19,533
Could be a person,
an energy source, a weapon.

548
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:21,769
Whatever it is, it's dangerous.

549
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:23,070
It could be a trap.

550
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,439
Can't be much worse
than being trapped in here.

551
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:26,607
Hey.

552
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:29,543
I can get us out.

553
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:31,245
Just slip these bracelets off me,

554
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,380
and I'll be your teleporting taxi.

555
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,516
- No way.
- Hell no.

556
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,952
New timeline, new John Garrett.

557
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:41,523
That just makes it worse.

558
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,292
I don't think we have any other options.

559
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,373
Okay.

560
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,745
Now, this is wired
to the Gravitonium Drive,

561
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:06,847
as well as the Time Jump Drive.

562
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,615
It's gonna make a helluva boom.

563
00:30:14,757 --> 00:30:17,291
Deke. Jemma.

564
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,425
Where's Daisy?

565
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:19,693
Dealing with Kora.

566
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,662
She said not to wait.

567
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:24,131
I know this place.

568
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,766
Home.

569
00:30:25,768 --> 00:30:27,502
Yeah, we're not there yet.

570
00:30:29,472 --> 00:30:30,604
They did something to her.

571
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:33,273
She's remembering and
forgetting at the same time.

572
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:35,410
We can't let the
Chronicoms have her. The...

573
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:38,679
So, what's the plan now?

574
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:40,938
Is it something that doesn't
involve a suicide bomb?

575
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,317
Because this looks a
lot like a suicide bomb.

576
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,449
This was in case Daisy
didn't find you guys.

577
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:46,452
I'll go for Daisy.

578
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,655
Stand down, Agent Sousa.

579
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:49,657
And do what?

580
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:53,595
Find me some duct tape.

581
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:57,664
You are responsible for this.

582
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:00,667
Simmons was about to give us
the location of Leopold Fitz,

583
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:03,104
but now the moment has passed.

584
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:06,908
Where are they?

585
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,144
I don't think Daisy's bad.

586
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:13,147
She... She said things, and...

587
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:15,483
and they... they made sense.

588
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,586
I couldn't.

589
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:21,923
I'm sorry.

590
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:25,659
You don't think Daisy's bad?

591
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:28,762
No.

592
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:29,830
Okay.

593
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,565
Well...

594
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:34,234
We'll just have to agree to disagree.

595
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:40,138
Kimball, you interested in a promotion?

596
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,474
Absolutely.

597
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,677
Then lock her up in a cell.

598
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,915
Looks like we got to consult
your Time Stream again.

599
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,420
I told you guys not to wait.

600
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:55,556
- Yeah. You're welcome.
- What's the plan?

601
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:56,883
Mack and Sousa figured it out.

602
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:58,258
I'm still a little fuzzy,
but apparently,

603
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,327
it involves a lot of duct tape.

604
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:03,030
Okay. Daisy's on board. It's go time.

605
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:06,200
Do I sound cool when I say that?

606
00:32:27,122 --> 00:32:28,755
That one right there.

607
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,699
Lord, I hope this works.

608
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:19,693
Freeze! Hands in the air, or we'll...

609
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:35,656
Hands behind your head before
another person gets shot.

610
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,226
I can disarm everyone

611
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:41,861
without them even knowing what happened.

612
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:44,930
Let's not scare them any
more than they already are.

613
00:33:44,932 --> 00:33:46,699
They are scared. I can feel it.

614
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:48,235
And confused.

615
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,770
My name is Phil Coulson.

616
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:53,639
I'm an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

617
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:57,244
We received a coded
transmission after the attack.

618
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:00,106
Is it fair to assume that everyone here

619
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:02,282
responded to the same coded broadcast?

620
00:34:06,988 --> 00:34:09,221
I'm Agent Brandon Gamble.

621
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:11,024
I was stationed at the Hub.

622
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,326
Why the hell didn't
you just use the door,

623
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:17,997
instead of this crazy
teleportation device?

624
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,199
Your friend might still be alive.

625
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,469
Does that mean I just
killed one of our own?

626
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:25,871
Oh, God.

627
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:28,040
I know what you're feeling,

628
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:31,277
but this man, John Garrett,
was a double agent.

629
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,829
He was responsible for
destroying the Lighthouse

630
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:35,281
and killing civilians.

631
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,383
You did the world a favor.

632
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:39,385
You have a package?

633
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:42,621
A box, a briefcase, something
you were told to bring?

634
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:50,096
Any idea what we're
supposed to do with these?

635
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,760
0-8-4s.

636
00:34:57,438 --> 00:34:58,572
Where did they come from?

637
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:03,409
That one belonged to my
grandfather, who was SSR.

638
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:05,711
Been in my family for decades.

639
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:08,180
I was raised to guard it with my life.

640
00:35:08,182 --> 00:35:09,682
If and when the signal ever came,

641
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:11,717
I was to deliver it as instructed.

642
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,986
What's inside?

643
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:16,255
Never looked.

644
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:17,523
Wasn't part of the order.

645
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:20,259
This one has a postmark of 1948.

646
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:21,994
Agent Grace Mulcahey, ma'am.

647
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:24,330
That box has been locked in
a safe in my parents' basement

648
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,464
since before I was born.

649
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:28,000
Same instructions as Agent Gamble...

650
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,469
protect at all costs.

651
00:35:32,273 --> 00:35:34,340
Well...

652
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,977
maybe we should see what
the hubbub's all about.

653
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:44,917
This seems to have been
manufactured in the '60s.

654
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,919
And this...

655
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:49,355
never seen anything like this.

656
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,956
Any thoughts?

657
00:35:56,497 --> 00:35:57,796
They're with us!

658
00:36:05,406 --> 00:36:06,739
I knew you'd be back.

659
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:08,141
That makes one of us.

660
00:36:09,712 --> 00:36:11,747
I'll be fine.

661
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,780
Hey.

662
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:21,755
Oh.

663
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:26,458
Sorry. Not sure what happened.

664
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,894
No, it's good. Just... new.

665
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:35,868
What happened?

666
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,339
You recognize any of these people?

667
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:43,142
The Chronicoms did
something to her memory.

668
00:36:43,144 --> 00:36:44,743
She's forgotten all of us...

669
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,413
names, faces, everything.

670
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,660
Then she'll just go off on
something from the past

671
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,016
or being married or...

672
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:52,618
Math is my faithful husband.

673
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,920
Like that.

674
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:58,490
Any idea why we're all here?

675
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:01,093
Or... who sent that message?

676
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,362
That's an 0-8-4 in and of itself.

677
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:05,097
We can't stay here too long.

678
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,693
The Chronicoms are coming,
and they seem to be planning

679
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:09,601
some sort of landing or invasion.

680
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,403
So we need to be ready
for the next move.

681
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:14,473
I was hoping the 0-8-4s
might be just that.

682
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:16,475
Maybe they are.

683
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:22,682
What are you doing?

684
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,484
Holy matrimony.

685
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,797
How do you know how to do this?

686
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:41,333
I just know they need to be married.

687
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:42,868
Two becomes one.

688
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,437
Then three becomes one.

689
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,473
Why do I know this?

690
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,518
We're missing something.

691
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,254
Sorry I'm late!

692
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,397
Damn bus broke down.

693
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:15,200
Where did you get this?

694
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,169
I don't remember exactly.

695
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:19,037
Maybe from my friend Enoch

696
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,474
or, uh, one of the Koenigs.

697
00:38:22,243 --> 00:38:23,510
Thank you.

698
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:28,013
Coulson, what's happening?

699
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:30,082
It's possible

700
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:33,418
Enoch deposited these over the decades.

701
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,021
Okay, but why?

702
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:37,422
It might be a weapon
to fight the Chronicoms.

703
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:44,764
A singing key.

704
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,617
So... what's in there?

705
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:07,953
The end or the beginning.

706
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:10,022
I can't remember.

707
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,547
I don't know if it's supposed
to explode or save us,

708
00:39:35,549 --> 00:39:37,583
but I have to admit...

709
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,518
kinda disappointed.

710
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,820
There's got to be something else.

711
00:39:41,822 --> 00:39:43,809
Jemma, I know that somewhere inside

712
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:45,123
that you understand this.

713
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,092
Just think, okay? You...

714
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,428
You knew how to put the pieces together.

715
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,230
You knew about the singing key.

716
00:39:51,232 --> 00:39:53,599
You kept... You kept saying
that you were married.

717
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,934
"I now pronounce you..."

718
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,803
You said those words.

719
00:39:57,805 --> 00:39:59,038
I did.

720
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,510
You were all there.

721
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:07,613
We were.

722
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,716
I was married.

723
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:15,020
I am married.

724
00:40:15,022 --> 00:40:16,622
I have proof.

725
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:28,667
Why can't I remember whom I married?

726
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:07,606
Jemma.

727
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,241
Fitz.

728
00:41:11,278 --> 00:41:12,679
You did it.

729
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:13,687
Hey! It worked!

730
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:16,224
No, stop... stop that.

731
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:19,285
She doesn't remember me, does she?

732
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,626
Damn.

733
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:30,017
We'll return in a moment.

734
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,524
Can you tell where Daisy Johnson went?

735
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:36,060
There's a new statistical anomaly...

736
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:39,630
a massive power drain in New York City.

737
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:43,033
S.H.I.E.L.D. has a
safe house in New York.

738
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:44,389
It's not in any files.

739
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:46,091
It wasn't targeted by your lasers.

740
00:41:46,093 --> 00:41:48,194
They've probably gone there to regroup.

741
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,463
Assign me some Hunters,

742
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,432
and I will personally
finish off S.H.I.E.L.D.

743
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:54,933
before we begin the invasion.

744
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:58,338
There is less than a 22%
chance of you succeeding.

745
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:05,244
Here's something much more interesting.

746
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:08,700
There's a 100% chance
that this is the last time

747
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:11,503
the S.H.I.E.L.D. team
will ever be together.

748
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:15,787
The end is at hand.

749
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:21,152
I'm just glad to
see you all in one piece.

750
00:42:21,154 --> 00:42:22,488
- One piece?
- Aren't you worried?

751
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,690
- Simmons' mind is in shambles.
- Give her time.

752
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:24,992
Hopefully no serious
damage has been done.

753
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:26,095
What do you mean, "no damage"?

754
00:42:26,097 --> 00:42:28,297
- The Chronicom fleet destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D.
- That won't matter.

755
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:30,399
We can still get back
to our original timeline

756
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:31,502
and save it.

757
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:33,740
We can go back?

758
00:42:35,743 --> 00:42:38,111
Yes. That's where I just came from.

759
00:42:39,313 --> 00:42:41,380
Look, I... I kn... I know
that it hasn't been easy.

760
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:43,087
You made sacrifices.

761
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:44,750
Clearly, so did we.

762
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:46,527
But there was no other way.

763
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,262
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- Not easy?

764
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:49,563
No other way? Are you kidding?

765
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:50,732
- And where the hell have you been?
- Listen!

766
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,535
The only way we can save
the original timeline

767
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:54,271
was for you to survive through this one.

768
00:42:54,273 --> 00:42:55,674
You saw how this would play out?

769
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:58,377
I saw countless versions
of how it could unfold.

770
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:59,774
But we had no choice.

771
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:01,909
Just threw us into the deep
end and hope we don't drown?

772
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,844
We hope that you survive this far

773
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:05,247
to give us the key to save our world.

774
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,882
Key? W-What key?

775
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:09,417
Kora.

776
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,659
Did Kora survive?

777
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:19,822
Yes.

778
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,090
Oh, thank God.

779
00:43:21,092 --> 00:43:22,691
Where is she?

780
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:25,461
She's with the enemy...
Nathaniel Malick.

781
00:43:25,463 --> 00:43:26,822
What? What happened?

782
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:28,697
She's your sister. Didn't
you connect? Jiaying...

783
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:30,367
Jiaying is dead.

784
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:35,839
But she is pivotal.

785
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:39,108
Okay. All right. Uh...

786
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,877
We'll need to find a
way to work around that.

787
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:43,146
Here. Um, right now, we need to get

788
00:43:43,148 --> 00:43:45,216
this Quantum Bridge onto the Zephyr.

789
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:46,547
- Hold on.
- We need to hook it up

790
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:48,618
- so we can all fly home together.
- We can't leave.

791
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,921
Yes, we can.

792
00:43:49,923 --> 00:43:51,318
We can't... Okay, look, I'm sorry,

793
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,454
I know there's a lot to explain...

794
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:53,857
the multiple dimensions...

795
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,926
Okay, look, you went back in time,
and then you branched off.

796
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,762
But we can travel through something

797
00:43:59,764 --> 00:44:01,730
called the Quantum Realm.

798
00:44:01,732 --> 00:44:03,932
So, we... we... we... we
can go in between timelines.

799
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,802
I mean we can't abandon these people.

800
00:44:07,203 --> 00:44:09,037
We can't leave this timeline
with the Chronicoms

801
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:10,540
about to launch an all-out invasion.

802
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:12,474
And if we do, we have to
take the enemy back with us.

803
00:44:12,476 --> 00:44:14,110
No, I understand that. I do.

804
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,211
But that decreases
the chances of success

805
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:17,837
a fair amount... something like 85%.

806
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,115
- Don't talk to me about percentages.
- This is not math.

807
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:21,417
You sound like a robot.

808
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:22,851
Can everyone please stop yelling?

809
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:25,254
This isn't some abstract
or virtual world,

810
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:26,488
like the Framework.

811
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,526
These people, they've suffered enough.

812
00:44:30,528 --> 00:44:32,729
This reduces you?

813
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:35,264
Subatomic?

814
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,299
Does it create an energy field to do it?

815
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:40,202
Yes, a bubble, for...
for want of a better word.

816
00:44:40,204 --> 00:44:41,637
No, no.

817
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,306
No, "bubble" is a great word.

818
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,040
Because you can make it bigger.

819
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:46,475
I-If we use enough energy,

820
00:44:46,477 --> 00:44:48,944
we can bring all the
Chronicom ships back with us.

821
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:51,180
I don't know if the Zephyr
can generate enough power to...

822
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:53,982
No, but 1983 New York City can, right?

823
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:55,517
Uh... y-yeah.

824
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,620
I... We'd need something
like 10,000 megawatts,

825
00:44:58,622 --> 00:45:00,155
but s-someone would have to...

826
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:03,392
Stay behind and set it
up and turn it on... yeah.

827
00:45:03,394 --> 00:45:05,194
We have to break up the band.

828
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:07,863
I don't know if that matters.

829
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:11,166
'Cause this... this is the
last mission together, isn't it?

830
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:17,840
How could you know that?

831
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:19,142
Enoch told us.

832
00:45:20,588 --> 00:45:22,755
Before he died.

833
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:28,195
Yeah, that's true.

834
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:32,898
In fact, no matter what the outcome,

835
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,769
this will be the last time we're
all in the same room together.

836
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:39,606
Ever.

837
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,810
I'll stay.

838
00:45:45,713 --> 00:45:47,380
I belong here.

839
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:49,382
I've already been given the
privilege of a second chance,

840
00:45:49,384 --> 00:45:52,452
of meeting all you... fine people.

841
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:55,722
It's only right.

842
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:02,561
If the Army taught me
anything, it's that...

843
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:04,531
- it's that you can't...
- Pbbbbbht!

844
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:06,699
I'll stay.

845
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:07,800
D.

846
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:09,236
First of all, I'm the one

847
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:11,655
with the scientific knowledge
to be able to repatch the power.

848
00:46:11,657 --> 00:46:13,806
Dannyboy over here is still
impressed by a light bulb.

849
00:46:13,808 --> 00:46:15,142
That's not accurate or nice.

850
00:46:15,144 --> 00:46:16,844
And second, seems like you and Daisy

851
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:18,646
have a real thing going, and I...

852
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:21,648
I just want you to be happy.

853
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,001
Deke...

854
00:46:23,003 --> 00:46:25,953
And third, as long as
you reconnect with Nana

855
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:28,789
and then, you know...

856
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,125
connect...

857
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:31,792
then maybe you'll see me again someday.

858
00:46:31,794 --> 00:46:33,894
- Deke, that's...
- And honestly...

859
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:38,932
... I'm kind of a rock god here, anyway.

860
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:46,340
All right, people!

861
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:47,674
No time to argue.

862
00:46:47,676 --> 00:46:50,811
I've already made up my
mind. Now let's get to it!

863
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,016
Come on, people. Let's go, let's go.

864
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:24,211
Keep it snappy. We're
running out of time.

865
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:34,722
Seconds away.

866
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:38,695
All set on this end, Director.

867
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:40,231
Watch over little Alphie, will you?

868
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:42,100
Hell, watch over all of us.

869
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:43,989
You know I will. I don't...

870
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:45,566
You don't give up on friends.

871
00:47:45,568 --> 00:47:47,802
I know better than anyone.

872
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:50,938
Thank you for everything, Agent Shaw.

873
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,072
Get ready!

874
00:47:52,074 --> 00:47:53,106
Here we go.

875
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:54,474
One, two...

876
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:56,811
Wait, wait. Like, on three or,
like, "One, two, three, go"?

877
00:47:56,813 --> 00:47:58,378
On three, damn it.

878
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,447
One, two, three.

879
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:24,905
So...

880
00:48:24,907 --> 00:48:26,940
you the new guy in charge now?

881
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:35,950
Yes.

882
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:48,643
Okay. Okay, I need to... I
need to take it slow with her,

883
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:49,812
or her mind might collapse.

884
00:48:49,814 --> 00:48:51,048
Just get her to remember you.

885
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,450
That's the most important thing.

886
00:48:52,452 --> 00:48:53,886
No, it's not.

887
00:48:53,888 --> 00:48:56,886
I need to take something small
that she does remember,

888
00:48:56,888 --> 00:48:59,523
and I'm gonna draw a line
from that to all of the rest.

889
00:49:01,226 --> 00:49:02,994
Okay.

890
00:49:04,796 --> 00:49:05,863
Jemma.

891
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:10,717
I-I was gonna tell your friends
a story, and I was wondering

892
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,221
if you could help me fill
in some of the blanks.

893
00:49:14,873 --> 00:49:16,873
It's okay. We know him.

894
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:19,584
Yeah. And I... I know some
things about you, too.

895
00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:21,878
Like, when you were
younger, you had scoliosis.

896
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,947
Yeah?

897
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:25,050
And y-you would spend your
nights lying on your back

898
00:49:25,052 --> 00:49:26,553
with your father...

899
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:29,119
Looking up at the stars.

900
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:30,354
Yeah.

901
00:49:31,957 --> 00:49:34,491
And do you remember what
your favorite star was?

902
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:36,027
Theta Serpentis.

903
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:40,930
Though, technically, it was
a... a triple star system

904
00:49:40,932 --> 00:49:43,066
in the constellation, uh, Serpens.

905
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:44,267
No, no, that's right. That's right.

906
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:46,104
What was the traditional name of it?

907
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:47,706
The biggest star in that system?

908
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:51,142
Alya.

909
00:49:53,312 --> 00:49:54,378
Yeah.

910
00:49:56,181 --> 00:49:57,314
Okay.

911
00:49:57,316 --> 00:49:59,149
I want you to lock on to that name,

912
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:01,018
because that's where we went.

913
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:09,125
Enoch saved us, wearing another skin.

914
00:50:09,127 --> 00:50:10,660
What do we have to do?

915
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:15,265
Change the natural course
of your lives forever.

916
00:50:15,267 --> 00:50:17,233
And he got us out of there.

917
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:24,674
Hey.

918
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:25,777
Hi.

919
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:29,242
Turn this Quinjet around.

920
00:50:29,244 --> 00:50:31,078
What the hell are you?

921
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,216
Enoch, put your face on.

922
00:50:33,218 --> 00:50:34,951
You're freaking everybody out.

923
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:36,178
Listen, Piper.

924
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,681
We need to head back into
the jungle, to Zephyr One.

925
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:38,822
What, to help take out Izel?

926
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:39,989
Uh, Izel... right.

927
00:50:39,991 --> 00:50:41,491
No, we have bigger problems than that.

928
00:50:41,493 --> 00:50:43,293
Uh, is that a normal thing around here?

929
00:50:43,295 --> 00:50:45,195
Yeah.

930
00:50:45,197 --> 00:50:46,863
How did you know the jet would be here?

931
00:50:46,865 --> 00:50:48,865
How are you predicting these things?

932
00:50:48,867 --> 00:50:51,835
It's called the Time Stream.

933
00:50:51,837 --> 00:50:53,670
I stole a copy of it.

934
00:50:53,672 --> 00:50:56,373
My time with Fitz taught
me how to be an outlaw,

935
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:58,508
and I've gotten quite good at it.

936
00:51:06,785 --> 00:51:09,052
Flint made us a piece
of the Time Monolith

937
00:51:09,054 --> 00:51:11,422
to help us do what had to be done.

938
00:51:16,228 --> 00:51:18,094
Thank you.

939
00:51:18,096 --> 00:51:20,430
Now, wait here a moment.

940
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:22,399
We'll be right back.

941
00:51:32,244 --> 00:51:34,344
We need to get away from
here and head to space.

942
00:51:34,346 --> 00:51:36,212
So pick a star system.

943
00:51:36,214 --> 00:51:37,747
I know just the one.

944
00:51:45,357 --> 00:51:48,258
We arrived safely in that
distant solar system,

945
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,727
and I began to study the Time Stream.

946
00:51:56,268 --> 00:51:58,835
Jemma, you were afraid
it would drive me mad

947
00:51:58,837 --> 00:52:01,157
or give me radiation
poisoning to interact with it.

948
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,606
But we had no choice.

949
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:05,976
We needed solutions.

950
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:09,446
And there was only one path

951
00:52:09,448 --> 00:52:12,883
that gave us a chance to succeed.

952
00:52:16,488 --> 00:52:18,956
We knew it would take a while
to complete our designs.

953
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:23,126
It's a good thing we are
building a time machine,

954
00:52:23,128 --> 00:52:25,361
as it does not matter how long it takes.

955
00:52:25,363 --> 00:52:28,865
Could just take some time to...

956
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:30,401
live.

957
00:52:31,937 --> 00:52:33,970
And we did.

958
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:35,104
Yeah.

959
00:52:35,106 --> 00:52:36,372
We did.

960
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:38,342
For years.

961
00:52:40,312 --> 00:52:42,913
We had our happily ever after.

962
00:52:44,316 --> 00:52:47,116
We knew our friends needed
us, not to mention mankind.

963
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:49,752
But we didn't want to say goodbye.

964
00:52:49,754 --> 00:52:51,522
So we put it off.

965
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,293
But we couldn't stay forever.

966
00:52:57,295 --> 00:53:00,530
But I feel the guilt inside...
the guilt for having left.

967
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:02,732
A part of me being torn away!

968
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:04,234
No, I don't want to forget!

969
00:53:04,236 --> 00:53:06,035
- Hey, hey.
- I don't want to forget!

970
00:53:23,054 --> 00:53:26,022
So we jumped back to the moment we left.

971
00:53:34,366 --> 00:53:35,598
That was quick.

972
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,334
How'd that thing get here so fast?

973
00:53:38,336 --> 00:53:40,371
Oh, come on. Are you guys
messing with time again?

974
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:41,471
It's complicated.

975
00:53:41,473 --> 00:53:42,690
But Fitz needs to wait in here

976
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:44,374
so he can be transported
through the Quantum Realm

977
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:45,675
to an alternative timeline.

978
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:47,544
That doesn't sound complicated at all.

979
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:49,679
While he's in there, you need
to guard it with your life.

980
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:51,381
Like there's nothing more
important in the world.

981
00:53:51,383 --> 00:53:52,405
Yeah, we get it.

982
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,417
No. You don't.

983
00:53:54,419 --> 00:53:55,679
If you keep this safe,

984
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:57,604
I will give you anything
you ask for in return.

985
00:53:57,606 --> 00:53:59,073
Understand?

986
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:00,123
Yeah.

987
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,525
If I'm not back by sunup, open it.

988
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:04,394
You'll know what to do.

989
00:54:06,531 --> 00:54:08,332
Okay, good to go.

990
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:11,735
We're on the clock now.

991
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,540
Jemma.

992
00:54:17,842 --> 00:54:20,277
For us, it will be an instant.

993
00:54:24,249 --> 00:54:25,415
Stay strong.

994
00:54:32,424 --> 00:54:33,790
One of us had to stay

995
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:36,526
to establish the link between timelines,

996
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:38,027
and it had to be me,

997
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:40,630
because my mind couldn't
handle the implant.

998
00:54:44,436 --> 00:54:46,469
Jemma Simmons...

999
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,439
where is Leopold Fitz?

1000
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:52,141
I...

1001
00:54:52,143 --> 00:54:53,242
I don't know.

1002
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:57,747
I didn't see the rest.

1003
00:54:57,749 --> 00:54:59,382
But now we know it worked.

1004
00:55:10,528 --> 00:55:12,963
You were with me that whole time.

1005
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:16,834
Fitz.

1006
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,136
Yeah.

1007
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:21,205
Jemma.

1008
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:24,574
But why, though? W-Why...

1009
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:26,109
Why would we stay so long?

1010
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:27,545
I can't follow that logic.

1011
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:29,681
Why... Why would we do any of it?

1012
00:55:29,683 --> 00:55:31,384
That doesn't... That's not a...

1013
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:33,750
She's remembering that she knows
him... just not that she loves him.

1014
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:35,985
That doesn't... make sense.

1015
00:55:35,987 --> 00:55:37,453
No, no, no.

1016
00:55:37,455 --> 00:55:40,391
She's forgotten something
far more important than that.

1017
00:55:40,393 --> 00:55:41,691
Okay, I need to fill you guys in

1018
00:55:41,693 --> 00:55:43,760
so you know what we're fighting for...

1019
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:45,896
so that we can map out a plan together

1020
00:55:45,898 --> 00:55:47,864
and all be willing to do
what needs to be done,

1021
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:49,499
no matter what the cost.

1022
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:51,068
There are so many moving parts.

1023
00:55:52,437 --> 00:55:54,504
Which is another reason
why you built Coulson.

1024
00:55:54,506 --> 00:55:55,772
For this moment, yeah.

1025
00:55:55,774 --> 00:55:57,507
'Cause we all need to work
together to figure this out.

1026
00:55:57,509 --> 00:55:59,275
Well, lay it out for us, Fitz.

1027
00:55:59,277 --> 00:56:01,797
'Cause the enemy's coming up with
a plan, and they're not happy.

1028
00:56:05,016 --> 00:56:06,215
Out of time?

1029
00:56:06,217 --> 00:56:08,178
If you'd have given me
control of your Hunters,

1030
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,619
I would've crushed them.

1031
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:11,721
It seems you can't control anything.

1032
00:56:11,723 --> 00:56:13,289
None of that matters anymore!

1033
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,524
We got pulled out of reality

1034
00:56:14,526 --> 00:56:16,594
and into this Grateful Dead poster!

1035
00:56:16,596 --> 00:56:20,432
I was moments away from ruling...

1036
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,835
... saving the world
from tyranny... whatever.

1037
00:56:25,837 --> 00:56:27,700
There's a 99% chance

1038
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:29,972
we're crossing to
their original timeline...

1039
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:33,643
a world already under attack
from a separate Chronicom force.

1040
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:35,511
We need to stop playing percentages

1041
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:37,180
and get to the business of killing.

1042
00:56:37,182 --> 00:56:38,816
Earth is still within our grasp.

1043
00:56:40,085 --> 00:56:42,652
Nobody knows the future anymore.

1044
00:56:52,097 --> 00:56:53,663
Hook her up.

1045
00:56:53,665 --> 00:56:55,132
It's time to take her power.

1046
00:56:57,902 --> 00:56:59,635
I think we're close!

1047
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:01,904
Everyone's clear on
what needs to be done.

1048
00:57:01,906 --> 00:57:04,040
You two go with Fitz and
Simmons, retake the Lighthouse.

1049
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:05,074
- Right.
- Copy that.

1050
00:57:05,076 --> 00:57:07,177
But first, you need to put these on.

1051
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:13,483
We'll arrive just before we left.

1052
00:57:13,485 --> 00:57:15,418
So, believe it or not,

1053
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,688
there's unfinished
business at the Temple.

1054
00:57:20,592 --> 00:57:22,458
Yeah, I know.

1055
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,740
I don't believe it, either.

1056
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:52,814
The Hunters are gonna
be scanning for us everywhere.

1057
00:57:52,816 --> 00:57:55,149
Hang tight. We gotta
wait for our moment.

1058
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:04,349
Zephyr One is out there somewhere.

1059
00:58:04,351 --> 00:58:05,785
We are not seeing any...

1060
00:58:05,787 --> 00:58:07,026
Find it.

1061
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:08,062
Destroy it.

1062
00:58:24,647 --> 00:58:27,081
Good. They sent reinforcements.

1063
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,790
Thank you for coming.

1064
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:37,860
We must move quickly and calmly.

1065
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:42,964
Do not speak. Do not engage.

1066
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:46,234
I'm just trying not to
throw up in my helmet.

1067
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:03,352
Give Yo-Yo her breathing apparatus.

1068
00:59:05,588 --> 00:59:08,390
Set the chamber temperature
to minus-68 degrees.

1069
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:10,958
Where's Fitz?

1070
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,227
I don't know.

1071
00:59:13,229 --> 00:59:14,829
I can't know.

1072
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:26,538
Wait for it.

1073
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,574
Wait for it.

1074
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:28,976
You don't need to keep saying it.

1075
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:33,581
Zephyr One spotted moving
on the surface of the Earth.

1076
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,249
Fire!

1077
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:40,988
Now!

1078
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:04,213
Be ready.

1079
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:21,729
Quinjet team, head
back to the Lighthouse.

1080
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:22,863
On our way.

1081
01:00:22,865 --> 01:00:25,199
That's some serious flying there.

1082
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:27,035
That used to be all I did.

1083
01:00:30,773 --> 01:00:33,040
No sign of Zephyr One.

1084
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:35,276
It looks as though it's been destroyed.

1085
01:00:35,278 --> 01:00:37,345
I don't believe it.

1086
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:40,414
No matter the percentages,

1087
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:43,184
these people always beat the odds.

1088
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,360
They definitely heard that.

1089
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:55,896
Remember, these things are
radioactive, so be careful.

1090
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:13,547
Go. I got this.

1091
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:15,283
Go!

1092
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,856
Hope this works.

1093
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:23,924
You hope. I'll pray.

1094
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:41,042
Time for you to be reassigned.

1095
01:01:43,813 --> 01:01:45,881
So, this is it?

1096
01:01:49,419 --> 01:01:51,285
This is it.

1097
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,120
I've studied your history,

1098
01:01:53,122 --> 01:01:55,423
know all the enemies you've faced.

1099
01:01:55,425 --> 01:01:58,893
I am honored to be the last.

1100
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:29,706
So, that's what she can do.

1101
01:02:37,813 --> 01:02:39,713
Anything I can do to
help point the antennas

1102
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:42,118
- in the right direction?
- Can you rewire the capacitor connections

1103
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,988
to bypass the network backbone?

1104
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,021
Nope.

1105
01:02:45,023 --> 01:02:46,723
We were here.

1106
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,860
He said it'd be the hardest
thing we've ever done.

1107
01:02:48,862 --> 01:02:49,960
We know.

1108
01:02:49,962 --> 01:02:52,095
They'll bang through
the door soon enough.

1109
01:02:52,097 --> 01:02:54,798
Hopefully, not before our
friends handle their part.

1110
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,499
Don't worry too much about Mack.

1111
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:58,703
Don't worry too much about Daisy.

1112
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,074
They're your everything.

1113
01:03:04,176 --> 01:03:06,277
Stars in your skies.

1114
01:03:07,813 --> 01:03:08,813
Fitz.

1115
01:03:10,015 --> 01:03:12,148
I think I remember.

1116
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,150
Why we did all this.

1117
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:20,992
I think I remember
what we're fighting for.

1118
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:32,804
If you've seen my battles,
you know how this will end.

1119
01:03:32,806 --> 01:03:35,773
You know, I don't... for
the first time in a while.

1120
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,009
Can't wait to see how it plays out.

1121
01:03:39,011 --> 01:03:41,911
Like it did with your mother, maybe?

1122
01:03:41,913 --> 01:03:44,080
The only enemy we both fought.

1123
01:03:44,082 --> 01:03:45,594
Someone needed to rescue you,

1124
01:03:45,596 --> 01:03:49,085
whereas I snapped her
neck, fair and square.

1125
01:03:58,524 --> 01:04:00,430
Aah!

1126
01:04:25,957 --> 01:04:27,457
Hang in there.

1127
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:41,738
Feels good to strike you down.

1128
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,240
But you wanna do worse.

1129
01:04:46,244 --> 01:04:50,280
I can give any Hunter orders
remotely using only my mind.

1130
01:04:50,282 --> 01:04:52,415
You're next.

1131
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:55,185
Once I tear everything
but Chronicom hardware

1132
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:56,219
out of you.

1133
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:57,587
There's no need.

1134
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:59,155
The war's over.

1135
01:04:59,157 --> 01:05:00,523
You surrender?

1136
01:05:00,525 --> 01:05:01,758
We won.

1137
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,703
Fitz and Simmons are
retaking the Lighthouse

1138
01:05:03,705 --> 01:05:04,972
as we speak.

1139
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:08,830
Oh. A creepy smile.

1140
01:05:08,832 --> 01:05:09,999
That's new.

1141
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:12,169
So that's where they are.

1142
01:05:17,175 --> 01:05:19,909
All available Hunters,
disembark for the Lighthouse,

1143
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:22,245
where we have established a stronghold.

1144
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:24,214
All spacecraft, prepare to fire

1145
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:27,317
on previously targeted
S.H.I.E.L.D. posts.

1146
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:29,620
Now it's my turn to smile.

1147
01:05:32,023 --> 01:05:34,991
We just needed you to
enter your authorization.

1148
01:05:34,993 --> 01:05:36,793
Oh?

1149
01:05:36,795 --> 01:05:38,696
And what comes next?

1150
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:43,032
The Cavalry.

1151
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,399
Nope.

1152
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:18,810
We need to make sure the transmission's

1153
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,829
- pointed in the right direction.
- She's too weak.

1154
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:22,063
I don't know if she'll be able

1155
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:23,643
to boost the signal
enough to reach Earth.

1156
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:25,046
Kora, look at me.

1157
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:27,082
Look at me.

1158
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:29,452
We're fighting for the very
thing that gives us strength.

1159
01:06:31,508 --> 01:06:33,409
Do you need me to tell you what that is?

1160
01:06:35,212 --> 01:06:36,212
No.

1161
01:06:42,386 --> 01:06:43,985
I can do it.

1162
01:06:55,532 --> 01:06:58,200
Okay, parabolic antennae
are nearly in position.

1163
01:07:06,977 --> 01:07:09,344
I hope you know how to
give the Chronicoms orders.

1164
01:07:09,346 --> 01:07:11,481
We aren't giving them orders.

1165
01:07:15,052 --> 01:07:17,018
We're giving them empathy.

1166
01:08:24,721 --> 01:08:25,988
Hey, there.

1167
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:28,724
You friends or enemies?

1168
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:34,697
Friends.

1169
01:08:36,433 --> 01:08:38,266
As we have always been.

1170
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,503
Daisy.

1171
01:08:57,505 --> 01:09:00,789
We have to let her do her part,
no matter what the cost.

1172
01:09:07,255 --> 01:09:08,923
Do you think you're winning?

1173
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:10,470
'Cause I can't tell.

1174
01:09:10,472 --> 01:09:12,972
It's a close one, but
I could go all day.

1175
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:14,173
Good.

1176
01:09:14,175 --> 01:09:15,575
That's what we were hoping for.

1177
01:09:15,577 --> 01:09:16,676
Is that right?

1178
01:09:16,678 --> 01:09:18,444
Those sparks?

1179
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,446
That means Kora's purged
all the Chronicom data

1180
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,514
from the planet.

1181
01:09:21,516 --> 01:09:23,684
Turned the attack to our side.

1182
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,019
Mission accomplished.

1183
01:09:30,892 --> 01:09:32,759
Down on the planet.

1184
01:09:32,761 --> 01:09:35,228
But up here...

1185
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:38,220
these ships are about to vaporize

1186
01:09:38,222 --> 01:09:39,556
your friends down below.

1187
01:09:40,602 --> 01:09:42,502
And you can't stop that.

1188
01:09:42,504 --> 01:09:45,278
There is no way to kill me

1189
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,648
without killing yourself.

1190
01:09:58,586 --> 01:09:59,586
That's the idea.

1191
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,550
Thank you, Kora.

1192
01:11:08,356 --> 01:11:09,990
This is what we were fighting for.

1193
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,227
Family.

1194
01:11:16,331 --> 01:11:17,914
Okay, that was a neat trick.

1195
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,550
But how did you...

1196
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:25,705
What the hell, man?! We
were scared out of our minds.

1197
01:11:25,707 --> 01:11:28,275
Are you saying that we were
guarding this thing for nothing?

1198
01:11:30,178 --> 01:11:31,310
No.

1199
01:11:31,312 --> 01:11:33,646
You were guarding our everything.

1200
01:11:44,692 --> 01:11:45,859
Alya?

1201
01:11:47,562 --> 01:11:48,928
Mama!

1202
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:54,001
Ohh!

1203
01:12:06,381 --> 01:12:08,247
Mama, what's wrong?

1204
01:12:08,249 --> 01:12:09,615
Nothing, sweet girl.

1205
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,484
Nothing. I'm sorry.

1206
01:12:11,486 --> 01:12:13,586
I'm sorry.

1207
01:12:33,007 --> 01:12:37,076
You said you would be
gone for a long time,

1208
01:12:37,078 --> 01:12:38,679
but that wasn't long.

1209
01:12:41,282 --> 01:12:43,416
Felt like forever to me.

1210
01:12:43,418 --> 01:12:45,284
There was a loud noise.

1211
01:12:45,286 --> 01:12:46,886
I know.

1212
01:12:46,888 --> 01:12:49,722
I was only a little scared.

1213
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:53,359
Me too, sweetie.

1214
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:54,927
Me too.

1215
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:21,054
There he is.

1216
01:13:21,056 --> 01:13:22,255
You're looking good.

1217
01:13:22,257 --> 01:13:24,057
You're looking good.

1218
01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:25,860
I never change.

1219
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,133
Long time no see.

1220
01:13:33,135 --> 01:13:34,202
Hi, guys.

1221
01:13:39,778 --> 01:13:41,246
Hey.

1222
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:43,883
Well, this is a nice venue.
Whose idea was this?

1223
01:13:47,148 --> 01:13:48,181
Where's Mack?

1224
01:13:48,183 --> 01:13:49,950
Turtleman is always late.

1225
01:13:49,952 --> 01:13:52,385
He knows. He'll be here.

1226
01:13:53,755 --> 01:13:55,422
Am I the last one?

1227
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:56,755
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry.

1228
01:13:56,757 --> 01:13:59,392
Ah, there was a situation in Moscow

1229
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:01,328
that needed my attention.

1230
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:03,197
A story worth telling?

1231
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:07,235
Well, it's, uh... it's classified.

1232
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:09,937
Of course.

1233
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:12,772
You enjoying the new digs?

1234
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:15,387
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's
nice. You know, it's, uh...

1235
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:17,456
Yeah, but after all those
years in hallways,

1236
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:20,493
uh, I'm... I'm just not
used to having a view.

1237
01:14:20,495 --> 01:14:22,328
Are you still stationed there, too?

1238
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,929
I'm on assignment, actually...

1239
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:26,732
chasing an 0-8-4, of all things.

1240
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:29,969
Yeah, she's our most decorated Agent.

1241
01:14:29,971 --> 01:14:32,438
Okay, okay. I've got a good team.

1242
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,073
We work well together.

1243
01:14:34,075 --> 01:14:37,143
Although Piper, I think,
is questioning her choice.

1244
01:14:37,145 --> 01:14:38,344
What, taking on the assignment?

1245
01:14:38,346 --> 01:14:41,380
No, the choice she made when
you and Simmons asked her

1246
01:14:41,382 --> 01:14:42,715
what she wanted for a reward.

1247
01:14:46,554 --> 01:14:48,754
And you, Melinda?

1248
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:50,589
How are you liking your new profession?

1249
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:51,658
I hate it.

1250
01:14:52,762 --> 01:14:54,226
No, you don't.

1251
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:57,129
I fought aliens, demons, and androids,

1252
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:59,432
and this is the first time in my life

1253
01:14:59,434 --> 01:15:01,534
I've ever felt this exhausted.

1254
01:15:01,536 --> 01:15:02,936
Amen to that.

1255
01:15:02,938 --> 01:15:04,801
What do you know about being exhausted?

1256
01:15:04,803 --> 01:15:06,405
You're retired.

1257
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:08,341
Only someone without
kids would say that.

1258
01:15:08,343 --> 01:15:10,144
Yeah. She's a lot.

1259
01:15:10,146 --> 01:15:11,195
She's the best.

1260
01:15:11,197 --> 01:15:12,764
She's learning to swim right now.

1261
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:14,366
- Aww.
- Send videos, please.

1262
01:15:14,368 --> 01:15:15,828
She wants to design her own fish.

1263
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:17,384
- Aww.
- We have to tell her it's not possible.

1264
01:15:17,386 --> 01:15:19,887
Well, it's possible. It's
just not legal... yet.

1265
01:15:19,889 --> 01:15:22,558
Well, did she, uh... she
get Uncle Mack's present?

1266
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,960
Yes. Thank you.

1267
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:26,500
Yeah, thank you for
all the many presents.

1268
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:27,702
One a year is plenty.

1269
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:29,363
Oh, come on, Fitz. What about Christmas?

1270
01:15:29,365 --> 01:15:30,498
It's overrated.

1271
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,833
We did get a very nice
letter from Agent Sousa.

1272
01:15:33,835 --> 01:15:35,896
So cute he writes letters.

1273
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,571
I know, right? I just
got him a typewriter.

1274
01:15:38,573 --> 01:15:40,206
Speaking of a kid on Christmas.

1275
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:44,411
Things are going... well?

1276
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:47,913
They're going, yeah.

1277
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:50,850
We're just, like, loving
the journey together.

1278
01:15:50,852 --> 01:15:53,487
I showed him "E.T". to prep for it.

1279
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:54,702
- Great movie.
- Classic.

1280
01:15:54,704 --> 01:15:56,255
He cried like a baby.

1281
01:15:56,257 --> 01:15:59,761
Um, but he's... he's...
he's made for this work.

1282
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:01,127
He's solid.

1283
01:16:01,129 --> 01:16:03,429
But he does keep calling
us the "Astro Ambassadors",

1284
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:05,064
so that's... yeah.

1285
01:16:05,066 --> 01:16:06,365
He's a dork.

1286
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:07,501
But he says hi.

1287
01:16:10,405 --> 01:16:11,604
Speaking of dorks...

1288
01:16:11,606 --> 01:16:12,672
Wow.

1289
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:15,476
What are you gonna do, A.C.?

1290
01:16:15,478 --> 01:16:16,575
Yeah.

1291
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,077
Yeah, I was gonna ask.

1292
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:21,380
You said you would
take the year to reassess.

1293
01:16:21,382 --> 01:16:22,548
Well...

1294
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:25,384
I figure I can always,
you know, turn off.

1295
01:16:25,386 --> 01:16:27,553
So no rush on that.

1296
01:16:27,555 --> 01:16:32,458
I'm gonna take a little time,
continue my reassessment.

1297
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,927
See the world.

1298
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:36,195
Right on.

1299
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:37,596
Glad to hear it.

1300
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:40,433
You know, after your sabbatical,
I could use you.

1301
01:16:40,435 --> 01:16:41,468
Yeah, me too.

1302
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,403
There's a bunk open on
Zephyr Three. It's a nice one.

1303
01:16:44,405 --> 01:16:46,673
I'll keep all that in mind.

1304
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:55,414
Guys, I'm going to
have to go in a minute.

1305
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,882
We're approaching the drop zone.

1306
01:16:56,884 --> 01:16:59,919
Okay, just remember...
minimal force, sweetheart.

1307
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:02,421
In and out, no contact... I know.

1308
01:17:02,423 --> 01:17:05,257
Uh, yeah, I-I have a
group waiting, so, um...

1309
01:17:05,259 --> 01:17:08,027
maybe we should just, uh, call it.

1310
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:11,264
Yeah, I'm losing signal anyway.
We're entering a Nebula.

1311
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:16,302
I vote we make this a tradition.

1312
01:17:16,304 --> 01:17:19,071
Yeah. I agree.

1313
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:21,417
We can't lose touch.

1314
01:17:21,419 --> 01:17:25,077
We've been through too much together.

1315
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:26,413
A miracle we survived.

1316
01:17:29,951 --> 01:17:32,552
Well... except for Coulson.

1317
01:17:33,888 --> 01:17:34,988
And Fitz.

1318
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,024
And Daisy.

1319
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,393
And May.

1320
01:17:37,395 --> 01:17:38,891
Geez, I was a zombie once.

1321
01:17:38,893 --> 01:17:40,292
So was Mack, actually.

1322
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:41,660
- Really?
- Yeah.

1323
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:42,729
Was I... Was I there for that?

1324
01:17:42,731 --> 01:17:45,166
Look, if this is a contest,
I died like seven times.

1325
01:17:45,168 --> 01:17:46,435
Is that all?

1326
01:17:46,437 --> 01:17:49,005
But I didn't even exist
in Deke's timeline.

1327
01:17:49,007 --> 01:17:50,402
Aw, Deke.

1328
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:51,637
Deke.

1329
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:53,806
I miss that little weirdo.

1330
01:17:53,808 --> 01:17:54,974
Yeah.

1331
01:17:54,976 --> 01:17:57,009
We may see him again one day.

1332
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:01,413
Look, I'm sure the D is doing just fine.

1333
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:03,855
I mean, he's probably playing
Madison Square Garden right now.

1334
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,090
All right, well...

1335
01:18:11,092 --> 01:18:12,425
I guess that's it.

1336
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:15,629
Same time next year?

1337
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:21,500
All right.

1338
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:23,303
Hasta la proxima.

1339
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:29,108
We're only a block
away from the drop-off?

1340
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,995
Yeah, but we should've
been there quicker,

1341
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:32,304
and you should be able to drive better.

1342
01:18:32,306 --> 01:18:33,340
You're a damn computer.

1343
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:34,980
I know, but either
they changed the signs

1344
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:36,650
or you programmed me a little stupider

1345
01:18:36,652 --> 01:18:37,985
so you could feel superior for once.

1346
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:40,786
I swear on all things holy, you
were always this stupid.

1347
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:42,588
Don't slow down, Davis.

1348
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:45,090
I'll see you on the other
side of the compound.

1349
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,934
Mack, I'll be sending a few names.

1350
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:56,402
Good.

1351
01:18:56,404 --> 01:18:57,770
And, Phil.

1352
01:18:57,772 --> 01:19:01,540
You know, you should at least
swing by on your travels,

1353
01:19:01,542 --> 01:19:03,643
tell some stories to the newcomers.

1354
01:19:06,614 --> 01:19:08,481
They'll love that.

1355
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:11,216
You might be seeing me.

1356
01:19:26,734 --> 01:19:28,233
You done finally?

1357
01:19:28,235 --> 01:19:30,369
We're five minutes late to class.

1358
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:32,371
You're late.

1359
01:19:32,373 --> 01:19:34,440
I'm giving the lecture.

1360
01:19:34,442 --> 01:19:36,075
That's not late.

1361
01:19:36,077 --> 01:19:37,676
That's dramatic.

1362
01:19:45,662 --> 01:19:47,096
This little monkey is punching me

1363
01:19:47,098 --> 01:19:48,253
as hard as she can in the leg.

1364
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:49,388
- We should go.
- Oh.

1365
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,391
Yeah.

1366
01:19:50,393 --> 01:19:51,824
Having a picnic in the garden.

1367
01:19:51,826 --> 01:19:53,026
She's been very patient.

1368
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:55,828
Well...

1369
01:19:56,998 --> 01:19:58,732
Bye, everybody.

1370
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:01,884
I'll e-mail you that anatomy analysis

1371
01:20:01,886 --> 01:20:03,335
after Fitz is asleep.

1372
01:20:03,337 --> 01:20:05,438
Interesting stuff.

1373
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:22,921
Aah!

1374
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:24,256
Ahh!

1375
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:29,829
You're at HQ?

1376
01:20:31,298 --> 01:20:33,465
So, then... you received the package.

1377
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:36,201
Sitting right in front of
me. Just need the code.

1378
01:20:36,203 --> 01:20:37,703
1-3-6.

1379
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:39,204
It's in there.

1380
01:20:39,206 --> 01:20:43,842
Along with a little,
um... going-away present.

1381
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:45,679
Is it what I think it is?

1382
01:20:45,681 --> 01:20:48,080
H-Hey, I'm still a mechanic at heart.

1383
01:20:48,082 --> 01:20:49,282
All right?

1384
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:55,221
Be careful out there.

1385
01:20:56,724 --> 01:20:57,990
Both of you.

1386
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:13,739
All stations, make
ready to get under way.

1387
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:15,708
Okay, everyone's in position.

1388
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,810
Let's move forward with the operation.

1389
01:21:17,812 --> 01:21:19,178
Everything's in place.

1390
01:21:23,517 --> 01:21:26,418
It's not the same without these guys.

1391
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,954
No, it's not.

1392
01:21:28,956 --> 01:21:30,990
Are you really just seeing the world?

1393
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:35,462
There's some places
I've always wanted to go.

1394
01:21:37,164 --> 01:21:38,531
Okay.

1395
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,301
But look at what you did here.

1396
01:21:42,803 --> 01:21:47,573
There are people out there who are lost,

1397
01:21:47,575 --> 01:21:51,643
people who show promise.

1398
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:54,012
If you don't find them, who will?

1399
01:21:54,014 --> 01:21:56,216
How's it going with your new recruit?

1400
01:22:00,821 --> 01:22:02,988
She's doing great.

1401
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:07,794
She's been through a lot, but, um...

1402
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:12,866
It's funny what can happen
when someone believes in you.

1403
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:18,171
Give me a call when you get back.

1404
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,740
Yes, sir.

1405
01:22:41,695 --> 01:22:42,862
They good?

1406
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:47,901
They're good.

1407
01:22:49,103 --> 01:22:50,803
Hey.

1408
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:52,437
You have to see this.

1409
01:23:10,658 --> 01:23:12,358
Amazing, right?

1410
01:23:14,962 --> 01:23:16,728
It's beautiful.

1411
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:25,998
Cool.

1412
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:41,949
