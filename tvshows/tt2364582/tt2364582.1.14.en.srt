155
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,894
Phil, come on.

156
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:33,396
Just because Fury gave
you this pretty plane

157
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,231
doesn't mean they won't
shoot it out of the sky.

158
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:37,066
<i>Why are you really here, Garrett?</i>

159
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,068
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any
security team to collect Quinn.

160
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:40,169
Why you?

161
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:45,375
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.

162
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:49,996
Then yesterday, your little Italian job
cost my team weeks of work.

163
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,865
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.

164
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,117
Quinn shot one of my agents.

165
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,753
She's on life support
in a med pod downstairs.

166
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:59,622
We are taking her to the
trauma center in Bethesda.

167
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,891
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?

168
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:05,061
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.

169
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:08,031
When he saw her yesterday,
seems he took it personally.

170
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,852
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.

171
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,771
I've lost three of my own chasing him.

172
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:17,073
Then you understand why
I can't give him to you

173
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,191
until we save my agent.

174
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,143
Because if she doesn't make it...

175
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:29,002
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip. [chuckles]

176
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:30,620
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.

177
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:32,154
You know, he still talks about

178
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,207
that thousand-yard shot
you took in Bandung.

179
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,993
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?

180
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:42,164
- Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
- Mm. [chuckles]

181
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,667
I mean, a guy could get soft
bunking in a space like this.

182
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,920
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?

183
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:51,291
- He died.
- That's tight.

184
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:54,077
You want to point me to the
box you're keeping Quinn?

185
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,513
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass
to the fridge for questioning.

186
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,699
[breathes sharply]

187
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:05,455
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.

188
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,574
But, uh, Quinn stays put
till Coulson says otherwise.

189
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,993
Come on, man.

190
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:13,830
Garrett was your S.O., too,
so you know how this works.

191
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:17,533
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.

192
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:20,536
It's my job to make sure
Garrett gets what he wants.

193
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:23,206
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.

194
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:28,210
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.

195
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:31,934
I'm sure he's tucked between
the jacuzzi and the squash court.

196
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:33,599
Hey.

197
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,551
[both grunting]

198
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,442
<i>Agent Ward, stand down.</i>

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,577
[coughs]

200
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,165
Agent Garrett and I have
come to an agreement.

201
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:52,168
<i>He convinced H.Q. he could
interrogate Quinn here</i>

202
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,737
on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.

203
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,457
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet
talker when I need to be.

204
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:01,127
You wouldn't believe what I
could talk this son of a gun into.

205
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:04,013
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.

206
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:05,798
<i>And thank you.</i>

207
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:09,418
Saving the girl's top priority,
and she might know something.

208
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:14,057
I've never heard of half the
drugs they gave Coulson... GH-325?

209
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:17,143
And what about this
robotic-assisted-neural-micro-surgery

210
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,995
they used to implant the Tahiti memories?

211
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,066
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.

212
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,180
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.

213
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,324
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.

214
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:33,543
He begged the doctors to let him die.

215
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:36,112
This is different. Skye's still alive.

216
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,914
We have to keep her that way.

217
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,582
[cellphone vibrates]

218
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:43,619
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.

219
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,421
[beep] Hello.

220
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:49,075
Yes.
Are you sure?

221
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:51,928
That can't be.

222
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:54,630
[door opens]

223
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,633
And here I thought I was
gonna get to play bad cop.

224
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,468
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.

225
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,355
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.

226
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,640
I... my head's still
ringing from the last visitor.

227
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,308
At least the last visitor
left you with a head.

228
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:09,112
<i>I'm not always that considerate.</i>

229
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:11,447
I'm interested in one
of your newer projects.

230
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:13,449
Hmm? Oh, but there are
so many to choose from.

231
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:14,483
[grunts]

232
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:18,320
Let me be clear... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.

233
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:20,823
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here

234
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,058
from throwing you out of this plane

235
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,043
is the very weak heartbeat
of a young agent downstairs,

236
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,379
and the only incentive I have
for not tearing your tongue out

237
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,714
is that you use it to answer my questions.

238
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,266
Is that clear?

239
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,259
<i>[mumbling] Mm-hmm.</i>

240
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,836
- You understand that?
- No.

241
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,337
[groans]

242
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,840
Aah. Ohh.

243
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,680
Tell us about Cybertek
and the Deathlok program.

244
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,233
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?

245
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:51,621
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?

246
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:53,923
Those are dangerous waters,
and the last agent that

247
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:56,192
waded into them wound up
with two in the stomach.

248
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,495
[grunting]

249
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,698
So... she's still alive?

250
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,534
Yeah. And you better
hope she stays that way.

251
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:09,589
Is that why you shot Skye, because
she saw what Cybertek delivered?

252
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,575
No.
I shot Skye because that's what

253
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,010
the Clairvoyant told me to do.

254
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,673
<i>May: You wanted to see me?</i>

255
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,098
I just got off the phone with
the trauma center in Bethesda.

256
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,783
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.

257
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,486
So we'll find a different doctor
there who operated on Coulson.

258
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,990
- That's the thing. Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.

259
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:29,909
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.

260
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:31,823
The doctors listed, the
operating-room number...

261
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,614
none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.

262
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,669
What I find surprising is
how a big-shot billionaire

263
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:42,171
could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.

264
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:43,673
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning,

265
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,609
but then I realized it
would be mutually beneficial.

266
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:48,794
He must have something
pretty terrible on you.

267
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,046
Shooting an unarmed girl?

268
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,100
Let's just say I learned the hard way
that obeying was in my best interest.

269
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,836
Yet... here you are.

270
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:04,527
Let me assure you it wasn't luck

271
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:07,596
that led me to your partner's
black sedan in Berlin

272
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:13,481
or that he'd open the door for a redhead
or those two agents in Morocco.

273
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,521
<i>Do you think it was
just a roll of the dice</i>

274
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:18,708
that my people found them in that Riad?

275
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:21,944
No, it was the Clairvoyant.

276
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,613
Your Clairvoyant say anything
about me knocking your teeth in?

277
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:26,382
The Clairvoyant sees everything...

278
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:32,672
...except what happened to him.

279
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,575
This is still about me.

280
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:41,297
Wait. You're gonna need
to rewind the tape, Phil.

281
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,100
You heard about my near-death
before the battle of New York?

282
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,569
<i>There's more to it than that.</i>

283
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:49,739
I thought I was gone for seconds...

284
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:53,576
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.

285
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,370
Which is why the
Clairvoyant will do anything

286
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,862
to know how it happened.

287
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:01,200
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Garrett: Wait.

288
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:03,369
You don't know what
S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.

289
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,471
That's why we're flying
to where I was treated.

290
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:10,076
So shooting the girl forces
you to figure it all out.

291
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,429
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.

292
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,477
[sighs]

293
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,826
[engine roars]

294
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:24,077
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.

295
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:26,613
The place we were going, the
doctors who treated you...

296
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:31,084
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.

297
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,904
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.
There are always secrets.

298
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:36,807
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets...

299
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:39,325
experimental drugs,
unknown surgical procedures

300
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:40,994
<i>we've never even heard of.</i>

301
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:44,765
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand
about 70% of what's in here.

302
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,810
Even if we do find where they
treated you and we were able to

303
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:50,821
replicate the procedure, there's
the other obvious question.

304
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:53,450
- Which is?
- Whether we should.

305
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:57,110
What you experienced, sir,

306
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:59,246

No one's suggesting that we submit Skye

to everything that I went through,

309
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:06,172
but if there's something
in here... a drug,

310
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,622
a treatment that can save
her, we need to find it.

- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.

- No.

I think we need to do everything
humanly possible to save Skye.

314
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:22,018
But we need to acknowledge that doing so

- Some kind of drug?

Agent Coulson was injected with that,
and literally minutes later,

his wounds showed signs
of cellular regeneration.

Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?

468
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:31,403
I have. Sometimes, a person
takes you by surprise.

00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:32,838
Yeah.

- Yeah.

The timer doesn't control the explosion.

It's just a clock. Detonator

It's not in here, or I'd have found it.

There's no time to

Maybe we can take some

Sir, are you sure you want to?

Have you worked much with

513
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,810
Explosives are a fascinating specialty...

Get that drug up there.

Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.

They took the drug up to Skye.

No, don't give it to her.
The drug... they can't give it to her!

All right. You can tell them
yourself. Right now, we just need

<i>Phil? Phil!</i>

619
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:41,161
<i>You all right?</i>

620
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:44,847
Being down there...

621
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:50,019
seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared

622
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,789
that she would suffer the way that I did.

623
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:00,547
But she didn't.

624
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:05,375
For whatever reason...
she didn't.

625
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,885
<i>Coulson: "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

626
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:00,524
<i>Nicole: I'm gonna go
see if they have a map.</i>

627
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:03,026
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.

628
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:05,212

[panting]

630
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:19,760
- Are you okay?
- [sighs] No.

631
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:22,313
No, I'm parched and weary.

632
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,982
Is all of Midgard so desolate?

633
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:28,018
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.

634
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,522
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.

635
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:36,827
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.

636
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:41,532
I wish I could help, but...
it's built for two.

637
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:46,837
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.

638
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:52,743
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.

639
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:56,158
And you prefer her to me?

640
00:40:56,381 --> 00:41:02,586
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.

641
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:07,424
That's why I married her...
together forever.

642
00:41:07,442 --> 00:41:08,976
[chuckles]

643
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:18,769
Loyalty... I admire that in a man.

644
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:29,380
[echoing] I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.

Jimmy!

647
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:44,961
I swear to protect you and keep you safe,

648
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:48,232
<i>but I don't even know your name.</i>

649
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:53,695
It's Lorelei.

650
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:57,358
My name is Lorelei.
