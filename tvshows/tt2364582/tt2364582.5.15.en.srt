Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,509
<i>Daisy's powers are the missing key
to manipulating the gravitonium.</i>

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,390
<i>I wouldn't have done any of this
if I didn't believe it was gonna work.</i>

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,134
- I'll never forgive you.
- You had a psychic split.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,508
But that dark persona, that's not you.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,547
I really don't know where we go from here.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,263
You're standing next to the man
responsible for shooting Talbot.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,849
- Daisy Johnson shot Talbot.
- That was an android.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,641
Come with me. Let me show you
what we're really up against.

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,900
<i>My vantage point is much higher
than yours.</i>

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,857
I come with you,
my people get away unharmed.

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,355
I can agree to that.

14
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,636
I see they've shown you
to your new accommodations.

15
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,890
Of all the blindfolds I've forcibly worn,
that was one of the nicest.

16
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,142
There's a method to this madness.

17
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,853
All of your questions will be answered
in the morning.

18
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,690
Not my first rodeo,
so I may have already figured out

19
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,521
a little bit of what's going on here.

20
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,451
You got the gravitonium
and the total disregard for human safety.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,116
Check. You've got Ivan Drago
and Crusher Creel on the payroll. Check.

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,795
And then, there's you, rogue general
operating with zero oversight.

23
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,465
Add it all up, just doesn't feel
like an Air Force operation.

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,212
It's not.

25
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,593
It's Hydra.

26
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,550
- I thought we stomped you out.
- Yes.

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,227
Just as you were stomped out.

28
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,932
And yet, here we are in the same room.

29
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,192
I'd like to tell you my story...

30
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,068
- and then, I think you'll know it's time.
- Time for what?

31
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,740
It's time for S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra
to finally unite.

32
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,549
<i>Good morning.</i>

33
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,337
<i>Rise and seize the future.</i>

34
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:20,357
- One more day. Are you excited?
- Excited to be done with these lectures.

35
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,867
I can't stand another one
of these old dudes droning on

36
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,396
- about placement.
- Well, at least

37
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,036
today's guest speaker is cool.

38
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,703
You know, I heard that he once used
alien DNA to actually reverse...

39
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,229
...the body's aging process...

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,620
Oh, shut up, Sitwell. You're just jealous.

41
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,504
Of you being a teacher's pet?

42
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,568
They've got you better trained
than any of our mutts.

43
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,504
You're jealous because I am going places

44
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,590
while you will be stuck
in middle management.

45
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,290
Calm down, take a seat.

46
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,057
I know everyone is excited
about graduation tomorrow.

47
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,027
As a reminder, there will be
a final examination tonight.

48
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,819
And now, here to speak to you
about another post-grad opportunity,

49
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,779
please welcome, Daniel Whitehall.

50
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,543
Good morning.
It's an honour to speak with you...

51
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,789
the future of our organisation.

52
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:23,299
Tomorrow, you will leave these halls
and venture out into society.

53
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,969
And though you may be behind the scenes,
there are many ways

54
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,180
that you can help Hydra
dismantle the oppressive state.

55
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,897
Since World War Il,

56
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,683
and the success of Steve Rogers,
there have been

57
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,861
many failed attempts
to create a super soldier.

58
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,775
But after some ungainly setbacks...

59
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,569
we're close.

60
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,782
Close to creating
the most powerful man on Earth.

61
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,209
Now, this
is the Particle Infusion Chamber...

62
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,214
an apparatus that can force human cells
to take on the properties

63
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,215
of a raw material. Imagine...

64
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,554
a man with the density of lead,
with the volatility of cesium

65
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,136
and the possibilities are endless.

66
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,227
Can someone name another substance
suitable for infusion?

67
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,183
Yes, Mr Von Strucker.

68
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,641
Why not use...

69
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,110
Red Skull's Tesseract?

70
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,653
It's greatest power source we've ever had.

71
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,238
Intriguing.

72
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,068
- Looking to our past for inspiration...
- Well, that's a waste of time.

73
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,808
There's no way that we could take it
from S.H.I.E.L.D. unnoticed,

74
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,073
we would blow our cover.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,083
Well, I suppose you have
a better substance in mind?

76
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,965
We're not gonna find it
by digging up our history.

77
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,459
Instead, we should look
to where the Tesseract came from,

78
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,928
to find new materials.

79
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,135
Meaning?

80
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,554
Outer space.

81
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,641
Finally!

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,806
Some forward thinking.

83
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,040
Wh...

84
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,272
Hey.

85
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,450
You're going to S.H.I.E.L.D.

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,236
Admin division.

87
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,780
Isn't that what you wanted?

88
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,293
You okay?

89
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,125
- That test was tough for everyone.
- I'm fine.

90
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,256
You hear about your placement yet?

91
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,047
Nothing.

92
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,586
Getting anxious.

93
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,383
Well, I would be too.

94
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,424
Especially if I picked a fight
with Strucker.

95
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,455
You know that he put those two up to that.

96
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,393
Doesn't matter. You punched
the future leader of Hydra in the face.

97
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,274
You screwed your chances of getting
a good placement, genius.

98
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,236
- Uh...
- Miss Hale.

99
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,689
Daniel Whitehall
would like a word with you.

100
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,458
You've made
quite the impression lately.

101
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,145
It seems you're one of the few females
to make it to commencement.

102
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,211
- It's a tough school.
- And you completed your final test?

103
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,096
Well done. It's a rite of passage.

104
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:44,472
We must eliminate any weakness,
no matter how difficult.

105
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,145
I imagine it wasn't easy
to sleep last night.

106
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,657
Not with all the boys sobbing
through the walls.

107
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,569
Leadership expected nothing less.

108
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,116
In fact...

109
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,153
we're confident
we see the future of Hydra in you.

110
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,492
That's why I've selected you
for my program.

111
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,829
Sir...

112
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,627
I'm honoured.

113
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,982
Um... I've dreamed of working
with you and I... I really think

114
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,838
- that the chamber can revolution...
- No, no.

115
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,254
Von Strucker will be working
on the chamber.

116
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,505
Is... is this because he and I got
into a fight?

117
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,473
In a sense, yes.

118
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,223
We were actually impressed
by your strength...

119
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,061
your mettle.

120
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,566
We think that you will be essential
in engineering

121
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,273
the perfect human specimen
for the chamber.

122
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,197
But...

123
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,732
- Sir, I'm... I'm not a biologist.
- Correct,

124
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,026
but you're the only candidate left
with the other...

125
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,324
necessary qualifications.

126
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,876
- You want me to be...
- Artificially inseminated.

127
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,840
It's quite exciting, yes?

128
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,339
You should be honoured.

129
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,886
You will give birth to our new leader.
As I said...

130
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,059
we see the future of Hydra in you.

131
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,184
What about my future?

132
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,941
As requested, you'll be placed
deep undercover

133
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,602
within the Air Force. Perhaps...

134
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,528
you'll even become an astronaut.

135
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,488
However, once the seed has been perfected,
we expect you'll serve the cause.

136
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,404
Sir...

137
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,199
I'm flattered...

138
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,833
but is there an option where I utilise
my talents elsewhere?

139
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,464
You always have a choice
whether or not to comply.

140
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,098
Hail Hydra.

141
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,562
That's what I thought.

142
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,492
<i>Good morning.</i>

143
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,958
<i>Rise and seize the future.</i>

144
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,750
- Poor boys could never keep up.
- No, her weaknesses

145
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,463
are more glaring than you think.

146
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,344
She doesn't look weak to me.

147
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,555
Any idea what leadership has planned
for her after graduation?

148
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,775
- Oh, they have yet to decide.
- What's to decide?

149
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,979
Whitehall designed her to lead.

150
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,371
Whitehall is dead.

151
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,171
So...

152
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,383
does he know where I'm gonna be assigned
after graduation?

153
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,343
It's being discussed.

154
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,880
He knows that you're top of the class.

155
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,718
Runs in the family.

156
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,330
You don't think they're gonna stick me
somewhere boring like Air Force, do you?

157
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,018
Hey, hold on. I happen to think
that Air Force is very good placement.

158
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,729
You get to see combat,
flight training.

159
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,399
You could even become an astronaut.
That's why I joined.

160
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,113
An astronaut?

161
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,571
Why didn't you ever tell me?
That would have been so cool.

162
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,549
You would have been like ten times cooler.

163
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,863
Maybe.

164
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,286
But I wouldn't have had you.

165
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,751
Let me guess. Your country calls?

166
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,346
Sorry, sweetie.

167
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,076
God!

168
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,072
We've got a problem.

169
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,289
- Is this an Air Force matter?
- S.H.I.E.L.D. captured Gideon Malick.

170
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,292
- Is he talking?
- It's bad. We have to move fast.

171
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,211
Here...

172
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,672
I need you to take this. Locate the device
that's hidden in my vault.

173
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,796
Find somewhere safe.
You're now overseeing communications.

174
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:09,339
Fischer. Fischer, what is this?
Look at me. What the hell is going on?

175
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,342
Look, after New York,
we found transceivers in the wreckage

176
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,559
of one of the Chitauri cruisers.
We reached out. Someone answered.

177
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,727
You made contact with aliens?

178
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,949
It's an alliance of several races.
They call themselves the Confederacy.

179
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,108
Well, why the hell
wasn't I brought in on this?

180
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,739
General...

181
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

182
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,620
Come on, Hale.

183
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,158
Step away. This is for your own safety.

184
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,257
Hail Hydra.

185
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,049
Get him!

186
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:51,631
Fool! Get him to medical now!
How could you let that happen?

187
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,590
Now! Move!

188
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,303
I was looking forward to making
that traitor talk.

189
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,810
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine. I just...

190
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,404
I thought we'd seen the last of Hydra.

191
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,565
Well, don't worry.

192
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,698
After today, you'll never have to see
one of those squids again.

193
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,873
I don't understand what my dog
has to do with me graduating.

194
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,763
Your attachment to that mutt
is a liability. You cannot serve

195
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,066
- until you complete the test.
- I'm the only one left!

196
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,831
You're seriously gonna stop me
from serving,

197
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,716
- because of some barbaric ritual?
- Do not question the Hydra way.

198
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,254
- You trust in the system.
- Why not? Look where it's gotten us.

199
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,785
- We're this close to being wiped out.
- All the more reason

200
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,095
to devote yourself now.

201
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,678
- Eliminate your weakness.
- Wake up! Me obeying you,

202
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,815
that is weakness!
You with your blind faith,

203
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,192
with this stupid tradition,
that's weakness!

204
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:50,527
No! It is a rite of passage!
To a life built on control and survival!

205
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,408
That's why when you cut off the head,
two more spring up...

206
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,413
And now, we're the last two.

207
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,720
General Talbot.

208
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,258
Your family's here to see you.

209
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:25,020
<i>Okay, not a train,
because the last one was a train.</i>

210
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,231
Choo-choo. Choo-choo train. Right?

211
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,655
Um... Strawberry? It's not a strawberry.

212
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,284
- It's a cat.
- Nice job, Dad.

213
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,934
- You're on a roll.
- Okay, we can do this

214
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,917
- because I got a mind like a steel trap.
- Hm-mm.

215
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,045
We can get through this. All right,
so the last one's a train...

216
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,625
Wait, I don't understand.
He was getting better

217
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,088
and now you want to transfer him
somewhere...

218
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:57,381
- More comprehensive.
- But he's getting better. He's calm.

219
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,466
Today's a good day, Mrs Talbot.

220
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,844
But the damage
to his frontal lobe is severe.

221
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,272
It's gonna take a lot more time to retrain
his brain to control his impulses

222
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,307
- and think clearly.
- No! No.

223
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,026
That's not a friggin' cat!
That's not a cat!

224
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,570
- Glenn, honey.
- Mom.

225
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,106
Honey, everything's okay.
George is just trying to help.

226
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,950
No. He showed me this... this...
this tiger.

227
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,641
I said it was a cat and he said
I was right, but I'm not right.

228
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,516
I'm wrong. How am I gonna get better
if nobody is honest with me!

229
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,906
- Sir, take a moment and breathe.
- No, you take a moment!

230
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,712
Stop it! Stop pumping me
full of that junk. You...

231
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,920
Mom!

232
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,252
Let me...

233
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,927
I promise
we'll take very good care of him.

234
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,237
What in the Sam hell?

235
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,517
Hello?

236
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:29,983
Hello?

237
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,200
Stomach is so hungry,
it's about to digest itself.

238
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,032
Hmm.

239
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,619
Oh.

240
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,589
I still outrank you.

241
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,360
- I don't know you. I don't know you.
- I don't know you.

242
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,021
Hi!

243
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,773
You wanna tell me...

244
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,067
what we're doing
in this God-forsaken place?

245
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,206
Hey!

246
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,502
Don't you walk away from me, young lady!

247
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Hey!

248
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,463
I don't appreciate being ignored.

249
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,712
You answer me!

250
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,599
You answer me, or I will rip
those sorry little headphones

251
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,329
from your sorry little...

252
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,720
Oh.

253
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,264
I see you've met my daughter, Ruby.

254
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,685
CrossFit Tinkerbell is your daughter?

255
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,778
I've known you 20 years...

256
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,357
you never once mentioned having a child.

257
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,243
I never felt it was anything
you should be concerned with.

258
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,327
General Hale, where the hell am I?

259
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,082
All in due time.

260
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,314
You don't speak
to your commanding officer like that.

261
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,524
You don't speak to a superior...

262
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,665
You don't speak
to a superior officer like that

263
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,796
and as such, I'm ordering you
to tell me exactly what's going on,

264
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,838
because I am not gonna put up
with one more second of this...

265
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,851
Your Air Force career is over.

266
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,388
Your family is afraid of you...

267
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,694
and your lack of impulse control
is a threat to yourself and others.

268
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,575
Why are you telling me this?

269
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,828
Because there was a time in my life
when I felt like

270
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,877
everything was out of control
and I needed a new purpose.

271
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,254
And I see you
going through the same ordeal.

272
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,549
I think you and I can help each other.

273
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,808
How?

274
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,552
Let me show you what I'm working on.

275
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,626
I don't know what the hell this is?
I don't think she knows

276
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,267
what the hell this is.
What the hell is this thing?

277
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,937
What the... What is this thing?
What is this contraption?

278
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,197
To be honest, I have no idea.

279
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,946
They use it to move ships
through the galaxies.

280
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,155
Galaxies?

281
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,529
- You're suggesting...
- Just...

282
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,242
let me explain.

283
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,421
<i>After New York, my predecessors
made contact with life</i>

284
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,047
<i>beyond this solar system.</i>

285
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,931
<i>They gave us this to travel to the stars
and meet with them.</i>

286
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,009
<i>Face to face.</i>

287
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,440
<i>I learned my predecessors
hadn'tjust made contact.</i>

288
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,950
<i>They had struck a deal...</i>

289
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,071
<i>- for protection.
- From what?</i>

290
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,619
The war coming to Earth.

291
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,329
It's only a matter of time
before it reaches us.

292
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,918
Mm. This one's nuttier
than a Butterfinger.

293
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,665
Reaches us... What, war?

294
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,086
Why didn't this make it up
through the chain of command?

295
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,297
- How come it didn't get to me?
- It's not Air Force, Glenn.

296
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,509
- Then, how did you get a project?
- From General Fischer.

297
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,430
The day that he killed himself.

298
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,724
What flag do you fly, General Hale?

299
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,129
I think that's irrelevant
when you're fighting

300
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,519
- a common enemy.
- What flag...

301
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,608
do you fly?

302
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,363
- Does it matter?
- If you choose those squid billies,

303
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,117
it matters.

304
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,533
I didn't choose Hydra.

305
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,199
I was born into it.

306
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,454
Just like you were born and raised
and indoctrinated

307
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,040
- under the stars and stripes.
- Indoctrinated? No. I wasn't.

308
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,798
I am not some wing nut and I stand
by my red, white and blue.

309
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,338
No. You stand by a country
founded on oppression.

310
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,765
You stand by an eagle on a shield.

311
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,059
Even after you saw
Daisy Johnson shoot you

312
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,515
- in the head point blank.
- That wasn't Daisy!

313
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,565
I know you think I've lost my onions,

314
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,311
but I've got a feeling it was one
of Anton Ivanov's tin cans. Am I wrong?

315
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,357
No. You're right. That was an LMD,
but it was created by S.H.I.E.L.D.

316
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,025
and it was used on you.

317
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,745
Don't you see these symbols
are irrelevant.

318
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,408
We are humans fighting for our survival.

319
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,662
We need every weapon we can get
in this fight, which is why I need you.

320
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,582
You filthy calamari Mata Hari.

321
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,013
Weapon? What kind of a weapon exactly?

322
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,178
It's an old Hydra device.

323
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,726
I'm starting to understand
why I might be here...

324
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,145
but you're not gonna get it from me...

325
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,941
because I have a mind like a steel trap.
That's right.

326
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,855
I'm the one...

327
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,521
that hid the Hydra contraband...

328
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,114
and you wanna know something else?

329
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,617
I'm not talking.

330
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,328
You gotta let go of these old symbols.

331
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,787
You need to let go of the old Talbot.
I am giving you new purpose.

332
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,582
Help me save humanity.

333
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:30,255
I would rather die on my two legs
than slither on eight with you.

334
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:44,398
Actually, squids don't have legs.
They have tentacles. They're cephalopods.

335
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,146
Let me out of here or I swear
I will bust your kraken ass!

336
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,360
Let's try this conversation again
when you're feeling more reasonable.

337
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,074
You can't do this!

338
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,778
Let me out!

339
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,991
I'll never talk! You'll never break me!
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s coming through that door

340
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,582
any day now! You just wait and see.
Phil Coulson is coming for me!

341
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,505
Hello?

342
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,511
Is this supposed to keep me
off balance or something?

343
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,473
Having me stumble out
to an Econo Lodge continental breakfast?

344
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,308
I give this ploy a C-minus.

345
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,719
Hey, wait a minute...

346
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,022
"Oops! All Berries."

347
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,899
Okay, C-plus.

348
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,690
By the way...

349
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,614
when Hale's done playing games,
I'll be in my room.

350
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,383
That girl...

351
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,876
the member of your team I haven't met yet.

352
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,879
Is she the one responsible
for cutting my agent's arms off?

353
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,182
That's my daughter, Ruby.

354
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,349
Seems like a major strike
against home schooling.

355
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:54,611
She's not exactly helping your sales pitch
on the merits of teaming up with Hydra.

356
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,198
You're right.

357
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,277
Why don't you let me show you
what I'm working on?

358
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,199
Bad idea.

359
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,701
- You don't even know what it does.
- I don't need to.

360
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,832
It's got that weird alien writing
on the side.

361
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,009
Longitude...

362
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,717
latitude...

363
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,898
and...

364
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,766
altitude.

365
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,399
You need to elevate your vantage point.

366
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,607
- Would you grab that handle please?
- I'm good.

367
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,281
I've already been to space.
Pretty recently, actually.

368
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,159
- No, you need to meet him for yourself.
- Or what?

369
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,394
Why have you brought this human,
uninvited?

370
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,067
This is Phil Coulson.

371
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:22,198
He considers himself humanity's shield,
one of Earth's mightiest heroes.

372
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,451
Her words. Not mine.

373
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,542
He's that ally that we need.

374
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,084
I'm hoping that you can show him
the wisdom of helping the Confederacy.

375
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,799
Very well.

376
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,961
Your world will soon
become a battleground.

377
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,180
We will ensure humanity's survival.

378
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,716
For a price?

379
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,603
Much smaller than you'll pay
if this comes to Earth.

380
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,739
So, the shadow guy will save humanity
from the alien warships?

381
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,991
Provided we meet certain terms.

382
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,128
- Let me guess. Gravitonium.
- Amongst other things.

383
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,458
And Inhumans, or engineered warriors
as they call them.

384
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,635
That's why you need me.

385
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,588
Yes. You know where they are,
and how to contact them.

386
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,133
So, you want my help
to arm alien warlords?

387
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,248
You ever consider they may not hold up
their end of the bargain?

388
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,265
That, maybe, something called
the Confederacy will just enslave us all?

389
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,267
- The thought has occurred to me.
- Then, why cooperate with them?

390
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,685
We need to fight back.

391
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,687
Finally. Someone who gets it.

392
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,773
Altering the deal has always been my goal.

393
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,194
Now you see why
we have to stop fighting each other.

394
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,529
And work together.

395
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,959
Right now, the Confederacy thinks
that we have no choice but to cooperate.

396
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,855
And you want to prove
we're not so easily coerced.

397
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,899
Not only that,
but that we're a galactic superpower,

398
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,084
not to be toyed with.

399
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,417
That's gonna require
a significant display of force.

400
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,927
The whole we will not go quietly
into the night bit. What's your plan?

401
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,805
- You're familiar with Dr Whitehall?
- I buried him.

402
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,720
Go team.

403
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,936
We've been searching
for an old Whitehall program.

404
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,730
It's a Particle Infusion Chamber.

405
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,975
It's designed
to create the most powerful man.

406
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,059
- Like Captain America.
- Better than that.

407
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,443
Personally, I'd like to see
the most powerful human not be a man.

408
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,943
If the idea is to put your ninja daughter
into that chamber,

409
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,744
this is gonna be a long conversation.

410
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,910
Cap was selected for his heart,
not cutting off hands.

411
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,117
Ruby is a perfect fit.
Her physical bio metrics

412
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,378
were optimised for particle infusion.

413
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,459
I'm sensing a "but".

414
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,461
She's not ready.

415
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,798
I'm not sure she has the temperament.

416
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,176
I'm wondering if your Daisy Johnson
is a better fit.

417
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,562
You've made her into quite
the formidable soldier.

418
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,020
- "Made" is not the term I would use.
- Well, as far as her heart is concerned,

419
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,859
I hear she sacrificed her own boyfriend
for the greater good.

420
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,299
- Those decisions are not easily made.
- Now, wait a minute.

421
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,643
Look, she's powerful, she's intelligent,
she's calculating.

422
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,691
If the Confederacy needs gravitonium...

423
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:15,284
- Daisy Johnson is the one to deliver it.
- By infusing her with gravitonium?

424
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,619
Yes. She would have the power
to level alien armies

425
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,581
and blow their ships apart.
She would be worthy of Whitehall's

426
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,247
"Destroyer of Worlds".

427
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,426
Obviously, the guy was over-compensating
for something, but...

428
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:33,260
No, no. Stop. This is a huge mistake.
A broken planet-sized mistake.

429
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,683
Listen, my team wasn't hiding
all these months.

430
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,219
We travelled to the future.

431
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,813
We saw the aftermath of that program.

432
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,352
- You travelled to the future?
- And back.

433
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,401
I saw the Earth cracked apart,
but not because of the Confederacy

434
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,815
or that alien ship.

435
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,194
- It was because of my actions.
- Exactly.

436
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,412
Call off the search.

437
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,620
- Do not let anyone enter that chamber.
- Let me ask you something,

438
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,409
in this fever dream of yours,

439
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,999
are you the big strong man
who's saving me

440
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,292
- from my mistakes?
- It's more complicated than that.

441
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,865
- You just...
- I'm sure it is.

442
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,718
I can't tell if you're delusional
or playing games with me.

443
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,713
This is very disappointing.

444
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,141
I thought you of all people
could see the bigger picture.

445
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,699
Clearly,
you're just like the rest of them.

446
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,887
I listened to you, now listen to me,
General.

447
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,181
I've heard enough!

448
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,367
Let's try this conversation again,
when you're feeling more reasonable.

449
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:30,772
You're making a huge mistake! No!
You have to listen to me!

450
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,449
Hey.

451
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,998
It's cool.

452
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,582
Did you actually...

453
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,090
travel to the future?
'Cause my mum doesn't believe that.

454
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,130
Well aware how crazy it sounds.

455
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,050
So, if you really did see the future,
then...

456
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,807
tell me how I fail.

457
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:00,934
What do you mean?

458
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,555
You told my mum
that the "Destroyer of Worlds"

459
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,724
cracks the planet apart, so...

460
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,028
- what did I do wrong?
- I hate to burst your apocalyptic bubble,

461
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,859
but it wasn't you.

462
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,869
Daisy Johnson.

463
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,867
- Where is she?
- That's a bad idea, Ruby.

464
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,832
- You can't beat her.
- Yes, I can.

465
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,539
Where is she?

466
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,584
I can't tell you.

467
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:37,093
But I can recommend some medication,
preferably at a high dosage.

468
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,592
Other than that, I'm not talking.

469
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,017
Why don't I show you how that worked out
for the last guy who said that to me.

470
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,070
Stay calm. Stay quiet.
Stay quiet. Don't even make a sound.

471
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,118
Talbot?

472
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,531
What happened?

473
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,709
Phil?

474
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,665
I told 'em you were coming.
I tried to hold out.

475
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,500
S.H.I.E.L.D. never came.

476
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,209
I'm sorry, Phil. I told 'em everything.
I held out as long as I could,

477
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,093
but S.H.I.E.L.D. didn't show up. Sorry.

478
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,921
Phil, Phil!

479
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,600
Just... Just...
Phil, I'm sorry, Coulson! I'm sorry!

480
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,731
<i>Daisy?</i>

481
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,893
Daisy? Did you hear me?

482
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,104
Yeah, I heard you.
I'm just thinking it through.

483
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:45,365
- Strucker's escape, Anton, Creel.
- And her connection to General Fischer.

484
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,916
Hale is Hydra.

485
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,874
Hale Hydra. Seriously?

486
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:54,841
How are we still fighting Nazis today?

487
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,420
More importantly,
why does she need Coulson?

488
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,260
Okay, I don't know
even where to start.

489
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,928
Yeah, obviously, we have to get ahead
of her, but...

490
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,622
we have no leads because everyone
in Hydra's locked up.

491
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,606
But we can't question them
without false documents

492
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,389
which I can't get
without more resources.

493
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,049
- So, there's no... There's...
- Hey!

494
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,731
Coulson chose you for a reason.

495
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,904
Take a breath. This is just another fight.

496
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:22,698
- No, it's not. I can't quake this away.
- Remember combat training.

497
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,952
Take what you have,
use it to your advantage.

498
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,791
We have nothing.

499
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,419
We have a super villain.

500
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,135
Go on. Let's get it over with.

501
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,352
Tell me that I can't be trusted anymore.

502
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,935
You forget that I was Hydra
in the Framework too.

503
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,392
I know how this works.

504
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,777
I made decisions I regret.

505
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,733
This isn't the Framework.

506
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,530
And truthfully...

507
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,906
I don't regret it.

508
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,782
Just how it had to be done.

509
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,543
Well...

510
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,336
I'm not asking you to apologise for it.

511
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,791
I'm asking you to embrace it.

512
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:25,719
Okay. Just need to calibrate
the myoelectric interface.

513
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,801
Wouldn't want her suffering
any neural distortion.

514
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,970
No disrespect, but...

515
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,147
you sure you got this?
Or do you need to consult Fitz?

516
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,770
No need.

517
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,239
Listen, I know you went
into the Framework, but...

518
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,118
for those of us
who were really plugged in it was...

519
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,870
It's hard to explain. It's...

520
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,665
It's you but it's not you.

521
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,563
Look, I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm saying this all wrong.

522
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,707
- I understand.
- No, no, what I mean is... is that...

523
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,920
it's not that Fitz is still a bad guy
out here.

524
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,799
It's that he was still a good guy
in there.

525
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,513
Somehow.

526
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,308
I understand.

527
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,720
And thank you.

528
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,308
Okay...

529
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,689
moment of truth.

530
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,753
So, when Yo-Yo wakes up,
she's gonna be stronger than before?

531
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,455
Theoretically.

532
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,050
Is something wrong?

533
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,965
It's just that lately she's been

534
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,719
acting like she's bullet-proof,
like nothing can stop her.

535
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,309
Well, that is not an uncommon attitude

536
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,266
- for our team.
- No. This is different.

537
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,598
Yo-Yo saw herself in the Lighthouse, so...

538
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,815
now she knows for a fact
that she lives far into the future.

539
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,316
So, if Yo-Yo subscribes to Fitz's theory
that time can't be changed, then...

540
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,985
She thinks she can't be killed.

541
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,157
- Interesting.
<i>- What's your conclusion?</i>

542
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,466
Well, we know that Hale went
after gravitonium.

543
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,454
So, unless she's experimenting
with artificial gravity,

544
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,250
- I think she's trying to build a weapon.
- But why does Hale want Coulson?

545
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,754
I don't know.

546
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,801
If we can determine Hale's target,
then we can infer Coulson's role.

547
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,472
We have a lot of intel on file.

548
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,894
I just need a few hours access
to the computers and the labs,

549
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,476
I can figure it out.

550
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,444
I can't help when I'm locked up
in this cell.

551
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,409
- Not a chance.
- I suspected you were listening in.

552
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,332
Yeah and of course your solution
involves us letting you out.

553
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,290
- I'm only trying to help, Daisy.
- He's still on our side.

554
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,920
Don't defend him. Not to me.

555
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,797
There's not a lot of team left here,

556
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,630
- so let's hold it together.
- We had to seal the rift shut.

557
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,337
- By any means, no matter how sadistic.
- Okay, well,

558
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,825
- would you have agreed to do it?
- Never.

559
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,681
Well, then, I didn't have a choice.

560
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,930
You didn't have a choice?
You drugged me,

561
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:22,225
you restrained me and you cut into me.

562
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,986
I don't feel good about it either.
But in a few hours...

563
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,323
the town up there would have been affected
as well so...

564
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,199
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,074
I don't need your forgiveness.
I just need you to trust me.

566
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,240
You are not leaving this room.
You are Hydra.

567
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,914
Well, that's an advantage.
I saluted the same flag as those people.

568
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,687
Yeah, but we don't turn on our own here.

569
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,084
Do you want me
to recount all the times that you did?

570
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,366
We'll figure out another way
to track Hale down, we've done it before.

571
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,430
- And it was a trap.
- It'll be different this time.

572
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,287
Yeah,
'cause you've got your powers back

573
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,722
and they've got the gravitonium.

574
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,929
We already sealed one crack in the Earth.

575
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,234
Doesn't take a fortune-teller to see
how easy it would be to make another one.

576
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,820
Are you listening to me? Daisy?

577
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,528
Daisy? Where are you going?

578
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,449
He's right...

579
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,036
it might not take a fortune-teller.
But why not ask one anyway.

580
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,234
You want to bring Robin out of hiding
and risk her getting hurt?

581
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,500
- Daisy...
- Our leader is missing.

582
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,918
We have to get him back.

583
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,881
We need every weapon we can get
in this fight.

584
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,107
Again, I can't do anything
while I'm locked away in this dungeon...

585
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,610
like a...

586
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,656
hideous freckled stepchild.

587
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,290
Please,
you're not in the least bit hideous.

588
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,919
Take it you and Daisy
had a productive chat?

589
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,359
She quaked me against the wall
and then, stormed out.

590
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,919
So, yeah, it was quite productive.

591
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,507
You've got that look.

592
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,305
I've been thinking about you and me,
about us.

593
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,562
- Jemma.
- Relax...

594
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,392
I know we get through this.

595
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,357
Do you recognise this?

596
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,242
Yeah. It's mine.

597
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,739
After my injury, I got the number engraved
because I couldn't remember the name.

598
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,415
See, that's the thing.

599
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,119
This one's yours.

600
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,215
That other tool belongs to Deke.

601
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,639
Who got it from his grandfather.

602
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,138
He's my...

603
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,351
our...

604
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,355
grandson?

605
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:13,779
Yeah.

606
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,741
But...

607
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,367
he's the worst.

608
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,655
I think he's perfect.

609
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,539
Plus, his very existence proves
that you and I make it to the Lighthouse.

610
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,129
And live long enough to raise a daughter.

611
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,919
- Do you see what this means?
- Yeah. I do. It means

612
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,857
that our daughter's obviously gonna marry
some belligerent space goon,

613
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,140
if she's gonna give birth to a Deke.

614
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,051
No, Fitz...

615
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,391
it means you and I are invincible.

616
