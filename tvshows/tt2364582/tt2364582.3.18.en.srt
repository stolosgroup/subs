would be doing that instead of this.

Yeah, but not before
she busted the hydraulics

39
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,088

40

- He's readying the Zephyr.

You saw the bone sticking out
of his leg, right?

- I mean, he should be ...
- Resting?

48
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:12,964
I told him that.
Didn't sit well.

49
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,353
- He said he needs everyone in the air.
- The hangar doors are still jammed.

50

We managed to pry them open halfway,

00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,286
What she did here
was not of her own free will.

<i>Hive infected her.

63

Hive is building an Inhuman army,

00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,511
He is, too. In a way.

77
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:19,614
Grant was a thirsty soul.
And he suffered for it.

<i>Coulson: You're saying Daisy's
addicted to this thing?</i>

82
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,672
It's the closest scientific
explanation that we've got.

83
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,250
She said she was happier
than she's ever been.

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,996
Wanted me to experience
the same thing.

85
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,278
Most parasites have one goal ...
attack and weaken its host.

86
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:39,553
But Hive does the opposite.

87
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:41,367
Its parasites swarm
the brain's pleasure center,

88
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:44,640
- releasing so much dopamine that ...
- Infected Inhumans not only feel

89
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:48,281
- bulletproof, they actually are.
- Well, at least when it comes to a dendrotoxin.

90
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:51,269
- We took tissue samples from Lucio and ...
- So ICERs don't work on them.

91
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:52,377
- No.
- I'm afraid not.

92
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:56,135
Okay. Then,
how do we disinfect Daisy?

93
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:58,921
Well, meet Dr. Holden Radcliffe,
a fellow Scotsman.

94
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,733
He was lead researcher
on parasitic organisms

95
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:04,728
at the agrochemical lab we raided.
Based on his expertise,

96
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,279
we believe he's our key
to finding a cure for Daisy.

97
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:09,193
That facility and everyone in it
were wiped clean.

98
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,467
How did Radcliffe escape?

99
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,079
He didn't have to, 'cause
he wasn't actually there.

100
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,690
He was asked to step down
a month before

101
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,215
- for conducting irregular experiments.
- "Irregular" meaning...?

102
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,370
- He's a rumored transhumanist.
- A what?

103
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,016
People who believe in
using science and technology

104
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:24,096
to transcend our biological limitations.

105
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,419
- Their goal is...
- Become more than human. Timely.

106
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:29,802
Digital immortality,
superintelligence...

107
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,615
Okay, I'm glad
everyone knows what it is.

108
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:35,258
- So, where is Dr. Radcliffe?
- We think Romania, but his

109
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:36,482
exact whereabouts are unknown.

110
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,900
Okay. That's enough to go on.
You two are taking point.

111
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,223
I'll send Mack with you to run
back-end, whatever you need.

112
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,012
Just find Dr. Radcliffe
and get us a cure.

113
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:53,049
- You're awfully quiet.
- Just got a lot on my mind.

114
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:57,816
- I'll see you in the Quinjet, buddy.
- Yeah.

Uh, Jemma, uh,
I know it's not a good time,

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,187
but can we speak about what
happened between us last night ...

117
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:06,610
- professionally speaking, I mean.
- Of course, Dr. Fitz.

118
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,893
We are colleagues, after all.

119
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:13,290
That we are, Dr. Simmons, and, um...
that we are.

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,547
It's that working relationship
which I would like to keep intact.

121
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:19,031
Yes, we wouldn't want anything
to interfere with it.

122
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,160
Exactly.
Um, so, that's why, as ... as ...

123
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,288
as things progress with our, um...

124
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:32,391
We should consider all variables
as we move forward,

125

Sorry. I'm not sure
where you're pointing.

- A driven man.

how strong you are, Skye.</i>

139
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:35,598
It's ... It's actually Daisy.

140
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,579
My name is Daisy.

141
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:41,876
- Grant knew you as ...
- Yeah, I changed it.

142
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:45,684
Or I guess you could say I...
found it.

143
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:49,275
It was the name
they always intended for me.

144

Who?

145
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:58,002
I got so used to being alone, you know?

146
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:02,233
And then my dad made good on his
word, and for a second, I had parents.

147
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,743
Ones who wanted me.

<i>They weren't what I imagined,
but they were real.</i>

149
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:10,591
Not some fantasy
that I drummed up, you know?

150
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:14,116
- But it didn't end well.
- I just...

151
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,028

00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:56,444
Next time, I snap your neck.

[Gasps, breathing heavily]

618
00:36:15,888 --> 00:36:19,010
It's time to let me go.

619
00:36:20,788 --> 00:36:25,119
Just because
you stole Will's memories

620
00:36:25,189 --> 00:36:28,979
doesn't give you the right to be him.

621
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:32,537
Will is dead.

[Gunshots]

623
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:53,817
HQ is fortified.
Nothing's getting in here.

624
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:59,692
It's a thing. This is why
Talbot's been so bent out of shape.

625
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,278
- Malick's intel?
- He gave us everything.

626
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:04,527
You mess with a man's family,
all bets are off.

627

- I don't think aliens get that.
- What are you saying?

628
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:12,650
We're about to take down
Hydra's infrastructure.

629
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:14,195
Want to watch?

00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,152
Oh. Thank God.
Is Fitz with you?

638
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:43,366
- [Sighs] No.
- But this is the rendezvous point.

639
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:44,642
Wait.
H-Hold on, hold on.

640
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,287
I just got back.
He can't be too far behind.

641
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:48,469
Plus, if you go out there
looking for him

642
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:51,759
and he comes back here,
then this will go on all night.

648
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,048
I shot him.

00:38:14,118 --> 00:38:17,069
<i>Doubt it did anything.</i>

650
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:19,083
Always said I'd shoot Ward.

651
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:26,132
- You think we'll get her back?
- We have to.

652
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:31,571
[Sighs] I guess sometimes
it's easier to think the world

653
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:35,061
wants you to suffer than
to believe it's got your back.

654
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,550
You should tell that to Fitz.

655
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:43,558
He thinks we're cursed, which
I know is ridiculous, but...

656
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:44,934
I don't know.

657
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:54,065
- So, how long have you two...?
- Oh, no. No, we've ... It's not ...

658
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:55,643
You know how many times
Bobbi and Hunter pulled

659
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:58,463
the "my comms are broken" trick?

660
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,215
Come on.

661
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:04,537
Right.
Well, I ... I don't know.

662
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:08,231
I ... I suppose it's very new.

No, it isn't.

Oh, well, I've been here at the
rendezvous point like we discussed.

- What? And Mack?
- In the Quinjet, unloading equipment.

then what about "Hellfire"?
