00:31:52,837 --> 00:31:54,470
that you're not trying to cure Inhumans.

613
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,854
You're making as many as you can.

614
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:59,108
What are you talking about?

615
00:31:59,144 --> 00:32:02,278
"Enhanced specimen control."

616
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:05,081
They're inside, Roz, so
you know what they found.

617
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:09,000
No. No one's allowed on those
floors for risk of infection.

618
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:09,919
Intentional infection.

619
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:12,955
I got to admit, handing out
the contaminant as a cure...

620
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,980
- No, that's not what we...
- That's especially sinister.

621
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:18,328
No, I get weekly reports fr...
from Malick.

622
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:21,597
- Excuse me?
- Gideon Malick.

623
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:22,965
I know the name. Industrialist.

624
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:26,235
- He once served on the world council.
- He's a friend.

625
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:29,739
I've worked with him more than a decade.
H-He advises the president's staff,

626
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:35,578
helped design the ATCU,
oversees the science... division.

[Exhales sharply]

628
00:32:39,818 --> 00:32:42,785
He gave me the Tahiti intel.

629
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:49,859
- Connection's down.
- Look. Last file we pulled...

630
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:52,562
a catalog of all the Inhumans
they turned and put into stasis.

631
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:53,830
- But...
- Let me guess.

632
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:55,631
They didn't put them all in stasis.

633
00:33:04,075 --> 00:33:05,441
[Sighs]

634
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:08,511
Well, once again, too
little and too late.

635
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:10,480
I'll remind you that we're
basically the same height.

636
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:11,755
I just don't wear bloody heels.

Aliens! I pine for the days
days where we didn't have

641
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:34,279
to fight bloody aliens.
It's just not a fair fight.

642
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,982
[Batons beep] Let's see if we
can level the playing field.

643
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,717
Really?

644
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:40,485
Your batons?
That's your game-changer?

00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:53,465
Well, all right, then.

648
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,946
- Let me make a call to my people.
- Your people?

649
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:09,314
Yeah, I don't see that happening.

650
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,417
If Malick went to these lengths,
your agents are in serious danger.

651

- I can get them out.
- Or sell them out.

Phil, look at me.

653
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:18,557
Please believe
that I don't know what's going on.

654
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:19,891
We need answers... both of us.

655
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,927
And if you don't let me
get on the phone right now,

656
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:23,561
we lose everything.

657
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,450
Well, that'll buy us very little time.

I'll get you out of here.

If you're worried you can't
trust me, worry on the move.

661
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:02,467
He'll lead them to the
Northwest parking lot.

662
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:03,468

But I got to tell ya, I'm at
a loss for words. [Chuckles]

671
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:50,082
- You left me to die.
- I left those men there to kill ya,

672
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:52,117
but you... you cut
through them like cake.

673
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:55,020
And to locate this
place, much less get here?

674
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,455
Phew! [Chuckles]

675
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,092
I only got here a few
minutes before you,

676
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:01,893
and I have my own jet.

677
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:02,929
[Blows]

678
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:06,898
- This was all just a test?
- No, I wanted you dead.

679
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:11,369
You pose a legitimate threat
to everything that I've built.

680
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,940
But now...

681
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:19,244
now I'm beginning to think
that maybe I was looking at it

682
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,912
from the wrong angle.

683
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:24,649
You just might be Hydra's second head

684
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:30,522
- that's grown right next to me.
- I should kill you.

[Exhales sharply]

686
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:35,193
Then you'd miss that history
lesson we've been talking about.

687
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:38,824
[Chuckles]

688
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:42,594
I know you're all about
rebooting Hydra and all that.

689
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:47,299
But do you know much about
our history, our origin?

690
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:51,403
Yeah.
World War II.

691
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:53,105
Red Skull used Nazi funding
to build this whole...

692
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,541
[Chuckling] Oh, no, no.
Red Skull was following

693
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:58,977
the principal that Hydra was built upon,

694
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:02,948
that the ultimate power
was not of this world.

695
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:09,287
But Hydra... well, we're
much, much older than that.

[Music]

697
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:19,965
Hydra's actually as
ancient as this stone.

698
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:27,606
This one here and other
surviving stones like it

699
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:30,776
have been passed down
for 100 generations.

700

Keep your eye on it, Mr. Ward.

701
00:37:32,913 --> 00:37:35,714
You don't want to miss
it when it does its thing.

702
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:38,483
This was cut from a much larger stone,

703
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:44,156
a monolith that possesses
otherworldly properties.

704
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:48,593
Literally.
It's a portal to another world.

<i>He recruited me in '01.</i>

707
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,001
- At NASA.
- Yes, how did you...

so powerful, so fearsome
that others were consumed with dread,

711
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:20,625
and so they banished it from the Earth,

712
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:24,262
sent it through the
portal to a distant planet.

[Chuckles] I know.

And why exactly should
I believe a word of it?

Because we're closer than
ever to the final chapter.

We're gonna write it ourselves.
But you don't have to believe me.

I know you want revenge,

to cut the head off of
S.H.I.E.L.D., to watch it writhe.

- And in return?

732

You'll help me learn
how S.H.I.E.L.D. was able

00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:48,613
to achieve something with the portal

00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:50,882
that Hydra, in thousands of years,

735
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:55,253
- has never been able to accomplish.
- And what is that?

No, no, no, no, no, no!
I don't need to be sedated anymore.

a lot of baggage these days.

- What are you doing here?
- Learning.

749
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:38,792
Spent a good few days educating myself.

750
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:40,627
Now we get to learn about you.

751

Well, you're gonna die...
with a hole in your chest.

You can try to sedate
me, but I promise...

Oh, no, no, no, no.

755
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,275
No, this isn't the sedation
compound from S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:59,613
this is chloroethyl sulfide...
something.

757
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,315
It's, uh, basically mustard gas.

758
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:05,919
You see, S.H.I.E.L.D. showed
us how to turn the monster off.

00:41:05,954 --> 00:41:09,523
Now we want to know
how to turn that back on.

760
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:14,127
[Display beeps] Oh, uh,
I also wanted to thank you

761
00:41:14,163 --> 00:41:18,865
