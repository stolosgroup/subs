He was crueler than that.
He made me do it.

But I have yet to figure out
how this weapon can be ...

68
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:55,618
Weapon?
That's so small-minded.

69

Uh, for someone with such a big mind.

70
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,894
It's a key.
It can kill, sure,

71
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,831
but only to protect itself
from those it doesn't divine ...

special people you speak of

78
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:30,886
takes this Diviner to that
special place, it won't just kill.

00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:35,124
It will do something ...

Fury.
I've been thinking a lot about

101
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:30,913
what made him such a good director.

102
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:33,082
His communication skills ... flawed.

103
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,818
But he could always
see five steps ahead,

104
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:37,319
which, for a one-eyed
man, is impressive.

105
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:38,888
He knew his enemies.

106
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:41,257
And for better or worse,
he could think like them.

You didn't see what I saw.

That would be wrong, wouldn't it?

- Why not lead?
- My time will come.

141
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,765
Like Whitehall, I worry
about the long view.

142
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,667
And I worry that
you've been brainwashed.

143
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,602
Did Whitehall pull an MK-ultra on you?

144
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,005
I'm not one of those
fanatics that HYDRA controls.

145
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,907
Dr. Whitehall is a
disciple of Red Skull,

146
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,443
HYDRA's founder, shared his vision.

- Two grow back. Yes, yes, yes.

Hell, I'll hand you the sword

get you the gig. [chuckles]

friends turn to stone...

- ... those that haven't already.
- Hmm.

153
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,903
So, you think Bakshi was brainwashed?

154
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,072
No, but let the idea
drive him nuts for awhile.

155
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,374
Any HYDRA member could've
been, wouldn't know it.

156
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:15,210
Yes, that's true.
Oh.

00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,646
Something Bakshi said ...
the language didn't feel right.

158
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,915
Called Whitehall
"a disciple of Red Skull."

159
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:22,751
Weird choice.
He didn't say "studied."

160
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,720
<i>Morse: And "shared his vision"?</i>

161
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:27,056
That phrase is past tense.
The wording feels ...

162
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,758
- May: Firsthand.
- Yeah.

163
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,393
I think Bakshi slipped.

164
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,530
Maybe Whitehall and Red Skull
have some sort of connection.

165
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,565
Sounds logical, other than the fact

166
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,068
that Red Skull's been
dead for over 70 years.

167
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,337
Which is right around the time
the SSR recovered the Obelisk.

168
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:45,107
Clearly, whatever Red Skull did to
get the Obelisk influenced Whitehall.

169
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,443
This used to be an SSR base
before Fury restored it.

170
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,913
- It's full of SSR files.
- Get on it.

171
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,315
Like Coulson's been saying,
know your enemies.

172
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,319
<i>Christian: I'm sorry, hon.</i>

173
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:59,088
I'll try to make it home this weekend,

174
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,090
but with the strategy
meetings, it's just...

175
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:04,360
Okay.
Love you.

It's me.

00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,672
Yep. Wide open.

181
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,007
My family's summer place.

182
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,143
Did you get my present yet?

183
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:23,712
[chuckles]
Of course it's see-through.

184
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,114
That's the point.

185
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,517
Whoa!

186
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:33,555
Hey, big brother.

187
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,494
Heard you were looking for me.

188
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,510
What are we gonna do, storm Oahu?

189
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:47,547
- We don't know yet.
- Ditch the guns. Take this.

190
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:48,915
- What is it?
- It's a watch.

191
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:52,119
Deliver it to Cam, the owner of
the Kahananui repair shop. Here.

192
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:54,121
It'll need the following inscription ...

193
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,724
"Dearest Darren, I count
the seconds we're apart.

194
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,725
Love, your island flower."
You got that?

195
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,393
"Island flower" ... got it.
Anything else?

196
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:03,530
If it starts to leak
any fluids, drop it, run.

197
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:05,765
This does not sound like a watch.

198
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,402
Take this to the Ka Pua dry-cleaner
on Makaimoimo street.

199
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,571
- Maka-what, now?
- Not the one on Hookelewaa.

200
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,206
Am I good with this in my pocket?

201
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:14,875
That depends. You ever want kids?

202
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:18,111
- And bring back the blue tie.
- You got it, sir.

203
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,346
Get back here asap.

204
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:20,981
This bus has to be
wheels-up in 40 minutes.

205
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:22,649
- You got it.
- Copy that.

206
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,950
Any orders for me, sir?

207
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:27,554
You wanted to get back in the field?
Here's your chance.

208
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:30,790
It's a... transceiver, or
at least parts for one.

209
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:32,826
I'm gonna need you to
install this in the field,

210
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:34,628
under pressure, in
less than six minutes.

211
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:37,464
You are aware that I only
have one hand that works good.

212
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:39,366
That's why you'll
practice it over and over

213
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,767
until you've got it down cold.

214
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:42,969
Muscle memory.
Don't think about the action.

215
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:46,139
- Let the action help you think.
- Yeah.

216
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,141
Piece of cake.

217
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:53,947
What's wrong?
You're twirling.

218
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:56,149
Having trouble figuring out Bakshi?

219
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,652
Actually, no, I-I have him pegged.

220
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:01,254
Grew up on the street ...
probably Southall ...

221
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:02,989
worked hard to refine his accent,

222
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,525
still struggles with the t's,
parents weren't around,

223
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:07,994
got into petty crime,
military straightened him out

224
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:11,031
till they sensed something
off and washed him out.

225
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:14,000
Ended up a private
intelligence contractor.

226
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:16,836
And you got all that from the
eight words he said to you.

227
00:11:16,904 --> 00:11:18,605
No. That last part I checked on.

228
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:21,675
I think that he crossed
Whitehall as an enemy,

229
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:24,144
and Whitehall gave
Bakshi a second chance.

230
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,579
His borderline personality disorder

231
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,314
makes him overvalue
certain relationships ...

232
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:28,548
thank mom and dad for that ...

233
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:30,350
and one glimmer of belief

234
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:33,486
in an authority figure like
Whitehall, well... Hail HYDRA.

235
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:36,389
The puzzle I'm working is Whitehall.

236
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:39,726
Bakshi sees something
in him that we don't.

237
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:41,962
I've found decades of research,
and it's incomplete.

238
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,333
But I did find the
original 0-8-4 report

239
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,168
signed by Agent Carter herself.

240
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:50,870
- Anything on Red Skull?
- Did you hear what I said?

241
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:53,240
Peggy Carter, founder,
happens to be British,

242
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,375
held this in her hand.
[chuckles]

243
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:57,911
No. Anyway, um...

244
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,247
no Red Skull, but a lot of references

245
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,882
to one of his commanders,
Werner Reinhardt.

246
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,150
Yeah, it says the Howling Commandos

247
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:06,453
grabbed him and the Obelisk in '45.

248
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,655
Yes, and cites intake interviews,

249
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,824
but all the important
documents on him are missing.

250
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:13,870
I question Coulson's
filing skills, to be honest.

251
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,163
[air hisses]

252
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:24,004
Vault D? Not the only vault.

Werner Reinhardt.

257
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:40,453
- That was a neat trick.
- I'm sorry. I don't follow, doctor.

258
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:43,723
It's a pen. You wanted to
see what I would do with it.

259
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,392
After all, there are so many uses, no?

260
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:50,196
Escape, confession, homicide...
suicide.

261
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:51,431
It's true.

262
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,066
I wanted to find out
what kind of man you were.

263
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:57,971
You didn't use the pen, so now I know.

264
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:00,206
Pens are also used for signatures.

265
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:02,442
You want a deal.
How terribly shocking.

266
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,977
The U.S. Government has recruited

267
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,478
many german scientists.

268
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,347
They'll send rockets into space.

269
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:09,582
Maybe they can strap you to one of them.

270
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,651
They'll show you parlor tricks.

271
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:15,922
Giving me a second chance
could save all of humanity.

272
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,091
I've seen all of your home movies,

273
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,161
the bodies left in your wake,
the girl you caged up.

274
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,330
There'll be no second chances for you.

275
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:28,168
You must be dying to understand
all the items you recovered.

276
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:30,503
They're fascinating, no?

277
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:33,173
I don't suppose you'll tell
me where they came from.

278
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,974
There's a story.

279
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:41,247
A myth from the East of
a star that fell from the heavens...

280
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:46,219
... of blue angels who came
bearing a gift for all mankind,

281
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:50,056
- meant to save the world.
- You don't strike me as a believer.

282
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,759
Oh, I've based my whole life on it.

283
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,495
History just has the details wrong.

284
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:57,397
Then set history straight.

285
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:04,104
These visitors ... they
didn't come to save the world.

286
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:06,539
They came to conquer it.

287
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:10,143
<i>The doctor: Conquer?
You heard "conquer"?</i>

288
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,812
I think you got a bad translation.

289
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,882
The way I understand
it, it was "end" ...

290
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,384
to end mankind ...

291
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,320
sparing a chosen few, needless to say.

292
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,289
Hmm.
And that's why it's called the Diviner.

293
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:27,160
Yeah.
It decides who lives, who dies...

294
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,629
who will inherit the Earth.

295
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:31,664
And only someone who
can carry the Diviner

296
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,199
is allowed to enter the city.

297
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,001
Or more importantly, the temple inside.

298
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:39,372
But I can get you in.

299
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,243
And if I let you take a team,
where will you take them?

300
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,645
How do you intend to find this city?

301
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:49,082
Well, I'll have to look
everywhere really, really hard.

302
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,117
I'm not giving you men and money

303
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:53,853
on the off chance that
you'll find this place.

304
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:58,925
Or if you do, that you'll not
take its true power for yourself.

305
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:00,927
Me? [scoffs]
Nah!

306
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:03,863
No, I'm not management material.

307
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:06,933
I'll leave that power part to you.

308
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:10,370
Then why?
What do you have to gain?

309
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:12,839
I have nothing to lose.

310
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:17,310
I've lost everything important to me.

311
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:21,781
And I want to kill those who took it...

312
00:15:21,849 --> 00:15:26,453
and finally be reunited with my family.

313
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,854
Reunited?

314
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,591
In the afterlife.

315
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:43,812
Okay. Are we going to
talk or just go camping?

316
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,283
Look, I don't know what
HYDRA hopes to achieve,

317
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,219
but I'm sure you and I can
come up with a better plan

318
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,756
- than kidnapping a senator.
- HYDRA doesn't care about you.

319
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:56,825
And they care about you?
Have they protected you?

320
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:59,895
Because I was the one who
got you out of S.H.I.E.L.D.

321
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:04,199
To have me executed.
A public trial, your face all over it.

322
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:07,870
Is that what you think?
If I didn't broker that deal

323
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:10,706
and did the speech
Mr. Coulson wanted me to on TV,

324
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,574
would we be out here now?

325
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:15,210
You're free because of me.

326
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,414
- I fought my way out.
- Through how many?

327
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:20,516
The four men I had on detail?

328
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:25,087
Keep going. I'm enjoying this.

329
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:27,523
- Enjoying what?
- Watching you work.

330
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,893
I'm ... I'm trying to have
an honest conversation.

331
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:33,028
Okay, one second, I think
I'm gonna be meeting Anna,

332
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,897
and the next thing I know,

333
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,732
you're just dragging
me through the dirt.

334
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,134
Changing tactics, using my
name, mentioning your wife ...

335
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:40,769
I used to fall for all your tricks.

336
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:44,206
That is not how I think, Grant!
That's how you think!

337
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:46,575
And now you're turning it back on me.

338
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:47,977
You take after mother.

339
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:50,446
Listen to yourself!
Just listen to yourself!

340
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:53,749
You twist every act and
blame it on somebody else!

341
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,718
Mom and dad were terrible,

342
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:58,554
but they didn't put
the match in your hand

343
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:00,389
when you burnt down that damn house!

344
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:02,057
And I didn't squeeze the trigger

345
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,393
when you killed all those people!

346
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:09,631
No. It is my fault.

347
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,569
I let you all hollow me out, control me.

348
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:16,338
Spare the non-apology. I'm a senator.

349
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:18,574
I take responsibility
for my actions, Christian.

350
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,379
What are you... ?

351
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:32,454
The well.
[breathing heavily]

352
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:36,158
You still blame me for the well.

353
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:38,160
We both know that it was you

354
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:40,629
who nearly killed Thomas down there.

355
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:42,998
Do you sleep better
telling yourself that?

356
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:46,035
You know, I don't know what
crazy lies that you have built

357
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:49,004
up all these years, but the
well doesn't even exist anymore.

358
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:52,307
It's gone.
Mom and dad buried it.

359
00:17:55,945 --> 00:18:00,682
Oh, no.
They just covered it up.

360
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:21,970
[exhales sharply]

361
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:24,039
[beeps]

362
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,493
[timer beeps]
Hey.

363
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,895
Whatever you're doing,
just take a break.

364
00:18:32,963 --> 00:18:36,265
- What are you doing?
- Coulson has me patching a transceiver

365
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,400
into a system that's not
even meant to handle one.

366
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:39,602
You can do that in your sleep.

367
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,270
In my sleep, yes, I'm quite good at it.

368
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:44,173
Problem is, I'm awake.
I think Coulson's testing me.

369
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,941
Coulson doesn't roll that way.

370
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,344
If he has you in the
dark, it's for a reason.

371
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:50,012
Mm. Or just keeping me busy.

372
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,949
I just gave a button to
a 300-pound hawaiian dude.

373
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:57,853
Look, we've been through some crazy,
we two especially,

374
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:01,023
but the whole time,
Coulson's been our anchor.

375
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:04,026
He may seem lost sometimes,
but he's always got a plan.

376
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:07,897
O captain, my captain.
One blue necktie.

377
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,900
- Any complications out there?
- Kept waiting for that other shoe.

378
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,102
Great. Everything's in motion,
then ... except the bus.

379
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,703
- Get us airborne.
- Where to, sir?

380
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:16,172
Australian outback.

381
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,073
We got a satellite network
to steal and very little time.

382
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:20,843
- Copy that.
- What's the story with the tie?

383
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,579
It was a gift from Audrey,
and I spilled poi all over it.

384
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:26,081
Under six minutes.
[knock on table] You can do it.

385
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,921
Sorting paperwork ...
the life none of us chose.

386
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,089
Anything from the interrogation?

387
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:37,293
Pretty good idea why the
Reinhardt files were locked up.

388
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,728
Yeah, there's some nasty stuff in here.

389
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:41,397
Thank god none of this
stuff made it on the

390
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:42,998
S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to
be stolen away by HYDRA.

391
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,601
Hang on.
Hang on. I've got it.

392
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:46,769
I've got the Reinhardt file.

393
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:49,405
Complete SSR bio, psych eval,

394
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,842
and a lovely picture
of the nazi bastard.

395
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:55,644
- Wait. No.
- Yeah, name's right beneath it.

396
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:58,414
No. That's Daniel Whitehall.

397
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,815
What, you mean it looks like him?

398
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:02,451
No, I mean it's the same man.
I've stared Whitehall in the face.

399
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,020
- You're joking.
- Can't be. He'd be old as hell now.

400
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:09,291
I would've agreed with you before
"alien" became a word we used daily.

401
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,793
May, I know I'm right.

402

<i>He did have a personal
connection to Red Skull.</i>

404
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,634
What is this guy, Asgardian?

405
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:22,271
- It's like he stopped the clock.
- Or turned it back.

406
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:24,006
Where's that photo from?

407
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:27,042
An old S.H.I.E.L.D.
prison called the Rat.

408
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,479
- How long was he kept there?
- For life.

[door opens]

410
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,985
So, curiosity brings her back.

411
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,353
Have you come to make a deal?

412
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,688
Carter: With the devil?
I considered it.

413
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,891
As you've said, the skies
might open up one day.

414
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,626
Your work will be valuable.

415
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,528
But if that day comes, I
know who I'd want by my side.

416
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,331
It isn't you.

417
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,835
We could learn so much together.

418
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:56,372
Instead, we'll forget ...
forget you, forget your work.

419
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,908
When I leave, no one else will come,

420
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:02,344
no one to hear your stories,
study your deadly artifacts.

421
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:04,213
You'll be buried.

422
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:08,651
I seriously doubt that.
Nothing stays buried forever.

423
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:11,954
For as long as I have a say, you will.

424
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:15,257
Farewell, Dr. Reinhardt.

Some german researcher.

429
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,935
Undersecretary Pierce took pity on him.

430
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:02,271
Said it wasn't his choice
which side of the war he was on.

431
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:04,273
Pierce is just trying to
make himself look good.

It's budget cuts, my man.
I'll pull the truck around.

Hail HYDRA.
After all these years, why now?

- Fear goes way deeper, for sure.
- That's not what I meant.

You meant programming.

No?

So what is it you're so afraid of, huh?

472
00:24:49,158 --> 00:24:52,093
What horrible acts do you fear
Whitehall will perform on you?

473
00:24:54,363 --> 00:24:56,130
I wonder...

474
00:24:56,198 --> 00:25:01,969
if your friends know the
acts that you are capable of,

475

ingratiate yourself to HYDRA.</i>

<i>should those details ever surface?</i>

478
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,417
Fear of judgment.
Perfectly said.

479
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:19,220
You don't fear Whitehall.
You fear disappointing him.

480
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:21,573
And let me tell you,
he is going to be very

481
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:23,858
disappointed to see
that you gave him up.

482
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:30,298
- I didn't give up anything.
- No.

483
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,769
You gave us everything ...
Whitehall's name,

with Red Skull, his age.

<i>Did you know he's hypertensive?
We do.</i>

486
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,811
I know he gave you a second chance.

487
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:45,780
Now, do you think he's
gonna give you a third

488
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,615
when you tell us how to kill him?

489
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:50,351
You failed your boss, Mr. Bakshi.

490
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:54,055
I know who Whitehall is.
Question remains...

491
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,724
what kind of a man are you?

492
00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:01,295

He was terrified, and
you wouldn't pull him up.

You enjoyed it.

It's simple.

Come on.
It's time we went home.

547
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:30,905
The satellite network we need to
map the Earth and find the city

548
00:29:30,973 --> 00:29:34,542
is controlled by the U.S. Air Force
facility at Kaena point, Oahu,

549
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,811
And it's too heavily
guarded to infiltrate.

550
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:39,847
Which is why we came
to Australia instead.

551
00:29:39,915 --> 00:29:41,682
There's a small station
here that comes online

552
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,217
whenever Kaena point's feed goes down.

553
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:46,654
- But Kaena still needs to go down.
- You already took care of that.

554
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:49,557
The watch and the button are
two pieces of a trojan horse.

555
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,860
- They'll take down the base's feed.
- Man with the plan.

<i>Once per quarter, General
Cole inspects Kaena point.</i>

<i>This time, he'll meet
the new relay commander.</i>

<i>Skye: Let me guess ...
commander's name is Darren.</i>

<i>And since he's new,
introductions will be made.</i>

561
00:30:02,838 --> 00:30:05,139
On their own, these
two pieces are harmless,

562
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:06,474
undetectable to security.

563
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:10,344
But as they near each other, they'll
power up an E.M.P., and boom ...

Trip, you'll provide backup.

569
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:23,624
Fitz, you'll install the transceiver
to let Skye hack the network

570
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:26,527
So that we can find out if this
city exists once and for all.

571
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:29,096
All because a general got
too fat for his jacket.

Fitz, how you coming with
the transceiver patch?

No, that's with my bad hand.
With both, I can do it, definitely.

- You too, son.
- Coulson: Fitz.

626

You'd use this man's
life as a bargaining chip?

627
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,521
An opportunity, actually ...

628
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:06,589
to get out of this sticky situation.

629

chance at a first impression.

633

- You're not her father!

be close, but you're already

Whitehall didn't even
know about the city

He thinks the Diviner is just a weapon.

645

He has no idea of its true
power, of what's inside.

646

- Oh. There's something inside.
- What are we talking about?

647
00:34:57,374 --> 00:34:59,609
- Tesseract-level power?
- Sure.

I don't know what that is.

there in the center of it.

- Oh, I can't wait.

agent as fast as you can
