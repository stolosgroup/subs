1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:02,294
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:04,340
We have to live with
the choices we make.

3
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:05,640
And now I have to make mine.

4
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:12,948
Yo-Yo saw herself in the Lighthouse,

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,050
so she thinks she can't be killed.

6
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:16,384
You're our grandson.

7
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,543
His very existence proves that you and I

8
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:19,888
make it to the Lighthouse.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,156
Do you see what this means?

10
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:23,191
It means you and I are invincible.

11
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:24,693
You cut into me.

12
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,375
You are not leaving this room.

13
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:28,362
I come with you, my
people get away unharmed.

14
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:29,321
I can agree to that.

15
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:30,576
You want to bring Robin out of hiding

16
00:00:30,578 --> 00:00:31,666
and risk her getting hurt?

17
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:33,635
Our leader is missing.
We have to get him back.

18
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,570
Well, we know that Hale
went after Gravitonium,

19
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,572
so I think she's trying
to build a weapon.

20
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:39,206
It's a particle infusion chamber,

21
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:41,859
If the idea is to put your
ninja daughter into that,

22
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:43,378
this is gonna be a long conversation.

23
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,013
She's not ready.

24
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,750
I'm wondering if your Daisy
Johnson is a better fit.

25
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:49,683
She would be worthy of
Whitehall's code name

26
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:52,110
for the project... Destroyer of Worlds.

27
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,245
No. No, stop.

28
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,781
You're making a huge mistake!

29
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,851
No!

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,074

31
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,570
General Hale.

32
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:10,823
I know you're bummed

33
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:15,777
the whole team-up thing
isn't gonna happen.

34
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:18,947
But it still seems kind of petty,

35
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,049
taking away my cot...

36
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:23,251
my chair...

37
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,687
and my Cap'n Crunch.

38
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,889
That last one really hurt.

39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,930
And you're gonna
destroy the Earth, so...

40
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:37,566
I told you we'd get Coulson.

41
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,568
And he'll pay for General Talbot

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,770
after he's turned over his Inhumans.

43
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,104
But for now...

44
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,641
I know you enjoy it,

45
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:49,244
the feel of a new material.

46
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:52,080
I've been looking forward to this one.

47
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:55,250
The question is, what do
you want me to do with it?

48
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:58,180
Whitehall, Strucker, even Talbot...

49
00:01:58,183 --> 00:01:59,821
They all wanted your compliance.

50
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:01,957
I'm offering transformation.

51
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,325
Into what?

52
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,160
A hero.

53
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,166
Show us what you can do.

54
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:15,604
Why hand him this?

55
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:18,659
Talbot already gave up the
location of the chamber.

56
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:20,141
Yes, and we're waiting for Strucker

57
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:22,010
to show us how to put it together.

58
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:23,472
His father never made it easy

59
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:24,980
for someone to steal his work.

60
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:26,982
- But Creel...
- Creel will give us answers.

61
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:29,317
No one understood Gravitonium
except for Ian Quinn,

62
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,019
and he's been in hiding for years.

63
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:32,500
But if Creel touches it...

64
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:35,190
Yes, he'll help us understand
what we're dealing with here.

65
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,325
Before you give it to me.

66
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:41,329
I don't want to infuse your cells

67
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:42,831
with something we know nothing about.

68
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,532
So then why not talk
to Coulson about it?

69
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:46,201
He has experience with it.

70
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:48,169
And I think after two days in isolation,

71
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,337
maybe an olive branch...

72
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,139
We've done the olive branch.

73
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:52,841
We stick the screws to him now.

74
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:54,843
A week without sleep and food,

75
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:57,178
we'll see what he has to say.

76
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,116
Let's begin.

77
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:31,313
Hey! Get me out!

78
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:34,049
Aah!

79
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:36,203
Aah! Hey!

80
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,585
Get me out of here!

81
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:38,980
Stop!

82
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,555
Aah!

83
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:45,026
Aah!

84
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:48,258
What happened?

85
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,222
What did you feel?

86
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,492
It's alive.

87
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:58,477

88
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,734
Wow. Hey, Simmons was right.

89
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,190
She said you might become
stronger than before,

90
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:19,728
but you're murdering that heavy bag.

91
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,529
Yeah.

92
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,933
Feels good to not be
laying on a bed for once.

93
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:29,320
- Yeah, well, maybe...
- Unh!

94
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:31,148
Maybe don't push too hard, though.

95
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,640
We just put those things on you.

96
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,790
I'm fine.

97
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,315
I'm just getting used to them.

98
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,585
Mm-hmm.

99
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:43,125
Look, I know you like to do things fast,

100
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:45,336
but you don't know your strength yet.

101
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,906
So maybe a little caution
couldn't hurt for a change.

102
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:50,325
I know that speech by heart.

103
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,727
Well, you're the one talking
about how you're indestructible

104
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,948
and saying you can't die.

105
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,296
How was I supposed to take that?

106
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:57,019
I guess it was just, uh...

107
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,900
the pain medication talking.

108
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:01,302
Yeah.

109
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:04,339
Well, you can at least hydrate.

110
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,307
Okay, Pacquiao?

111
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:11,846
And later on, I can run a
diagnostic on those arms.

112
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:14,082
What? Don't look at me like that.

113
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:16,317
What, I'm not babying
you. I'm a mechanic.

114
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,153
A well-oiled machine needs oil.

115
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:20,288
Okay, yeah.

116
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:37,205
I don't see it.

117
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:40,141
None of you looks like me.

118
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:43,344
Well, I don't know what
to tell you, Grandpappy.

119
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:45,548
I guess your daughter found a real man.

120
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,784
Of all people.

121
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,323
Why couldn't it be Flint?

122
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,558
I liked Flint.

123
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,076
Well, that's a lovely sentiment.

124
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,406
That's almost as loving
as when you had a robot...

125
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:03,565
point a gun to my head.

126
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:06,401
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

127
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:07,502
It's fine.

128
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:08,903
It's the first move you made

129
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:11,573
that actually made me
respect you a little bit.

130
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:16,644
It's my kind of move.

131
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,313
And this place, 80 years from now,

132
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,381
I'd survived on moves like that.

133
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:22,584
'Cause it was kill or be killed.

134
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,018
I know Johnson's still mad at me

135
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,688
about the whole "selling
her into slavery" thing,

136
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,430
but you got to play the long game,

137
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,259
or else the whole world is
gonna be a vacancy, right?

138
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:34,062
Maybe.

139
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:36,375
And you say you don't
see the resemblance?

140
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:38,644
Okay.

141
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,523
Well, quality time
was fun, but I'm late.

142
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,070
I don't know if you noticed, but...

143
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:43,505
ever since she's been in charge,

144
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:46,074
Daisy's kind of a hard-ass.

145
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:50,078
I noticed.

146
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:54,449
Can I pick your brain for a minute?

147
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,695
That's a weird saying.

148
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:57,919
I was hoping you could tell
me more about our future.

149
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,287
I mean, you saw it... It sucked.

150
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,889
No, I mean Fitz and me.

151
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:03,753
Do you recall any
evidence of major injury,

152
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,422
any noticeable scarring, perhaps?

153
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,096
I don't remember you guys at all.
I didn't even know your real names.

154
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:09,264
Everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. changed them

155
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,099
when they were getting hunted down.

156
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,468
I just knew you as Nana and Bobo.

157
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,303
But you guys made it to the Lighthouse.

158
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,438
Good to hear.

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,198
Mom talked about you a lot

160
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,709
but never mentioned any health stuff.

161
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,945
I'm pretty sure you were tiptop.

162
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:26,948
You remind me of her.

163
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,137
If you want,

164
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,653
I could tell you
stories about what you...

165
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:34,489
I think it's best not to know too much.

166
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:36,324
It's enough to know

167
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:38,893
Fitz and I live long
enough to create her.

168
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:41,891
Yeah, well, you certainly will,

169
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,665
as long as you guys...

170
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,466
you know...

171
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:46,750
Uh, but anyway,

172
00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:49,337
I-I don't know how much
longer I'm gonna make it

173
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:51,639
if I don't get a move on, because...

174
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:53,019
I don't know if you noticed,

175
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,677
but ever since she's been in charge,

176
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,144
Daisy has really just become a hard-ass.

177
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,003
I noticed.

178
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,075
You sure about this?

179
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:07,031
I understand the risk of
taking her out of hiding,

180
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,700
but Robin is our best
shot at finding Coulson.

181
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,151
I have to talk to her.

182
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:12,459
And look, I... I get that
you're afraid to see her again,

183
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:14,262
but she's the most
powerful tool we have.

184
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:17,465
- She's just a kid.
- Sorry I'm... I'm late.

185
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,334
I was just... just getting
all my gear together,

186
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,828
but I'm ready to go. Geared up.

187
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,136
Mission-ready.

188
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:27,542
I'll just go ahead and
get to the command center.

189
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:32,180
- Was he late?
- I have no idea.

190
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:33,314
What's up?

191
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:35,450
I was hoping to have another
word with you about Fitz.

192
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:37,218
We can't have that
conversation again, Simmons.

193
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,687
Yes, well, Robin may have answers,

194
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:40,948
but she may not,

195
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,353
whereas Fitz has a concrete
lead on a Hydra weapon.

196
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,846
We get to that first, we get to Hale.

197
00:08:44,849 --> 00:08:45,902
That could lead to Coulson and...

198
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:47,128
Fitz is sick.

199
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,030
You should be worried about that.

200
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:51,866
Look, you can compile his intel,

201
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,301
and we will review it when we get back.

202
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:54,902
But right now, everyone is leaving.

203
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:59,698
And, Simmons, Mack is
in charge when I'm gone,

204
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,341
and he's under strict
orders Fitz stays locked up.

205
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:03,577
Understood?

206
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,381
I understand what you're saying.

207
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:08,149
Good.

208
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,934
You might want to dial it back.

209
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:16,171
- I think she's wrong.
- You made that perfectly clear.

210
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:17,588
But you're leading us now,

211
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,761
and it's new to everyone, not just you.

212
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:23,031
I'm just leading us to Coulson.
Then he can have his job back.

213
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:26,789
Daisy won't listen.

214
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,612
I think it's time we try a new approach.

215
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,920
To what? Why'd you drag me here?

216
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,935
Because I've realized we
have to think differently.

217
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:35,075
Fitz started to, and he's paying for it.

218
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:37,045
But you can't deny it worked.

219
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,279
And you.

220
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:40,754
Mack said you believe you can't die.

221
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:42,690
I know it sounds crazy, Jemma...

222
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:44,252
I don't think it's crazy.

223
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:45,520
I believe it's true.

224
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,023
I'm glad someone understands.

225
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,771
I don't just mean you.

226
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:54,595
You guys didn't see
yourselves in the future.

227
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:57,098
No. Deke is our proof.

228
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:00,134
His mother...

229
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,070
was our daughter.

230
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,108
Deke...

231
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,276
Is our grandson.

232
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:10,987
Wow. I'm sorry.

233
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,648
- Thank you.
- No, no, it's really quite sweet.

234
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,873
Well, it makes as much
sense as anything else.

235
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:18,985
So we're the invincible three, huh?

236
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,457
Now what?

237
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,737
Daisy's taking a long shot to
find where Hale is keeping Coulson,

238
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,073
but we have something concrete

239
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,897
- that can get us one step ahead of her.
- That sounds good.

240
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,467
Hale may be after a weapon
powered by Gravitonium,

241
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:33,573
probably in a location

242
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:35,349
that Malick turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D.

243
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,671
That sounds bad. I'm in.

244
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:40,004
So we go to these places
and knock down doors?

245
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:43,201
I can knock down doors now.

246
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:46,080
I can't go anywhere.

247
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:48,082
Fitz...

248
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:51,319
I know you feel like you're
battling something inside you,

249
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:52,687
but I trust you.

250
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:53,821
Do you trust me?

251
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,456
Yeah.

252
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,198
Why?

253
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,135
Because I'm going to get you out.

254
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:02,959
And we're going to go after this thing.

255
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,699
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

256
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,501
We have a problem.

257
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:09,637
Mack... he's the only one
that can open Fitz's cell now.

258
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,539
He won't want to, Jemma.

259
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,846
He'll stop us.

260
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,642
No.

261
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:16,178
He'll try.

262
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,566
It's far too powerful for you, for him.

263
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,000
Mr. Creel.

264
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,740
How are you feeling?

265
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:35,410
It won't leave my head.

266
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:39,347
Whatever's in there, I can't control it.

267
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:43,384
I think this is more about
what's happening inside you.

268
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:46,421
What are you talking about?

269
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:50,391
You and I are a creation
of the old Hydra.

270
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:51,960
That was destroyed.

271
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,629
When the thing we identify
with most falls apart,

272
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,897
we lose our footing.

273
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,600
We don't know what our next step is.

274
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:02,303
I didn't choose to be created by them.

275
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,297
But you get to choose now.

276
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:08,303
That's not what this feels like.

277
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,277
That's what you want.

278
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,481
We're going to conduct
another test soon.

279
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,552
Whether you take that
next step is up to you.

280
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,132
Watch your heads.

281
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:33,891
Just try to get comfortable, and...

282
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:36,304
we'll take off in a few minutes.

283
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:40,805
It's nice to see Mr.
Fitz got you all back.

284
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,575
It's good to see you guys, too.

285
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:44,633
I-I'm... I'm sorry to
take you out of hiding.

286
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:46,869
I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't...

287
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:49,239
really important.

288
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:50,675
Hi, Robin.

289
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:55,490
Let's get you into a seat, honey.

290
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:11,117
She hasn't been doing well...

291
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,747
For a couple weeks.

292
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,141
She isn't speaking to me.

293
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,211
She isn't drawing pictures.

294
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:18,946
I don't know what she's seeing.

295
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:22,016
Whatever it is, it's overwhelming her.

296
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,719
I understand that feeling.

297
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,522
Maybe I can find out what's on her mind.

298
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,360
Good.

299
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,566
Uh, take these to be translated.

300
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:52,036
I don't speak German.

301
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,006
Is something wrong?

302
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:59,352
Well, do these have the
answer we're looking for

303
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:03,157
or just more musings
from a Hydra has-been?

304
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,360
My father kept everything separate.

305
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:06,813
There's no single journal

306
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,549
that explains how the chamber works.

307
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:12,054
A-Assembly, the mechanics,
the infusion process...

308
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:13,633
So then, we're still missing something.

309
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,633
I am trying to re-create
these as fast as I can,

310
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:17,883
to understand it all.

311
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,040
We may be running out of time.

312
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:24,379
My mother just gave
Creel the Gravitonium...

313
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,947
A new toy for him to play with.

314
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,781
Creel?

315
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,416
What, is he the... the test subject?

316
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:29,851
That's what she says, but...

317
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,255
she's up to something,
and I can feel it.

318
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:37,759
She wanted to join
forces with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

319
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,861
with Daisy Johnson.

320
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:43,131
The Gravitonium is meant for you.

321
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,953
She can't make him into the...

322
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:46,801
The Destroyer of Worlds?

323
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,961
I've worked myself to the bone,

324
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:54,333
trained my whole life to become this.

325
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:56,426
And I'm so close.

326
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,294
I'll get you there.

327
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,296
I'll work harder.

328
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:03,133
I just... I need to think.

329
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:09,972
Zephyr One, we're en route to you.

330
00:15:09,974 --> 00:15:11,941
- Five minutes out.
- Copy that.

331
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,976
You have the cargo onboard?

332
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,378
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,280
Safe and secure.

334
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,920
It's okay if you don't want to talk.

335
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,155
You saw something frightening.

336
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:29,158
It's okay if you're feeling scared.

337
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,127
I was scared of my powers, too.

338
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,129
I couldn't...

339
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:36,966
control it, I couldn't escape it.

340
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,569
But it... It'll get better.

341
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,970
It will.

342
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:43,106
I promise.

343
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,917
I wouldn't ask you

344
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,753
to think about anything
you don't want to.

345
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:03,626
But my friend, Phillip J. Coulson...

346
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,329
he's the one who helped me get better.

347
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:11,334
And right now, he's lost.

348
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:15,371
And I need...

349
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,974
I need to find him.

350
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,343
Robin, can you help me find him?

351
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:21,477
Please?

352
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,664
Structure looks good.

353
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,068
Hydraulics are okay.

354
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,161
I guess you didn't do any
damage with all that punching.

355
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,196
Yeah, these things are pretty tough.

356
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,883
Well, if the arm fits...

357
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,323
So you're making arm jokes now?

358
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,959
I thought those were off-limits.

359
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,972
All right, it'll be the first and last.

360
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:53,633
I'm just glad to see that these are...

361
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:56,179
are in good shape.

362
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,776
Yeah, um...

363
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,313
I'd like to do more than...

364
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:02,349
work out and get check-ups.

365
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,719
Yeah?

366
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:06,422
I want you to let Fitz out of his cell.

367
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,527
Why?

368
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:15,364
Because he knows about a
weapon that General Hale wants

369
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:18,334
that uses gravity, and
we need to get it first.

370
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,003
You know what Fitz did.

371
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:23,064
Take it up with Coulson
when we get him back.

372
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,873
And what if we can't
wait for that, Mack?

373
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,943
Maybe it's time for others to step up.

374
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,411
I saw myself alive in the future.

375
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,912
I want to use that to help...

376
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,673
Damn it, Elena! That
doesn't make you bulletproof.

377
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,568
I thought you let go of that.

378
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,786
There are things I can't let go of...

379
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,255
Things I learned in the
future about this team,

380
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:41,290
about Coulson, about you.

381
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,059
I don't want to hear about the future!

382
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,737
Look, all I know is,

383
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,891
right here, right now,
you're in front of me.

384
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:50,800
Safe.

385
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,869
You can't protect me forever, Mack.

386
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:57,139
Did you ever stop to think
maybe you're alive in the future

387
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:58,641
because I did?

388
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,568
Fitz stays where he is.

389
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,322
And so do you.

390
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,560
I see the future, Mr. Coulson.

391
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,971
Coulson...

392
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,532
You can tell the General
there's nothing you can do

393
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,927
to make me join her evil league of evil.

394
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,871
I'm not her messenger boy.

395
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,211
Gravitonium.

396
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,448
It hates you.

397
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,884
It wants you dead.

398
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,591
You don't look so great, Carl.

399
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,721
If you're messing with
that stuff, believe me,

400
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:21,557
you don't want to be the
guinea pig in Hale's experiment.

401
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,294
S.H.I.E.L.D. is just as
guilty of the same thing...

402
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:29,966
Experimentation without
thought of consequence.

403
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,367
S.H.I.E.L.D. may not be perfect,

404
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,502
but we'd never do what
Hale did to Talbot.

405
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,971
I thought he was your friend.

406
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,472
What do you mean?

407
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,708
You don't know.

408
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,344
Talbot is Hale's prisoner, too.

409
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,521
- She broke him.
- No.

410
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:46,549
She said she was getting
him care no one else could.

411
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:47,943
Helping him heal.

412
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:50,353
That's a touching story.

413
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,255
And I should believe you instead?

414
00:19:53,257 --> 00:19:56,192
You don't have to believe
me because every few minutes,

415
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,361
a mech guard comes
to check on that door,

416
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,862
and it's been a few minutes.

417
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,532
You have a choice to make, Carl.

418
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,747
Stop right there...

419
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:24,920
That's a choice.

420
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:27,138
Let's see if your story checks out.

421
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:29,219
If it doesn't, I'll do the same to you.

422
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:30,700
Oh. Okay.

423
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:55,622
She still won't talk with me.

424
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:58,224
I thought I'd have until she was 13

425
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,493
before she completely tuned me out.

426
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,463
I'm sorry we're not able to help.

427
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:05,498
Please, do not apologize.

428
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,567
This... This cannot be easy for you.

429
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,802
She can see the future,

430
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:12,505
and I don't even have the power
to know what she's feeling.

431
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:13,961
At least when she would draw,

432
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:16,009
I'd have a window into her world.

433
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:19,445
Do you remember what
her last drawing was?

434
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,514
I have it.

435
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,187
Do you know what it means?

436
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:30,623
No, Robin!

437
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,794
I'm not sure.

438
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:39,032
Mom?

439
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,475
Mommy.

440
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,519
I missed you.

441
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:09,195
I told you Flint would get you back.

442
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:11,998
You did.

443
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:16,803
You were right.

444
00:22:20,075 --> 00:22:22,508
This base is a labyrinth.

445
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,810
Is this the right place?

446
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,678
It's the only wing Hale made off-limits.

447
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,213
Maybe there's a reason for that.

448
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,715
And you can open these doors?

449
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:31,050
Yeah. Just need to know
which one Talbot's in.

450
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:32,585
If what you said is true...

451
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,887
Straighten up and fly right, Hammond!

452
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:36,756
You look like a damn hobo!

453
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:38,491
Pretty sure that's our man.

454
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:39,859
You are in violation...

455
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:44,731
Major violation of dress code 36-2903.

456
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,599
Noncompliance.

457
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,735
Get it together.

458
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:50,335
General?

459
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:51,403
Good God, man!

460
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:54,040
You sneak up on a man like
that, that's not right.

461
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:55,943
That's not right.

462
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:00,179
Carl?

463
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,108
What the hell are you doing here?

464
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:04,245
Coulson, what the hell
is Carl doing here?

465
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,887
He can explain it to you later.

466
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,833
- Are you okay to travel?
- Oh, no, I'm not in the best shape.

467
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:10,757
If your robot hadn't
have shot him in the head.

468
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,059
If you still want to buy Hale's
story about that, too, fine.

469
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:15,027
But can we agree this man
needs to get out of here?

470
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,374
Listen to him, son.

471
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:17,499
He's an ally.

472
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:20,436
I'd like to get back and
see my wife and child.

473
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,634
We good?

474
00:23:21,636 --> 00:23:23,403
Yeah, let's get going.

475
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:24,604
Okay, Glenn, come on.

476
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:26,225
Perfect. Let's go.

477
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:27,127
Come on.

478
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,964
Hey, you quit it! Quit being so handsy!

479
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,412
Glenn, I know we're under
a bit of strain here,

480
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:34,647
but I'm gonna need you
to use your inside voice.

481
00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:36,582
- This is my inside voice!
- Okay.

482
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,218
Then your softer inside voice.

483
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:39,804
Elena, you know I don't like surprises.

484
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:40,796
Where you taking me?

485
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,233
If I can't convince
you, someone else will.

486
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,143
What the hell is this?

487
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,980
An experiment.

488
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,163
The test of a hypothesis.

489
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,374
If that hypothesis is true,

490
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:04,605
you'll see that you should let Fitz out.

491
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,311
I already gave you my answer on that.

492
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:08,702
Yeah, but we want you to
reconsider with all the facts,

493
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:11,316
so I'm going to prove
that I can't be killed.

494
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,046
What, you, too, Simmons?

495
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:15,216
Do you know how all this sounds?

496
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,327
Like science.

497
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,999
No, sounds like you're
detached from reality.

498
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,135
Don't look at me. I don't
know what she's doing.

499
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,265
Well, what's an experiment
without a little skepticism?

500
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:27,834
So, each of these
beakers contain a liquid.

501
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,319
Three of them contain water,

502
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:31,655
the fourth holds a
phosphoric-acid compound

503
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:33,505
used in the hydraulics
of Yo-Yo's arms...

504
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:34,507
Highly toxic.

505
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,725
One sip will make you sick.

506
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:37,827
I mean, this much will surely kill you.

507
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,546
What the hell? Jemma...

508
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,349
No.

509
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:43,751
Yes, Fitz.

510
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:46,352
I wouldn't be doing this
if the science wasn't sound.

511
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:48,221
So, without knowing which is which,

512
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:50,823
I will drink three of them,
and since I can't be killed,

513
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:53,788
I will happen to consume the
three that just hold water.

514
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,828
This is insane.

515
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,703
No looking.

516
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:04,871
I'm not looking.

517
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:07,640
Are you kidding... Simmons.

518
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:09,909
Are you serious?

519
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:11,744
Ready.

520
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,819
Don't do it.

521
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:23,856
- He's right. Jemma, J...
- Don't. Don't.

522
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:34,834
Simmons... Simmons, I
need you to stop right now!

523
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,341
No... Oh, geez.

524
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:51,284
I will now drink the last one.

525
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:52,952
And it will be water.

526
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:54,787
- No.
- No.

527
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,319
You would shoot me just
to keep me from dying?

528
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:03,195
No, I-I'll wound you
to stop this madness.

529
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,031
No.

530
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,199
I don't think you will.

531
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:08,327
Simmons, please.

532
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,802
Please, Simmons, please don't.

533
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:11,470
- Jemma...
- Stop!

534
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:24,250
Fitz.

535
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,987
Jemma?

536
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:29,989
Jemma!

537
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:32,550
Jemma!

538
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:34,654
Aah!

539
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:39,431
Simmons! Fitz! Fitz, what do I do?!

540
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:41,067
She needs some alkaloid phosphate

541
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,590
to counteract the toxicity!

542
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:45,695
- Where do I find that?!
- I know where it is! Let me out!

543
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:47,930
Let him out! Please, let him out!

544
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:51,200
Aah!

545
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,703
Hang on, Jemma!

546
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:54,770
Hurry up!

547
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:59,909
Elena, open the door!

548
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,011
Now! Open the door!

549
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:04,780
Open the door now! Ele...

550
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,949
A heads-up would've been nice.

551
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:18,594
You sca...

552
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:21,948
Here.

553
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:27,470
Compliments on the
performance, Dame Judi Dench.

554
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,073
That's the longest you
ever kept a lie going.

555
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:34,276
It wasn't all a lie, Fitz.

556
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,767
I might've chosen that one.

557
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,727
I didn't.

558
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:54,430
Because we are invincible.

559
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:57,099
And crazy... apparently.

560
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:59,902
Let me out of here.

561
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,841
I'm sorry, Mack.

562
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:08,677
I know you don't understand.

563
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,080
But I'm doing this to keep you safe.

564
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:12,948
You're right.

565
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,950
I don't understand.

566
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:20,290
If, for some reason, I
don't come back, it means...

567
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:21,950
We've broken the time loop.

568
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:23,586
You know my feelings on that...

569
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:24,693
It can't be broken.

570
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:26,356
Is that what you'd tell our daughter,

571
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,797
that her world can't be changed?

572
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,598
Maybe, don't know.
Haven't met her yet...

573
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,533
Oh, for goodness sake.

574
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:32,368
- So maybe when I clear up...
- Guys, guys!

575
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,836
You argue on the way.

576
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,771
But if you really believe that, Fitz,

577
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:37,326
then it means we're in no danger...

578
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,933
Lo siento.

579
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:45,881
Lo siento, lo siento.

580
00:28:45,883 --> 00:28:47,783
I'm just getting...

581
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:49,652
used to my fingers.

582
00:28:52,723 --> 00:28:54,723
I'll get that.

583
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:56,892
That was close.

584
00:28:58,514 --> 00:29:00,629
Let's go.

585
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:17,646
I'm glad you're here.

586
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,717
Me, too.

587
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,825
Robin...

588
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:34,663
Is this why you had
stopped drawing before?

589
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,734
Because of what it shows?

590
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:47,209
We are going to try to make sure

591
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:50,779
that this future never happens, okay?

592
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:53,782
And to do that, we have to find...

593
00:29:53,784 --> 00:29:55,751
Phillip J. Coulson.

594
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,420
He can put all the pieces together.

595
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,222
Yes.

596
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:04,097
But he's lost, and...

597
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,451
I'm lost without him.

598
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,565
Daisy, too.

599
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:12,425
That's why you need each other so much.

600
00:30:12,428 --> 00:30:14,136
Yeah.

601
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:19,942
He's gonna die.

602
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,714
You can see that?

603
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:36,392
Hey.

604
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:38,561
We can save him.

605
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,482
Well, once again, my life depends on

606
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,587
a crayon drawing of a
crazy person, which is...

607
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:06,455
great for me.

608
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:08,624
Is May still with her?

609
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:09,909
Yeah.

610
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:11,780
I just cannot imagine
bouncing back and forth

611
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:13,480
between the past and
the future like that.

612
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:14,964
It sounds terrible.

613
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:18,033
God, finally, someone gets it.

614
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:19,745
Thank you for saying that,

615
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:21,437
'cause it's been like a pretzel up here

616
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,505
ever since I met up
with you time travelers.

617
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,941
Yeah, I was talking about...

618
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:27,176
Robin.

619
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:30,012
I'm sorry about your...

620
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:32,047
brain.

621
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:37,853
Coulson.

622
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,488
Yeah, she's seen him.

623
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,057
Okay, let's start searching
for landmarks that might match.

624
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:52,001
It won't be easy.

625
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,902
But that might be where he is.

626
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,518
- I was brought in this way.
- From where?

627
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Any idea where this bunker's located?

628
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:12,694
Well, I don't know.

629
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:16,034
I was kept in the dark, just
like you, when I was brought in.

630
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:18,027
I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

631
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,329
Are you okay?

632
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:22,731
Can you hear them arguing?

633
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,070
No. What do you hear?

634
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,339
It's nothing. Let's keep moving.

635
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,343
Ha!

636
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,613
What's wrong with him, anyway?

637
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,081
Shh.

638
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,816
I'm not the only one
with a cooked noodle.

639
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:52,895
You need to eat.

640
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:58,787
There'll be time to eat
after I've reconstructed this.

641
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,222
What's that?

642
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:03,772
Ruby?

643
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,941
Creel has broken out Talbot and Coulson.

644
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,600
They're trying to escape.
Gear up and stop them.

645
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:10,469
We need Creel alive.

646
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:13,105
You, secure Strucker.

647
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:15,150
The rest of you, go with her.

648
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:18,153
Ruby...

649
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,056
Alive.

650
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:23,125
I heard you.

651
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:31,464
So, where are we going?

652
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,135
We have coordinates to three locations,

653
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,647
so we'll start with the closest

654
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,583
and hope we don't find
company when we get there.

655
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:38,953
Wait. What about our pilot?

656
00:33:38,956 --> 00:33:42,791
We have an auto-pilot,
which I designed.

657
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,151
What's the worst that could happen?

658
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,819
They'll be on us in seconds.

659
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,789
Stay behind me.

660
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:24,486
Fallen hero.

661
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:28,503
Fallen hero.

662
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:31,491
He took a shot right to the ticker.

663
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:33,995
I've got no pulse.

664
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,202
Oh, my God. Do something, son.

665
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:42,905
Do something!

666
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:44,506
They never agree on anything.

667
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:45,674
You're feeling it now!

668
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,176
They agree... I shouldn't help him.

669
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:48,510
They? Who's "they"?

670
00:34:48,512 --> 00:34:50,512
We got a man down. Come on, soldier!

671
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:52,881
Do something!

672
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:18,073
You know, you die more
than anybody I've ever met.

673
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,542
Who do I have to thank?

674
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:24,079
Thanks, Carl.

675
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,883
It's time to go.

676
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:32,688
Bup bup!

677
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,857
This way. This way.

678
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:43,265
If you're thinking of blond
jokes, now's not the time.

679
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,100
- I got a bunch of 'em.
- Go! Go!

680
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,302
Fire.

681
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:04,164
I wish we had time to take
you both back into hiding,

682
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,632
but we'll keep you safe here.

683
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:07,968
I'm just glad that Robin
was able to help you.

684
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:08,902
Me, too.

685
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:10,741
We think she might've
given us a location.

686
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:12,472
We'll see what we can find.

687
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:14,107
Can I ask you something?

688
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:18,662
I don't understand everything
that's happened here today,

689
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:21,648
but Robin clearly has
a connection with you.

690
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,984
I, uh...

691
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:25,986
don't know if I can explain it.

692
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:28,188
I don't fully understand it myself.

693
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,157
You don't have to.

694
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,325
I've seen the drawings.

695
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:34,695
I know that I'm not in them.

696
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:40,467
- If anything happens to me...
- Listen...

697
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:44,237
That's not gonna happen.

698
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,072
Okay?

699
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:49,476
Come sit next to me, Mommy.

700
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:17,373
I don't know how to get us out.

701
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,198
She's blocking the only exit I know.

702
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:21,108
I guess this is how it's gonna end.

703
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,238
Pinned down like Butch and Sundance.

704
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,946
Maybe that's a cliff we can jump off.

705
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:29,082
Carl, can you open this door, too?

706
00:37:39,094 --> 00:37:41,128
Yeah.

707
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,097
I've got something for you to absorb.

708
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,558
I'll hold her off.

709
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:51,304
Come on.

710
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:52,605
Kill those two.

711
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:54,107
This one's mine.

712
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:55,870
Oh, no, no!

713
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,742
I'm not interested in
going to outer space.

714
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,145
I'm not a damn cosmonaut.

715
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:01,850
I think as long as we
avoid the altitude dial,

716
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:04,817
we should end up somewhere on Earth.

717
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,154
You know the Earth's 70% water, right?

718
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:14,561
I think we need to try this.

719
00:38:14,563 --> 00:38:16,129
- Glenn.
- Yeah, okay.

720
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,134
Oh, boy. Here we go.

721
00:38:40,155 --> 00:38:41,521
Aah!

722
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:14,955
Stop!

723
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,191
Ruby.

724
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,847
Who the hell do you think you are?

725
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:43,650
I'm the Destroyer of Worlds.

726
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:49,022
Then go get them.

727
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:05,529
We're on Earth, right?

728
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:06,628
We can breathe.

729
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,542
I think it's good old Earth.

730
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:10,911
Well, we're in the middle
of godforsaken nowhere.

731
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:12,534
We should get moving.

732
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:15,015
Hope hypothermia doesn't set in.

733
00:40:15,017 --> 00:40:18,865
Maybe next time, send
us someplace warm, huh?

734
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:22,136
White sandy beaches and the palm trees.

735
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:24,357
That's not really my thing anymore.

736
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:37,482
We'll return in a moment.

737
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:39,964
_

738
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,792
How you got through to that man,

739
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:44,396
I'll never know, but thank you.

740
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,698
He learned to trust me, in the end.

741
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
And this is what I wanted.

742
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:52,125
Yes, but why did you care what I wanted?

743
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:54,028
I mean, to give me this.

744
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,184
This act cements a bond.

745
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,877
Yeah.

746
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:01,079
It does.

747
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:04,316
You have my undying loyalty now.

748
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,719
I never wanted any of
that Hydra nonsense.

749
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:08,653
I just wanted the Gravitonium.

750
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:11,923
Oh, no.

751
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:14,559
You misunderstand.

752
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:20,865
It wanted you.

753
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,506
No!

754
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:30,442
No!

755
