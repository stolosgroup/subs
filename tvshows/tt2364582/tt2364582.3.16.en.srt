1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,569
Previously on "Marvel's
Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,569
Malick is supposed to be
the last head of Hydra,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,659
but I can't shake this feeling

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,650
that he's reporting to someone else.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,959
Was that Ward?

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,269
Unfortunately... I think
that's something else.

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,579
My ancestors were taught to believe

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,489
that if we managed to return you

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,600
from that godforsaken place
that we would be rewarded.

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,399
It would happen any time
Charles touched anyone.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,580
He and that person - would
both see someone's death.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,079
You're the head of my security,

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,919
and you should be by my side at all times.

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,630
No, I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,880
Is he all right?

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,440
He sounded... afraid.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,800
Gideon, your father was a true believer.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,550
He'll be sorely missed.

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,030
Nathaniel and I will do everything we can

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,710
to continue our father's work.

22
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,070
I'd expect nothing less
from the Malick boys.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,009
Gideon, they're saying it's time.

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,539
I already told them no, Nate.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,529
We have to go see him. - Like hell we do.

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,479
We can't just ignore Daniel Whitehall.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,249
He's an old man in a prison cell.

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,320
Who is still very powerful.

29
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,569
And if he wants us to show...

30
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,469
I don't give a damn what he wants.

31
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,949
Dad never believed in Whitehall's Hydra,

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,500
and we're not gonna start now.

33
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,630
We're staying right here.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,060
They're not asking, Gideon.

35
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,690
Sir? We're home.

36
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,290
You've been holding out on me.

37
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,230
We need to talk.

38
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,390
You didn't tell me he was a looker.

39
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,259
I don't know what I expected,

40
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,739
but... tall and handsome

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,140
were certainly not at the top of the list.

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,870
Wait. Who... Who... Who
are you talking about?

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,340
Our guest.

44
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,860
A-Are you saying that he's here?

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,190
Why?

46
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,619
I thought you'd be happy.

47
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,060
Just answer the question.

48
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,339
He showed up earlier

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,969
and asked me to gather the inner circle.

50
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,320
They're on their way now.

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,510
So they're coming here today.

52
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,820
Gideon.

53
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,930
So glad you could join us.

54
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm honored that you would visit our home.

55
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,710
To what do we owe this pleasure?

56
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,460
I felt it was time.

57
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,370
Time for what?

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,080
To reveal my true self.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,029
You said you killed him.

60
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,929
I did.

61
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,840
Well, you didn't kill him hard enough.

62
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,260
Want to tell me what we're looking at?

63
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,100
The lab is working on that question.

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm sorry about Andrew.

65
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,169
If you need any... - I don't
want to talk about that

66
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,080
any more than you want to talk about this.

67
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,749
You don't have a lot of kills
like that under your belt.

68
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,420
- I've done my fair share.
- Not that you enjoyed.

69
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,320
I would've made the same choice.

70
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,069
We do what we have to do.

71
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,430
I know the company line.

72
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,580
Just feel like we're only fixing
problems that we created.

73
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,920
Yeah.

74
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,780
Plus side...

75
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,010
maybe I'll get a chance to kill him, too.

76
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,980
You got to be kidding me.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,990
Ward?

78
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,600
What a pain in the ass.

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,079
What? Leaving him for
dead on another planet

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,840
isn't enough to get rid of that guy?

81
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,580
You're looking better.

82
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,700
Yeah?

83
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,520
'Cause you're not.

84
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,100
Well, we don't think he's a guy anymore.

85
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,729
We think Ward's body was possessed,

86
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,779
for lack of a better word,
by It, the creature...

87
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,090
From the other planet.

88
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,669
And he burned them or something?

89
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,510
Honestly, right now... - We have no idea.

90
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,539
When I was there, It knew
everything that Will did,

91
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,249
even after he was... gone.

92
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,809
Which means whatever this
thing is has Ward's memories,

93
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,599
so why hasn't It come after us?

94
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,239
Maybe It's not interested in us.

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,339
Can't believe I'm hearing this.

96
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,580
Well, we know It destroyed an
entire civilization over there.

97
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,090
Who knows what It has planned here?

98
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,720
Tremors, you saw the future, right?

99
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,750
You see anything else? Anything
that might help us out?

100
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,860
Director Coulson would like
to see you in his office...

101
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,220
all of you.

102
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,040
Malick has given new meaning to
the term "Hostile takeover."

103
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,219
What he did at Transia Corp

104
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,710
was brutal, even for him.

105
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,390
They must have something he needs.

106
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,219
If we can figure out what it is...

107
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,829
- It'll lead us to Ward.
- This is not Ward.

108
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,080
Sure is creepy like Ward.

109
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,620
Ward's dead. I saw it happen.

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,099
There's a lot of overlap
between the two companies,

111
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,699
but only Transia has a subsidiary dabbling

112
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,430
in the agrochemical field.

113
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,150
GT Agrochemical.

114
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,029
Does what?

115
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,059
GMOs, pesticides, ruining
the global food supply.

116
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,279
Minutes after the takeover,

117
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,940
a paramilitary force took
control of that branch,

118
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,459
started moving equipment out.

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,329
Zephyr is wheels up in 20.

120
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,459
The Quinjet will peel off mid-flight.

121
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,270
We're splitting up?

122
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,650
Lincoln and Daisy have a stop
to make in the Badlands.

123
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,540
There, uh... There was
this Inhuman in Afterlife.

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,610
He might have answers about
whatever is possessing Ward.

125
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,030
It's a long story. I'll explain on the way.

126
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,460
We're in the dark,

127
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,580
but right now, Ward and this thing...

128
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,510
they're not afraid to take what
they want or kill who they want.

129
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,590
So what's our advantage?

130
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,460
They're not afraid.

131
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,630
Dad, what's going on?

132
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,060
I've seen something.

133
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,590
There was an Inhuman,

134
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,240
and when I touched him, I
saw a vision of the future.

135
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,420
Really? What did you see?

136
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,440
My death.

137
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,980
Feel so much pain.

138
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,500
I was being torn apart from the inside.

139
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,069
You have to tell our guest.

140
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,339
He can help save you.

141
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,870
No, honey, no.

142
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,740
I felt every cell in my
body was being destroyed.

143
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,400
My killer...

144
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,450
it was him.

145
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,610
Why are we here?

146
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,210
Our dad's body is barely cold.

147
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,179
I felt it was vital we spoke

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,690
before you upcoming stone ceremony.

149
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,789
Your first, yes?

150
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,450
There better be a point to this.

151
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,800
You boys are of age now.

152
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,800
It's time you choose a
path forward in Hydra.

153
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,109
And with your father gone,

154
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,749
I believe you should choose mine.

155
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,739
And why would we do that, old man?

156
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,799
Gideon, don't.

157
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,630
I'm a man of science, not religion.

158
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,979
Your family's ancient
traditions are nonsense.

159
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,109
You don't know anything
about us or our beliefs.

160
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,960
No?

161
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,599
A ceremony where grown men
draw stones from a bag

162
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,139
and one unlucky participant
draws a white stone

163
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,529
and is sacrificed to a liquid rock.

164
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,339
To be chosen as the
Traveler is a great honor.

165
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,139
An archaic blood sacrifice...

166
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,079
You're a coward.

167
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,050
He was 10 times the man you are.

168
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,680
Make no mistake.

169
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,270
Your rituals are foolish.

170
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,190
But your father... he was no fool.

171
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,710
Answer me this.

172
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,930
How do you suppose he survived
all those ceremonies?

173
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,789
From what I heard,

174
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,910
he was quite gifted with
a certain parlor trick.

175
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,460
Why leave to fate what you
can decide for yourself?

176
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,280
Nice try. We're done here.

177
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,930
There's a book in your father's study...

178
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,930
"Paradise Lost." Take a look.

179
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,980
I believe you'll find it most illuminating.

180
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,240
Let's go.

181
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,970
Nathaniel, let's go.

182
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,000
Dad.

183
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,630
Dad, are you listening to me?

184
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,460
He's not going to hurt you.

185
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,130
I felt it.

186
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,229
I think he's gonna do it tonight
in front of the others.

187
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,209
You brought him back.

188
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,139
You more than anyone are the
reason why he's even here at all.

189
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,430
Look, I know, and I'm
as shocked as you are.

190
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,480
But he sent Giyera away,

191
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,010
and now he's gathering the
inner circle behind my back.

192
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,079
He must have a good reason.

193
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,830
Oh, he thinks he no longer needs me.

194
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,769
And it makes sense for him to kill me

195
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,610
as a show of power to the others.

196
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,729
Dad, you've always been
a faithful follower.

197
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,530
Why would he ever hurt you?

198
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,759
When Mom died, I wouldn't
get out of bed for a week.

199
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,670
Remember?

200
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,730
And you told me to man up.

201
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,670
Stephanie...

202
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,320
Malicks don't wait around.

203
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,900
They roll up their sleeves,
and they get the job done.

204
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,260
Whatever this is...

205
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,550
you can fix it.

206
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,660
You remind him how important you are.

207
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,260
I'll have a Scotch waiting
when you're done.

208
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,010
Daisy?

209
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
Where'd you go?

210
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,679
Trying to understand

211
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,279
how we've been searching
the globe for months

212
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,519
and you never bothered to mention

213
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,029
another Afterlife Inhuman.

214
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,930
Potential Inhuman.

215
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,820
He was never given powers.

216
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,710
And until we saw Ward's
corpse walking around,

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,900
I was pretty sure he was crazy town.

218
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,850
I wasn't trying to keep anything from you.

219
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,860
So don't.

220
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,359
He's in South Dakota?

221
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,500
Off the grid.

222
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,639
His name's James. He's
a demolitions expert.

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,989
Australian. Former mercenary.

224
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,049
Few weeks after I got
there, Jiaying caught him

225
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,880
breaking into her private
archives and banished him.

226
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,340
What was he doing in there?

227
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,180
Stealing, mostly.

228
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,819
He made a big scene, ranting
about the second coming

229
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,130
of some ancient inhuman
who could raise the dead.

230
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,109
Well, something tells me

231
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,679
he won't be jumping at
the chance to help us.

232
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,560
He was pretty bitter, not getting powers.

233
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,320
We'll need to be careful
and keep our eyes open.

234
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,059
You're saying these
organisms ate these people?

235
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,680
Well, most of them.

236
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,279
In a remarkably short space of time.

237
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,100
Will believed that one of the other
astronauts was burned alive.

238
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,709
Maybe it was actually this.

239
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,350
There was a graveyard of
bones on that planet, right?

240
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,909
And it controls these organisms?

241
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,889
That's one theory. We do know
that they eat living flesh.

242
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,720
What if it also uses them
to reanimate dead flesh?

243
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,300
Sorry.

244
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,690
It's just...

245
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,110
I still can't believe this
thing is here on Earth.

246
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,260
Sir, we're nearing the agrochem facility,

247
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,750
and you were right to head there first.

248
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,359
Some of the boxes weren't carried out.

249
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,410
They floated.

250
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,690
Giyera.

251
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,760
I always loved this place.

252
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,210
My brother and I used to play here as kids.

253
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,320
Gideon, your daughter impresses me.

254
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,820
She's a true believer.

255
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,729
Well, I tried to raise her right,

256
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,480
same as my dad raised me.

257
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,570
She'll play a key role in this.

258
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,410
Well, I'm happy to hear it.

259
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,309
How fortunate it was for all of us

260
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,580
that I was able to find
you and bring you home.

261
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,190
Trivial thing, daylight...

262
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,730
...till you spend a few
centuries in the dark.

263
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,190
How much do you remember of those years,

264
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,480
of your many hosts?

265
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,900
Do their memories live on in you?

266
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,970
Why? Is there something
you'd like to ask them?

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,450
It'll all be made clear tonight.

268
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,999
Giyera is Malick's right hand.

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,209
He's a trained killer.

270
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,789
And torturer, don't forget.

271
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,659
Which is why we need to make
sure he doesn't get away.

272
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,499
It won't be easy.

273
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,539
He can control anything
in his line of sight.

274
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,429
Non-biological objects.

275
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,299
Yes, non-biological objects and the like,

276
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,860
but he can't make you hurt yourself.

277
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,890
Though he did turn poor Mr.
Banks' gun on him.

278
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,040
So I built handprint locks into the grips.

279
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,629
The firing pin won't engage
without the designated hand

280
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,710
on the trigger.

281
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,249
Great.

282
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,839
So instead of shooting us, he'll
just bludgeon us to death.

283
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,890
Before the ATCU, Giyera
spent years in special ops.

284
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,449
He's dangerous without powers.

285
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,310
Here.

286
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,310
Tell me about this room.

287
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,519
I hope you know how to deal with this guy,

288
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,910
because I'm thinking...

289
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,219
crazy town was a pretty spot-on assessment.

290
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,049
We'll be okay, but we
shouldn't use our powers.

291
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,749
He's cranky enough as it is.

292
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,650
Lincoln, you S.O.B.

293
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,029
Take your little boy-band
hipster scruff and piss off.

294
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,310
What a sweetheart.

295
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,069
Same as he ever was.

296
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,900
Come on.

297
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,640
Fair warning, pretty boy.

298
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,570
You take one more step...

299
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,170
you're gonna regret it.

300
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,390
James, we only want to talk.

301
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,590
What is that?

302
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,690
Don't move.

303
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,470
You're standing on a land mine.

304
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
I did say "One more step."

305
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,160
Seriously?

306
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,409
What kind of lunatic puts land
mines in their front yard?!

307
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,879
James! We're not here to fight.

308
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,550
Oh, that's rich, coming from you.

309
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,209
I've been waiting a long time for this day,

310
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,699
for Jiaying to send out
one of her little lapdogs

311
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,060
to come after me.

312
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,400
To be honest, I thought it'd be
that no-eyed boot licker, Gordon.

313
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,400
Kind of shocked that she trusted you

314
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,090
with anything, really.

315
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,590
You really undersold Mr. Personality.

316
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,020
Can you hold it down?

317
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,180
Or I'll blow off my leg.

318
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,920
Okay.

319
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,340
What are you doing?

320
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,460
Look at you.

321
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,869
Girl power. Nice move.

322
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,649
Well, I hope you got the message.

323
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,520
Okay. - Daisy, wait.

324
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,930
Damn it.

325
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,410
Damn it.

326
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,910
I can't sleep, either.

327
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,490
I'm trying not to be nervous about
the ceremony tomorrow, but...

328
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,720
I had to know.

329
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,870
What are you talking about?

330
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,020
"Paradise Lost."

331
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,969
Whitehall was right.

332
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,529
Whitehall's a blowhard.

333
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,490
He was trying to mess with us.

334
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,180
Dad...

335
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,570
he would swap in this stone
during the ceremonies

336
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,460
and feel for the notch

337
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,969
to make sure he never drew it from the bag.

338
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,039
He would never do that.

339
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,169
But he did.

340
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,030
It's all right here, Gideon.

341
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,070
Dad was afraid to be the Traveler.

342
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,600
He was a coward...

343
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,410
and a cheater.

344
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,070
Everything he said to us was a lie.

345
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,430
Maybe Dad wasn't who we thought he was,

346
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,060
but our family has upheld
this faith for centuries.

347
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,950
And that is not gonna end with us.

348
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,660
We'll be better men.

349
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,210
How?

350
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,440
We do the ceremony the right
way and let fate decide.

351
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,400
Together to the end.

352
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,450
Together to the end.

353
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,770
Dad, you okay?

354
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,590
The others are anxious to
know why they're here,

355
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,980
and I don't know if I can
keep the secret much longer.

356
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,339
Once we begin, there's no turning back.

357
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,720
Whatever happens...

358
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,399
If you were me,

359
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,730
I know exactly what you'd say right now.

360
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,390
"It's time to man up."

361
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,990
My friends, it's time to begin.

362
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,570
I know you're wondering why we're here.

363
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,370
It's been a long time, but today,

364
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,390
we're not here for a
ceremony, but a celebration.

365
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,119
We've devoted our lives

366
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,239
to bringing the Hydra God back from exile,

367
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,050
and I know some in this room

368
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,269
have doubted that he'd ever return.

369
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,549
You doubted me. Well...

370
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,680
They were wrong.

371
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,980
My exile's over.

372
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,300
What is this?

373
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,990
You're Grant Ward.

374
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,650
Yes, I am.

375
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,230
But this body is only a vessel,

376
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,720
one of many who gave their
life so that I could survive.

377
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,239
As promised, all of the Travelers,

378
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,800
the brave men who sacrificed for me,

379
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,720
have finally returned.

380
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,150
Thanks to the Malick family.

381
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,840
You'll all get what you deserve.

382
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,430
And for those of you still having doubts...

383
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,640
...see and believe.

384
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,880
The area's clear, Director.

385
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,480
Scanning the building for Giyera.

386
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,519
Most of the lab equipment's
been taken away.

387
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,599
Files, too.

388
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,640
What hasn't been taken
away has been destroyed.

389
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,210
Nope.

390
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,870
Nothing sinister about that.

391
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,210
No quick moves, tough guy.

392
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,619
Hand it over, unless you
want to wrestle for it.

393
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,690
I can see you're not
afraid of a little scrape.

394
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,410
We only need information

395
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,000
about that ancient Inhuman
you used to talk about

396
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,190
and anything you stole before
being thrown out of Af...

397
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,510
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,600
I just can't get over the irony
of this whole situation.

399
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,859
Jiaying elected to give you powers?

400
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,100
Oh, Lincoln.

401
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,749
Man, you're a mess.

402
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,279
You don't know what you're talking...

403
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,339
Makes me wonder what you've
been giving her, huh?

404
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,590
Something a little extra
on the side after hours?

405
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,669
What? Well, the woman's crazy,

406
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,359
but she's not bad for a senior citizen.

407
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,280
We're not here on her behalf.

408
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,899
We're with S.H.I.E.L.D.

409
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,000
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

410
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,180
Even I know? the band broke up, brother.

411
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,719
Why don't you leave me out

412
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,619
of whatever little plan you and Jiaying...

413
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,629
Jiaying's dead, and Afterlife
is a pile of ashes.

414
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,870
Well... hallelujah.

415
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,539
You see? We're on the same side.

416
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,199
So why don't you tell us what you found?

417
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,980
Why?

418
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,490
I don't really do things out of
the kindness of my own heart.

419
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,660
Haven't really understood
that behavior, to be honest.

420
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,220
Yeah, that's why I brought
a little incentive.

421
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,680
I know all you've ever
wanted is to be like us,

422
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,360
so I thought I'd put
that offer on the table.

423
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,090
You should've opened with that.

424
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,310
Looks like the data was uploaded
off-site before it was wiped.

425
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,229
Work with Fitz.

426
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,190
See if you can trace where it was sent.

427
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
And gather what's left of these
experiments for Simmons.

428
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,230
Maybe she can figure out

429
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,420
what the hell they were working on here.

430
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,680
Sir, Giyera's coming your way.

431
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,390
Copy that.

432
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,470
Not so fun when we take
away your toys, is it?

433
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,140
So we're doing this the hard way?

434
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,380
I don't usually like
getting my hands dirty,

435
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,190
but for you, I'll make an exception.

436
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,040
Don't bother.

437
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,589
Giyera uploaded his data to a
set of servers in Schoonebeek.

438
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,480
It's on the Dutch-German border.

439
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,209
It's an abandoned oil field.

440
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,300
So Hydra's in the oil business now?

441
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,650
It's like they're not even trying
to avoid the bad-guy clichés.

442
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,350
Get the coordinates to the cockpit.

443
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,790
Damn it. Get out of there right now.

444
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,520
Go, go, go, go, go!

445
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,489
We'll get him to talk.

446
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,320
Maybe.

447
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,209
If not,

448
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,750
let's hope Daisy and Lincoln
come back with something useful.

449
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,040
Most of what I stole was junk...

450
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,350
but this was interesting.

451
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,690
I give you the alien thingumajig

452
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,549
and you give me the crystal.

453
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,550
That's Kree.

454
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,279
Looks like you're the muscles
and the brains, huh?

455
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,449
He's just the haircut.

456
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,329
What does it do?

457
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,419
Well, if I could figure that out,

458
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,270
I would be doing that instead of this.

459
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,569
But from what I can gather,
it was snatched up

460
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,179
by this ancient that you're
badgering me about...

461
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,439
after the Kree were killed
or driven out or whatever.

462
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,250
When the Inhumans revolted against them.

463
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,090
That was your man that led the charge.

464
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,759
They called him Alveus.

465
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,969
It was Latin or something.

466
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,570
One of the first Inhumans.

467
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,159
Original blend. Powerful.

468
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,660
Designed by the Kree to command
the Inhuman army for them.

469
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,060
That idea really bit him
in the ass, didn't it?

470
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,399
Powerful how?

471
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,169
I'm not sure,

472
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,070
but the archive said the
Inhumans started to fear him,

473
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,069
and they had to band
together with regular humans

474
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,260
to banish him.

475
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,219
Look, those records... they say
that all of us at Afterlife

476
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,359
descended from the first group of Inhumans.

477
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,549
That was our history.

478
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,169
She had no right to keep it from us.

479
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,430
She was probably scared someone
would try to bring him back.

480
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,110
Maybe.

481
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,519
Wait. You guys aren't trying
to bring him back, are ya?

482
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,890
Of course not. - Never.

483
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:36,919
Good.

484
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,999
Well, this priceless artifact is yours.

485
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,960
If you want it, just give
me the damn crystal.

486
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,529
You lying son of a bitch.

487
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,500
See, Jiaying was right about some things.

488
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,119
Not everyone deserves powers.

489
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,190
And you do?

490
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,009
Now that you got electricity
running through your veins,

491
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,900
you might actually kill someone.

492
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,639
Let's get out of here.

493
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,599
Oh, boyfriend of the year didn't tell you

494
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,530
how his last relationship ended.

495
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,440
He nearly murdered the poor girl.

496
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,919
But I can see by your face

497
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,180
that you're familiar with that side of him.

498
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,330
Daisy, come on.

499
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,769
You may think you can
change him, sweetheart,

500
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,110
but you're wrong.

501
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,170
Men like him don't change!

502
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,770
Let me pour you that Scotch.

503
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,120
Neat, two fingers?

504
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,590
To you,

505
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,950
for reminding me what
it means to be a Malick.

506
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,190
I learned from the best.

507
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,570
What do you got there?

508
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,820
Our guest seems to have
taken a liking to me.

509
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,900
Got me a gift.

510
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,860
Token of appreciation...

511
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,040
for standing by his side.

512
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,019
I told him it was my pleasure, but...

513
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,580
Very thoughtful.

514
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,890
I know that look.

515
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,539
It's been a long day.

516
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,820
I may turn in.

517
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,339
You're not still questioning him.

518
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,150
No. Not anymore.

519
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,240
Goodnight, Dad.

520
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,520
Love you.

521
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,710
Love you, too.

522
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,100
See you in the morning.

523
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,109
The Sturnus vulgaris, or European Starling,

524
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,980
one of America's scariest invasive species.

525
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,419
They're just birds.

526
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,849
Birds can be scary.

527
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,169
Imagine a flock of a million
coming to peck your eyes out

528
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,589
with their tiny, little beaks.

529
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,719
So they were studying birds and bugs?

530
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,879
And all sorts of other invasive species.

531
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,549
Yeah, they were genetically
engineering plants

532
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,579
and animals to resist them.

533
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,599
This was their
 most cutting-edge division.

534
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,699
Why would It burn the evidence, then?

535
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,739
Well, either he wanted to use it

536
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,410
and was covering his tracks or...
he was afraid of it.

537
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,990
Keep looking.

538
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,070
Maybe we find a chink in his armor.

539
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,199
How close are you to
figuring out what he is?

540
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,859
Well, I have a theory, at least.

541
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,189
These experiments have me thinking.

542
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,639
The organisms we found on the bones...

543
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,360
I don't think he's controlling them.

544
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,180
I think he is them.

545
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,540
He's a parasite.

546
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,399
A parasite that retains the
memories of the body he took over.

547
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,480
Sounds even worse when
you say it like that.

548
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,400
Is there something wrong, sir?

549
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,550
You were there.

550
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,970
You saw.

551
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,800
"We do what we have to do."

552
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,890
That's your words.

553
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,510
Yeah.

554
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,199
And that's what I've been telling myself.

555
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,000
And now you don't believe that that's true?

556
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,590
It was true for you.

557
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,319
You were left no choice on that planet.

558
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,370
You did the right thing,
but I crossed the line.

559
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,979
Ward deserved to be punished,

560
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,429
but no one deserves to have the life s...

561
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,770
No, he did deserve it.

562
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,079
He did deserve to have his
chest caved in... no question.

563
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,409
That's not the point. It was payback.

564
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,120
That's not what we do here.

565
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,060
Well, what was the alternative?

566
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,849
I mean, letting him live, letting him win?

567
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,990
Don't you see?

568
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,050
When I killed him, he did.

569
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,459
I knew it would come back to haunt me,

570
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,560
I just didn't think it would
actually come back to haunt me.

571
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,370
You're gonna tell us everything you know...

572
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,299
about Malick, about your plans,

573
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,339
about that thing your brought
back through the portal.

574
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,540
I should thank you.

575
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,660
Without S.H.I.E.L.D., he
never would've made it home.

576
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,510
You're really drinking the
Kool-Aid, aren't you?

577
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,169
Oh, this leader of yours
must be a real charmer.

578
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,179
We don't have leaders.

579
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,579
We're walking towards a common goal.

580
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,069
That's what they tell you
when you join a cult,

581
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,080
but it's actually not true.

582
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,240
Eventually, you'll get it.

583
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,230
We see such great potential for humanity.

584
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,790
Those who are worthy will
inherit a better world.

585
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,630
And those who aren't?

586
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,550
We're nearing Dutch air space.

587
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,279
Looks like we're gonna find out
what you and Malick are hiding

588
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,850
whether you help us or not.

589
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,250
So, you kept it.

590
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,720
After all these years.

591
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,339
Stephanie, give us a moment.

592
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,149
Dad, what is going on?

593
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,799
There's no reason for her to see this.

594
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,020
I invited her here.

595
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,850
She deserves to know the
truth about her father.

596
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,680
You've had this notched stone
since that day at the pond.

597
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,720
Together to the end.

598
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,600
You knew you'd never be chosen.

599
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,910
Tell me, Gideon...

600
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,849
was this a deliberate betrayal,

601
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,770
or was it all just to save your own life?

602
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,220
I loved Nathaniel.

603
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,800
So it was just fate that it
came down to the two of us.

604
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,160
Dad, what is he saying?

605
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,250
Your father is not the
brave man he claims to be.

606
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,160
I thought we had a deal.

607
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,670
I thought...

608
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,140
Let's go.

609
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,930
I thought we had a deal.

610
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,760
Nate?

611
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,140
What happened to "Together
to the end," brother?

612
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,030
Oh, I meant every word of that.

613
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,009
I wanted you by my side, but
I-I didn't have a choice.

614
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,029
Is that what you've been telling yourself?

615
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,869
I never gave up on you, Nate.

616
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,019
I carried on the tradition.

617
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,389
I gave up everything so
that you could return.

618
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,769
You were never willing
to give up everything.

619
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,570
So all these years...

620
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,800
you just lied to my face?

621
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,190
He was selfish.

622
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,280
He gets it from our father.

623
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,779
They were both too afraid
to make a true sacrifice.

624
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,369
Yeah, I'll die if I have
to, but not as a coward.

625
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,189
Stephanie, I won't let you remember me

626
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,810
the way I remember my father.

627
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,770
Do what you have to.

628
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,620
This needs to be made right.

629
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,150
But I still need a Malick by my side.

630
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,770
Now you understand sacrifice.

631
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,679
He said you almost killed your girlfriend.

632
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,530
What the hell was he talking about?

633
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,449
Who was she? Why haven't you
said anything about this before?

634
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,749
Because I never wanted you
to see that side of me.

635
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,179
I don't really care what you
want right now, Lincoln.

636
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,339
You can't... You can't just show me Mr.
Perfect all the time

637
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,799
and keep all the ugly parts hidden away.

638
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,140
That's not how this works.

639
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,390
I need the truth, or
whatever we are ends now.

640
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,830
Okay.

641
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,780
You know how we've, um, talked about

642
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,150
how most Inhumans have this feeling where

643
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,630
nothing feels right, just empty?

644
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:20,920
Yeah, like how I spent my entire
life searching for my parents.

645
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,460
It's a classic attempt to fill the void.

646
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,590
Well, I tried to fill it with vodka,

647
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,560
but I couldn't control it...
the drinking or my temper.

648
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,230
You've told me this.

649
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,660
Not this.

650
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,750
My girlfriend thought she could
help me to be a better person.

651
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,000
We fought about that a lot.

652
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,660
I don't even remember what we
were arguing about that night,

653
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,010
but the more I drank, the angrier I got.

654
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,230
I just wanted to get away,

655
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,510
so I got in the car.

656
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,029
I don't know why the
hell she got in with me,

657
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,150
trying to talk me down.

658
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,300
We ended up wrapped
around a telephone pole.

659
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,670
Oh, my God.

660
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,050
She was basically dead.

661
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,730
But then Gordon showed up...

662
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,640
said he'd been watching me.

663
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,830
They saved her... and me.

664
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,590
Brought me to Afterlife.

665
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,119
And for the first time,

666
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,690
I felt like that emptiness...

667
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,520
might be filled one day.

668
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,930
I want you to know...

669
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,400
that I would never hurt you.

670
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,680
I know.

671
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,270
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner,

672
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,320
but I don't want any more secrets.

673
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,570
Yeah.

674
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,630
Then, there's something I...

675
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,860
have to tell you.

676
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,250
I got another glimpse...

677
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,100
into the future.

678
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,730
And...

679
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,830
I don't know when...

680
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,640
but someone on our team is gonna die.

681
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,200
That's not good.

682
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,699
Giyera's escaped.

683
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,100
Do not let him in here.

684
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,330
You can't stop us.

685
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,520
You're not getting this
plane without a fight.

686
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,390
We don't need to fight anymore.

687
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,790
Mayday! Mayday!

688
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,080
What the hell?! Thrusters at maximum!

689
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,460
Pull up! - I c-can't!

690
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,270
Simmons?

691
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,800
Daisy, come in.

692
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,679
Giyera's taken control of the plane.

693
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,810
We need...

694
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,330
May?

695
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,050
May??

696
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,910
May?

697
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,059
Line's dead.

698
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,100
Everyone from our team is on that plane.

699
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,070
Not everyone.

700
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,250
You put together the Secret
Warriors Initiative for a reason.

701
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,109
No, Lincoln, what... what if...

702
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,750
You can't be afraid of that vision.

703
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,750
We both know we got to do something.

704
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,780
Let's call them in.

705
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,090
We'll return in a moment.

706
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,870
Good news.

707
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,980
Giyera's captured a S.H.I.E.L.D.
airship with several prisoners.

708
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,810
We should be on our way.

709
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,450
Sacrifice is never easy,

710
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,180
but we have balanced the scales today.

711
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,970
You have nothing else to fear.

712
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,790
Together to the end.

712
00:42:13,305 --> 00:43:13,876
