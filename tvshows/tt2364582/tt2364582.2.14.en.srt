00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:12,332
I'm recommending Skye
leave S.H.I.E.L.D. altogether.

- Whitehall's dead.
- So you're free.

00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:34,688
- I don't know what to do.
- I can get us out of here.

my ass back in Puerto Rico,

- nursed me back to health...
- Well, what else was I going to do?

- You. Get up.

<i>You know, it could just be growing

57

It's okay, Fitz. You don't have
to put a positive spin on this.

58
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:53,208
I'm not doing that.
I would never patronize the...

59
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:56,911
Well, the...

60
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:59,047
things change.
That's what I'm saying.

61
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:02,550
So maybe if you can learn
to control this, then...

62
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,719
you could have
avengers-level powers,

63
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:06,721
something like
Captain America, even.

64
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:10,257
I think it best we keep in mind
the unstable nature of Skye's power.

65
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,659
If there is an Avenger equivalent,

66
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,094
right now I'm afraid it's the Hulk.

67
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:16,898
Well, Hulk saved the world,
last I checked.

68
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,165
You're absolutely right.

69
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,401
But given the choice,
I believe Bruce Banner

70
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:23,004
would not hesitate to cure
himself once and for all.

71
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:25,005
Well, then...
I guess we should be thankful

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,874
- that nobody's given him the choice.
- Oh, Fitz...

73
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,078
Don't "oh, Fitz" me. I'm be...

74
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,750
- I'm sorry, Skye.
- This really isn't about you.

75
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm pretty sure it is.
I'll go back to the cage.

Andrew's recommending Skye
be removed from S.H.I.E.L.D.,

77
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,794
effective immediately.

78
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,395
I agree with his recommendation.

79
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,868
I've got to admit...
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

80
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,335
I can agree with my ex.

81
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,105
Skye's too dangerous to
be out there right now.

82
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,298
- You just brought her into the field.
- I had no other choice.

83
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,008
You were in danger.
I made a call.

84
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,479
And Skye's injuries were something...
neither of us saw coming.

85
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:10,183
- What won't we see next time?
- Hard to say.

86
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,785
Which is why you need to
remove Skye from the equation.

87
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,590
I know it's difficult, Phil.

88
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,058
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s always wrestled

89
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,993
with how to handle
people who are enhanced.

90
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,462
And add Skye's alien DNA to the mix,

91
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,864
it's a whole new category
we have to deal with.

92
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,433
This isn't about categories
on the index, May.

93
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:32,604
- We're talking about Skye.
- And as her S.O., I am telling you,

94
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:35,173
I have no idea how to handle her.

95
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,142
You'll find a way. You always do.

96
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:42,080
- Not always.
- This isn't Bahrain. Okay?

97
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,982
We know who we're dealing with here.

98
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:48,620
Don't fool yourself.
Skye's changed.

99
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:52,123
Maybe not on the surface, but inside.

100
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:55,192
She doesn't know herself anymore.

00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:28,992
Did the facial-scan diagnostic appear?

104
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,326
- Yes.
- Now close your eyes

105
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,562
for two seconds, and
the change should take effect.

106
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:42,104
Hmm. That reminds me
of my Berkeley days.

107
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,041
Well, the effect
would be far more convincing

108
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,310
if you were to replicate
the face of another woman.

109
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:50,380
And don't forget...
I stabilized your vocal processor.

110
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,692
Admittedly, it's not quite as precise
as my original nanomask.

111
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:00,262
But regardless, I think
you're going to find it

112
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:03,031
extremely useful for any
on-the-go S.H.I.E.L.D...

113
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,892
...or Hydra operations?

114
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,474
I see you figured out
how to reset the mask.

115
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,343
Just remember the program's memory

116
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,546
can only store up to three
facial scans at a time.

117
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,232
And you're sure there's
no way to remove the mask?

118
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:23,419
There's nothing I can do.
But if you want your old face,

119
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,354
- just turn the machine off...
- No! You've seen what's underneath.

120
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,524
Please, I know this is difficult.

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,332
But look at the bright side...
now you can be anyone you want.

122
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:43,405
Maybe you can find an old
photo from before the accident.

123
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,740
Use that for the facial scan.

124
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:49,077
- Let the mask do the rest.
- Not sure where I'd find one.

125
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:51,046
To be honest,
I haven't even seen her face.

126
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:56,685
Oh. I see.
Well, then I guess it's fair to say

127
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,721
we all hide our true selves, don't we?

128
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:04,702
Or we just... wait for the
right time to reveal the truth.

129
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:10,565
So this is what all the fuss is
about... another S.H.I.E.L.D.?

130
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,934
Lower your voice. It'll all
get worked out momentarily.

131
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,338
Lower my voice?
You must be joking.

132
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,673
So, where now?
To see the wizard?

133
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,344
Eh, something like that.

134
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:34,289
Priceless.

135
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:37,292
I guess one boss wasn't
enough for you and Bobbi.

136
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:40,795
Seems the road trip hasn't
dampened your friend's spirits.

137
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:47,235
Gonzalez.
It's good to see you, sir.

138
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,988
- It's been too long, Mack.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:51,039
It's good to have you back on board.

140
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:57,913
- You must be Lance Hunter.
- And you must be crazy.

141
00:07:57,948 --> 00:08:02,517
I assure you, none of us wanted this.

142
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,289
I think I preferred you acting alone

143
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:09,958
instead of taking orders
from the clown academy.

144
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:14,296
This is not about blindly
following orders, Mr. Hunter.

145
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,132
<i>This is about leaders
being held accountable.</i>

146
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,968
To the men and women they serve,

147
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:22,771
<i>as well as those that
govern alongside them.</i>

148
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,966
Thanks for the democracy
lesson, Lady Thomas Jefferson.

149
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:27,442
But if it's all the same,
spare me the sales pitch.

150
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:30,512
That's great.
We should throw him in the brig.

151
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:34,649
Let's not be hasty, Tomás.
We at least owe him an explanation.

152
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:37,519
We founded S.H.I.E.L.D...
the real S.H.I.E.L.D...

153
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:40,155
<i>on the belief that
leadership should operate</i>

154
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,091
with transparency and
not from the shadows.

155
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,293
Nick Fury simply kept too many secrets.

156
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,964
Got it.
Couldn't agree more, actually.

157
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:51,800
<i>Just one little detail that
you seem to have overlooked</i>

158
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,369
in your otherwise spot-on assessment.

159
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:58,540
<i>Guy with the eye patch and the
secrets, Nick Fury... he's dead.</i>

160
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,776
Fury is dead,
but Coulson's alive and well.

161
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,612
Thanks to one of those secrets.

162
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:06,548
And it seems that instead of
learning from those mistakes,

163
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,550
<i>Coulson's heading down the same path.</i>

164
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:12,721
All right.
So that's what this is about.

165
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:14,723
You guys don't want Coulson in charge.

166
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:17,459
<i>I'll be the first to admit
the guy's not perfect.</i>

167
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:20,061
Sometimes chews with his mouth open,

168
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:22,297
<i>tends to hog the mike on karaoke nights.</i>

169
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:26,301
But other than that,
he's not so bad, really.

170
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,837
Well, I'm afraid we
don't share that opinion.

171
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,240
This is rubbish.

172
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:34,209
Maybe you've drunk the
conspiracy kool-aid,

173
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:35,277
but there's not a chance in hell

174
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:37,946
Bobbi would ever bow
down to any of this...

175
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:07,954
Perhaps we could have
discussed this alone...

176
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,125
- without all of hufflepuff looking on.
- Hunter... please.

177
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:18,748
Okay, then.

178
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,553
- Indoctrinate away.
- It may come as a surprise to you,

179
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,656
but I was very close
to Isabelle Hartley.

180
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,961
<i>You see, she saved my
life in this very facility.</i>

181
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,929
Hydra had me dead to rights.

182
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,198
You're not the first person
Izzy helped out of a pinch.

183
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,268
But I may have been the last.

184
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,838
<i>By all accounts, Isabelle's death
could have been avoided</i>

185
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:46,343
<i>if Agent Coulson hadn't been so
relentless in his pursuit of alien tech.</i>

186
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:48,678
Added to that, the
tragedy in Puerto Rico...

187
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,181
the death of Agent Triplett,

188
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:52,716
the transformation of
the young woman, Raina.

189
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:56,987
Even Agent Skye seems
to have been affected.

190
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:00,156
And all because of
Coulson's search for a city

191
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,393
that his own alien writing
drove him to find.

192
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:05,328
Yeah, he's put all that
scribbling behind him.

193
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,665
<i>Oh. Should we all just
get up and go home now?</i>

194
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,235
This is not a decision
that we arrived at lightly.

195
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,139
I know Coulson.
He was a good agent.

196
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:20,210
<i>At least, he was before Fury
injected him with alien DNA.</i>

197
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:25,315
Ever since, his behavior's grown
increasingly more troubling.

198
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,983
Can you honestly tell me

199
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,253
that you don't share
any of these concerns?

200
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,397
I won't deny
you have a few good points.

201
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,666
But why not just take it
up with the man himself?

202
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,868
We wanted all the facts first.

203
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:48,738
Which is what Bobbi and I have
been doing... gathering intel.

204
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:53,209
Bobbi, you're an awfully quiet
member of this<i> coup d'etat.</i>

205
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,678
What's your take?

206
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,849
I believe they're right.

207
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,186
Coulson has been compromised.

208
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,373
Come in.

209
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,582
- It's all there?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,121
Is there something else?

211
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:40,957
It's just...

212
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,326
possible repercussions.

213
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,161
We've been over this, Agent Simmons,

214
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,497
and I'm aware of the consequences,

215
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:51,634
- but this is my decision to make.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,747
Ah.
No.

217
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,616
- Ankle bone's always the toughest.
- Yeah.

218
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,652
Maybe a game of nerves
isn't the best idea for me.

219
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:13,223
- You and I need to take a ride.
- Okay. But why am I

220
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,125
suddenly feeling
like old yeller right now?

221
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,627
Kind of surprised you
know the reference.

222
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,664
I've had a lot of downtime lately.
That and Fitz really wants a dog.

223
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,712
- Thought he wanted a monkey.
- Guess he readjusted his expectations.

224
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,572
You can't tell me where
we're going, can you?

225
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,057
You're gonna want to pack a bag.

226
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,407
So...

227
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,813
Everything all right?

228
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,449
Uh, yeah, I'm just
deciding on what to wear.

229
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,318
Why don't you let me take care of that?

230
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,023
- Where you going?
- Pick up another surprise for you.

231
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:23,293
But wait. We just
finished with the doctor.

232
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:26,296
It was important he not talk.

233
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,169
- Now it's time for the next phase.
- Wait.

234
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:42,912
I appreciate what you're doing, really.

235
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,414
But you have to stop.

236
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,352
I'm too, um...
I-it's just...

237
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,759
I have nothing to give to you in return.

238
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,460
That's not why I'm doing this.

239
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:04,184
Just be patient.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

240
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:15,448
I'm sorry about everything
that's happening, Skye.

241
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:18,785
Not your fault. The blame
begins and ends with my dad.

242
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,387
Well, you wouldn't be the first person

243
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,155
to have parents with
misguided intentions.

244
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:24,658
Nope, just the first whose crazy dad

245
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:29,062
lured her to an alien city
to get earthquake powers.

246
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:34,367
Yeah. I got us a little
something for the trip.

247
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:46,446
Thing I remember most about
my dad is he was a car guy.

248
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:50,784
Always working on this junker
he insisted I help him fix.

249
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,620
While my friends were outside,
playing ball, having fun,

250
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:57,991
there I was, stuck at home
with him, fixing that damn car.

251
00:15:58,026 --> 00:16:00,126
Wasn't till we finished that it hit me.

252
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:04,631
That car was the most
beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

253
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,633
<i>And all the time we'd
spent together working on it</i>

254
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:09,970
gave me an appreciation I
never would have had otherwise.

255
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:16,843
Hold on.
Was that car a red 1962 Corvette?

256
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,045
Yeah.

257
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:22,716
Well, he'd be very proud.

258
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:25,552
Your red Corvette flies.
How cool is that?

259
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,654
It's pretty cool.

260
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,857
But I think the thing
he'd like most about it...

261
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:35,495
at her core, she's still
just a red '62 Corvette.

262
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:44,070
Just to be clear, I-I'm
the Corvette in this story. Right?

263
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:46,740
Now you want to tell
me where we're going?

264
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,379
We're almost there.

265
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,817
<i>Have a seat.
I'll be right in.</i>

266
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,158
Pumpkin pancakes.

267
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:11,231
<i>When you left, it got me thinking...</i>

268
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:14,501
<i>what do I have to offer
that you would even want?</i>

269
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,336
Hmm.

270
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,977
Surprise.

271
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:42,997
Wait.
What are you doing?

272
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,066
I'm giving you what you want.

273
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,536
- You're wrong.
- We both know that's not true.

274
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:52,807
You took Skye off that
S.H.I.E.L.D. plane for a reason.

275
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:56,376
- I made her a promise.
- You don't have to pretend.

276
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,649
I saw the way you looked at her.

277
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:03,988
And you also picked me up from
the floor after she shot me.

278
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:06,423
Whatever I may have thought
there was between me and Skye,

279
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,892
she made it pretty clear
the feeling wasn't mutual.

280
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:14,798
- I'm not insane.
- Uh, I'm... sorry.

281
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:18,034
Please, you have to forgive me.
This is so stupid.

282
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:23,272
It's okay.

283
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:29,661
I... I ju...
I thought that if...

284
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:34,617
I looked like her, then maybe...

285
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:37,753
maybe there's a chance
we could be together.

286
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:42,692
Well, maybe we could.
But not as Skye or May.

287
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:45,460
No. It has to be with you.

288
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:48,096
- Me?
- Yeah.

289
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:49,899
There is no me.

290
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:55,364
Whoever I was before is destroyed!

291
00:18:56,472 --> 00:19:00,910
Whitehall wiped her all away.

292
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,516
Mack. How's your cover with Coulson?

293
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,385
We're giving him updates once a day,
painting in broad strokes.

294
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,987
Heartbroken ex-husband,
finding comfort in a bottle,

295
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:16,258
- that kind of thing.
- It's time for you to get back, then.

296
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,492
- Okay.
- Play it as ships passing in the night.

297
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,820
Roger that.

298
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:25,099
- What's your take on Hunter?
- It's hard to say.

299
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,734
He's not really the
type to show his cards,

300
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,637
- especially in front of an audience.
- Would you tell me if he was?

301
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:31,464
What are you implying, Robert?

302
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,166
I know that you and Hunter
have been reconnecting lately.

303
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,569
Maybe that's taken your
focus off the big picture.

304
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,571
You really want to play that angle,

305
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:41,140
after the hell you and I have
been through here together?

306
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:44,076
I need to make sure that
you're all-in, Barbara.

307
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:46,479
- I'm all-in.
- Good.

308
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:49,248
Then you'll understand why
we're keeping Hunter on the base

309
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:51,617
till the Coulson situation
has been resolved.

310
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:56,189
<i>I know what're you going through...</i>

311
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,824
my family did a number on me...

312
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,563
stripped me down, left me...
hollow. I was a shell.

313
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:07,900
So, when someone finally did come along

314
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:11,570
and offer to build me
back up, I didn't resist...

315
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:15,441
Even though what he really did
was make me a killer.

316
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:19,211
But you seem so well-adjusted.

317
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:23,449
It was a long road.

318
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:27,620
Took getting locked up to
give me some perspective.

319
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,555
But then I paid my family a visit.

320
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:35,394
They were surprised to see me,
but I think that eventually,

321
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:41,701
we were able to... dig in,
really... express our feelings.

322
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:43,436
That's it?

323
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:46,305
I haven't looked back since.

324
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:57,717
You are the only one
who can find yourself.

325
00:20:57,752 --> 00:21:00,386
But maybe...

326
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,423
...this will help.

327
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:07,727
- What is it?
- Closure.

328
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:11,463
<i>Sunil Bakshi?</i>

329
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:15,401
He's in Air Force custody
under a guy named Talbot.

330
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:19,338
I was thinking you and I
should drop by and say hello.

331
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:22,842
Bakshi was the one who
dragged me from my safe house,

332
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:24,810
prepped me for Whitehall.

333
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:27,480
Which is why you need
a face-to-face...

334
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:29,915
to get all this out.

335
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:33,285
Let him know how you really feel.

336
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:39,992
I... I-I...
I'm sorry. I just... I can't...

337
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:44,997
No. Hey. It's okay.
We'll do this together.

338
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:47,274
I'll be there every step of the way.

339
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:54,041
Okay.

340
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:59,145
- Okay.
- But how?

341
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
You said he's in Air Force custody.

342
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:06,452
Got that all worked out.
First...

343
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:13,953
...you...
are gonna need this.

344
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,302
I could have swore it
was in here somewhere.

345
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:25,371
Unless maybe I put it in my other purse.

346
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:27,173
Is everything okay, Mrs. Talbot?

347
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,976
Well, obviously not.
I can't find my I.D. anywhere.

348
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:34,413
It's not that, ma'am.
It sounds like you have a cold.

349
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:39,652
Can't seem to
shake the damn thing.

350
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:42,822
Probably got it from my son,
the little germ factory.

351
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:47,293
How about I just call the general,
get this all straightened out?

352
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,998
The thing about a riding mower
is it gives you a superior cut,

353
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:55,668
lets you control the terrain.

354
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:58,671
- That's very informative, sir.
- Ah.

355
00:22:58,706 --> 00:23:03,876
You got two hands, four
wheels... one saddle.

356
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:07,379
That's really what it's all about,
lieutenant.

357
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:09,748
General Talbot's office.

358
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:12,918
I see. It's security.

359
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:14,687
Your wife left her I.D. at home again.

360
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,192
It's a little early for
taco Tuesday, isn't it?

361
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:28,300
All right. Send her up.

362
00:23:28,336 --> 00:23:31,136
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:33,606
Sorry about the wait, Mrs. Talbot.
You're all set.

364
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:36,442
- I hope you feel better.
- Thank you.

365
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:42,515
<i>It's one of
Fury's old retreats.</i>

366
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,517
<i>Haven't been in here in years.</i>

367
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:47,320
Fury's not the kind of guy
who has a cabin just to relax.

368
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:48,988
What is this place?

369
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:50,923
It's a safe house for
people with powers.

370
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:54,260
Rogers even spent a few
weeks here after he defrosted.

371
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:56,762
Okay, but who's it
supposed to keep safe...

372
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:58,931
the people with powers or everyone else?

373
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,767
Both.

374
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:04,937
Skye, I'm afraid I have to
pull you from active duty.

375
00:24:06,674 --> 00:24:11,444
I get it. I do. I just didn't
think that you'd lock me up

376
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:14,113
- like a werewolf during full moon.
- You're not alone here.

377
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:17,450
- Feels pretty isolated to me.
- There's a direct video link to the base,

378
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:19,519
and May will keep dropping
by every couple of days.

379
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:21,554
What am I supposed to do?
Go fishing?

380
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:23,222
<i>Well, if you do go outside, be careful.</i>

381
00:24:23,258 --> 00:24:25,191
There's a laser fence
around the perimeter.

382
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:31,030
Look, this is a safe place.
You can relax here.

383
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:34,200
You can use this time to get
a handle on your abilities.

384
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:36,569
Yeah, 'cause that's worked great so far.

385
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,804
Well, maybe it's time we
give you a hand with that.

386
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,575
Simmons has been working
around the clock on these.

387
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,545
She assures me they'll cut
your recovery time in half.

388
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:48,881
<i>How to they work?</i>

389
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,083
The internal wiring emits
a surge of electricity

390
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,987
- to inhibit your powers.
- So these take my powers away?

391
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:56,489
More like decrease their magnitude

392
00:24:56,524 --> 00:24:58,724
to keep you from hurting yourself.

393
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,460
- Like I said, we want you to heal.
- Seems like a no-brainer.

394
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:03,629
It's a personal call.

395
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:05,265
What do you mean?
Are there side effects?

396
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:10,102
A few.
Simmons can go over them with you later.

397
00:25:10,138 --> 00:25:12,238
Are these gloves really my best option?

398
00:25:12,273 --> 00:25:14,140
I can't answer that
question for you, Skye.

399
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:17,077
Stop.
Stop being this S.H.I.E.L.D.

400
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:19,719
guy for just one second, okay?
Please.

401
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:21,414
<i>We've been through
way too much together.</i>

402
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:24,217
I just need you to be
my friend right now.

403
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:26,519
What would you do if you were me?

404
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:30,923
I don't know.
These are uncharted waters,

405
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,626
but if anybody can find
a way through them, it's you.

406
00:25:34,261 --> 00:25:36,862
'Cause I'm the red Corvette.

407
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:40,933
Because you're one of the
few people I know I can trust.

408
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:54,614
Do something to your hair, major?
Looks good.

409
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:16,802
- What the hell?
- Feed go out?

410
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:19,872
Yeah, and I can't figure
out why. Any ideas?

411
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:22,008
Might know a little something.

412
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,581
Hey, honey. Get lost
on the way to my office?

413
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:31,117
No, I'm not lost. I'm
just stuck in some traffic.

414
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,854
Wait, you're telling me
you're still in the car?

415
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:37,557
Yes.
I swear, this construction on 5th

416
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:41,686
- has been going on forever.
- But I just s...

417
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:46,599
She's not really here.

418
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:49,068
- Excuse me, sir?
- I need you to lock down

419
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:51,237
the base for me right now, lieutenant.

420
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:54,740
And if you see me someplace
I'm not supposed to be,

421
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:56,375
I'm not there.

422
00:26:58,046 --> 00:27:01,380
It's that damn mask again.

423
00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:07,363
Get to the sat room.
Make contact with Phil Coulson.

424
00:27:07,397 --> 00:27:10,099
Tell him the nanomask is in play.

425
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:14,237
No one comes in here
without my permission.

426
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,106
No one.

427
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:22,544
Is that everybody?

428
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:24,947
All female personnel
are accounted for, sir.

429
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:26,649
Outstanding.

430
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:30,686
At ease.
We have a situation.

431
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,221
There is a mole on our base.

432
00:27:33,256 --> 00:27:36,391
This mole infiltrated
security by posing as my wife

433
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:39,461
and could be anyone
in this room right now.

434
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:40,828
<i>Make no mistake...</i>

435
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:45,600
this is an enemy combatant,
one not to be taken lightly.

436
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:49,304
But rest assured, I will
find this perpetrator.

437
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:52,907
<i>Because if there is one
thing that I cannot stand,</i>

438
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:56,878
<i>- it is a spy in my house.
- Mack.</i>

439
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:02,449
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- Excuse me?

440
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,786
You've been off-campus several
days babysitting Hunter.

441
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,855
- Yet here you are.
- What? Oh, and still no Hunter, yeah.

442
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,050
Well, I mean, what can I say?

443
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:12,693
I spent the last 48
hours in Athens, Georgia,

444
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:13,994
keeping the guy out of bar fights.

445
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:16,664
I mean, the guy's in no shape to return.

446
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:19,966
- Well, then we've got a problem.
- I'm not sure I'm seeing it.

447
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,303
Hunter didn't resign or
take a leave of absence.

448
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:23,603
He went AWOL.

449
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,639
Yeah, a broken heart
will make a guy do dumb things.

450
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:31,044
- So will money and opportunity.
- Oh. No, uh...

451
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,279
What, you think Hunter...
might sell S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets?

452
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,447
No, no, trust me...

453
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:37,684
the only threat this
guy poses is to himself.

454
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:42,922
- Bobbi there when you left?
- No, I didn't see her.

455
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:45,591
Two ships pass in the night, I suppose.

456
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,993
Call Coulson.
He's waiting for your report.

457
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,363
Will do.
Is there anything else? Uh...

458
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:56,101
No.
You've done enough already.

459
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,437
Okay.

460
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:08,213
- Thanks for the update, Mack.
- Is everything okay?

461
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:12,083
- I'm afraid I have to get back.
- I get it.

462
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,552
Didn't expect you to stay
and roast marshmallows.

463
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,955
This is temporary, Skye.
I'll be back in a couple days.

464
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,123
- If you need anything...
- I'll let you know.

465
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,927
We'll figure this out.

466
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:27,665
I promise.

467
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,008
Captain Andersen.

468
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:42,146
I believe your daughter
goes to school with my boy.

469
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,651
- I don't have a daughter, sir.
- No, you do not.

470
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,395
Lieutenant...

471
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,764
when was the last time
I got your name right?

472
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,368
- Never. Sir.
- You are correct.

473
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:28,624
I think we have a winner, folks.

474
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:33,495
This is not your face.

475
00:30:34,664 --> 00:30:37,366
General, please...

476
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:43,171
Sorry about that, Meredith.

477
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:48,310
Damn it!
Where is she?!

478
00:30:56,185 --> 00:31:00,087
- Uniform's a little big.
- Shortest guy I could find.

479
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:02,056
Any luck with security clearance?

480
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:05,893
Come on. Follow me.

481
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:14,902
What is it you want?

482
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:23,701
Agent 33.
Loyal to the very end.

483
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:32,753
- What are you doing here?
- Just lending a hand.

484
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:36,556
- Whose orders are you following?
- My own.

485
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,594
Agent 33, you need to
listen to me very carefully.

486
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:43,797
You've lost your way.
Take a deep breath.

487
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:47,233
Calm your mind...
and your compliance will be...

488
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:55,508
Seems they all check out.

489
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:59,212
Then who the hell was that
masquerading as my wife?

490
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:00,479
Uh, sir...

491
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:02,382
- Hi, honey.
- Stop right there!

492
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:05,484
Th-The guard wasn't at
the front, so I just walked in.

493
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,953
- Get down!
- Glenn, you're scaring me.

494
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:09,622
- Now!
- Okay.

495
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:11,356
Put your face on the carpet!

496
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:14,760
Okay! God!
What is wrong with you?!

497
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:17,630
God, I-I-I even brought
those little pork taquitos

498
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,197
that you like so much.

499
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:21,466
Honey...

500
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:25,938
Carla?

501
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:42,921
- I'm sorry.
- You could have just told me, Bob.

502
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:45,323
I was hoping to keep you out of this.

503
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:51,128
You're right.
I totally blew that one.

504
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:57,601
I gave your name to Coulson
because Hartley needed backup.

505
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:02,340
I never thought you'd stay,
let alone care.

506
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:04,508
<i>Then you started asking questions</i>

507
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:05,977
about what Mack and I were up to.

508
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:08,379
And the next thing I know, he
has you tied up in his trunk.

509
00:33:10,982 --> 00:33:16,319
- Least fun road trip of my life.
- Forgetting Arizona?

510
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:19,857
More like repressing the memory.

511
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:22,251
Still can't listen to the eagles
without getting the chills.

512
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:29,032
I should have known
it wouldn't work out between us.

513
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:33,169
I mean, we first hit it off when
you were sent to steal intel from me.

514
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:37,340
- Well, I made it worth your while.
- Time of my life, really.

515
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:42,612
But maybe not the bedrock foundation
upon which a marriage is built.

516
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:48,183
Everything I felt for you...
that was real.

517
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,623
Yeah, maybe so.

518
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,658
But in the end, you still
got that intel, didn't you.

519
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,359
Hunter...

520
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:02,131
It's always the same pattern, love.
I fall for you, only to discover

521
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,565
you got something else up and running.

522
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,335
- There was no hidden agenda with you.
- Yeah, you say things like that,

523
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:07,936
but your actions
clearly suggest otherwise.

524
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,071
Can't you just meet me halfway?

525
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:15,244
- I want to. Just tell me how.
- Walk away. Right now.

526
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:17,211
You and I... we can
leave all this mess behind,

527
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:21,917
just start over,
be new people, be better people.

528
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:28,897
I'm sorry.

529
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,717
I need to finish this.

530
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:42,636
Fine.

531
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:46,732
Well, I'm leaving, Bob.

532
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:52,979
- So don't try and stop me.
- I won't.

533
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:02,494
Everybody else will.

534
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,963
There's nowhere to go!

535
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:15,468
Damn it, Hunter.

536
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:32,915
Bloody hell.

537
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:16,677
- Sir. Where's Skye?
- I'm afraid that's confidential.

538
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,512
'Cause you're keeping her
prisoner somewhere, aren't you?

539
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:21,648
Skye is safe, Agent Fitz.

540
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:24,185
That's all you need to know.

541
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:34,027
You took something...

542
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,798
...up to Coulson earlier.

543
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,468
- What was it?
- It was nothing.

544
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:43,236
Didn't look like nothing.

545
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:47,807
- What was in the case, Jemma?
- Something to help Skye.

546
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:50,843
Because you want to change her.
Is that it?

547
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:52,712
Stop it.
I don't want to change Skye.

548
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:56,849
The Diviner did that.
I'm just trying to fix her!

549
00:36:56,883 --> 00:37:00,086
You never used to be this
scared. You know that?

550
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,187
Trip died, Fitz,

551
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,824
all because we didn't take
the necessary precautions.

552
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:08,694
No, it's not that.
You're afraid.

553
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,964
'Cause of what happened to me and Skye,
how we both changed.

554
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:14,266
<i>Well, you know what
the scariest change is, Jemma?</i>

555
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,101
It's you.

556
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:28,947
Agent 33 infiltrated your
base to break out Sunil Bakshi?

557
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,249
<i>Turns out she wasn't
working alone, either.</i>

558
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:34,585
<i>We managed to track down video
of the vehicle leaving the premises.</i>

559
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,821
<i>Guess who was behind the wheel.</i>

560
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:39,791
<i>Grant Ward.</i>

561
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,694
Agent 33 must have dragged
him out of Puerto Rico.

562
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,229
Guessing we haven't
heard the last of this.

563
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,998
Your wife... how's she holding up?

564
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:49,767
<i>Rattled, which is to be expected.</i>

565
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,270
<i>Damn experience nearly
cost me my marriage.</i>

566
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,605
<i>I'm gonna be up to my
ears in edible arrangements</i>

567
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,374
<i>trying to make this thing right.</i>

568
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:01,884
<i>I lost two men to those psychopaths.
Good men.</i>

569
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,381
My condolences. It's never easy.

570
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,184
<i>Just tell me we'll get those
sons of bitches, Coulson.</i>

571
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,518
You have my word, general.

572
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,829
<i>All right, then. I'll be in touch.</i>

573
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,795
- It's a lot to process.
- Throw it on the heap.

574
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:25,369
- Everything all right, Phil?
- Earlier today, with Skye...

575
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,406
- just didn't feel right.
- You made the right call.

576
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,107
There's just too many
things in play right now

577
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:34,444
- for her to be here.
- Yeah, maybe.

578
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,146
But you ever get that feeling...

579
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,323
like you mishandled something important?

580
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:46,093
Yeah.
It's how I felt after leaving Andrew.

581
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,361
So, Mack... you believe him?

582
00:38:52,395 --> 00:38:54,463
- Nope.
- Me, neither.

583
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:56,932
Guess it's time we find out
what he's up to.

584
00:38:56,966 --> 00:39:00,836
Hey, it's me.
Something happened with Skye.

585
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,904
I think we have a situation.

586
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:04,306
It appears Hunter escaped

587
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:06,475
using one of the
ship's submersible pods.

588
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:08,477
We've managed
to scramble communications,

589
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:11,713
- but he's disabled the GPS.
- So we don't know where he is.

590
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:15,150
Or where he's going.
Once he reaches shore, he's a free man,

591
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:17,685
able to communicate
with whomever he pleases.

592
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,856
We approximate 12 hours
till he reaches the coast.

593
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:25,026
We may have a bigger problem.
I just got off the phone with Mack.

594
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:29,196
- Seems Coulson's put Skye in hiding.
- Stockpiling enhanced people?

595
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:32,933
I doubt that.
Skye and Coulson... they're close.

596
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:34,935
She's more than just some asset to him.

597
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,838
So says the person whose
ex-husband just flew the coop.

598
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:40,207
- Agent Calderon...
- Oh, come on.

599
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:43,043
We all know Bobbi could
have taken out that tea cup

600
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:45,079
- anytime she wanted...
- I might just have to test

601
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,181
- that theory out on your face.
- Enough.

602
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:50,384
Bobbi gave me her word
she's still committed,

603
00:39:50,418 --> 00:39:52,987
and I have no reason to doubt her.

604
00:39:57,592 --> 00:40:01,928
This is your op, Morse, so tell me...
how do you want to proceed?

605
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,599
Skye's not the main concern.

606
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:09,536
Coulson and his secrets...
that's the threat.

607
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,153
And I think it's time
that we remove that threat.

608
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:17,543
- I want to go back in.
- You gotta be crazy.

609
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:20,680
You know that Hunter could
blow your cover at any moment.

610
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:25,285
And Weaver?
She gave you 12 hours.

611
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:32,325
I only need six.

612
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:04,888
Nice to finally meet you.

613
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,031
I'm Grant.

614
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,160
Kara.

615
00:41:12,863 --> 00:41:15,165
I'm proud of you, Kara.

616
00:41:18,573 --> 00:41:20,403
Thank you so much.

617
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:26,737
You did this.
And it is just the beginning.

618
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:33,615
Guess that's true.
It's going to be a long night.

619
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,186
Guess we should get started, then.

620
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:51,166
- You really think this'll work?
- We'll see.

621
00:41:55,605 --> 00:42:00,942
If I obey,
will my compliance be rewarded?

622
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:09,150
To be honest,
it really won't make a difference.
