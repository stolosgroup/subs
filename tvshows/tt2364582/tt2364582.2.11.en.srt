HYDRA grows stronger every
day while S.H.I.E.L.D.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,724
clings desperately to a world
it no longer understands.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,093
- Why not lead?
- My time will come.

5
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,595
Tell me what happened to my mom.

<i>Your mother was
special because she had a gift.</i>

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,432
<i>Whitehall cut her to pieces.</i>

<i>I'm gonna kill the man

<i>You killed him! He was mine!</i>

We're human, Skye.
We just have the potential to be more.

11

There's someone new.
Tell the others I'm on it.

Trip!

00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:36,812
Poor thing.

20
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,818
How long since he
passed through the mist?

21
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:45,021
14 hours since terrigenesis.

22
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:49,725
- He's very emotional, Jiaying.
- I can see.

23
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,827
Leave us.

24
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,932
Gordon?

25
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,735
- Gordon, it's me.
- Jiaying? Help.

26
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:03,172
- I can't ... I can't see.
- Shh.

27
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,707
- What's happened to me?
- It's all right.

Help me, please.

That's why I'm here.
Can you follow my voice?

31
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:12,848
Take my hand.

32
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,519
It's okay. Come on.

33
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,025
It's okay.

34
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,596
I'm right here.

35
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:32,101
Come on.

36
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:35,137
Almost.

37

It's gonna be okay, beautiful.

38
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:45,281
I'll show you the way.

39
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:48,551
Go ahead. Let it out.

40
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:53,322
- It's okay to cry, Gordon.
- I'm trying.

41
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:57,159
But ... But I can't.

42
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,432
We prepared for this his whole life,

43
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:07,136
readying him for whatever may come.

44
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:13,576
Every cell within him has changed,
in his body and his mind.

45
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:17,379
It's terrifying.
But he's the ideal age ...

46
00:03:17,415 --> 00:03:20,850
<i>old enough to understand,
young enough to adapt.</i>

47
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:22,418
He'll be fine.

48
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,488
It's a blessing you
age so slowly, Jiaying,

49
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:29,091
able to counsel so many
generations through the change.

50
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,594
I won't live forever, Yat-Sen.

51
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,830
<i>Well, even with the
years of preparation,</i>

52
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,632
<i>without your warmth to guide them</i>

53
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,970
<i>through their transformations,
these poor souls...</i>

54
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,305
<i>They would be lost.</i>

<i>make fun of me for being

call me a goldfish or
a hamster or something.

<i>I just can't believe
he's not coming back.</i>

64
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,765
He should not have been down there.

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
You both went in for a good reason.

66
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,537
To prevent HYDRA from
starting a cataclysm.

67
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:52,474
- He was trying to save me.
- He may have saved all of us.

68
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:56,111
The Obelisk triggered
a massive earthquake.

69
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:57,846
<i>Imagine how much worse
it could have been</i>

70
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,516
if he hadn't destroyed it.
He died a hero.

71
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,020
Once medical clears you,
we'll get you out of there.

72
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:08,357
You'll just be stuck underground,
like the rest of us.

73
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,460

74
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:14,263
Just trying to keep busy.

75
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:20,915
<i>Everyone deals with it in their own way.</i>

76
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,207
<i>When you sign up for this kind of life,</i>

77
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,510
<i>you accept that loss will be part of it,</i>

78
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:32,448
<i>but you never get used
to losing one of your own,</i>

79
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,918
<i>especially when it's...
a good man like Trip.</i>

80
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:37,786
<i>It happens too much.</i>

81
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:42,291
<i>And over time, it makes
it harder to let people in.</i>

82
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:46,695
<i>Sometimes, just makes you
want to pack up and run.</i>

83
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:50,399
<i>Is that what
you want to do ... run?</i>

84
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:54,169
Sometimes.
You?

85
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:58,274
Couldn't even if I tried.

86
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:06,015
How long did it take
for Mack to get out of quarantine?

87
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,516
He cleared pretty quickly.

88
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,986
Whatever took over his system is gone,
but he's pretty shaken up.

89
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,189
- And Simmons ... is she back?
- Not yet.

90
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,491
<i>She has a team</i>

91
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:19,662
<i>documenting whatever they can
in the tunnels, cleaning up,</i>

92
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:22,765
<i>but it's slow going with no electricity.</i>

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,601
Be careful with that.

94
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,770
This area is finished.

95
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,372
<i>She'll assess the structural
integrity of the place</i>

96
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,775
<i>and, if possible, blow
one of the vertical shafts</i>

97
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,511
<i>under the ocean floor,
flood the city with water.</i>

98
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:37,279
And drown it for good.

99
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:41,450
Hopefully, the bedrock wasn't
too badly damaged by the quake.

100
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,788
The temple collapsed on itself.
It's a miracle you're still alive.

101
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,359
Did you find Raina's body yet?

102
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:55,130
There's a lot of rubble to
dig through, but not yet.

103
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>Whatever gas came out of
that Obelisk hit you, too.</i>

104
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,836
<i>That's why we're being extra cautious.</i>

105
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:03,238
<i>It's hard to make sense of all this.</i>

106
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:06,241
What? No, it ...
No, it isn't.

107
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,445
We lost.

108
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,681
- We failed.
- Skye, don't say that.

109
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:14,917
It wasn't because of HYDRA.
It was because of me.

110
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:17,837
- Don't blame yourself.
- If I didn't go down there,

111
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,221
you could have blown the place!

112
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:23,425
- That was one battle. This is a war.
- And Ward and my father ...

113
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:24,978
<i>- The rotten core
- Skye...</i>

114
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,763
<i>- at the center of everything!
- We did not fail!</i>

115
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:30,899
Trip prevented a disaster,
and Whitehall's dead.

116
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:32,368
<i>We cut off the head.</i>

117
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:35,604
And while HYDRA scrambles for
a new one, I will crush them!

118
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:41,076
I'm gonna make somebody pay ...
whoever the hell it is.

119
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,915
<i>Thank you, Mr. Bloom, for hosting.</i>

120
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:52,221
I regret that our biannual gathering
has turned into a vigil.

121
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:55,491
Daniel Whitehall has joined
our founder in the afterlife.

122
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,766
How unfortunate.
I admired the man's commitment.

123
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:06,602
- I was never fond of him.
- We must not speak ill of the dead.

124
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:09,338
Why?
What's he going to do about it?

125
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,540
What this means is
that there is a vacancy

126
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,209
at a management position
in this region of the world.

127
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,245
And who would you like
to see fill it, Dr. List?

128
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,747
Baron von Strucker
thought that Sunil Bakshi

129
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:21,116
was well-groomed to
serve in that capacity,

130
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:24,386
- so why is he not present?
- He's disappeared.

131
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,655
We think he may have been
captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.

132
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,592
Then in all likelihood, he's dead, too,
if he did his duty.

133
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,494
You underestimate S.H.I.E.L.D. ...

134
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,263
<i>constantly, it would seem.</i>

135
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:37,132
Von Strucker would like this
mistake to stop happening,

136
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,767
so I'm going to make it simple ...

137
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,036
S.H.I.E.L.D. will take this victory

138
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:45,274
- as a chance to move against us.
- Come aboveground.

139
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:48,377
Whomever can remove S.H.I.E.L.D.
from the landscape permanently

140
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:51,346
will win Whitehall's position.
Does that sound fair?

141
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,251
<i>Meanwhile, I intend to find out</i>

142
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,855
if Whitehall's obsession with
arcane artifacts was fruitless

143
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,225
or if, indeed, it did produce something

144
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,729
that we at HYDRA
can use for our future.

145
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:21,810
<i>No, no, no!</i>

146
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:39,685
These are the last sections, ma'am.

147
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:43,522
Same conclusion ... cavities
are carved from lava rock.

148
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,158
Therefore, these walls
are not load-bearing.

149
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:50,329
Alien stone lining to create
electromagnetic flux field...

150
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:51,823
at least, I imagine.

151
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,567
I can't measure the bloody thing
without electronic equipment.

152
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:59,671
I could spend a year down
here answering these questions.

153
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,088
Photograph it, mark it off,

154
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,892
- and let's flood this cursed place.
- Yes, ma'am.

155
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,632
<i>No.</i>

156
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,985
Hey.

157
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,755
Quarantine survival kit.

158
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,199
<i>Got a deck of cards for solitaire,</i>

159
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:02,701
bag of homemade trail mix
if you want to eat healthy,

160
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:04,169
a couple candy bars if not,

161
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,383
headphones, a few trashy magazines.

162
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:11,143
Cactus cooler.
I keep a stash.

163
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:13,479
I mean, you can only get it in
California ... it's the best.

164
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:17,816
Anyway...
I've been in quarantine before,

165
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:22,488
and I know it can drive
you absolutely nuts.

166
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:23,789
Thanks.

167
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:28,827
- I was beginning to feel like a leper.
- Are you kidding?

168
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:32,831
You managed to be taken hostage
by three known murderers,

169
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,033
you gunned Ward down, then were blasted

170
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,104
by an alien chemical weapon
and walked out unscathed.

171
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:45,444
Leper?
I think you're a rock star.

172
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,556
Staring off into space there, turbo.

173
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:01,593
Uh, i-it's Skye's bio-meter watch.
It was damaged in the cave-in.

174
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:06,431
- Records her heart rate?
- And skin temp ... lots of data.

175
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,934
If I can fix it, I might
be able to get a better,

176
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:14,840
uh, like a ... a snapshot
of what happened down there.

177
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,548
Can't make any sense
of it just now, anyway.

178
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,350
The... data in my
brain is jumbled today.

179
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,887
I'll get my small electronics kit.

180
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:30,889
You know, you can start tinkering.

181
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:33,759
You know, working with my
hands always cleared my head.

182
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,729
- How is it ... your head, since...
- I told you.

183
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,299
It's not gonna help to
give you a play-by-play.

184
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:42,634
I've never known you to be
afraid to talk about anything.

185
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,536
Yeah, well, you didn't feel it.

186
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:48,937
- And I can't describe it, so...
- Well, it's not good to keep

187
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:52,277
things to yourself, Mack.
I know what you're going through.

188
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,948
Really?
You know what it's like to lose control,

189
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,650
to be trapped inside your own body,
unable to tell it what to do,

190
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:00,586
to watch yourself hurt the
people that you care about?!

191
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,254
Yeah.

192
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,232
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- It's okay.

193
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:15,834
I'm a little on edge.

194
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:19,938
I guess I ...
I need to keep myself busy.

195
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,311
Hey, can you request access
to the schematics of the base?

196
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,347
I want to double-check
the ventilation systems

197
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,449
and make sure the
quarantine is fully isolated.

198
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:35,253
I don't want anyone else
falling prey to this alien crap.

199
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,788
<i>How many victims were there?</i>

200
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:38,690
<i>Two dead, three
in critical condition.</i>

201
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:40,525
<i>How did Raina do this?
She had no weapon.</i>

202
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:44,396
She was covered in thorns.
It's hard to comprehend.

203
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,198
I shot her a few times.

204
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,967
<i>- Good.
- But none a fatal hit, it seems.</i>

205
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,902
<i>I did manage to gather some
tissue from the ground ...</i>

206
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,170
<i>blood and such.</i>

207
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,538
How long till you can blow
the shaft on the ocean floor?

208
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,641
We're preparing the charges now.

209
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:57,709
That place will be underwater
and sealed up for good.

210
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:01,146
<i>Sir, as much as I'd like to
join the manhunt for Raina,</i>

211
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:04,983
I'd much rather come back
to H.Q., see... everyone,

212
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:08,286
to study Raina's tissue
and check on Skye.

213
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:11,156
- Whatever transformed Raina...
- She was exposed, as well.

214
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,158
We have enough boots on
the ground in Puerto Rico

215
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:14,359
to hunt down Raina.

216
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,028
Come home, Jemma.

217
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,365
Gather everyone.
We're going after HYDRA now.

218
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,533
With a prisoner exchange?

219
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,502
Using Bakshi out in
the open like that ...

220
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,070
it's a dangerous strategy, sir.

221
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,305
I know it's high-risk,
but we have a small window

222
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:29,474
to take advantage of
HYDRA's lack of leadership.

223
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,577
- It puts us out on a limb.
- With a chance to deliver a crushing blow

224
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,312
to those responsible for Trip's death.

225
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:36,815
- I'll take it.
- Responsible, huh?

226
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,876
You have something to say, Mack?

227
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,222
- Plenty, but I'll keep it to myself.
- Don't mind him.

228
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,224
He's just coming down from the
worst alien acid trip of all time.

229
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,061
- That's not funny.
- Just trying to lighten the mood, mate.

230
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,862
Yeah, well, Mack didn't ask
for what happened to him.

231
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:53,432
- Of course not.
- No one asked for any of this to happen.

232
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:55,734
HYDRA forced our hand, and now
Coulson plans to force theirs.

233
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,336
Did they?
Did HYDRA force our hand?

234
00:14:58,372 --> 00:14:59,871
- Calm down, Mack.
- Repeatedly, but we have a chance here ...

235
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,708
Or did we hand them detailed plans
and the location of that city?

236
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,543
HYDRA took them
when they took Skye.

237
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:07,045
Are you saying we shouldn't
have gone in to save her?

238
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:08,547
I'm saying there wouldn't
have been anything to take

239
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:10,182
if you and Skye hadn't been obsessed

240
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:12,050
with the alien messages
in your damn head.

241
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:13,719
- All right, let's just all ...
- This isn't about blame.

242
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,650
- Watch yourself, Mack.
- No one would have left Skye there.

243
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,723
- That's not what he's saying.
- I shouldn't have to ask any

244
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:20,292
- of you to save one of our own.
- You never ask!

245
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:22,394
You just give your orders, no
matter how cracked out they are!

246
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,596
Mack, you'd do well to
remember your rank right now.

247
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:25,497
Really? Rank at a time like this?

248
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,466
- Why don't you shove rank up your ...
- Not helping, Hunter.

249
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,800
- Guys, stop.
- No, it's cathartic.

250
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:30,569
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on it,

251
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:32,471
- Or do you just parrot his?
- Coulson's only trying to stop HYDRA.

252
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:34,773
We didn't stop anything! We
unleashed something on the planet!

253
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,241
<i>- Please.
- No one knows what happened yet.</i>

254
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,275
<i>Trip averted disaster.</i>

255
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,278
<i>- It could have been a lot worse!
- And Skye barely made it out alive!</i>

256
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,047
<i>Thanks to Trip ...
he sacrificed his life, Mack!</i>

257
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,149
No, he traded his life for hers!

258
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:46,318
<i>And then he was shattered
into a thousand pieces!</i>

259
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:47,486
That's enough!

260
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:55,293
If Trip was here,
he wouldn't be arguing.

261
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,695
He wouldn't be bitching.

262
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,564
He would be gearing up to
do what needs to be done.

263
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,634
Yes, we're dealing with
forces we don't understand,

264
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,603
but HYDRA I do understand.

265
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,672
I want everyone ready
when the sun comes up ...

266
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,455
end of discussion.

267
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:17,249
<i>Hope you're feeling
better this morning, Mr. Bakshi,</i>

268
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,818
<i>because you have a date
with the U.S. government.</i>

269
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,255
Smile.
There he is, general.

270
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,859
<i>Sunil Bakshi ... the man tied
to the Navy wedding massacre,</i>

271
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,629
<i>the U.N. attack, and who
tried to kill you, Coulson.</i>

272
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:31,696
While dressed up as you, sir.

273
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,198
<i>Safe to say, I'm not a fan.</i>

274
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:36,868
Perfect. I'll trade him to
you to add to your collection.

275
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,303
All I ask is your
assistance in handling ...

276
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:41,139
<i>Remaining HYDRA forces.
I understand the idea, Coulson,</i>

277
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:43,441
<i>and in this case, I'm not against it.</i>

278
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:44,743
Thank you, sir.

279
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:52,951
Go ahead.
You agree with the rest of the team.

280
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,020
You're concerned we're out in the open.

281
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,722
More that we contacted
the U.S. government.

282
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,758
I think Talbot's on the level.

283
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:02,657
I'm not worried about
Talbot, but around him?

284
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:04,896
There are security leaks everywhere.

285
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:08,567
And with Whitehall dead,
Bakshi may be even more valuable.

286
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:09,535
I'm well-aware, but without

287
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:11,903
- Talbot in our corner...
- I know.

288
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,172
Without him, we'll never have
a chance to get the upper ...

289
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:26,726
<i>Move up! Hit them!</i>

290
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:29,116
Go!

291
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,507
I count four left.

292
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:56,076
- You know what that means.
- Not really.

293
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,041
That's what it means ...
means I'm gonna do that.

294
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:13,477
- Good to know.
- More will be coming.

295
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:15,846
They must have intercepted
our transmissions.

296
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:19,083
- Talbot.
- Come on.

297
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:20,284
Get out of there.

298
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:22,953
Seems you underestimated us again.

299
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:24,722
Underestimated how
desperate they must be

300
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:26,356
if you're this important to them now.

301
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:31,028
No!

302
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:32,896
You'll never take us alive!

303
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:45,809
The S.U.V.'s still running, so get in!

304
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:55,219
- Whitehall is truly dead?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:55,254 --> 00:18:56,720
Then did Mr. Bloom set up the rescue?

306
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,589
- I'm just the driver.
- Who do you take orders from?

307
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:03,052
I guess I take
orders from you now, sir.

308
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,496
<i>Clear!</i>

309
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:14,705
"You'll never take us alive!"?
Really?

310
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,340
A little over the top, don't you think?

311
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,575
<i>I only had a day to
come up with this whole thing.</i>

312
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:22,646
Besides, if I let you write the script,
no one would say anything.

313
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:29,820
Well, Bakshi has
a flair for the dramatic.

314
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:32,356
Let's just hope he bought ours.

315
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,731
Word is, Coulson's mad plan worked.
Bakshi took the bait.

316
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,536
How's the watchmaker
project coming along?

317
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:47,037
Looks like it took precise work.

318
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:48,472
Your hands are getting better.

319
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:54,812
Well, my head's getting worse.

320
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,949
I'm totally confused by what I'm seeing.

321
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:01,952
Turns out the electronics
weren't crushed like I thought ...

322
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:03,887
Well, they were, but from
the inside out or something.

323
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:07,491
Well, can you fix it?
Get a look at Skye's biological data?

324
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,393
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I, um... yeah, I can.

325
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:13,397
I think so.
I won't know what half of it means

326
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:15,199
until Simmons gets back, anyway.

327
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,436
They're landing now.

328
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:27,878
Is every radioshack a HYDRA outpost?
I always suspected.

329
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:33,750
- This is lighthouse.
- This is warship. I'm free.

330
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:39,556
- Ah, Mr. Bakshi, very good news.
- But we have a situation.

331
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:41,325
Well, perhaps you'd better come in.

332
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,028
<i>- I'm a few hours out.
- See you then.</i>

333
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:46,396
Don't take that gun from your belt.

334
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:49,032
- This will be painless.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa! What the hell?!

335
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:51,535
Sorry. I like you,
but once you made contact,

336
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,204
- my orders were to take you out.
- Why?

337
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,472
My employers don't want you, Whitehall,

338
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,608
or your phone-a-friend
to get in their way.

339
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:00,077
- Sorry about this.
- W-W-Wait, p-please.

340
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:02,012
I'll triple whatever you're being paid.

341
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:04,781
Mm, I'm getting paid
by a bunch of people.

342
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:07,251
- That'll start to add up.
- They're moving against us.

343
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:10,387
They want you out of the picture.
If it's not me, it'll be someone else.

344
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,656
Please. Money is not a question.

345
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:15,826
If you can protect me and
see me safely to Bloom,

346
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:17,861
not only will you be
financially set for life,

347
00:21:17,897 --> 00:21:21,064
but you will also solidify your standing
with the true heads of HYDRA.

348
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,033
The money will be there!
I swear it!

349
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,637
I-If not, I'll pull the trigger myself.

350
00:21:30,242 --> 00:21:32,242
Okay.

351
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,245
Get in.

352
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:38,815
<i>Thank goodness
nothing bad happened to you.</i>

353
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:41,685
<i>Wouldn't want you to have
to stay in there forever.</i>

354
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,529
Raina ... she was unrecognizable.

355
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:55,299
It was insane, and not
just from the outside.

356
00:21:55,334 --> 00:22:00,737
Look ... we separated her DNA
and mapped it using gel electrophoresis.

357
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:05,075
Her DNA didn't just rearrange ...
it contains extra macromolecules.

358
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,109
I wouldn't think that even possible.

359
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:09,079
- That's amazing.
- It's horrific!

360
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:11,715
We need to make sure that
you're not contaminated

361
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,150
or infected in any way.

362
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:16,853
- What's the worst that could happen?
- An epidemic.

363
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:21,124
- That's a pretty harsh conclusion.
- Well, and I feel responsible.

364
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,161
We all do.
There's nothing you could have done.

365
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:26,830
Yes, there was.

366
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:30,667
I was so curious about powers,
about unearthly biology,

367
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:32,202
wondering where it might lead,

368
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:34,271
hoping to better
understand it, control it.

369
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:36,940
I should have been
trying to terminate it,

370
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:39,810
- erase it from existence.
- What?

371
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:43,347
You ... You've helped
plenty of people with powers.

372
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:45,349
It's ... It's part of
the world that we live in.

373
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:48,952
It's a plague, Skye ... all of it.
It only ever brings us death.

374
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:51,722
Donnie Gill, Chan Ho Yin, Creel
... the list keeps growing.

375
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:53,523
Not the Avengers ... they're not ...

376
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,359
The Avengers wouldn't
have been necessary

377
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:59,896
- if we hadn't unleashed alien horrors.
- There must be another ...

378
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:02,499
Trip was in fragments!

379
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:10,217
- I know.
- Well... it ends with him.

380
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:13,944
Flooding the alien city
may be the first responsible

381
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:17,180
thing I've done to protect
the people I care about.

382
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:21,985
I'll check these samples
and ... and compare them

383
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:23,887
to samples of your
blood we had from before,

384
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:26,490
- just to be safe.
- Okay.

385
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:29,593
<i>Just to be safe.</i>

386
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:36,116
<i>Don't worry.
I'll stay out of sight.</i>

387
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:39,131
<i>Cool as a cucumber, quiet as a mouse.</i>

388
00:23:39,132 --> 00:23:41,119
<i>I don't want any trouble.</i>

389
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:01,074
<i>It's exactly the way we traveled
the world all those years,</i>

390
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,576
<i>searching for answers.</i>

391
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:04,478
<i>I knew I'd find you here.</i>

392
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:06,813
- Raina.
- After all that time,

393
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:09,316
<i>I didn't quite get the
answers I was searching for.</i>

394
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:12,419
I'm sorry you didn't find
your way to the temple.

395
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:16,423
- You didn't get to evolve.
- Oh, I evolved.

396
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:21,628
What the hell have I become?!

397
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:31,247
- Raina, let's not lose our heads.
- What happened to me?

398
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,083
Metamorphosis, by the look of it.

399
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,587
I was supposed to
become something divine,

400
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,489
something transcendent.

401
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:42,058
My grandmother said I'd be an angel,

402
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:47,063
not some gnarled freak of
nature covered in thorns.

403
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:49,732
You always did like flowers.

404
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:54,838
They hurt, and it's your fault.

405
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:59,075
You wanted this more than anything.

406
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,644
But your thankless daughter was there.

407
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,180
She received the gift meant for me ...

408
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:07,283
came through the mist
as beautiful as ever!

409
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,186
What? What? What?
You mean Daisy was there, too?

410
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:13,923
Oh.
She emerged from the chrysalis?

411
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:18,570
Yes.
And that bitch took what was mine!

412
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,400
We all have our disappointments.

413
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:29,205
Ah, god.

414
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:32,442
I dreamt of the perfect
reunion with my baby girl,

415
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,477
revenge for my wife.

416
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:38,014
Coulson rained all over my parades.

417
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:41,985
But you say she's done
it ... she's changed.

418
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,456
Oh!
That's fantastic news.

419
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:50,460
Oh, she's gonna be so mixed
up now ... oh, terribly afraid.

420
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:53,363
She didn't have your mental preparation.

421
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,298
She probably ran right
back to Coulson's arms.

422
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,166
It's the worst possible
place for her to be!

423
00:25:57,202 --> 00:26:01,170
He'll put her on the index,
tag her like a shark.

424
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,940
She'll come to me when she sees

425
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:06,309
how they treat those
particular individuals.

426
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:10,546
It'll never happen.
She'll never love you, you stupid man.

427
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:14,450
The index ... I should
reconnect with some of them,

428
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:20,890
wreak a little havoc, ruin
that man and his dumb suit,

429
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:24,093
remind Daisy where she really belongs.

430
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:27,563
She may not love me now,
but she needs me.

431
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,301
What about me?
You ... you have to help me.

432
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:35,305
I did.

433
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,641
We helped each other,
achieved our goals.

434
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:41,444
You're on your own now.

435
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:46,249
You ... You have to
find a way to fix this.

436
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:49,018
There's no fix.
There's no reverse.

437
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:52,889
It's your lifelong dream.
It's lifelong.

438
00:26:52,924 --> 00:26:55,258
I can't live like this.

439
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:59,729
My insides feel like gravel.

440
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:03,533
I cut myself when I move.

441
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:07,537
I can't live as
this repulsive creature.

442
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:10,139
Then don't.

443
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,461
<i>Pull up over there.</i>

444
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:34,597
That's a pretty big fence
for protecting some grapes.

445
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:37,233
Mr. Bloom doesn't appreciate
unannounced guests.

446
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,002
Once inside, I'll send for you.

447
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,155
I canvassed the area, stashed the bike.
We're good here.

448
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,290
Your presence is most welcome.

449
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,026
Drop the accent. It makes
you sound like a douche bag.

450
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,594
Now you know what it feels like

451
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:06,963
for me to live in this country.

452
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,933
And we wait.

453
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,436
You didn't really take much of a stand

454
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,472
during that awkward family
argument back at H.Q.

455
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:18,875
Nobody meant half of what they said.

456
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,544
Everyone's just raw,
broken up over Trip.

457
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:24,347
Plus you and Mack have that
secret to keep under wraps.

458
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:25,515
This again?

459
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,351
Oh, and now Mack's in on it.
You're relentless.

460
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:30,219
Now I definitely think he is.

461
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:32,155
You and Mack have
something up and running,

462
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,190
and you avoided backing
him in that argument

463
00:28:34,225 --> 00:28:35,491
for fear you'd reveal it.

464
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:39,929
If I'm wrong, say so,
'cause you haven't yet.

465
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:45,635
Yeah.
We have a secret.

466
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,437
I know.

467
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,543
We're in a support group, okay?

468
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,346
See, this is the reason
I didn't tell you.

469
00:28:57,382 --> 00:29:00,750
- Jackass.
- I'm laughing because it's great.

470
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:03,753
That's the best thing
you could have said.

471
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:07,857
We dedicated our lives to an
organization that went to hell.

472
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:10,526
Our friends turned their guns on us.

473
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:16,732
- We needed help coping, Hunter.
- And I support it, really.

474
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:19,302
I was afraid you'd closed off even more.

475
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:22,572
This is actually healthy ...
like, emotionally healthy,

476
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:26,342
and that's not a phrase I ever
thought I'd use to describe you.

477
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:28,177
I'm happy to hear it, Bob.

478
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:31,981
Good.

479
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:39,789
So... do you guys pass
around a talking stick or...

480
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:45,328
<i>Thanks for the schematics, sir.</i>

481
00:29:46,564 --> 00:29:47,997
Ventilation system's all good.

482
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,767
And, sir...

483
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:54,237
I want to apologize for
my outburst in there.

484
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,371
It was uncalled for.

485
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:58,975
I have a little trouble
dealing with my anger sometimes.

486
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,811
- Join the club.
- Yeah, something I'm working on,

487
00:30:01,846 --> 00:30:05,181
but this alien stuff messed
with my head, and, uh...

488
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:08,284
and losing Trip brought
back a lot of hard memories.

489
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,619
For all of us.

490
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:13,055
I hope I-I didn't blow my
chance to work on Lola one day.

491
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,091
After that little R.C.
version you built for me,

492
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:16,459
I'm genuinely considering it,

493
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:19,971
although I couldn't figure
out how to make it fly.

494
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:22,932
It doesn't.

495
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:25,067
Sir, I do think Mack brought
up a matter we should consider.

496
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,631
- I'm all ears.
- I'm aware the team

497
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,772
hunting Raina
has orders to capture, not kill.

498
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:32,608
- As always.
- But this might be some sort of contagion

499
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:35,178
or even a plague
inadvertently set loose.

500
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:40,750
Plagues must be understood, yes...
but eventually eradicated.

501
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:44,120
Are you saying that you want to
put Raina down, Agent Simmons?

502
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:46,856
No, of course not, uh...

503
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,247
I'm just saying that if they have to,
it may not be the worst thing.

504
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:57,300
Thank you.

505
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:05,875
<i>They want to kill us ... a power play.</i>

506
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,877
The rest are moving
against us, Dr. List ...

507
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:10,213
gave the order to wipe us out.

508
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,481
<i>But von Strucker and I are
not involved, I can assure you.</i>

509
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,183
We're calling because
you may be a target.

510
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,219
<i>Do you think it's the baroness?</i>

511
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:18,521
And the banker and the Sheikh.

512
00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:20,623
<i>We can't have infighting
at a time of transition.</i>

513
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:23,209
We agree,
and we promise to smooth

514
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,560
this over as best as we can.

515
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:26,462
<i>We count on it.</i>

516
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,099
I'll send word.

517
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:36,005
Oh.
There is one other thing.

518
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,577
<i>There's a man outside
who's begging to die.</i>

519
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,597
Hey, Fitz.

520
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:08,304
- What's wrong?
- Can you tell me?

521
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,909
I fixed your bio-meter watch,

522
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:16,812
checked your vitals at the
time of the temple collapse.

523
00:32:20,418 --> 00:32:25,755
Your heart rate was recorded
at almost... 300 bpm.

524
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:31,327
- That's very fast.
- No.

525
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:35,298
That's inhuman.

526
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:39,568
I thought the readings were a mistake,

527
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:40,803
that I put the thing together wrong.

528
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:43,873
Been struggling to, uh, um...

529
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:50,079
something's wrong with
the data in my head.

530
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:52,882
- What are you saying?
- So, I was thinking how the heart monitor

531
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,684
seemed to shatter from the inside out,

532
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,185
but it was still on your
wrist when we found you ...

533
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,420
that doesn't make sense.

534
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:59,288
<i>And how we found you ...</i>

535
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:02,258
basically unharmed in the collapse,

536
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:05,027
with destruction all around you!

537
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:13,769
I thought I was losing
my mind all over again...

538
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:18,240
<i>...that there was something wrong.</i>

539
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:20,910
<i>So it took a while to dawn on me ...</i>

540
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:24,613
or maybe I was just afraid
to think it ... that...

541
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:29,518
you survived the destruction
because... you caused it.

542
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:31,821
No. No, no, no.

543
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:33,723
Raina wasn't the only
one changed in there.

544
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:35,958
And I'm pretty sure the DNA
results we're running right now

545
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:37,631
- are gonna confirm it.
- No. No!

546
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,711
There's nothing wrong with
the data in my head, Skye.

547
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:42,031
There's something wrong with you.

548
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:45,011
No!

549
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:09,566
- Hey.
- Hey.

550
00:34:09,601 --> 00:34:13,136
Feeling like you've been in that
glass box your whole life?

551
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:17,829
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

552
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:19,976
I-I just...

553
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:23,380
I feel isolated and
exposed at the same time.

554
00:34:23,415 --> 00:34:25,749
Being a caged animal is no fun.

555
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:28,251
It's for your own good ...
temporary.

556
00:34:28,287 --> 00:34:30,620
I know. I know.

557
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,356
Maybe I just need a hug.

558
00:34:33,392 --> 00:34:35,425
I hate seeing everyone fighting.

559
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,160
They're just having a hard time.

560
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:39,663
Yeah, but I've never seen
Coulson like that before.

561
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:42,532
He seemed so... cutthroat.

562
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:46,369
Yeah, I've rarely seen
him like this myself.

563
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:49,172
<i>For Coulson, Trip was the embodiment</i>

564
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:53,176
<i>of the principles he wants
S.H.I.E.L.D. to be built upon...</i>

565
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,783
<i>...compassion, loyalty, heart.</i>

566
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:03,186
<i>And that is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s strength.</i>

567
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:09,559
<i>And Trip's death reminded Coulson</i>

568
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:14,531
<i>that HYDRA doesn't have that,
and that is their weakness.</i>

569
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:42,425
I'll get the next one.

570
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,179
No more waiting.

571
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:19,896
Why have we stopped?

572
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,987
Oh! Ohhh!

573
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:59,002
- Coulson.
- He knows you too well.

574
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:03,606
He couldn't get to us, so he
had us slaughter each other.

575
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:06,376
Fortunately for you, we
already promised you to Talbot.

576
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:08,711
<i>So you're perfectly safe.</i>

577
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:10,880
Come on.

578
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:21,658
Are you bleeding?

579
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:24,260
<i>We should have your
DNA results back any minute now.</i>

580
00:37:24,296 --> 00:37:26,296
Once we know there's nothing
wrong, we'll have you out of there.

581
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,468
Something's wrong?

582
00:37:35,373 --> 00:37:36,706
What the hell happened?

583
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,176
Skye?

584
00:37:41,746 --> 00:37:46,563
- F-Fitz ...
- Fitz was a klutz again.

585
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:49,385
Uh, she's cleaning up the mess.
Sorry. It was my fault.

586
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:50,520
I knocked over the lamp

587
00:37:50,555 --> 00:37:52,388
when I was taking a
sample of Skye's blood

588
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:54,090
with one of those
ridiculous hazmat suits on.

589
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:56,926
Uh, I guess my coordination
still needs work.

590
00:37:56,962 --> 00:38:00,096
But I was anxious to
double-check the results.

591
00:38:00,132 --> 00:38:03,330
Her DNA is an exact match to
what it was before. She's clear.

592
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:06,369
Thank god.

593
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:09,072
I'm gonna call Coulson.
He can use the good news.

594
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:11,274
- You all right?
- Yeah.

595
00:38:17,482 --> 00:38:22,952
- Um, Skye is your bunk made?
- Uh, no. No, it's a mess.

596
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:25,788
Uh, well, maybe you could
get her some clean sheets.

597
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:26,823
She should probably sleep.

598
00:38:26,858 --> 00:38:30,894
Yes.
You deserve a good night's rest.

599
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:32,162
Yeah, I mean, I ... 
and I would do it,

600
00:38:32,197 --> 00:38:33,630
but last time I was in there,

601
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:36,232
there was lots of ladies'
things, and she's a slob.

602
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:38,735
I'll help bandage her hands.
It was my fault, anyway.

603
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,803
Okay.

604
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:43,706
Yeah.

605
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:51,848
What did you just do?

606
00:38:53,451 --> 00:38:55,652
I switched your blood
results with your old samples.

607
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:57,487
Give me your hand.

608
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,958
- The new samples are different?
- Drastically.

609
00:39:01,993 --> 00:39:04,460
But until everyone
around here calms down,

610
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:07,363
I don't think we should tell anybody

611
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:10,934
what with the way Simmons is acting.

612
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:15,972
For now, we should just
keep it between us ...

613
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:19,142
keep you safe until
we figure it out, okay?

614
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:28,151
- It's okay.
- This is all my fault.

615
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:29,385
- How?
- I could have stopped her.

616
00:39:29,421 --> 00:39:33,022
I let ... I let this
happen, and I'm so sorry.

617
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:36,292
- No, it's okay.
- No, everything's my fault.

618
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:44,534
<i>You're right.
There's something very wrong with me.</i>

619
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:46,469
No, you're just different now.

620
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:53,124
You're just different now,
and there's nothing wrong with that.

621
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:15,865
Don't move.
We're not here to hurt you.

622
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,767
We just want to take you in.

623
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:24,007
No. Either you kill me...

624
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,844
...or I make you do it.

625
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,021
It's okay, beautiful.

626
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:40,857
I'll show you the way.

627
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:06,556
Or that time when Trip tossed me the mag

628
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:09,059
on the burnside raid and it
fell down the sewer grate.

629
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:11,995
<i>Yeah, what did he say again?</i>

630
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,065
"Good catch, soccer hands."

631
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,733
Did he ever tell you about the time

632
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,029
his grandpa took him to
grandfather mountain when he

633
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:20,971
- was a child in North Carolina?
- Mnh-mnh.

634
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:23,673
<i>Well, he gets there, and
they pull up to the gate,</i>

635
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:26,409
- I have visual confirmation.
- and his grandfather...

636
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:27,577
<i>And then Triplett...</i>

637
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:30,113
Fury's toolbox is locked
in Coulson's office.

638
00:41:30,148 --> 00:41:33,116
Did you manage to wrangle
the blueprints from the base?

639
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,884
Yeah, we're almost good to go.

640
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,755
- Okay, I'll make contact soon.
- His grandfather comes down...

641
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,392
and he says, "U'm sorry, grampa.
I thought you owned the whole mountain."

642
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:46,396
- He'd be mad I told you that story.
- No, he'd say...

643
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:48,982
<i>"Come on, girl."</i>

644
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:06,999
We're gonna laugh a lot less ...
that's for sure.
