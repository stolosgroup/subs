[breathes deeply]

109
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,682
Here's what we know.
HYDRA's on the move.

110
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,285
They have the Obelisk and an
expert who knows how to use it.

111
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:34,254
We can't let that happen, obviously.

112
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:35,688
- Use it how?
- Based on our latest intel,

113
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:39,125
there's something very powerful
inside it ... a weapon.

114
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:42,128
Are we talking chemical,
biological, energy-based...?

115
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,730
Could be anything.
It's alien.

116
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:45,932
While Simmons and I
were undercover at HYDRA,

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,635
Whitehall was looking to create
an extinction-level event

118
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:50,420
to kill millions of
people. We have to assume

119
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:52,138
that this weapon has
the potential to do that.

120
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:54,173
Because bad guys
love their WMDs.

121
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:55,975
Trick is, to activate the Obelisk,

122
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:57,977
HYDRA has to take it to specific place.

123
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,813
It's like they have the keys
to launch a nuclear warhead ...

124
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:03,116
Now they need the lock ...
a temple inside the city.

125
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:06,386
- Any idea where this temple is?
- Glad you asked ... No.

126
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:09,355
But it's in the city,
and we now know where that is.

127
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,858
Even better, HYDRA doesn't.
Fitz?

128
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:18,931
On our mission to Australia,

129
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:22,101
we hacked a military
satellite network. Using that,

130
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,503
we ran a multispectral
topographic scan of the Earth,

131
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,171
miles deep
through the oceanic crust,

132
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,674
looking to match
ancient rock formations

133
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:33,110
with the 3-D model of the city.
And we found this.

134
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,583
Isn't that
in the Bermuda triangle?

135
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,218
'Cause that
would explain a lot.

136
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:41,787
Actually, it doesn't have
anything to do with the triangle.

137
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:44,790
- We solved that back in the '80s.
- Uh, Atlantis?

138
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:47,393
- Try Puerto Rico.
- These white markers

139
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:50,530
represent vertical air shafts
that are close to the surface,

140
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,198
possible entry points
for the city,

141
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,400
but most of them
are under the ocean floor.

142
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:56,435
Except for one ...
here, in old San Juan,

143
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,404
where we'll enter
the underground city.

144
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:01,073
A survey team will test the
tunnel's structural integrity,

145
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:03,843
- then locate the temple.
- And then what, sir?

146
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:06,379
We blow the hell out of it.

00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:43,349
Be right back.

159
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,818
<i>Thank you.</i>

160
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:49,121
You know, Agent May,
the whole point

161
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,458
of embedding a tracker in
somebody is that you don't

162
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,728
have to stalk them. Or did
you just come by to say...

163
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:58,831
[distorted]
Hello, Raina.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,986
Dr. Whitehall would like a word.

165
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:10,009
[tires screeching, horn honks]

166
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:17,783
Gonna want
to make your next right.

167
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:20,836
Next right.
Unless you want to spend

168
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:23,261
your last night on Earth
In the hotel HYDRA.

169
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,328
How ...

170
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:31,063
I'll explain later.
Come here. Give me a hug.

171
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,664
I'm not hitting on you, okay?

172
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:35,255
I'm S.H.I.E.L.D.
Okay, just...

173
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:42,241
Stay close.
And stay quiet.

175
00:08:57,256 --> 00:09:01,426
Shh.
Bye-bye, HYDRA.

176
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,330
I'm Agent Sam Koenig.

177
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:08,467
Coulson sent me.
Sorry, but...

178
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:11,303
You're gonna need a lanyard.

179
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,504
[camera shutter clicks]

180
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,668
<i>I'm telling you, sir, she looked
exactly like Agent May, </i>

181
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:26,270
<i>except for the freaky
facial-scar thing.</i>

182
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:27,571
That was Agent 33.

183
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,608
She was wearing a nanomask,
disguised as May,

184
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,343
but May electrocuted her
right in the face.

185
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:34,045
<i>Sam: Oh, that is so badass.</i>

186
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:37,281
<i>Sam, I'm on with the director.
Thank you.</i>

187
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:39,050
You were saying you think HYDRA was

188
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,751
there to kidnap Raina, not kill her?

189
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,753
<i>Well, we counted
four two-man teams,</i>

190
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:45,356
<i>all non-tactical,
all in full surveillance mode.</i>

191
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:47,091
<i>And the freaky one told Raina</i>

192
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,859
<i>that Whitehall wanted to talk.</i>

193
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:51,228
Question is why...
and why now.

194
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:53,631
<i>No idea, sir,
but this is the first sighting</i>

195
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:56,567
<i>we've had of HYDRA since
you let Raina out in the wild.</i>

196
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,519
Okay.
I'm sending Agent May

197
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,871
with an extraction team.
Sit tight until they get there.

198
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:04,274
<i>- Copy that, sir.
- He's sending the cavalry. Sweet!</i>

199
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,846
<i>Sam, what, are you 13?
You can't do a sit-up.</i>

200
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,712
<i>You think you're gonna hook up
with the cal... [computer beeps]</i>

201
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,781
<i>Reporter:
 More news on the investigation</i>

202
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,249
<i> of the horrific murder-suicide</i>

203
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,851
<i> of Massachusetts Senator
Christian Ward.</i>

204
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:16,787
<i>FBI sources claim that
while the senator did leave</i>

205
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:19,656
<i>a recorded confession, other
evidence found at the scene</i>

206
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,240
<i> suggests another party
 may have been involved. </i>

207
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:25,229
He did it.
You know Ward did it.

208
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:28,632
- No doubt in my mind.
- The senator should've let us help.

209
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,335
We tried, but he wanted
nothing to do with us.

210
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,770
All we can do now
is try and catch Ward.

211
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:36,306
Or put
the son of a bitch down.

212
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:39,109
Change of plans.
We're splitting up the teams.

213
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:41,478
We're going after Ward?
No, we're not.

214
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:44,548
HYDRA found Raina.
Tried to grab her in Vancouver.

215
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,049
Grab her.
Not kill her.

216
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:48,952
They're grasping. HYDRA
knows we found the city.

217
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,554
Maybe they think
she can help them.

218
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:52,956
- We're pulling an extraction.
- And you're leading it.

219
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,224
I'll head on to the city
in the quinjet

220
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:55,459
with Bobbi, Mack,
and Fitz-Simmons.

221
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:57,294
We need to locate that temple.

222
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,229
So, you want me to go with them?

223
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:02,065
We're all anxious
to see the city,

224
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,167
but I'd like you to run point
on Raina's interrogation.

225
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:05,836
I think she'll respond to you.

226
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,571
Yes, sir.
I'll spread the word.

227
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:15,345
You don't want Skye anywhere
near that city, do you?

228
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,682
It's not the city I'm afraid of.
It's her lunatic father.

229
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:23,186
- Keep an eye on her, okay?
- Of course. I'm her S.O.

230
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:31,161
Quinjet's prepped.
You almost ready?

231
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:33,263
Yeah, I was looking
for the dwarf case.

232
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,665
Well, ask Fitz.
I'm sure he'll know.

233
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:38,068
Ah. No.
That's all right.

234
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:41,037
I'm sure
it's around here somewhere.

235
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:44,908
So... how long
were you two a thing?

236
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:49,012
[chuckles] A thing?
Fitz and I? No.

237
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,947
I mean, we never..

238
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:52,749
I-I never dreamed...

239
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:56,019
[chuckling] Okay. I'm just
gonna stop you right there.

240
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:58,321
If this were an
interrogation, you'd have

241
00:11:58,322 --> 00:12:00,557
given me about nine visual
cues to put you away.

242
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:02,625
Maybe 10.

243
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:07,130
Look, I...

244
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:10,533
I know the story...
of what Ward did to you two...

245
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:14,037
...how Fitz's brain was damaged.

246
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:19,509
- That's not your issue, is it?
- No.

247
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:21,310
So, what happened?

248
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:24,313
[breathes deeply]

249
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:28,684
We were in the bottom
of the ocean in a storage pod,

250
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:30,586
left for dead, and Fitz ...

251
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:33,823
he said something that caught
me completely off guard.

252
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:35,224
Ah, those three little words.

253
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,426
Yes.
Well, no.

254
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:41,051
I mean, not exactly.
[sighs]

255
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,868
I barely had a moment
to process what he was saying

256
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:47,136
or how I felt about it.

257
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:49,372
Next thing I know,
he's giving me the oxygen,

258
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,806
water's rushing in, and...

259
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:56,545
...he's...

260
00:12:56,613 --> 00:13:00,383
he's laying there,
in the hospital bed.

261
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,186
- He was so pale.
- How long was Fitz in the coma?

262
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:09,191
Nine of the longest days
of my life.

263
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:14,096
And when it finally broke, he ...
he couldn't speak, he...

264
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:17,066
he just stared at me, confused.

265
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:19,969
All I wanted to do was help him.

266
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:23,539
All I wanted
was my best friend back.

267
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:25,141
Your best friend.

268
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,335
I never thought of him
as anything else.

269
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,715
That said, I can't imagine
my life without him.

270
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,083
It's all very confusing.

271
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,718
You've never told him
any of this, have you?

272
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:39,989
- Oh, lord, no.
- Yeah, it's tough.

273
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:41,991
I wish
I could give you some advice,

274
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:44,593
but I've never been friends
with a guy first.

275
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:46,462
It's always been a roller coaster.

276
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,831
Fast out of the gate,
hit the drop, the turn,

277
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,800
the loop,
the screeching halt, then...

278
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:55,062
back in line to do it all over again.

279
00:13:55,739 --> 00:14:00,576
- But is the ride worth it?
- I'll let you know when it's over.

280
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:05,814
You know...

281
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:09,585
at the very least,
you should be honest with him.

282
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,820
If you don't have trust...

283
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:25,534
- Don't die out there, okay?
- It's Canada.

284
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,509
Coulson: You two okay?

285
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:35,377
- Yeah.
- Ready when you are, sir.

286
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:37,613
- Good. Head on up.
- Yep.

287
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:49,925
All right. Time to go.
I'll see you in San Juan.

288
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:57,933
See you there... sir.

289
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:18,787
[grunts] So...

290
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:21,123
you and Hunter... again.

291
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,290
- I know.
- Mm.

292
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,993
- Been through it enough times.
- I know.

293
00:15:25,061 --> 00:15:26,695
Gluttons for punishment, I'd say.

294
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:28,530
Let's not go down this road, okay?

295
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:31,133
You're a big brother,
but you're not my big brother.

296
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,268
Your personal life,
that's your business.

297
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:35,204
I'm just wondering if it means you're

298
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:37,072
bringing Hunter in on the other thing.

299
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,676
- That? No.
- Well, I figured after we

300
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:43,345
- lost Hartley, you'd try to ...
- No, he has no idea.

301
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:48,506
- And I'd like it to stay that way.
- Copy that.

302
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:23,818
[cellphone beeps]

303
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:26,521
Excuse me,
mate.

304
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,589
[grunts]

305
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:32,627
Somebody call an ambulance!
This guy just passed out!

306
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:35,029
- That's impressive.
- Thanks, Billy.

307
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:37,398
No, I'm Sam.
Billy's the shorter one.

308
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,071
[bodies thud]

309
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,572
Two more down.

That's not Sam's knock.

312
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:53,214
You two have a knock?

313
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:57,318
Yeah, we're brothers.
Of course we have a knock.

314
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:59,020
Lanyard, please.

00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,222
<i>Agent Skye.
[beeps, door unlocks]</i>

316
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:03,524
Come on, Sam.

317
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:05,260
You can't just look through
the damn peep hole?

318
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,495
I'm Billy.
Sam's the shorter one.

319
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:09,864
Okay. Right.
Well, we need to move.

320
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,700
Come on.

Go for the stairs!

Stairs, copy!

Stand down, Agent 33!
We can help you!

329
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,045
Unh!

330
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:22,598
I don't need your help.

331
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:25,967
There's more coming.

332
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,703
We need to ...
What the hell is that?

333
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:30,740
May's evil twin,
formerly known as Agent 33.

334
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:34,877
I thought the Koenigs were creepy.

335
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:39,782
- Tell Coulson we're on our way.
- Yes, ma'am.

336
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,299
[door closes]

337
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:01,503
No tails on the way in ...
none that I could spot, anyway.

338
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:02,838
Then we're good.

339
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,640
You ever had
the fried plantains here?

340
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,841
<i> Tostones?
Yeah. Why?</i>

341
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:08,127
I read about this place
down the street where

342
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:10,346
they put crab in them.
I wouldn't mind trying that.

343
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:13,182
You know,
after we save the world.

344
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:14,850
[cellphone beeps]
Diego texted me.

345
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:16,518
He's gonna be late.
He's always late.

346
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,654
Said he'd meet us
on the other side of the plaza.

347
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,823
This contact of yours,
can we trust him?

348
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,058
He's a politician,
so, no, but he likes me.

349
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,761
And he can get us
those architectural plans?

350
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:28,530
Yes, and he'll keep
the local cops off of us.

351
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:30,549
Things could get sticky, depending

352
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,501
- on where we're digging.
- Ooh. Hats.

353
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:35,671
Wish I was a hat guy.

354
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,639
Some guys can really
pull that look off, you know?

355
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:45,581
- What? Too small?
- You know, for a guy

356
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,549
who's about to blow up a
chunk of an underground city,

357
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,786
- you don't seem fazed.
- You have concerns?

358
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:53,355
Just want to make sure
that we're here

359
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:55,991
to destroy that weapon,
not recover it.

360
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,561
- Why would we do that?
- That's what Fury would do.

361
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:02,802
- I'm not Fury.
- No. But he did hand you

362
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,734
the keys to the kingdom for a reason.

363
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:08,437
[sighs] Look around you.

364
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:14,042
Vendors selling their wares,
bringing home a modest income.

365
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,612
Locals buying fresh vegetables
for dinner tonight.

366
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,917
Tourists on
their one vacation a year.

367
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:25,153
- Point?
- They are the point.

368
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:29,024
They're the reason I'm here, the
reason there's a S.H.I.E.L.D.

369
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:31,826
There are 3 million people
on this island,

370
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:35,297
and I won't let HYDRA turn
them into collateral damage.

371
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,535
With all due respect, sir,

372
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:43,004
this kind of op,
Fury would have a number.

373
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:44,939
- A number?
- Of acceptable losses.

374
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:48,076
My number is zero.
For the record, I hate that phrase.

375
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,011
<i>That's why
I brought Fitz-Simmons ...</i>

376
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,964
not just to find the
temple but to assess its

377
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,850
structural integrity,
minimize injury or destruction.

378
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:58,620
Minimize destruction?
You really aren't Fury, are you?

379
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:01,189
Come on, Bobbi.
You ought to know me by now.

380
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,124
Rather use a scalpel
than a shotgun.

381
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,526
Well, it's HYDRA.
Might need the shotgun.

382
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:08,630
Why do you think I brought you?

383
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:12,200
There's Diego.
I'll be right back.

384
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:30,351
Okay. I'm gonna go check
on the landing gear.

385
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,853
What? No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

386
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,621
No, no. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

387
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,523
Why ... why?

388
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:40,595
Because the awkward silence
in here... is killing me.

389
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:43,064
[bag thuds]

390
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:48,269
[breathes deeply]

391
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:49,870
- I'd like to say something.
- I've been thinking ...

392
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:51,505
- Please let me go first.
- No ... I don't ...

393
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:53,641
- There's something I need to ...
- I know I've got ...

394
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,743
No, I ... I know things have
been difficult between us

395
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,344
since I got back
from being undercover,

396
00:21:57,412 --> 00:22:00,014
but I need you to understand
that I didn't leave because

397
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:02,151
- of what happened to you.
- No, no, no, no, Jem... Jemma.

398
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:04,185
Jemma, please,
because I've got a whole...

399
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:06,587
It's ... it's hard enough
to get the words out.

400
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:10,925
I've been thinking,
and I'm going to leave the lab

401
00:22:10,992 --> 00:22:15,429
so you can be the one
who runs the science division.

402
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:22,535
- You're quitting?
- No. I'm ... I'm ...

403
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,839
I'm going to the garage,
on the bus with Mack.

404
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:32,579
- But why?
- You know why.

405
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:39,153
You're clearly far more ca...
cap... capable than I am.

406
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,759
- At this point, anyway.
- That's not true.

407
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:46,026
You just need more time to heal and ...

408
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:49,296
I've had time, and I'm ... 
and I'm not better,

409
00:22:49,364 --> 00:22:52,199
So you should run the lab...

410
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:53,867
And I can work for you.

411
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:58,772
I just can't work with you.
And...

412
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,675
I think that's what's best.

413
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:13,654
The fort of San Cristobal ...

414
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:16,289
held off the Dutch,
the English, the Americans.

415
00:23:16,357 --> 00:23:18,158
But apparently, not the aliens.

416
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,293
Coulson: Looks like your buddy
Diego drew those plans.

417
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:21,795
<i>He got them from the city archives.</i>

418
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:23,296
<i>They're older than San Juan itself.</i>

419
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:25,766
<i>According to Skye's
satellite spectrometry,</i>

420
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,135
<i>there's a vertical shaft
under this fort.</i>

421
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:30,737
Looks like
it's right at the water's edge.

422
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:33,874
Think we'll get a better
vantage point from up there.

423
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,276
According to the map,

424
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:38,879
the garrison is located
underneath that sentry tower.

425
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:40,881
That's the deepest part of the fort.

426
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:44,417
<i>- Coulson: And inaccessible to the public.
- All the better for us.</i>

427
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:46,253
Won't be easy
to get equipment down there.

428
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,755
Get ahold of Diego ...
see if he can help us out.

429
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:50,490
We need to stay ahead of HYDRA.

430
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:52,192
Even if HYDRA locates the city,

431
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,794
how do you think they plan on
unlocking the Obelisk?

432
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:57,097
I mean, nobody can even
touch the damn thing.

433
00:23:57,164 --> 00:24:01,109
That we know of.
[thunder rumbles]

434
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,708
Corner, two men wearing
classic HYDRA black,

435
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:10,877
trying desperately hard
not to look conspicuous.

436
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:13,880
- And failing.
- Where's May?

437
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:15,381
Good question. I'll go check.

438
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:21,621
S.H.I.E.L.D. must be quite happy.

439
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:24,724
Your plan of dangling me
like bait seemed to work.

440
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,293
I thought Whitehall wanted
to kill you, not kidnap you.

441
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:29,762
Something must've
changed his mind.

442
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,233
Maybe he thinks you know
something about the Obelisk.

443
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,634
How it works.

444
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:37,870
Are you saying
Whitehall has the Diviner?

445
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:41,140
Someone give that girl
a new flower dress.

446
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:46,846
- Well, that changes things.
- How so?

447
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:49,248
They don't want to kill me.
They need me.

448
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:54,120
- Need you for what?
- I can hold the Diviner.

449
00:24:55,656 --> 00:24:59,525
You mean the thing
that turns people to stone ...

450
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:04,163
- you can touch it?
- You don't believe me.

451
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:05,865
Honestly, everything
that we've been through,

452
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:07,333
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

453
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,536
When you hold it,
these symbols appear.

454
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:12,505
There's a pull to them,

455
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:14,540
like a sense
of where the Diviner belongs.

456
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,576
Sounds a little "Harry Potter" to me.

457
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:21,380
It's alien technology.
The Diviner reads your DNA

458
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:24,083
to determine
if you're worthy of its power.

459
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:26,452
You'll understand
when you touch it.

460
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,222
No, thanks.
I'd rather not die just yet.

461
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:32,542
You wouldn't,
not according to your father.

462
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,294
He believes you're worthy, too.

463
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:38,531
Listen, if you think
you're gonna trick me

464
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:41,367
into touching that thing,
you're as crazy as he is.

465
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:43,269
It's not crazy.

466
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:46,439
It's our destiny.

467
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:51,477
<i>I'm over here!
I'm over here!</i>

468
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:53,112
[tires screech]

469
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,848
- Found May.
- Get in!

470
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:02,054
[tires screech]

471
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:10,229
[dialing, ringing]

472
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:12,698
They've got her, sir.

473
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:15,868
I'm sorry, but she did mention

474
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,903
that they implanted a tracker in her.

475
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:22,474
How fortunate. I'll get my
best man on it right away.

476
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:30,466
So, what happened
to Agent 33?

477
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:31,967
You guys just left her there?

478
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:33,569
We had to.
HYDRA was closing in.

479
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,070
We almost didn't make it out.

480
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,107
- I wonder if that's weird for May.
- How do you mean?

481
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:40,175
Someone else
having your face like that.

482
00:26:40,243 --> 00:26:45,247
- It's just creepy.
- Hey, Trip, how's the shoulder?

483
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:47,316
Uh... it's getting better.
Thanks.

484
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:50,452
- We were talking about Agent 33.
- Ooh, with the freaky fried May face.

485
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,554
Yeah, and the scary robot voice.

486
00:26:52,622 --> 00:26:54,523
Oh. [robotically]
Crush, kill, destroy!

487
00:26:54,591 --> 00:26:55,624
[chuckles]

488
00:26:57,393 --> 00:27:01,463
"Lost in space"?
Tv show? You ...

489
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,299
Is there something in my teeth?

490
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:08,170
What? No. No.
No, I was, um...

491
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:11,340
I was just wondering, how many
of you are there, anyway?

492
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,942
- Brothers, I mean.
- <i>Both: 13.</i>

493
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,977
13?

494
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:17,012
[both laugh]

495
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,650
- Look at him. He fell for it.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

496
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:24,653
That gets people every time.

497
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,722
Yeah, yeah, you ...
you got me.

498
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:27,856
You got me good.

499
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:29,124
[smacks lips]

500
00:27:29,192 --> 00:27:32,327
Yes, the extraction was a success.
Skye's with Raina now.

501
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:35,330
- How big was the HYDRA contingent?
- Not big enough.

502
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:37,132
<i>But they sent Agent 33
to take point.</i>

503
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,009
- You know she still has my face?
- I heard. Lucky her.

504
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:43,105
Any theories
why they came so hard at Raina?

505
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:44,973
Skye has one ...
Raina claims

506
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,342
that she can touch the Obelisk
without being harmed.

507
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,927
<i>That's ridiculous.
I swear on my...</i>

508
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:51,023
Said that it would lead them
to the temple.

509
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:54,683
- Do you believe her?
- Skye does.

510
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:56,651
You were right about Raina
opening up to her.

511
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,886
<i>You promised
you would help me.</i>

512
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:00,113
- Have her stay at it.
- You can't leave right now.

513
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:01,952
See if Skye can get me any recon
on that temple.

514
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,592
<i>May: Copy that.
[cellphone beeps]</i>

515
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,393
Where'd your friend Diego go?

516
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:07,496
He won't go down
into the garrison.

517
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:11,099
- Turns out he's afraid of the legend.
- What legend?

518
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:14,112
They call it
"La garita del diablo ..."

519
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,815
- The devil's sentry.
- Delightful.

520
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,850
Yeah. The fort was built
in the 18th century

521
00:28:18,918 --> 00:28:21,252
and helped repel
some of our british ancestors

522
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,288
when they tried
to invade the island.

523
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:27,317
But this particular
guard tower was built

524
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:32,583
in 1634 and is well-known
as being haunted.

525
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,401
[thudding in distance]

526
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:39,604
- Now, that's a deep hole.
- And haunted, apparently.

527
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:42,340
Not scared of ghosts,
though, are you Mack?

528
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,409
I mean ... [chuckles]
of course not.

529
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:45,710
[electricity crackles]

530
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:49,030
But w-what was that story?

531
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:51,282
The story is, several of the guards

532
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,351
went missing in the middle
of the night from this tower,

533
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:55,153
never to be seen again.

534
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:58,022
They simply vanished.
It's all preposterous, really.

535
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,234
Yeah. About as preposterous
as an alien city.

536
00:29:06,065 --> 00:29:09,200
- How's it coming?
- Uh... well, um...

537
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:10,835
- You should, um...
- Why don't you ...

538
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,370
- No, it's all right.
- You go first.

539
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:13,705
- No, no, that's all right.
- Fitz, this is your ...

540
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:15,306
- I know, but you ...
- Someone start talking.

541
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:18,647
Uh, we are ready to deploy, sir.

542
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:24,816
- Would you like me to ...
- No, no. Um...

543
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:37,919
How long will it take to survey
the tunnel and locate the temple?

544
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:39,564
Uh, it depends on
several factors,

545
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:43,367
like the tec... tec...
tect...

546
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:45,570
- Don't look at me.
- Uh...

547
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:50,174
Uh... The, um...
The tec...

548
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:51,409
Tectonic stress levels?

549
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:53,544
Tectonic stress levels, yes,
and the structural...

550
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:55,446
Structural integrity of the
tunnels, how damaged they are.

551
00:29:55,514 --> 00:29:56,814
And how deep they go.

552
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,450
Coulson: How will you know
what the temple looks like?

553
00:29:59,518 --> 00:30:01,686
Well, we'll know it
when we see it, I guess.

554
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:05,539
We'll be depending entirely
on the data the dwarfs send us.

555
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,324
[beeping]

556
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:11,900
- What just happened?
- Uh, the tablet's still working.

557
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,031
Looks like they just went out.

558
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:20,310
Raina: My very own
S.H.I.E.L.D. I.D.

559
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:23,777
We match.

560
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,878
I'm sorry for trying to run.

561
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:31,549
I just got swept up in the moment.

562
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:34,451
You're lucky Coulson's
the forgiving type.

563
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,222
Actually, I feel very
lucky we found each other.

564
00:30:40,492 --> 00:30:42,593
Your father's told me so much about you.

565
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:45,629
It's funny, since I've never met him.

566
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:49,721
Of course you have.
When you were born.

567
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:53,620
Did you know he actually delivered you?

568
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:56,657
That's sweet.
He also killed a whole bunch of people.

569
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:58,525
He almost killed my friend Trip.

570
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,764
Does he get emotional? Yes.

571
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:07,301
Violent, even? Yes.

572
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:11,972
But he's also...
quite misunderstood.

573
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,077
Then help me understand him.

574
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:21,748
- Where did you two meet?
- Thailand.

575
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:26,453
I was just a petty con
artist, scamming tourists,

576
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:29,589
running with a bunch of freaks,
as we liked to call ourselves.

577
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:32,125
My father was one of your freaks?

578
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,255
No.

579
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:39,332
He took us in, cleaned us up...

580
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,534
showed us we weren't freaks at all.

581
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:45,271
Before I met your father,

582
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:48,775
I was a lost soul with no
clue of where I belonged.

583
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:53,780
- The daughter he never had.
- No.

584
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:57,150
No one could ever replace you, Skye.

585
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:59,885
You're all he wants.

586
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,859
All right.
Let's get some light down there.

587
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:12,298
Eyeballing it, it
looks at least 100 feet.

588
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:15,368
That's all right.
I'm not scared of heights.

589
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:19,839
- The dark, however...
- Just get those dwarfs back online.

590
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,140
Otherwise, we're blind down there.

591
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,776
Well, sir, it might
not just be the dwarfs.

592
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:25,244
Could be all electronics.

593
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:27,228
[electricity crackles]

594
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:35,421
Be honest, Skye.
Haven't you ever felt lost...

595
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:39,826
or had that feeling that you
were part of something bigger?

596
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,561
Like you were special?

597
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:47,533
When you say "special,"
what you really mean is "alien."

598
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,735
Is that what you believe?

599
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:53,839
We're human, Skye.

600
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:56,542
We just have the potential to be more.

601
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,881
But the Diviner?
Now, that is most definitely alien.

602
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:03,082
Where do you get this stuff?

603
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,884
- My father?
- Partly.

604
00:33:04,951 --> 00:33:07,053
But my grandmother came from a long line

605
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,288
of special people who
believed in a story,

606
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:12,425
about the blue angels
that fell from the heavens.

607
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,628
The ancients called them the Kree.

608
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:20,132
- And what do the Kree want?
- Change.

609
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,736
That's why they left the Diviner,
as a guide to the temple,

610
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:25,704
so the worthy would inherit the Earth.

611
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:28,908
And do you know where this temple is?

612
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:32,886
That's what the Diviner shows you.

613
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:38,284
Only the worthy are allowed inside
to witness its true power.

614
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:42,888
And what happens to the
people who aren't worthy?

615
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:48,044
I hope they've said their goodbyes.

616
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,297
Three pulls on the cable
means "help," got it?

617
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,565
Yes, sir.

618
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:59,306
- Let me down easy, turbo.
- Please be careful.

[wind howling]

621
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,800
<i>Skye: We can't let
them go down there, May.</i>

622
00:34:28,868 --> 00:34:30,001
- We have to stop them.
- Calm down.

623
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,203
You can't let Raina get into your head.

624
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,172
She's not lying.
Look, she said the Diviner

625
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,141
was meant to guide the
worthy to the temple.

626
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:37,476
You see this?

627
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,277
It's the same symbol
I saw on the Obelisk.

628
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,947
- It's got to be the temple.
- You're sure?

629
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,182
Trust me.
It is seared into my brain.

630
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,609
We have to warn Coulson now.
Something bad is about to happen.

631
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,121
Damn it! Why isn't this working?

632
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,856
Getting some kind of interference.

633
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,859
<i>Whitehall: S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6...
do not engage your defenses,</i>

634
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,036
<i>or you will be shot out of the sky.</i>

635
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:00,695
Whitehall.

636
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,906
There's HYDRA quinjets outside
the windows on both sides.

637
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,574
Then let's step on it, shall we?

638
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:13,011
<i>You have someone aboard that
 I want ... a woman named Raina.</i>

639
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,047
<i>I'm going to send over
a representative to get her.</i>

640
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:20,852
<i>Any attempt to evade or retaliate
will be met with hostile fire.</i>

641
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,805
<i>Uncloak and prepare to be boarded.</i>

642
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,409
Destiny calls.

643
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,907
I hit bottom. Copy?

644
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:48,354
- Hey, I hit bottom!
- Fitz: Okay!

645
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,282
Aah!

646
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,484
Aah!

647
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,853
Aaaaaah!

648
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:33,417
Aaaaaah!

649
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,246
- Coulson: Get him up now!
- I'm trying! It's at max power!

650
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:38,981
- He's struggling on the line!
- Before the dwarfs went down,

651
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:41,417
they scanned for signs of life.
All readings were negative.

652
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:42,418
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I can see him!

653
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:44,553
- He's coming up!
- Hang on!

654
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,545
- Get the harness off him!
- Hey, talk to me, Mack! Mack!

655
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,608
Aaaah!

656
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:54,397
Mack!

657
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:55,698
Coulson: Stand back.
Mack, talk to me!

658
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:56,899
What happened? 
Were you attacked?

659
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,106
I don't see any wounds
or signs of blood.

660
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:01,130
Mack!

661
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:03,706
What did you say? 
I can't hear you.

662
00:37:08,912 --> 00:37:11,080
- Run!
- Aah!

663
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:15,184
- Simmons: Oh!
- Coulson!

664
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:21,033
May: I'm not going to give
up the lives of everyone

665
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:23,085
on this plane for Raina.
She's not worth it.

666
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:25,354
HYDRA already has the Obelisk.
If they have Raina, too ...

667
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,455
We still have the edge.

668
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:28,190
Coulson's already on site.
HYDRA's not.

669
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:29,425
How the hell did they find us?

670
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:32,042
- We were cloaked.
- Ward: Raina's tracker.

671
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:39,068
Old frequency S.H.I.E.L.D.
used during the cold war.

672
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:42,871
What can I say?
I'm a history buff.

673
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,043
Lower your weapons.
Anyone shoots, the plane goes down.

674
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:50,112
- We all die.
- Maybe it's worth it.

675
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,115
- Let's not get carried away just yet.
- Skye: First, you gave us Bakshi.

676
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,617
Now you're back with HYDRA?
Pick a side, Ward.

677
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:58,954
Oh, I have.
Don't worry.

678
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:00,322
Let's go.

679
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:04,393
With pleasure.

680
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:07,582
You, too.

681
00:38:08,031 --> 00:38:10,165
What?

682
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:14,469
I made you a promise, Skye.
I'm here to keep it.

683
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:16,405
You're coming with us.

684
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:18,674
The hell she is.

685
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:20,475
Snap out of it, Mack!

686
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:22,411
I don't want to hurt you.

687
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,463
Fitz, icer!

688
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,382
Simmons: He's not going down!
Why isn't he going down?

689
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:03,185
- She's not going anywhere.
- May.

690
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:05,053
- She comes, or the deal's off.
- May: Shut up.

691
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:07,622
May, if I don't go with him, he's
gonna blow this plane to pieces.

692
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,660
- They're HYDRA. They'll do it anyway.
- You can't trust him, Skye.

693
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:16,364
- Yes, you can. Skye, look at me.
- Don't talk to her.

694
00:39:16,432 --> 00:39:17,599
Skye, I give you my word ...

695
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:20,735
come with me, we won't
fire a single shot.

696
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:24,372
- Everyone gets out alive.
- Good one.

697
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,320
Is that what you told my
brother before you killed him?

698
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:30,655
How many of you are there?

699
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:33,148
Skye...

700
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,917
...you can't.

701
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:38,278
There's no other way.

702
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:40,822
You know that.

703
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,426
Whatever happens, I can handle myself.

704
00:39:57,973 --> 00:39:59,774
Raina: Oh, Skye, don't
forget your tablet.

705
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:03,829
You know, the one with
the map of the city on it.

706

[groaning]

Aah!

712
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:41,315
Please, Mack, wake up.
Don't make me do this.

713

<i>Simmons: Ah!</i>

714
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:45,620
Coulson: I got you. 
Shoot him, Fitz!

715
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:47,155
This isn't an icer.
These are real bullets.

716
00:40:47,222 --> 00:40:48,828
Damn it, Fitz, shoot!

717
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:51,058
Aah! [electricity crackles]

718
00:40:51,126 --> 00:40:52,460
Give me your hand!

Aah!

720
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,066
No!

[body thuds]

- Seal the tunnel.
- What?! What about Mack?!

723
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,675
That wasn't Mack.

<i>Coulson: We'll return in a moment.</i>

725
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,245
Update?

726
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,569
Ward's mission was a success.
He has Raina.

727
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:28,286
But...
there was a complication.

728
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:29,420
Go on.

729
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:33,258
He also took a hostage
from the plane ...

730
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:35,360
the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Skye.

731
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:43,034
- He said it was an insurance policy.
- Really? How curious.

732
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:45,370
I'll have to ask about
that when we join him.

733
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:47,705
What's more important is they
shot the S.H.I.E.L.D. plane

734
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:49,006
down once and for all.

735
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,345
Actually, sir, Ward let the plane go.

736
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:58,182
That was not his decision to make.

737
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,017
What are you waiting for?
Fix it.

738

[dialing, ringing]

00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:07,792
Bravo 4.

740
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,762
You have a go.
Shoot them down.

741
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,399
Repeat ... shoot them down.
