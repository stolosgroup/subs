00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:06,531
Oh, gorgeous!

3
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:07,750
Wow, Dorit.

4
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:10,056
Naughty Santa's helper.

5
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:12,945
Sweet Santa's helper.

6
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:15,555
<i>I have not talked to him,
even though he calls me</i>

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,498
- every day.
- Wow.

8
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:20,414
Erika shared
that Tom calls her.

9
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,721
Let me tell
the ****ing story.

10
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,244
You were needling
a little bit.

11
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,811
I am not going to sh***
On her

12
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:29,133
when she's at her bottom.
That's not who I am.

13
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:30,179
Oh God.

14
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,425
This article says that
"Tom stands accused

15
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,560
of stealing millions of dollars
from vulnerable clients."

16
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:39,346
- Is that money gone? Spent?
- I think it's gone.

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,218
Sutton called me in the car

18
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,569
and said that we should all
meet and talk without Erika.

19
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,571
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

20
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,313
I think that we have
heard stories

21
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:52,316
that to me don't add up.

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,231
You're saying, "I don't
believe you, Erika,

23
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,882
- and I think you're guilty."
- I have questions.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,525
I left yesterday
very concerned.

27
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,329
And then I started thinking,
and my alarms went off

28
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,646
and red flags
started flying everywhere.

29
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,234
I talked to an attorney.

30
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,649
I'm like, "What have we gotten
ourselves into?"

31
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:25,868
I am not sure how much

32
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:31,485
I want to be around my friend
during this time.

33
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,625
And I'm not being
a fair-weather friend,

34
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,402
I'm protecting myself.

35
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:38,536
I don't want my name
in an article

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,523
that's associated with this.

37
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,237
Well, that's associated
with taking money and...

38
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,847
- Any of it.
- Yeah, any of it.

39
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,545
Right, that part
I understand.

40
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,850
You mean because
of our connection to Erika?

41
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,374
Who would?
Who would want that?

42
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:51,984
This sounds terrible.

43
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:53,246
But how could that
affect you?

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,943
Because it does, Lisa.

45
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:58,904
People are like, "Oh, she's
friends with that person."

46
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:03,039
<i>Look, I'm on boards museums,
ballet companies.</i>

47
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,563
<i>I just... I want to stay clean.</i>

48
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:09,262
Like I don't want
to be involved.

49
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:11,221
I don't care about that.
I don't care about that.

50
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:13,484
I know that you
don't care about that... I do.

51
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:14,656
Okay.

52
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,925
Look, I mean, Ruth Madoff
has zero friends.

53
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:24,538
People don't like cheaters
and liars and stealers.

54
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,929
They just don't like 'em.

55
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:31,328
- But what if she's innocent?
- Then I'm eating crow pie.

56
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:32,546
- Okay.
- All day long.

57
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,591
- All right.
- Fair.

58
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,113
Okay.

59
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,463
<i>Why the ****</i>

60
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,291
Are you thinking about
your reputation here?

61
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,250
Your friend's hurting,

62
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,920
your friend's going through
something pretty ****ing major,

63
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:44,950
and you're thinking
about your reputation?

64
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,648
Right now,
I am way more important

65
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:50,347
than Erika Girardi is to me.

66
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:51,783
I'm more important.

67
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,220
Well, it's very honest.

68
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,875
Princesses worry about
their reputations.

69
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,617
Queens don't.

70
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,966
So you don't worry
about the legalities,

71
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,359
you're worried
about your reputation?

72
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,317
- I'm worried about both.
- Both.

73
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:06,319
- You sought a lawyer's advice.
- I did.

74
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:07,611
I just asked
a lawyer friend to explain

75
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,893
because I did not actually read
the whole "LA Times" article,

76
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:10,979
it was too long.

77
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:14,066
I too sought
some advice for this.

78
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,291
It's sad to read about
all of these victims.

Oh my God.

81
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,650
I don't want our support
of Erika

82
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:35,435
to be misinterpreted as support

83
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,003
for some of the atrocious
things that have been done.

84
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,918
- That's right.
- That's the problem.

85
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,268
You're right, Dorit.
You're so right.

86
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,314
- That is how I feel.
- High five.

87
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:47,404
When you read in
the "LA Times" about victims...

88
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:51,103
Children, orphans, widows,
of course, your heart breaks.

89
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:53,758
And you think to yourself,
my goodness,

90
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,368
I can't stand behind that.

91
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,414
Okay, I do have
a little bit of gossip.

92
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:01,418
One of the partners
at his law firm left

93
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:04,421
because his wife
told the partner,

94
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,814
"Honey, something's off."

95
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,816
- Stop it.
- I can't make this up.

96
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,818
"You need to leave this firm."

97
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:11,819
- When was that?
- And she knew about it.

98
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,514
Ten years ago.

99
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:18,478
Who knows, but it was
just a huge red flag for me.

100
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,784
We know his son-in-law left.

101
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,133
And then
the son-in-law left.

102
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,827
- The son-in-law just left.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:23,842
Recently.

104
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:25,137
So do you feel like

105
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:27,618
you've been told the truth?

106
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,707
No.

107
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,798
- Do you not believe Erika?
- I think she has lied to us.

108
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,148
- You do?
- I do.

109
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:40,587
And it started with
the three years ago head injury

110
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,502
that was a broken ankle.

111
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,852
Wait, he had a car accident
a few years ago.

112
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,419
- Right.
- Three years ago.

113
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,813
He was also unconscious
for 12 hours...

114
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,162
He was?

115
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,859
Being told he had
a broken ankle,

116
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:53,818
then hearing this later
is a little weird.

117
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:56,429
There's stuff
that's not adding up to me.

118
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:59,345
There are some, you know...

119
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,651
- Discrepancies.
- Yeah.

120
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,827
There are,
because I felt like

121
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:06,352
when we were on the mountain,
it was very clear to me

122
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,919
- that it all started...
- Three years ago.

123
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,007
- When he had the accident.
- Absolutely.

124
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,791
- Right?
- Three years ago,

125
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,967
he had a terrible,
terrible head injury.

126
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,013
And there was
a significant shift

127
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,493
in his personality,

128
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,756
his decision-making,
and who he is.

129
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,497
And then reading the article,

130
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:21,802
it didn't start
three years ago.

131
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,413
I don't buy it.

132
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:25,197
You don't buy what?
The whole accident?

133
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,678
I don't buy the three-year
package... I'm not buying it.

134
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,202
Since we've been back home
from La Quinta, the articles...

135
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,876
I'm right there with you.
It's all prior.

136
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:35,501
- Okay.
- So that's not congruent

137
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:36,861
- to what information...
- Right, to the three years.

138
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,558
- That we've got.
- Okay.

139
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:40,517
<i>Erika said that
there was a decline</i>

140
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,694
in his mental state
for the last three years.

141
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,522
<i>And the "LA Times" article</i>

142
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,915
<i>suggests this has been
going on for longer.</i>

143
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,527
And you start to wonder,
my goodness,

144
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,790
I've known this person
for so long

145
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:56,054
and never had any idea
that any of this was going on.

146
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,709
And so you don't know
what to believe.

147
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:02,147
So ten years ago is when
it started to be found out

148
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,802
that he was not
paying settlement money.

149
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,413
- Right.
- And Erika is suggesting

150
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,502
that three years ago there was

151
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,809
- this pivotal accident...
- Correct.

152
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,811
- That changed...
- Yes, changed everything.

153
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,160
- Everything.
- And then his attorneys

154
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,944
are now saying that he is

155
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,470
mentally incapable
over the last three years.

156
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,080
Erika is saying
the exact same thing

157
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,560
the lawyers are saying,

158
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,126
but yet there
is evidence to show...

159
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,085
- I think they've talked.
- Well, here's...

160
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,913
Whoa.

161
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:30,915
- Who? Erika and Tom's lawyers?
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,091
- Really? <i>
- Is that a coincidence</i>

163
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,181
that both
Erika and Tom's attorney

164
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,965
<i>had the same story?</i>

165
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,576
<i>I'm just saying
two plus two equals four,</i>

166
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,229
and I'm not even good at math.

167
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,231
I'm having a hard time
being her friend

168
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:46,757
because this speaks a lot
to character and integrity.

169
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:49,934
I want to be careful
in my dealings.

170
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,588
- Yeah.
- You're also saying

171
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,067
you don't want the association
with her, though.

172
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,592
I don't want my name
in the paper about this.

173
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,897
I don't want to be associated

174
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,943
with these crazy stories either.

175
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,075
But I think she's telling us
the truth right now.

176
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,903
I can't believe otherwise.

177
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,776
There's no proof to not believe
Erika at this point.

178
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,734
I don't believe she knew
those things, but if she did,

179
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:09,301
she's not going to say,
"Oh yes. I did know."

180
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,172
- If she actually did do that.
- Let me ask you all

181
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,870
- a question.
- There's no way you can

182
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,132
- ...ing admit that.
- Did y'all believe Denise

183
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,612
last year?
Do you really think

184
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,222
she was telling the truth?

185
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:18,832
Really?
In your heart of hearts.

186
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,617
- That was child's play.
- That was child's play.

187
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,140
But did you really think
she was telling the truth?

188
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:23,707
No, I think she was
just saving her marriage.

189
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,926
Okay. I'm going to get
so much sh***

190
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,147
Because I didn't have
my friend Denise's back,

191
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,585
but yet I am supporting
my friend Erika and yes,

192
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,066
I don't give a sh***
Whether you like me or not.

193
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,633
<i>If I thought Erika
was foolish,</i>

194
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,591
****,
I'd say the same thing to her.

195
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,594
I don't know
what is going on there.

196
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,248
I need to find out.

197
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:46,207
I need to let it play out
and see what's going to happen.

198
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,992
There cannot be
a blind support,

199
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,255
because I personally have
known her for five years.

200
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,823
And I'm telling you
everything I believed

201
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:56,522
about Erika's life is actually
the diametrical opposite.

202
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,002
Oh my God.

203
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,786
She didn't portray
that they had anything

204
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,875
- but a happy, loving marriage.
- A loving marriage.

205
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,138
When she talked about him,
she talked about the man

206
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,532
that was there
for the little people

207
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,012
who was the one who was
defending the little people.

208
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,013
Right.

209
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,144
I wanted to be a lawyer

210
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:11,624
when I was a little girl.

211
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,886
I fantasized about
being a lawyer.

212
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,322
I love everything about it.

213
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,586
It's great,
and it's so exciting.

214
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,588
And I don't care
if it's over $5,000

215
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:21,634
or $500 million,
you do some good.

216
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:22,896
Yeah.

217
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,986
But Tom misappropriated

218
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,035
at least $2 million of funds
of orphans' and widows' money.

219
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,864
- That is sickening to me.
- You just can't even imagine.

220
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,648
- It is sickening. It hurts!
- It is beyond $2 million.

221
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,258
Please, excuse me,
I have notes here.

222
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,870
This is three pages
of attorney stuff.

223
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:43,700
The burn victim from 2010,
the settlement was $12 million.

224
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,223
- Wow.
- Tom won it for...

225
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:48,705
The burn victim
got $1 million,

226
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:52,143
and so now this guy's family
filed a lawsuit

227
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:55,363
and listed on the lawsuit
Jordy's accountant,

228
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,278
the travel agent, Erika.

229
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,845
- Wow.
- Do people think it's hidden

230
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,151
or they think
it's actually all gone?

231
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,893
- Gone.
- Girls. They spent it.

232
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,329
- Why is...
- All of it.

233
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,026
What do you think they did?

234
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,550
They buried it somewhere?

235
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,160
- That's a lot of money.
- The question is,

236
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,162
did Erika know about
these things, or did she not?

237
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:14,597
I don't think that ignorance
is an excuse.

238
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:19,300
I just don't,
when she's so smart.

239
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,041
Ohh.

240
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,261
You got to choose,
are you going to be smart,

241
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:25,742
or are you going
to be blissful?

242
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:28,919
To be honest,
that whole mistress thing

243
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,095
and all of that
is beneath any of us.

244
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,400
- Yes.
- I also don't like

245
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,750
the deflection.

246
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,795
- Oh, seriously.
- Right.

247
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,623
It's like, "There's
a mistress over here!"

248
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,103
- This is scary...
- This isn't about

249
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,713
- sleeping with another woman.
- Scary stuff.

250
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,802
This is major.

251
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,108
Think about this.
You guys, in the beginning,

252
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,718
the first little trickle
that came out,

253
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,415
she said people
started disappearing,

254
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:48,895
and then start learning
who your friends are.

255
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,288
And I said to her,

256
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,768
"Well, I'm here
through the hard times.

257
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:52,769
I'm not only here
for the good times."

258
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,074
You would be shocked

259
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,815
at how quickly
people turn on you.

260
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,861
They were there
when it was good, though.

261
00:09:57,945 --> 00:09:59,602
If people are leaving
when it's not a good time,

262
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:00,733
I'm not that friend.

263
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,648
I know, I know, I know.

264
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,824
I mean, yes, I'm here
if you've lost all your money,

265
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:06,304
I'm here if your husband
cheated on you.

266
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:07,914
I'm here
if you're getting divorced,

267
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,394
but if there's any connection,
you know...

268
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,178
Yes, then **** you.

269
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,963
You knew what was going
on here, I need to know that.

270
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,747
Because guess what?
That's a very different story.

271
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,227
Yeah.

272
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,360
I need to be thinking
about myself, my family.

273
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,362
I would like to have
the conversation with Erika.

274
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:23,147
I'm happy to do that.

275
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,279
And especially for the reasons
that you just presented.

276
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,281
- I need to flat-out ask her...
- Then do.

277
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,109
"Did you know that the money

278
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,155
that was going to you
was meant for these victims?"

279
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,070
The only way
to make that clear

280
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,942
is by asking
those hard questions.

281
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,075
She's not going to like
the questions,

282
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,642
but that's what's
going to have to happen.

283
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,731
So the next time we all
see each other

284
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,646
is at your house
for the Christmas party?

285
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,125
Yes, I'm going to be cooking
Christmas dinner for you all.

286
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,736
- Are you?
- Yes.

287
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,739
<i>Erika's life is a disaster.</i>

288
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:52,916
The fact that she's coming over
for this holiday dinner,

289
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,179
and I know that we all
are going to be asking her

290
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:58,399
a lot of questions,
is making me feel terrible.

291
00:10:58,483 --> 00:10:59,531
She's going to have
to answer more than

292
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,315
she's comfortable with.

293
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,100
Because you know what,
we deserve to know the truth.

294
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,537
I feel like I am the Grinch
that is about to steal

295
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,321
Erika's Christmas.
We need to say to her,

296
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,367
"It's time to get real
right now.

297
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,325
You need to answer
some difficult questions."

298
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,979
- Right.
- Yeah, she does.

299
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,022
- It feels terrible.
- Yeah, it does.

300
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,679
<i>Coming up...</i>

301
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,071
Look at this guy.

302
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,986
He's like,
that macaroni and cheese...

303
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,161
- That Grandma made.
- Yeah.

304
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,685
Yeah, Granny.

305
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,338
Okay, we're not gonna
say Granny.

306
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,784
- Guys?
- Yeah.

307
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,176
Are you guys getting ready?

308
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,310
- Yeah.
- Can you come down, please?

309
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,268
Oh.

310
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,096
Oh my God,
I think I overcooked it.

311
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,098
They'll never know.
They're kids.

312
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:49,407
<i>Oh my God,
it's a little overcooked.</i>

313
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,887
I kind of made
a deep-fried turkey

314
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,366
without making
a deep-fried turkey.

315
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,499
It's all good.
I made some griot,

316
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,068
which is our Haitian pork,
ham, mac and cheese.

317
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,984
When it comes to the Haitian
food, I do the rice and beans,

318
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,248
<i>plantations, griot,
which is sort of fried pork.</i>

319
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,077
And the thing with Haitian
cooking, there's no measuring.

320
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,948
- I'm hungry.
- I'm glad, baby.

321
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:12,386
You just do it, taste it,
figure it out and it's done.

322
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,084
- Doesn't this look delicious?
- There you go.

323
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,564
I'm so happy you guys
drove down... thank you.

324
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,218
- Of course.
- Thank you for having us.

325
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,481
- We wanted to come.
- Merry Christmas guys.

326
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:21,942
- Baby.
- Yes.

327
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:24,481
This is the griot
that I was telling you about.

328
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,896
- It's... fire.
- Okay, I'm down.

329
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,552
<i>Before I got together
with Mike,</i>

330
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:30,317
<i>I had my first son Oliver.</i>

331
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:33,732
<i>Things didn't work out with me
and his dad, but with Oliver,</i>

332
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:36,584
the struggle has been,
you know, drug addiction.

333
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:40,937
My son, Oliver has
dealt with addiction.

334
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,374
- Oh.
- We've been through so much.

335
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,158
That was a really hard time
in our life,

336
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:48,031
a really, really difficult time
and I still feel guilty.

337
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,380
Looking back, I'm like,
"Did I give you

338
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,469
too much freedom?
Did I miss the signs?"

339
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:52,992
You guys were the best.

340
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,472
You guys did absolutely
everything.

341
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,474
I was just hanging out
with the wrong people

342
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,128
and my whole judgment,
my whole way of thinking...

343
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,433
Making poor choices.

344
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,305
Making the poorest
of choices.

345
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,048
This has been a looooong

346
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,224
- journey for you.
- Oh, yeah.

347
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,182
To see Oli now...

348
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,358
He's being... he's
being dramatic.

349
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,577
I wonder
where he gets that from.

350
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:13,883
Yeah, right. Right.

351
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,188
The father that he's become,

352
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,407
the man that he's become...

353
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,843
<i>It's amazing.</i>

354
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,238
You need this, mama.
You need this.

355
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:26,112
Sam is so sweet.
She loves Oliver to death.

356
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:27,679
Sam has three kids...

357
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:30,551
<i>Maya, Theo, and Sonaya,</i>

358
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,423
<i>and Oliver Jr.</i>

359
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:34,251
- He needs food.
- Oh...

360
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,211
He doesn't like
the service at all.

361
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:41,475
Okay. Hey, hey. Okay, buddy.

362
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,174
<i>Oliver loves them,
and they love him.</i>

363
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,697
And they've become a family.

364
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,481
You're so patient, Oliver.

365
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,745
I can't believe you're a dad.

366
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,703
I am. I had a diaper
in my pocket.

367
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,705
- It's official.
- I'm so proud of you.

368
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,446
Thank you.

369
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,370
It turned quick, honey.

370
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:02,975
<i>I mean, having four kids
under eight in quarantine...</i>

371
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,348
You couldn't pay me.

372
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,196
Has anybody seen my wine?

373
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,111
And he's like,
"Mom, I wish you lived closer."

374
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,678
And I'm like, "I'm okay."

375
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,202
Maya, what do you want
for Christmas?

376
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,031
Oh, we're not doing
those things.

377
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,380
I hurt my ankle so bad.

378
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,208
Yeah, I know,
and Mom gave it to me.

379
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,341
I'm so happy you guys
are here.

380
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,039
This is so good.

381
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,518
This is delicious.
Thank you all.

382
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:25,955
- This is so good.
- You're so welcome.

383
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,217
I'm just so happy
you guys are here.

384
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,132
- Yes. Yes.
- Look at this guy.

385
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,220
Oh.

386
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,569
Oh!

387
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,223
He's like that macaroni
and cheese...

388
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,007
That Grandma made.

389
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,443
Yeah, Granny.

390
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,402
Okay, we're not
gonna say Granny.

391
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:52,111
I am obsessed with this big,
bouncy, beautiful hair.

392
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,591
- Yeah, I know.
- It's so good on you.

393
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,985
<i>It's so fabulous.</i>

394
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,595
It's beautiful.
It's nice to be glam.

395
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,163
Okay, cool, I think
you're good if you want to...

396
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,555
Okay. Perfect. I love it.

397
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,948
Hi, beautiful.

398
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:05,429
Hi. You look beautiful.

399
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:09,085
Oh, look at that.
Ooh, what's happening?

400
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,782
I've got a nice
bottle of tequila.

401
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,305
Do you want like
an additional dessert?

402
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:13,741
Well, that's very
sweet of you.

403
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,656
I have stuff here,
I just need you here.

404
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,397
- Those are pretty.
- I love that.

405
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,486
Aren't those beautiful?
That's the same lady

406
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,098
who makes the shoes
that we love, Amina Muaddi.

407
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,664
- Oh, I love those. <i>
- Guess what.</i>

408
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,275
Teddi is coming tonight.

409
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,973
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

410
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,801
You know what?
I'm excited to see her.

411
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,369
We'll plow her with alcohol
now that she's not pregnant.

412
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,066
Yeah, exactly, now that she's
not pregnant she can drink.

413
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,285
Hold on, you can't
eat the sushi

414
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,113
and you can't drink the drinks.

415
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,288
Want some water?
I have water.

416
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,767
- Water is perfect.
- Right.

417
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,118
- What about Erika? <i>
- She said she's coming.</i>

418
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:45,077
She doesn't know
that we got together, does she?

419
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,296
No.
Well, what am I going to say?

420
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,124
Sutton wanted to have a meeting,

421
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,603
and you know, we didn't know
what the meeting was about.

422
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,823
No, exactly.
We have to figure out a way

423
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,172
forward through all of this,
Kyle.

424
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,000

<i>We want to support her.

- but I have questions.
- Totally.

427
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,267
Anyway, I need to get ready,
otherwise I'm going to be late.

428
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,660
Okay, I'll see you

<i>- Okay, bye. See you soon.
- Bye.</i>

00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,586
I'd love it.

468
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,588
It was like this...
white gloves banging.

469
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,416
Like who thought
that was a good idea?

470
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,375
But other than that,
there were good times.

471
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,463
- Perfect.
- Oh, it looks so beautiful.

472
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:51,856
Thank you.

473
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,205
This is lovely.

474
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,511
Oh wow.

475
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,295
- I love the tradition of it.
- Right.

476
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,341
Well, cheers.

477
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,777
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

478
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,518
Happy holidays.
Thank you for inviting us.

479
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,259
- Happy holidays.
- This is lovely.

480
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:05,391
So is everybody coming?

481
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,611
- Everybody's coming.
- Okay.

482
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,439
Erika did not say
she was canceling, so...

483
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,223
Okay, good.

484
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,660
It's just so hard
because we care about her

485
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,575
and we think there's
no way it's possible,

486
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,795
but like you want to just
ask her flat out:

487
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,362
did you know?

488
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:20,928
I mean, when you ask
somebody,

489
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,582
"Are you cheating?"
do they go "Yes" right away?

490
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,801
- No.
- No.

491
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,713
We don't know until we know.

492
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,503
****.

493
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:32,331
<i>Coming up...</i>

494
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,290
It's not going to be
something where she can come in

495
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:35,552
and just answer
all the questions

496
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:36,944
because they're legal.

497
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,856
The lawsuits... oh,
here she is.

498
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:48,826
Thank you so much.
Appreciate your help.

499
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,523
Anybody home?

500
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,438
Hello! look who it is.

501
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,571
Hi, Teddi!

502
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:56,744
- Baby bump-free.
- Give me a drink.

503
00:18:58,311 --> 00:18:59,619
I don't know.

504
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,839
She's kind of annoying
for no reason.

505
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,533
Like a little gnat.

506
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:07,668
Oh, God.

507
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,369
Hello.

508
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,631
Oh. Well, hello.

509
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,025
- Teddi!
- I'm so glad I didn't miss

510
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,809
one of the new names.

511
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,594
This is Heather.

512
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,248
- Heather.
- Hi.

513
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,945
Heather,
you're quite tall tonight.

514
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,903
- Look at the shoes.
- Hi Heather.

515
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,514
Nice to meet you.
We've met before.

516
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:25,732
Hi, we have met.

517
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,299
- This...
- Isn't it amazing?

518
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,388
- Unreal.
- Thank you.

519
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,042
Our husbands can
have girlfriends, right?

520
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:33,479
Well, he already got
a lot of girlfriends.

521
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:35,612
That is super cute.

522
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,703
Thank you.

523
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,975
Oh.

524
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,674
Does this work?

525
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,415
I'm really glad I got them
because yeah,

526
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:59,070
they were kind of pricey,
but then they were half off.

527
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,941
<i>- What's the buckle?
- It's Versace.</i>

528
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:03,509
Oh my God.
Can someone open the door?

529
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,511
Oh my God,
Dorit's going to kill...

530
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,947
- Dorit's going to kill you.
- She's going to rip these

531
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:08,297
off my feet.

532
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,501
Can someone open the door?

533
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,083
- Is that not opening?
- It opened for me.

534
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,737
- Open!
- Do I have to open the door?

535
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,565
- Push hard.
- It's just a door, Dorit.

536
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,783
It doesn't open.

537
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,568
Hello, mamacita.

538
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,265
Hi, you sexy thing.

539
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:21,701
- Hello.
- Hi.

540
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,616
- Hello, Teddi.
- Hi.

541
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,009
How nice to see you.

542
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,402
Good to see you too.

543
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,534
Ho, ho, ho!

544
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,754
- Hello!
- Hello. How are you?

545
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,451
- Hello.
- Hello are you?

546
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:33,974
- Discombobulated.
- Same, so...

547
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,585
No, you have no idea.

548
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,022
I'm trying to put 10 pounds
in a 5-pound bag.

549
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:40,590
Hi sweetie. Beautiful.

550
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,982
Hi sweetheart.

551
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,941
How are you?

552
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,073
Trying to get things
together.

553
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,075
I'm literally ready
to have a gorilla.

554
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,339
- Have a gorilla, Kathy.
- Have a gorilla.

555
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:51,772
What's that expression?

556
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,779
<i>You know,
I'm being dramatic.</i>

557
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,607
Like I'm going to have a horse.
I'm going to have a gorilla.

558
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,739
I'm going to have a barrel
of chickens, whatever.

559
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,524
It's just like...

560
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:04,135
That's my chicken.
That's my chicken.

561
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,355
You know,
gimme the chicken.

562
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,491
- Let me show her the table.
- Oh my God, gorgeous.

563
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,668
The situations you dealt with
with the kids killed me.

564
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,148
- Me too.
- Dove, the neurosurgery

565
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,150
was crazy,
but like she's so resilient.

566
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:22,849
Aah! Hello, little baby!

567
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,678
Last time, Dove wouldn't
let you hold her... I don't know.

568
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:28,377
- And the hair.
- I'm like, coming through.

569
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:31,467
I know, and they said
she has to have another helmet.

570
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,033
10 more weeks.

571
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,035
- That was the start of it.
- Wow.

572
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,643
And it just kept going up.

573
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,689
Thank you.

574
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,521
- Hi.
- How are you?

575
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,523
How are you, beautiful?

576
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,090
Look at you.
Oh, thank you.

577
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:47,918
Muah, muah, muah.

578
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,572
Is my girl here?

579
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,835
Hi. How's it going?

580
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,489
Oh, my girl.

581
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,099
I've known Crystal
for ten years.

582
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:56,840
Never seen each other
with makeup.

583
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:59,103
I got to take this all in,
because for you...

584
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,887
- That's a lot, right?
- Oh my God.

585
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,541
By the way,
thank you for saying that,

586
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,543
'cause I feel like
slightly uncomfortable.

587
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,241
- Who knew you had boobs?
- I have...

588
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,417
- You don't show your boobs?
- I don't show anything.

589
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,896
What did Rob say?
Who are you?

590
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,202
Bob, picked this out.

591
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,986
- Yay, Rob!
- Yes, Rob.

592
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,553
There is a lot of boob,
baby.

593
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,033
Rob loved it.

594
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,817
And then when I was
walking out, he was like,

595
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:18,949
"I can't believe you're wearing
that with your friends,"

596
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,864
like, "and I'm not going."

597
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,648
I said, "Look, I'll be home
soon with my sweat pants on."

598
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,778
He said, "Great."

599
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,611
Thanks so much.

600
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,613
- Hello.
- Hello.

601
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:31,918
Look at you.

602
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,181
- Look at you.
- Holiday queen!

603
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:36,532
- How's it going?
- Teddi's here.

604
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:39,099
- I know, I'm so excited.
- Oh, you look pretty.

605
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,188
- Look how pretty you look.
- Oh, thank you.

606
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:44,757
Five, six, seven, eight.
Oh, we're only missing Erika.

607
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,846
Yes.

608
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,848
I'm just thinking there's
a chance she could be like,

609
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,589
"I'm not gonna come"
last-minute.

610
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:51,938
I thought so too.

611
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,734
You guys, we always have
to remember:

612
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:07,606
- innocent until proven guilty.
- Exactly.

613
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,216
It's going to take
a long time.

614
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,175
<i>- Exactly.
- It's not gonna be something</i>

615
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,916
<i>where she can come in</i>

616
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,917
and just answer
all the questions

617
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,571
because they're legal.

618
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,877
Once all the lawsuits
started kind of coming...

619
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,662
Oh, there she is.

620
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,836
- Hi!
- Oh, hey guys.

621
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,147
Erika, how did you get in?
I could not open that door.

622
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:29,759
Well, you're not as smart
as Erika... what can I say?

623
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,544
- Hi, hotty.
- Mmm.

624
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,720
- Happy holidays.
- Come on in.

625
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,243
Hi.

626
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:39,246
- Oh, you look good!
- Thank you.

627
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,032
Thank God, I just put it
together but I really liked it.

628
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:44,295
- Good.
- Oh my God, is that... hey, hi!

629
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,210
- Hi.
- Oh, wow!

630
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,820
It's so good to see you.

631
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:49,300
Good to see you too.
You look beautiful.

632
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,606
- How are you?
- I'm good.

633
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,955
Can I get you champagne?

634
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,652
No, I drove.
So can I have a Coke?

635
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:55,262
- A Coke?
- A Coke.

636
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:56,960
- Coke.
- A Coke.

637
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,222
Coke.

638
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,138
I... I say Coca-Cola.

639
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:02,835
- You do?
- Yeah.

640
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,620
Hi guys. Hi guys.

641
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:06,143
- Hello!
- Hi.

642
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:08,798
All right. Oh, it's great
to see everybody.

643
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,235
- It is.
- It's been so long.

644
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,932
- Thank you for being here.
- Of course.

645
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:14,586
Thank you for having me.
Are you kidding me?

646
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,110
I'm a little radioactive
these days.

647
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,198
Yeah.

648
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:19,809
<i>Coming up...</i>

649
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:23,029
We all met the other day.

650
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,072
Sutton had asked for us
to get together.

651
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,041
I want you guys to sit down
while I go get the food ready.

652
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,913
- Okay.
- Let's go sit down.

653
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:39,089
- Can we help at all or no?
- No. I've got it. Thank you.

654
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:40,351
- No, we're not helping.
- You know what?

655
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:41,874
You should relax.

656
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,702
- You look adorable.
- So do you.

657
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:46,009
You look handsome
in your green.

658
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,837
Well, you know, I'm trying.

659
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,230
- You got it good, I like it.
- We need another chair.

660
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,971
- Honey, sit right here.
- I'm bad.

661
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,233
Sit right there
in the middle.

662
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:56,715
I feel like so...
far away formal.

663
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,022
- Formal and distant.
- Hi.

664
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,848
We're socially distancing.

665
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,243
Hey. Hey, hey.

666
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,684
She winked at me.

667
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:14,991
Have you said hello?

668
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:18,911
Do you want to maybe be like,
"hey"?

669
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:21,218
No, because then that's going
to be awkward.

670
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm not listening to you.

671
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,703
I haven't seen Erika
since she flipped out at me.

672
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:31,750
Erika shared, if you don't mind
me saying, that Tom calls her.

673
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,143
Well, I do mind
you saying that.

674
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:35,882
So let me tell
the ****ing story.

675
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,192
No, I'm not.
It's awkward,

676
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:40,364
but I'm not afraid.

677
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,154
Okay, guys,
go to the dining room.

678
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,851
Grab your plate.
I did place cards.

679
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,767
- Sutton, you'll be very happy.
- Thank you.

680
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,769
You guys I did a full
Christmas dinner for you.

681
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,728
- What?
- Kyle, this looks so good.

682
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:53,903
Are you on a diet?

683
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,121
I'm on a diet.
I'm starving.

684
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:56,949
Lot of control. Look.

685
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,213
Are you hungry, Kat?

686
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:01,650
I'm starving.

687
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,129
This looks yummy, yummy,
yummy.

688
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:05,871
- Thank you.
- Yummy. That is like tender.

689
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,960
Thank you.
I cooked for everybody.

690
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:11,137
- You cooked?
- Yeah. There's no chef here.

691
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,965
I put my heart and soul
into this dinner.

692
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:14,706
I'll see you
in the dining room.

693
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,012
Okay!

694
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,318
Oh! Ha ha ha. sh***!

695
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:21,234
Look at it, it's Christmas
on a plate... it's gorgeous.

696
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,802
Well, I appreciate
you being here.

697
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,935
I appreciate you having me.

698
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,720
Thank you for,
you know, supporting.

699
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:32,202
Well, I told you I'm not
just here for the good times.

700
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,897
No, you're not.
You're a very solid friend.

701
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:40,993
Erika seems so low,
like beaten down.

702
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,822
<i>Just to see her like that
really makes me feel bad</i>

703
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,433
<i>because I want
to be able to support her.</i>

704
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,218
But I want to be able
to support her

705
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:50,002
with a clear conscience
as well.

706
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:51,351
We're going to have
a good time right now.

707
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:52,962
Let's make some good times.

708
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,833
I wish there were
some good times.

709
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,356
I mean, this food
is a good time.

710
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,921
This is a fun time.

711
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,538
Kyle, it's so good.

712
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,931
- It's really yummy.
- So tender.

713
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,455
Thank you. I'll tell you guys
my secrets later if you want.

714
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,979
- Butter.
- No.

715
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,894
- Yeah, right?
- How is it so moist?

716
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,504
Do you inject it
with a needle?

717
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,375
This is Beverly Hills.

718
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:20,163
No, I actually don't
inject it with a needle.

719
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:22,165
- This is amazing.
- That's all?

720
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:23,862
But you don't take
mashed potatoes...

721
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:25,429
I mean, I didn't have
any room on my plate.

722
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:28,171
You didn't take stuffing
or mashed potatoes.

723
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,213
This is not the time to diet.

724
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,135
- Delish, delish, delish.
- Thank you so much.

725
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,920
Thank you.

726
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,444
I want to say happy holidays

727
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:42,881
and an extra-special thank you,

728
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,230
Erika, for even showing up.

729
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,015
Thank you for having me.

730
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,320
I hope that 2021...

731
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:50,367
- Is better than 2020.
- It's gotta be.

732
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,368
Cheers to that.

733
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:53,152
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

734
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:56,025
Health and happiness,
and the best to everybody.

735
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,461
- Health and happiness.
- Thank you.

736
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,071
So my doctor told me
the other day, she goes,

737
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:00,595
"Well, you are healthy."

738
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,900
And I was like,
well, there's that.

739
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,773
Thanks.

740
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,339
Do you feel like it's a dream
sometimes, you wake up

741
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:07,602
and you're like,
"Oh God, it wasn't a dream?"

742
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,212
Yeah, I wake up and I go,

743
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,996
"This is really happening."

744
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,955
All of this is really happening
in real-time.

745
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,307
And yeah, it's... I mean,
I'm so tired and so overwhelmed

746
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:19,875
and everything
happens day to day.

747
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:23,008
You must be blindsided
by everything that comes out.

748
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,445
Yeah.

749
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:28,361
There's... and there's
more coming.

750
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:36,500
So, you know,
I'm far from done and I just...

751
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:38,545
I feel it. I feel like
we're at the beginning of it.

752
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:40,852
- Yeah.
- But do you really not have...

753
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,376
Are you truly blindsided
or do you actually,

754
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,207
do you have some sort of... I
mean, it seems like you could...

755
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,296
Yes, go ahead
and ask this question.

756
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,124
No, it seems like you
could get information

757
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,866
before it hits the press.

758
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,956
I don't have access to
lawsuits before they hit press.

759
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:03,353
I think it was
when the "LA Times" article

760
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:04,963
came out after you left.

761
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,271
It seems like,
"She must know this."

762
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:14,103
We all read it, and the
timeline was confusing for me.

763
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,453
My biggest question was

764
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:20,979
I was so sad about Tom and what
happened three years ago.

765
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:25,549
Yes. These last few years
I noticed him declining.

766
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:27,594
I think he held on
even tighter.

767
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:30,510
My dad had Alzheimer's,
and he was like

768
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,861
so angry at himself because
he couldn't remember things.

769
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:35,167
- It's heartbreaking.
- And that's horrible.

770
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,996
And things started happening
before three years.

771
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,998
So that, for me,
was my question.

772
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:43,001
- I don't know.
- All right.

773
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:47,136
I know what I've seen
in the last 3 1/2,

774
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,703
almost 4 years.
And that's the other day.

775
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,096
Well, the burn victim thing
was ten years ago.

776
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,490
Yes. But that is just
recently being litigated now.

777
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:55,448
Right, January of 2020.

778
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,929
See, I did read the article,
and that's why I know things.

779
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,540
And I'm not answering
anyone's questions.

780
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:04,283
No one is looking
to pry into... I understand.

781
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,894
It's not what you said
the other night.

782
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,330
And I think anyone...

783
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:09,938
That's not what you said
the other night.

784
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:15,991
Tom misappropriated
at least $2 million of funds

785
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:19,559
of orphans' and widows' money.

786
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:21,083
That is sickening to me.

787
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,649
- It hurts!
- It is beyond $2 million.

788
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:26,218
That's not what you said
the other night.

789
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:28,090
Let me finish.

790
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:31,615
<i>I don't remember Dorit
being that supportive</i>

791
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:34,618
when we all had
our sister circle moment.

792
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:40,142
First of all, let me explain
that we all met the other day.

793
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,493
Sutton had asked for us
to get together.

794
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,067
<i>Coming up...</i>

795
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:51,330
Orphans and widows.

796
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:53,942
It makes you feel sick.

797
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,419
The obvious question is,
did you know any of this?

798
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:05,780
We all met the other day.

799
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,083
Sutton had asked for us
to get together.

800
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,656
The reason I wanted to talk
to everybody

801
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,397
was to see
where we all were on this.

802
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,790
So it's like a committee.

803
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,617
Do we support Erika
or do we not?

804
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:18,793
- No. No.
- No.

805
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,316
Let's be democratic and say,

806
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,970
"Well, you know,
I'm a little nervous."

807
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,798
- No. <i>
- You guys decided on</i>

808
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,538
<i>what questions to ask me</i>

809
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:28,628
and where the holes in,
you know, the stories are?

810
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,282
<i>And what you read
in the "LA Times"</i>

811
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:31,283
<i>and what you've heard
around town.</i>

812
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,632
Is this a grand jury?

813
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,286
Like what the ****
is this sh***?

814
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,810
I don't think you had
anything to do with

815
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,594
what his law firm
was doing, what he was doing.

816
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:38,769
I have no access
to any of that.

817
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,379
I don't think that you do.

818
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:43,513
I just want to make sure
that we are...

819
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,602
Addressing allegations
in an "LA Times" article?

820
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:47,778
No.
I just want to make sure

821
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:50,389
that we have
as much knowledge...

822
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,174
I don't think it's we.

823
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:55,133
You took a very different
stand, Sutton.

824
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:57,527
- I did, but I...
- Let's get real clear.

825
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:59,659
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Let's get clear now.

826
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:02,532
Sutton is here, but she left
her spine at home.

827
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,752
You need to say what happened
on Saturday night.

828
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,493
Yeah, I'm saying it
right now.

829
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,104
Like if she walked through
the door, you said,

830
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,279
- "I will tell her exactly."
- I'm doing it.

831
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,628
If Erica were to walk into

832
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,238
- this store right now...
- I'd say exactly

833
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,370
the same thing.

834
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:16,459
- Be real.
- Okay, Lisa.

835
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,113
- I'm doing that right now.
- Okay.

836
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,636
But she's going
through a lot.

837
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,160
- Yes, she is.
- I just went through...

838
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:23,248
I talked to an attorney,
I'm like,

839
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,554
"What is going on with this?"

840
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,730
You talked to an attorney
about me?

841
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:29,559
- Of course I did.
- I don't think

842
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:31,822
she's the only one,
actually, that did that.

843
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:34,390
So who here got
a legal opinion?

844
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:38,829
- You.
- Yes.

845
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,610
- Who else?
- Well, I spoke to my husband.

846
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:43,573
Please hear me out.

847
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,314
And what did he say?

848
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:49,796
He said by no means
are we legally in trouble.

849
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,625
Clearly, you understand
that we are dragged into this

850
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:55,106
- whether we like it or not.
- We're nervous.

851
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,716
I think... I think
some people are nervous.

852
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,328
I asked Faye's husband,
who's a lawyer, to break down

853
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,460
the "LA Times" article,
and he said to me,

854
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:06,465
it is very likely
that Erika had no idea

855
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,685
about what was going on
in her husband's business.

856
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,553
It's... it's true.

857
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,388
I just want to make sure that
I'm also protecting myself.

858
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:17,868
- Protecting yourself how?
- I don't know.

859
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,435
Darling, how were you
involved in any of this?

860
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,654
I wasn't.

861
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,830
You've got to be a little
more clear about what you said.

862
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:26,659
Tell me what you want me
to be more clear about, Kyle.

863
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:29,271
Well, you're worried
about your reputation.

864
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:31,838
- Of course.
- Wait a minute.

865
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:34,232
That's just between me.
That's me, my problem.

866
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:35,755
Not with you.

867
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,410
You guys, are you really
that afraid of me?

868
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,456
- No. I...
- I'm not sure you believe

869
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,848
that Erika was not involved.

870
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:44,808
The $20 million elephant
in the room.

871
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:47,202
<i>Why is the paper saying</i>

872
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:50,289
<i>that $20 million
went into your LLC?</i>

873
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,776
The obvious question is,
did you know any of this?

874
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,343
What do you think?

875
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,171
As your friend,
I don't think you did.

876
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:02,173
- No, I did not.
- And that's what I said.

877
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:03,870
- Everybody was like, wait...
- Right.

878
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,698
Do you where that money's
coming from?

879
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,744
Was that a loan?
Was that over time?

880
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,441
- Right, so...
- That was

881
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:10,921
- the biggest question.
- That's another question

882
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:13,141
as well
that we will uncover.

883
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:14,620
Okay.

884
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:17,972
Erika's answer seems
a little surface-y to me.

885
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,496
<i>I don't feel like
she's angry at Tom.</i>

886
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,325
<i>Yes, you love him
but at the same time,</i>

887
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:26,937
he's being implicated in things
that are really, really bad.

888
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,853
<i>So I understand being hurt,
feeling betrayed,</i>

889
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,595
<i>but I haven't seen
the anger towards Tom.</i>

890
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,641
I need Perry Mason.
I need... I don't know.

891
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,861
I need somebody
to try to explain that to me.

892
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:41,691
I have several LLCs.
If that money did go in there,

893
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:45,521
and seems like you would notice
maybe, or question that.

894
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:47,175
- And also my question, I...
- I was kept away

895
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:50,265
- from the books.
- You were. Even your own LLC?

896
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,525
- Like that would make me insane.
- Yes. It did.

897
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:57,924
You read these headlines,
and it's hard to digest.

898
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:02,755
It's hard to think about, like
I said, orphans and widows.

899
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,540
It makes you feel sick.

900
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:07,412
It's like one of the lawyers
that said, so he said,

901
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:10,372
"Where's the money?"
I said, "Go talk to Tom."

902
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:13,679
I found out we have $50 to
$80 million cash that's gone.

903
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:16,291
We did? That was in
the "LA Times" article

904
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,727
that you so thoroughly read.

905
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,337
Well, I'm sorry
that I read that.

906
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:20,773
No, you don't need
to be sorry,

907
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:24,255
but my point is this...
I didn't know that.

908
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:27,780
No one knows
the answer but him.

909
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:36,311
- Where does $80 million go?
- Explain that to me?

910
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,877
- Well, yeah.
- Explain that to me.

911
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:39,531
I don't know.

912
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:40,967
And that's a question
that only he can answer.

913
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:42,708
- Right.
- You know.

914
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,406
I would say
most of the people,

915
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,016
if not all the people here

916
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,367
believe very much not only
in your innocence but...

917
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:51,848
I haven't been accused
of anything.

918
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,545
That you will
come out of this.

919
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:56,505
Right. I think it's just
a matter of, you know,

920
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:59,290
what you knew
and being complicit.

921
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:02,076
I mean, it's not accused,
but you get attached.

922
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,645
Yeah. Those words are not,
not cool, you know.

923
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,560
It's not.
It's not cool to read.

924
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,954
- It's not cool to hear.
- And it's not nice to

925
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,391
repeat it, because you know
it's not true.

926
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,350
So, you know...

927
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:16,699
Well, I certainly
don't think so. And I'm...

928
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,266
Okay.

929
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,660
<i>I'm a little disappointed
in Dorit</i>

930
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:24,837
because we were
both simpatico on this.

931
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:27,405
I don't want our support
of Erika

932
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:29,973
to be misinterpreted as support

933
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:33,107
for some of the atrocious
things that have been done.

934
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,021
You're so right.

935
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,763
- That is how I feel.
- Big high five.

936
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:42,594
But she really softened.
Maybe she has a weak backbone.

937
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,596
Everybody making it
about them

938
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,424
when it's not about them
is the problem.

939
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,557
- I know, I agree with you.
- Like here's the thing.

940
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:50,602
A big portion of people
at this table

941
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:52,822
have had lawsuits, but it has
nothing to do with anybody else

942
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,737
unless it's directly
affecting them.

943
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,435
If you think that Erika is
lying to you, that's the issue.

944
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,437
But we don't know.
None of us know.

945
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,135
- Thank you.
- Until somebody tells me

946
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,049
something else,
I have to believe

947
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,791
that he's the asshole
and you didn't know.

948
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,838
Okay, I'm going to ask
another tough one.

949
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:11,449
Have you had
any kind of discussions

950
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:15,061
with attorneys about the story?

951
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,931
- How to navigate through this?
- How to navigate through it?

952
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,807
No.

953
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:24,332
I think this is where we...
You know what guys, I'm sorry.

954
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,116
- But these questions are like...
- I'm sorry, I'm just being

955
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,770
"honest"
like Lisa wants me to be.

956
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:29,554
Well, no, I don't want you
to be, I just...

957
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:31,600
"What discussions did you
have with your attorney?"

958
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:32,949
I'm starting
to get uncomfortable.

959
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,603
It's just not
questions you ask.

960
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:36,561
- Well, you can't ask that.
- Yes, I agree.

961
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,389
- It's nosy.
- It's just a little bit...

962
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:40,130
No, it's not nosy.
No, it's just uncomfortable.

963
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,785
<i>Dorit had a lot to say
when Erika wasn't around.</i>

964
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:46,092
<i>But now that Erika is around,
you know, it's a 180.</i>

965
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,356
<i>It's like,
"No, I support you."</i>

966
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:55,885
I'm going to be 100% honest,
as I normally am.

967
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:58,061
I don't know if you knew
or not.

968
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,934
My sister had a kidney
transplant, and it went wrong.

969
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,634
And she's had a lawyer, she was
supposed to be awarded money,

970
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,636
And my sister's very innocent.

971
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,507
She's like, "No, it's just
taking a long time."

972
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:13,685
So if what Tom did
is absolutely true,

973
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,644
then **** Tom.

974
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:26,263
So if what Tom did
is absolutely true,

975
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,918
then **** Tom.

976
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:32,095
Because I know personally
what it feels like for someone

977
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,749
who is waiting
for their compensation

978
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,533
for something
they went through.

979
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:38,232
What's being alleged
in that lawsuit is terrible,

980
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,886
and he will have to pay
a price for that.

981
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,975
If in fact,
that's what happened.

982
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,674
I think what has happened
to Tom here

983
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:48,067
is that he's not
mentally capable

984
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:50,940
and he was
in sole control of his firm.

985
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,725
And I think that
it got away from him.

986
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,815
I think that we're dealing
with a man

987
00:38:56,899 --> 00:39:01,559
who is... diminished capacity,

988
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:06,521
in control,
and not doing the right thing.

989
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:11,914
'Cause if he stole the money,
I'd like to know where it is.

990
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,616
You know, that's the truth.

991
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,930
If I didn't love and care
about you,

992
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:26,802
there's not really a situation.

993
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,673
The ones that love and care
about you, I mean,

994
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:30,022
are friends
in the middle of a hurricane.

995
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:31,502
We all love
and care about her.

996
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,548
- I know that.
- Is that a competition?

997
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,811
I do not want
my support of you...

998
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,682
- Everybody loves you.
- Is it?

999
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,510
So is it a competition
of who likes her most,

1000
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:40,946
who knows her more?

1001
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,209
And longer.
That's what I'm saying.

1002
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,950
We're all hoping
that she comes out okay.

1003
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,604
Some support you more
than others,

1004
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,650
apparently because
they've known you longer.

1005
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,914
But the victims
are the most important thing,

1006
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,611
you'll always be okay.

1007
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:57,659
Yeah. The victims...
need to be taken care of.

1008
00:39:57,743 --> 00:40:00,270
Absolutely, and that's
where I'm coming from.

1009
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:02,228
Right, of course, and that's
where everybody's coming from.

1010
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,708
That's where everyone
was coming from.

1011
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,710
- I haven't heard it.
- From whom?

1012
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:07,190
- We've all said it.
- Really?

1013
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:08,713
- We've all said that.
- Because I said it

1014
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:09,845
a hundred times on
Saturday, remember?

1015
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,021
I said it a lot on Saturday.

1016
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:15,241
First, it's the victims.
Their families.

1017
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:16,852
Absolutely.

1018
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:19,115
Yeah, 100%.
I'm not worried about me.

1019
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,944
I don't... I'm last
in all of this,

1020
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:26,340
and those people
are owed their money.

1021
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,778
But, um, we need to see
what this man did.

1022
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:32,955
Do you think we'll ever know?

1023
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,001
They'll get to it.

1024
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:38,221
I do not expect anyone
to hold my hand.

1025
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:41,355
I appreciate the support.
I have a long road ahead of me.

1026
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,748
Those who want to be my friend,
thank you,

1027
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:46,882
and those who it's too
much for, then, you know,

1028
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,623
you feel more comfortable
away from me,

1029
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:52,624
I certainly understand
and respect that too, so...

1030
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,764
I don't know
if I've been strong.

1031
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:02,071
I've just been trying to put
one foot in front of the other.

1032
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,986
<i>I'm not going to do myself
any favors</i>

1033
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,337
<i>if I wind myself up
into a hysterical place.</i>

1034
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:12,647
I just need to be calm
and work through all of this.

1035
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,911
I hope God gives you
the strength and the courage

1036
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,869
to go through it.

1037
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:21,133
And please God, we'll be there
sooner rather than later.

1038
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:23,962
I feel bad that there
was like questions

1039
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:26,965
- and stuff, you know? But...
- It's good practice.

1040
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:30,839
- One way of looking at it.
- She got it.

1041
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:32,797
Guys, I have dessert
in the other room.

1042
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,059
- Oh, great.
- Can we go to the other room?

1043
00:41:34,143 --> 00:41:35,104
- Yeah.
- You guys, please don't

1044
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:36,714
forget your gifts.

1045
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:37,846
Thank you. This is beautiful.

1046
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,630
<i>This dinner is so awkward,</i>

1047
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:40,762
I'm looking
for an eject button.

1048
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:41,850
Dessert, anyone?

1049
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,286
Oh, wow. Look how pretty.

1050
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,635
Beautiful.

1051
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,811
We share. We hash things out.

1052
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:47,899
- Yeah.
- Right?

1053
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,161
Yeah.

1054
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:50,815
Well, I can see
how tired you are.

1055
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,338
- I'm very tired.
- You're tired.

1056
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,775
- I'm very tired.
- Still looks beautiful, but...

1057
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:55,733
I just, you know,
this is my life.

1058
00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:56,992
This is where I'm at.

1059
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:00,172
Did you throw me under
the bus a little bit tonight

1060
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:01,913
do you feel like?

1061
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:03,828
I don't feel like
I threw you under the bus.

1062
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:06,657
You had some
same feelings as me.

1063
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:08,224
100%.

1064
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:11,140
And it felt to me tonight
like everybody was like,

1065
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,969
"No, we didn't have any
of those thoughts, just you."

1066
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:16,667
<i>I feel a little set up now.</i>

1067
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,974
<i>It's almost like
they all got together</i>

1068
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,193
and they decided to rally
on Erika's side.

1069
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:24,240
Okay. Well, I'm going to go.
Be on my merry little way.

1070
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:25,807
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1071
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:28,810
<i>Everybody
seemed to abandon ship.</i>

1072
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:32,944
These girls, man.
Tch. They got me.

1073
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,726
Merry Christmas, honey.

1074
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,080
I'm going to go.
Good night. Merry Christmas.

1075
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,343
Hang on, Erika, I've got
a little Prezi purse for you.

1076
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:41,953
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1077
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,996
Call me, please.
Good night, you guys.

1078
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,133
You really know
what people are made of

1079
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:51,093
when there are
tough situations around.

1080
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:52,790
It's just a little
Christmas present.

1081
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:54,488
- Thank you very much.
- From one Georgia girl

1082
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,185
- to another.
- Oh.

1083
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,796
<i>You can smell the cowards
a mile away.</i>

1084
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,712
<i>I don't know if the rats
are leaving the ship</i>

1085
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:04,190
or if I'm leaving the rats.

1086
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,069
<i>Next time on...</i>

1087
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:13,202
- Vodka and champagne?
- Yes.

1088
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:14,508
This goes against everything
I've been taught my whole life.

1089
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,074
She's a mess.

1090
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:17,772
I ended up with
Nana's wedding dress.

1091
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:19,687
- I want it.
- I'm probably going to be

1092
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:21,515
- the one to get married first.
- I'm just going to go like...

1093
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,081
Someone's, yeah, calling me.

1094
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:25,257
Anyone who saw
"American Woman,"

1095
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:26,824
it was literally
a love letter to Mom.

1096
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:27,999
No, I just wouldn't do that

1097
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,088
without talking to you.

1098
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,525
We're going to have
a little luncheon

1099
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,352
to have my launch party.

1100
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:36,225
- Oh my God, congratulations.
- This is so beautiful.

1101
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:38,183
I will say the girls
are a little nervous.

1102
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:40,229
Sutton, honestly, doesn't want
any problems in the society.

1103
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:41,970
Ms. Small town,
I'm so worried

1104
00:43:42,054 --> 00:43:44,015
about my mother ****ing
reputation... you shut up.

1105
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,104
- Don't take that out on me.
- Your bullsh***?

1106
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:47,889
No, your problems.

1107
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:50,413
Garcelle has made
little jabs at me.

1108
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:53,372
Just be open.
Have some guts.

1109
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:55,897
I start to think, "Gee, she
had a problem with Kyle."

1110
00:43:55,981 --> 00:43:57,725
And then what you did
in Palm Springs,

1111
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,030
it's like a bully,
which in my opinion...

1112
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:01,119
**** you with that.

1113
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:04,359
**** you, **** you,
**** you.

1113
00:44:05,305 --> 00:45:05,768
