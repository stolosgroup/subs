00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,442
It's okay! Please, open the door.

166
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,236
No, Papa. Open it!

167
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,405
Why did I end up like this?

168
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,700
This is all my fault.

169
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,993
No. It...

170
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,496
It's not, Papa,

171
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,872
it's not your fault.

172
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
Jiwoo.

00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,043

00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,036
Someone. Please, someone...

190
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,081
Are you the leader of the operation?

191
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,837
What did you make my dad do?

192
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,175
Beat people?

193
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,889
Did he threaten and stab them?

194
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,315
Who was it that killed my dad?

195

Your father...

196
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,741
was my most trusted friend and brother.

197
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,204
And Donghoon...

198
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,001
was a good father.

199
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,090
Remember that.

200
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,686
Here. Please, come closer.

201
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,106
Come closer.

202
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,193
This will be the last time
you're able to see him,

203
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,238
so say goodbye
and wish him peace in the afterlife.

204
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,574
Feel free to hold his hand
and send him off.

332
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,513
What'd you hit me for?

333
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,889
Asshole!

334
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,601
What are you doing, dumbass?

335
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,685
Fuck!

336
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,330
If you wanna die,
there are better ways to do it.

337
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,921
It's none of your business, mister.

338
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,057
So? Did you catch my dad's killer?

339
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,354
I guess not.

340
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,274
Stop acting out and stay low

341
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,610
or you'll die on the street.

342
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,531
How can I stay low?

343
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,870
The cops won't investigate,
and you won't do anything!

344
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,080
So how...

345
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,835
How can I live like nothing's wronged?

346
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,178
When all of this is my fault.

347
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,441
Do you have to get revenge?

348
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,403
Regardless of the price you pay?

349
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,663
I will handle all of it.

350
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,799
If you're determined
to catch and kill this man...

351
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,013
you need to be capable of killing someone.

352
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,472
SEONJIN SHIPPING

353
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,156
Sir.

354
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,283
Sir.

355
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,540
Hello, sir.

356
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Hello, sir.

357
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,422
Our new member.

358
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,051
Say hello.

359
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,274
Who the hell is she?

360
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,903
Maybe she's a snack?

361
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,364
For us to eat when we're bored?

362
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,157
Hey. She's a little girl.

363
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,910
Exactly. So we'll
raise her well, then we'll eat her.

364
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,163
He said she's a new member,
not a snack.

365
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,498
Okay, asshole.

366
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,045
Crazy bastard.

367
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,128
Hey, kid.

368
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,966
Come along.

369
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,305
Hey!

370
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,110
Tell me...

371
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,821
What do you plan to do with her?

372
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,075
She wants to get revenge.

373
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,956
Let her.

374
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,799
You can sleep here.

375
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,476
From now on, cleaning, laundry,
and the dishes

376
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,853
are your job, okay?

377
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,939
Finally, get to live upstairs.

378
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,983
I was the youngest until you.

379
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,819
Two years.

380
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,910
Once you prove yourself,
you can move up there.

381
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,164
You really become part
of the organization.

382
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,125
I'm going up there.

383
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,877
I'll make it to the top.

384
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,803
Why are you here?

385
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,971
You're a girl.

386
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,016
To get stronger.

387
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,190
Right.

388
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,193
I wish you luck.

389
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,255
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

390
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,052
Don't worry.

391
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,683
I'll be fine.

392
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,930
Come on. Let's go, let's go!

393
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,261
Hey, newbie!

394
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,138
Hey!

00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,519

397
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,855
Yeah! Yeah!

00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,608

399
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,610
<i>♪ You're so sexy! ♪</i>

400
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,030
What's that look for, you fucking bitch?

401
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,492
Come on, give me some ass.

402
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,161
Yeah!

403
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,205
Hey. You're the prettiest one here.

404
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,851
You're absolutely
the fucking prettiest!

405
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,395
A man is declaring
his love for you...

406
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,420
You...

407
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,382
Fuck your clothes.

408
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,462
Well, that's annoying.

409
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,089
Are you okay?

410
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,215
Damn!

411
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,426
Oh, how cute.

412
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,594
A cup?

413
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,805
Oh, look at the fire in your eyes.

414
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,308
You wanna fight, huh? Let's go.

415
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,684
Fucker!

416
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,479
You fucking bitch.

417
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,856
Oh, shit!

418
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,233
Give me some ass.

419
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,819
Fucking bitch.

420
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,863
- Hey. Stop it.
- Hey!

421
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,824
If you're not gonna give us ass,
why are you here, you bitch?

422
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,577
Hey, hey, that bitch hit me first.
Let go of me!

423
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,828
Get off!

424
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,585
You gonna run away?

425
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,296
No, I'm going to win.

426
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,343
Exactly.

427
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,847
You can't win like that.

428
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,645
It's not "winning"...

429
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,898
but "killing".

430
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,152
"I'll kill him."

431
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,990
That's how you need to fight.

432
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,201
Don't compete with strength.

433
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,704
Regardless of training, you'll lose.

434
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,038
And what do I do?

435
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,130
Attack the vitals.

436
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:06,513
The temple, upper lip, chin, solar plexus,

437
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,308
and genitals.

438
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,606
If you hit only the vitals...

439
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,431
then you can take down your opponent.

440
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:24,822
Okay.

441
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,074
Let's try it.

442
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,495
Huh?

443
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,204
Come here.

444
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,493
Upper lip.

445
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,791
Harder!

446
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:16,917
Chin.

447
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,670
Then guard.

448
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,647
Are you okay?

449
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,983
That was a good hit.

450
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,611
You've got talent, but not enough power.

451
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,196
Again.

452
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:16,870
DO NOT ENTER
