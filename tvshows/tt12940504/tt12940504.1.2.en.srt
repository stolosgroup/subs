5
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,970
You're awake, dumbass?

6
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,013
Hey, are you finally awake?

7
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,890
Get out here and die.

8
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,939
You got your ass beat by a girl
and you blacked out.

9
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,959
I wanna kill myself out of humiliation.

10
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,393
About earlier...

11
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,357
I wanna apologize.

12
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,653
Apologize for what?

13
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,072
It's just a fight.

14
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,249
Hey, man, you wanna hang out now?

15
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,377
Why? So you can get drunk?

16
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,921
Black out and die.

17
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,088
Uh, no.

18
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,716
I thought we could go...

19
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,071
What?

20
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,866
Don't be such a pussy.
You're always saying you want her.

21
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,202
Asshole, do you lost its fucking mind?

22
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,247
Hey.

23
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,123
Don't do anything stupid, man.

24
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,708
You know the boss brought her.

25
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,877
And she won't remember anything though.

26
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,464
You know, I roofied her water earlier.

27
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,891
Such a stingy little shit, bro.

28
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,854
Well, if you really wanna go that far,
I guess I can't refuse.

29
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,773
Yo.

30
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,861
You don't have to come
if you're so scared.

31
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,175
I owe you, Gangjae.

32
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,431
You know, you're the prettiest
little thing around, fucking slut.

33
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,354
Ah, you make me so hard.

34
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,642
I wanna taste you.

35
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,688
Aah.

36
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,566
Ah, promise I won't be too rough.

37
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,960
Hold still.

38
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,865
You need to calm down.

39
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,284
The whole thing will be over soon.

40
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,997
Stay.

41
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,916
Oh! Dirty slut, I can't take it.

42

DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

43
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,254
Oh, Jesus!

44
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,523
Oh!

45
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,638
I'm gonna kill you guys.

46
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,721
Fuck!

47
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,558
I swear I'm gonna kill you guys.

48
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,882
It's the fucking bitch...

49
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,313
Shit!

50
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,898
You fucking psycho bitch!

51
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,447
No!

52
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,619
You need to die.

53
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,223
Get over here, bitch.

54
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,333
Gangjae! I'm all fucked up now!

55
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,251
Yeah?

56
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,086
That piece of shit!

57
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,714
Come here.

58
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,800
Where are you going, you dumb slut?

59
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,711
- Gangjae! Stop it! Hey! Gangjae!
- Fucking bitch.

60
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,494
Your face, arms, or legs.

61
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,122
Which one?

62
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,041
I'm only going to mutilate one.

63
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,265
I'm really sorry, sir.

64
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,809
Sir, I made a mistake.

65
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,769
And that's why...

66
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,690
I chose not to kill you.

67
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,983
Which one?

68
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,321
Are you gonna get rid of me?

69
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,743
You said I was useful to have around.

70
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,495
It's most unfortunate.

71
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,628
I assumed this would eventually
happen to her.

72
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,880
That it was something
she had to go through.

73
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,799
Though I didn't know...

74
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,348
it would be you who did it.

75
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,767
Please forgive me, sir.

76
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,437
All I did was push her around a little!

77
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,651
I, myself, brought her here.

78
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,738
You shouldn't have even touched her.

79
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,208
Okay, which one?

80
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,004
No, I'll decide.

81
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,174
Sir, I'm sorry. No. Please. No.

82
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,010
Please, I'm begging you.

83
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:54,510
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

84
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,039
If you're done crying,
please leave.

85
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,491
Because of you,

86
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,577
I've lost one of my best subordinates.

87
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,623
This will be your last chance.

88
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,961
Your very last chance to wise up.

89
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,424
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

90
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,012
When I served Donghoon,

91
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,806
I got to know him very well.

92
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,476
He didn't belong in this line of work.

93
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,146
I can say the same about you.

94
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,607
You should get out now.

95
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,281
It's too late for me to get out.

96
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,061
Sit down.

97
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,075
I used to come here
with Donghoon all the time.

98
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,289
Did your dad teach you to drink?

99
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,343
Drink up.

100
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,735
It hurts?

101
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,406
Uh, no.

102
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,411
You never learned how to say
that you're in pain.

103
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,873
Or maybe no one taught you.

104
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,546
Yeah, there was someone...

105
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,633
but he's dead now.

106
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,681
The whole purpose of living...

107
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,601
could be a search
for when to find a person like that.

108
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,647
A person who can tell that you're in pain

109
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,983
and that life is too hard.

110
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,612
Have you found someone like that?

111
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,074
Yes, I did, but he died.

112
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,205
OCTOPUS STIR-FRY
PORK STIR-FRY

113
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,312
As of today, Yoon Jiwoo is dead.

114
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,483
Do Gangjae has been expelled.

115
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,360
It's punishment for

116
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,571
having murdered that girl.

117
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,033
Oh Hyejin.

118
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,578
From this point on,

119
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,081
you're going to go by this name.

120
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,013
Here's the gun that killed your dad.

121
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,391
The killer left it,
and we recovered it.

122
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,646
So who was it?

123
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,190
This gun is a police issue.

124
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,069
Donghoon's killer is a policeman.

125
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,864
You're gonna find him.

126
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,492
Kill him.

137

What do we do now?

138
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,528
We're going upstairs.

139
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,738
What?

140
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,075
We don't know how many are in there.

141
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,938
Hey. Call backup and go to the front.

142
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,122
Where are you...

143
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,232
Who are you?

144
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,732
What?

145
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,361
What's going on?

146
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,572
Which department are you with,
you dumbass?

147
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,811
Whoo!

148
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,615
Money first.

149
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,494
Hey.

150
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,455
I'm not giving you that.
You know what it's worth?

151
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,915
Now, go and call your boss in here.

152
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,313
I gonna see the guy's face
if we're gonna be working together.

153
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,172
It's gonna be an equally shared risk.

154
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,133
Now...

155
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,638
the supply has been running a little low.

156
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,640
Apparently, not for you guys, huh?

157
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,933
Yeah. Forget it. Never mind.

158
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,518
Okay. Fine.

159
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,894
Sit down.

160
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,605
Okay.

161
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,483
Radio her. Tell her it's a sting.

162
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,777
Fuckin'...

163
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,863
right now.

164
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,951
This jackass came here alone
and now he wants to talk in person.

165
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,595
<i>Hyejin.</i>

166
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,180
- I think I can take him down...
<i>- I'm letting you know.</i>

167
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,082
<i>This is a sting operation. Hyejin. Hyejin!</i>

168
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,313
- Freeze where you are, this is the police!
- Are you fucking narc?

169
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,940
- What the hell is she saying?
- Hey, Changoo, get up.

170
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,424
Oh, shit!

171
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,302
- Grab the knife over there!
- Hurry, come on!

172
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,096
Oh, shit.

173
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,448
Stop right there!

174
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,432
What the hell?

175
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,270
Let's go! Don't let them...

176
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,014
Block them right there!

177
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,594
Park Changoo. You're under arrest
for the murder of Lee Sumin.

178
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,972
Goddamn it!
I can walk on my own.

179
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,557
- Hey.
- Shit.

180
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,035
- Stop right there.
- Fuck.

181
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,602
- Hey!
- Fuck! Argh!

182
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,121
- Damnit. Damnit.
- I said I can walk on my own.

183
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,146
- Hey!
- Shit!

184
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,485
So, who the hell are you?

185
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,903
No, who the hell are you?

186
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,986
What?

187
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,493
I'm Sergeant Jeon Pildo from Narcotics.

188
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,412
Oh, shit, you really are a narc!

189
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,956
Corporal Oh from Violent Crimes Unit Two.

190
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,167
Hey, are you okay?

191
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,603
Can you try and get up?

192
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,878
My leg. Aah!

193
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,439
- I think my leg is broken.
- Hey, try and relax.

194
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,008
- Get an ambulance.
- Yeah.

195
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,426
Let's clean all this up.

196
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,512
Hey. Where's Pildo?

197
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,846
He's upstairs.

198
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,184
Do you have any idea what you've done?

199
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,393
Yeah. I think I do.

200
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,897
- I have an idea.
- Well, that's not enough.

201
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,484
You just ruined a sting operation
we've been setting up for six months.

202
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,432
We'll take care of this asshole.

203
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,863
Stop!

204
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,990
- You can't do that.
- I can't...

205
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,659
I can't do that?

206
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,578
You don't know how to talk
to your superiors, huh?

207
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,903
Are you trying to fuck with me?

208
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,116
- He's suspected of murder.
- Hyejin!

209
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,586
It's Captain Lee for you.

210
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,422
- Let's go.
- Aw!

211
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,133
Hey! God!

212
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,302
Yeah.

213
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,222
What?

214
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,517
Understood, sir.

215
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,121
Send him over to us once you're through.

216
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,859
Hey, wait, stop.

217
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,360
- Oh, god.
- Hey!

218
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,030
I don't wanna see you again, huh?

219
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,283
Let's go.

220
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,701
Damn it.

221
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,995
I'll fuckin' walk on my own!

222
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,633
- Argh! Ah!
- Hurry it up.

223
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,375
Damn it.

224
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,187
You son of a bitch!

225
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,078
Mister... Mr. Choi.

226
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,456
I, uh... I, I was wrong, okay?

227
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,792
This will... This will never ever
happen again, huh?

228
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,962
We've worked together...
together for ten years, huh?

229
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,255
Please, sir. I beg you.

230
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,346
Exactly.

231
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,434
So why did you do it
if we worked together for so long?

232
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,605
Don't you know what kind of guy I am?

233
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,316
I, I give you the whole factory
and all the drugs I have.

234
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,525
I...

235
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,444
I must have... have lost...

236
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,196
lost my mind for a minute there.

237
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,531
I, uh...

238
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,658
Please don't do this.

239
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,534
My daughter...

240
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,203
She just started school.

241
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,165
So then I'll make sure
that the funeral runs smoothly.

242
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,000
Mr. Choi.

243
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,795
Mr. Choi.

244
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,339
Mr. Choi.

245
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,220
No. Mr. Choi!

246
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,097
What are you... What...

247
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,601
Mr. Choi! You fucking... Aah!

248
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,617
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

249
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,585
Did you get them checked?

250
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,719
Corporal Oh Hyejin?

251
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,145
Yes, I'm Oh Hyejin, sir.

252
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,985
You know who I am?

253
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,823
I do, sir.

254
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,993
Captain Cha Giho of the Narcotics Bureau.

255
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,921
OFFICER: OPEN RECRUIT
CORPORAL: SPECIAL PROMOTION

256
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,508
FATHER: OH JINYEONG
MOTHER: BAE SUYEON

257
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,385
Why did you do it?

258
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,969
What?

259
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,847
Your evidence was somewhat inconclusive.

260
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,892
So the arrest was uncalled for.

261
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:09,687
Well, I believe the motive was clear
and he posed a serious flight risk, sir.

262
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,189
Yes, but that's not a valid reason.

263
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,899
Park Changoo has three priors on record.

264
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,443
I'm sure he would have fled
if I told him I was a cop.

265
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,821
So I believe it was valid.

266
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,038
You've applied to this bureau twice.

267
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,708
- Yes.
- Why so eager?

268
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,627
Why do you wanna join this bureau?

269
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,965
Because there's someone I wanna find.

270
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,049
Who's that?

271
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,722
Is it something you can tell me about?

272
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,227
I like punks like you.

273
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,732
You won't survive if you're only here
for the salary or the pension.

274
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,030
Were you waiting for a while?

275
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,823
Hmm.

276
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,742
Here you go.

277
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,000
What's in here?

278
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,087
Chamomile tea.
It's supposed to help with insomnia.

279
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,381
I know you have trouble sleeping.

280
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,765
Why does it taste like makeup?

281
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,186
This won't help me sleep. It's too gross.

282
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,149
How do you like being a cop?

283
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,031
I've been moved to the Narcotics Bureau.

284
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,786
Now, it's starting for real.

285
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,917
If I can find out who the gun belonged to...

286
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,047
and what exactly Cha Giho
had to do with my dad's murder.

287
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,341
Then I...

288
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,844
I'll have more answers.

289
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,889
Then I'll know who killed him.

290
00:30:56,604 --> 00:31:00,149
<i>My dad and I used to talk about
building a beach house and live there.</i>

291
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,697
<i>We'd hang a hammock out front
and we'd fish and swim every day</i>

292
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,532
like people with nothing to do.

293
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,412
'Cause he wanted to live like that.

294
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,298
And I always wonder
if he were still alive now...

295
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,178
would we be able to live like that?

296
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,089
Do you see that warehouse?

297
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,025
Just about ten years ago,

298
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,818
Donghoon saved my life over there.

299
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,990
Everybody was attacking,
trying to take down the organization.

300
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,588
Mujin!

301
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,978
Hey.

302
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,062
You psycho.

303
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,652
Ah, shit.

304
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,861
Hey.

305
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,447
How can I possibly abandon you here?

306
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,782
Come on.

307
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,659
- It hurts, though. It hurts.
- Get up!

308
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,043
Okay, guys.

309
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,503
Smile for the camera.

310
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,481
Will you be okay?

311
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,131
Too old for this.

312
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,304
I'm giving you my dagger.

313
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,853
You kill him as soon as you can.

314
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,065
Trust me.

315
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,319
No matter what happens,
the organization will protect you.

316
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,977
Later, okay?

317
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,067
God, these questions
are fucking pointless.

318
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,737
Hey, motherfucker!
You haven't answered me! Hey!

319
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,381
- Hey! Why are you cursing the man?
- Did you hear? You...

320
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,299
- You're not getting anything that way.
- Did you hear what he just called me?

321
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,200
And he's all shaken up now.

322
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,201
God.

323
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,619
Changoo. Hey.

324
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,204
Who cares about loyalty anymore?

325
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,081
Money is the real boss, right?

326
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,874
Here.

327
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,212
The name's of five big dealers
and your boss, right it down, huh?

328
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,591
Isn't your dad turning 60?

329
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,051
Don't wanna miss the party.

330
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,428
- Write it down.
- But I don't...

331
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,637
Jesus, just forget it.

332
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,561
There's plenty of other assholes
who will talk.

333
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,318
- So get up, you little piece of shit.
- Wait! Hold on! Just hold on!

334
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:22,934
No.

335
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,648
I really can't just give up our boss.

336
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,126
You little shit.

337
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,902
It's like you're playing hard to get.

338
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,573
You wanna ask me out, huh?

339
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,789
I can't give you names.

340
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,417
I can give you something else, though.

341
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,293
What?

342
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,005
Are you crazy?

343
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,091
There's this candy that's really hot.

344
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,442
Do you know who sell this stuff?

345
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,135
CALL US ANYTIME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

346
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,550
You fucking asshole.
How dare you...

347
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,742
Wait, wait, wait.

348
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,995
Who is it?

349
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,626
Mango.

350
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,879
I'll be right back.

351
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,923
INTERROGATION ROOM

352
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,007
Hey.

353
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,510
Mango is still your contact?

354
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,012
Huh.

355
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,183
Yeah, find out where Mango is.
Hold on. Don't hang up.

356
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,729
NARCOTICS TEAM 1

357
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,981
Why are you here?

358
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,402
You don't let strangers in.

359
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,699
- Park Changoo is still in questioning.
- Yeah, I know that, sir.

360
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,035
- Then why are you here?
- I was just transferred to this bureau.

361
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,662
Asshole.

362
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,205
You fucking narc? Shit.

363
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,748
Shut up. Stop that.

364
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,584
Ah!

365
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,252
Who's this?

366
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,815
Uh, when did you get here?

367
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,423
- Come in. Let's go. Let's go.
- Captain.

368
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,506
But...

369
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,861
- Here. Right this way.
- I'll call you back.

370
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:19,927
Yes, sir.

371
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,970
What...

372
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,267
Captain. Captain.

373
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,270
So, you just joined our team?

374
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,414
What's going on?

375
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,314
Your partner.

376
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,399
Seriously, sir, I can't work with her.

377
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,151
Junho's leg hasn't even healed yet.

378
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,278
Well, that wasn't her fault.

379
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,197
You just clashed while on the same case.

380
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,574
Exactly. Don't you think
that's a bad sign, though?

381
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,909
You want her for my partner...

382
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,620
Do you want me to carry her on my back?

383
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,623
She seems tenacious and very useful.

384
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,249
She wants to catch someone.

385
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,003
Well, who doesn't?

386
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,465
You keep an eye on her
and see if she'll last here.

387
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,550
Well, I don't think
she'll even last a month, sir.

388
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,093
You look into the candy?

389
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,263
Yeah.

390
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,848
Park Changoo talked to us.

391
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,099
Mango is the one.

392
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,559
So, bring him in.

393
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,644
Okay.

394
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,813
We don't have time. The boat's here.

395
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,907
It's not letting me log on.

396
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,825
Our system is a different one.

397
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,118
I think you need to register.

398
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,787
Why do you wanna log on?

399
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,082
So I can check the status
of the investigation.

400
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,624
Ah...

401
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,460
Status of the investigation.

402
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,964
Status of the investigation is that
a moron wasted six months of work.

403
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,467
I'm truly sorry about that.

404
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,844
I can register you on our system now.

405
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,222
Why even bother? Not like she lasts long.

406
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,118
Well, what would you like me to do now?

407
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,481
I don't know.

408
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,234
No idea what to do with you.

409
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,285
Huh.

410
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,328
He's there?

411
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,038
Got it.

412
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,624
Let's go.

413
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,252
- What?
- Time to get to work.

414
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,754
- Mango.
- Okay.

415
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,933
DEAD BODY OF BAE JUNGOO
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

416
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,685
SUICIDE NOTE FOUND WITH BODY

417
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,062
MY DEAR WIFE AND DAUGHTER
I'M SORRY FOR LEAVING YOU

418
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,864
Cha Giho here.

419
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,868
I think it's Choi Mujin,
he's gonna make his move soon.

420
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,425
Yamamoto has expressed interest
in striking a deal with us, sir.

421
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,137
How big of a deal?

422
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,514
The first transaction would be 50 billion.

423
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,894
Should I refuse?

424
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,606
It will become a problem
if we can't meet demand.

425
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,984
They just found Mr. Bae.

426
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,651
Hmm.

427
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,822
I'll make a point of going there
next week.

428
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,411
I don't think I've seen
that tumbler before.

429
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,831
- Chamomile tea.
- Uh...

430
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,958
Chamomile tea?

431
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,628
Nice work, Ms. Kang.

432
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,767
Jiwoo just joined the Narcotics Bureau.

433
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,853
This will be very useful.

434
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,898
And you really think you can trust her?

435
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,955
I, myself, don't think
we should trust her.

436
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,489
I trust the power of her desperation.

437
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,535
Jiwoo will serve as our dagger.

438
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,954
If things go south,
we'll have to kill her.

439
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,835
That's correct.

440
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,065
Goddamn it.
I just can't believe this.

441
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,860
God, that was at the worst.

442
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,491
So, the owner of this place
goes by "Mango", okay?

443
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,868
Head in and bring him out.

444
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,247
And what's he charged with?

445
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,082
Huh. No need for Miranda rights
or anything.

446
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,459
Just go in and bring him out.

447
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,378
Go.

448
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,718
Jesus.

449
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,732
Uh, who are you?

450
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,110
I'm here to meet with the owner.

451
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,613
Uh...

452
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,531
Are you like his new girl or something?

453
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,243
Sorry, that's not my thing. Look.

454
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,954
Mango? Where is he?

455
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,206
Not here. Out.

456
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:41,933
You have to learn to keep your hands

457
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,875
- to yourself.
- Get out...

458
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:53,010
Hey. Get out.

459
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,059
<i>Pildo. Did the rookie go inside?</i>

460
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,436
Yeah. Mango is gonna run out
holding the drugs.

461
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,854
Get ready to go.

462
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,269
Who's that?

463
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,462
What the hell
is happening here? What is this?

464
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,484
<i>Fuck. What's taking her so long?</i>

465
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,944
<i>How long has it been?</i>

466
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,862
Time to go.

467
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,269
What the...

468
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,228
What...

469
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,689
What the hell did she do? Is he dead?

470
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,150
Pildo. Hey. Pildo. Wait.

471
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,085
Hey, hey. My arm! My arm!

472
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,508
My arm! Shit!

472
00:43:57,305 --> 00:44:57,768
