<i>Previously

4
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,627
Goddamn, man.

5
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>It's the third fucking
time this year.</i>

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,792
You the new owner?
So if I want that cut,

7
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,274
I can come through
in a few days

8
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:37,516
and you'll clean me up?

9
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,798
<i>You know who I am,
you know my name,</i>

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
<i>and you know what the fuck
I can do with that.</i>

11
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:44,844
Why the fuck do you insist

12
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,446
on pushing your way into a room
where you're not wanted?

13
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,528
<i>Mr. Flynn, this is Dr. Bruton.</i>

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,330
<i>We need to have a conversation
about your test results.</i>

15
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:53,813
Why'd you come back?

16
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:55,735
I feel like
I could breathe here.

17
00:00:55,777 --> 00:00:57,296
There's something
you should know about me.

18
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:58,778
This motherfucker.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,660
<i>I ain't in this game</i>

20
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:02,462
<i>to snatch chains
and pick pockets.</i>

21
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:04,184
Beef within crews,
jumping off block to block.

22
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:05,224
<i>These little niggas
crazy out here, bro.</i>

23
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,425
Fuck off, Diamond.

24
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,827
<i>I walked in with him.</i>

25
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:08,868
I'm not walking out
without him.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,430
<i>You clockin' my city.</i>

27
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:11,431
<i>It gonna
be a problem if I am?</i>

28
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:14,915
<i>Every time</i>

29
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:15,876
<i>Ghost left somebody alive</i>

30
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,557
<i>out of his generosity,</i>

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,640
<i>it came to bite us in the ass.</i>

32
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:26,168
It's always good
running into old friends.

33
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:13,397
Here. Put it on your head
or your neck.

34
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,440
It'll help with the swelling.

35
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,603
You didn't give
a fuck about my face

36
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:21,124
when that bitch
with the pink sneakers

37
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,168
sliced it open
when I was running for you.

38
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,769
Facts.

39
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,731
But to be fair, we did pay
for your hospital bill.

40
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,493
You also wanted me dead.

41
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:30,975
More than once.

42
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:32,335
But let's not talk
about the past.

43
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,978
Let's focus on the future.

44
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,980
Where did you get this product?

45
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,463
I know you ain't got the funds
to front that kind of weight.

46
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,786
From some guy who tried
to kill me for my shit.

47
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:43,788
I'm beginning to see
a pattern here with you.

48
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,029
- <i>Who was he?</i>
- Didn't stick around

49
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,150
long enough to find out.

50
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,952
He ain't come back to collect?

51
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,594
I'm the only one that
walked away from that fight.

52
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:51,075
Hmm.

53
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,196
I'm not that bitch
getting caught

54
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:53,918
slipping in elevators no more.

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,441
<i>'Sides, been a few weeks.</i>

56
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,765
If someone was coming,
they would've knocked by now.

57
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,766
It's not if, it's when.

58
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,810
Didn't you learn nothing
running for us?

59
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,211
How many bricks you got there?

60
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,372
Let's see.

61
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,133
We got one, two, three, four,

62
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:10,695
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

63
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,137
You got ten bricks.

64
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:15,220
At, what,
30 fucking grand a pop?

65
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:16,661
Ain't nobody
just gonna walk away

66
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,463
from that kind of paper.

67
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,466
Lucky for you,
I kicked in your door.

68
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:22,668
Oh, yeah, I'm real lucky.
You get my coke and I get got.

69
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,630
<i>I ain't gonna kill you.</i>

70
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:27,353
We're gonna get into some
real interesting shit together.

71
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:28,994
<i>The way I see it,
we could either</i>

72
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:29,995
<i>keep trying to kill
each other...</i>

73
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:32,838
Let me rephrase that.

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,201
I could either kill you,
or we could work together.

75
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:37,083
Which one it gonna be?

76
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,764
I'm always on
the side of money.

77
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,566
Yeah, that's what I thought,
so grab a bag.

78
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:41,848
Pack this shit up.

79
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,892
Let's get to work.

80
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,981
Can I get some help?

81
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:55,784
Hello?

82
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,184
How can I help you, sir?

83
00:04:58,226 --> 00:04:59,946
Hi, how are you?

84
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:01,868
I'm here for uh, Simon McDougal,

85
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,913
Brian Kennedy,
and Jimmy Muldoon.

86
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,396
That'll be $9,500.

87
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:20,688
It's all there.

88
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,732
Go sit down.
It'll be a minute, maybe more.

89
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,773
Little something extra
for the, uh,

90
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:29,058
Police Activities League.

91
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:39,307
They'll be right up.

92
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,350
I appreciate it.

93
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,642
These cocksuckers grabbed us
for doing nothing.

94
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:54,883
Yeah, yeah, tell me about it
in the middle

95
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,725
of a fucking police station.

96
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,769
Get outside.

97
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:04,933
How the fuck they get all you?

98
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,054
I don't know.
We're coming out of Mother's.

99
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:07,776
Weren't doing a goddamn thing.

100
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:09,538
Two fucking Unis show up,
grab us.

101
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,582
I thought
it was a fucking joke.

102
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,183
Hey, listen,
don't worry about it, okay?

103
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:16,305
Let's get you fed.
Get in the car.

104
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:17,386
Be there in a minute.

105
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,426
<i>Give me my shit.</i>

106
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,673
What the fuck, Bennigan?

107
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:25,995
You got patrolmen
picking up our guys?

108
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,196
Our guys?

109
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:29,158
Just 'cause I got a Mick name

110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,360
doesn't mean we're fam.

111
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:32,882
You got beef?

112
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:33,603
Kick that shit
up the food chain.

113
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,325
Yeah, I got beef

114
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,967
when I have to post
almost ten large.

115
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,089
- My family gets a pass.
- I'm trying.

116
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,772
That shit's above my pay grade.

117
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,654
You got a problem in the ward.

118
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,416
Interesting.

119
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,497
I thought the whole reason
I paid you

120
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:48,578
is to make my problems go away.

121
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,463
And I'm doing everything I can.

122
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:56,868
You know, I don't believe you.

123
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:59,269
Take your hand
off my goddamn door

124
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:01,313
while you still got use of it.

125
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,674
You got an alderman issue,

126
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,879
not a cop issue.

127
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,536
Thank you.

128
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,340
Who wants breakfast?

129
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:47,321
<i>Whoa.</i>

130
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,683
No offence, but uh, you don't
really do it for me, Liliana.

131
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,649
- I don't fuck white boys.
- <i>Nah?</i>

132
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:00,612
Your asses
are too much trouble.

133
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,454
That's true.

134
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:03,936
The first rule of cutting

135
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:05,137
is don't get that shit
on your fit.

136
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,181
<i>Hmm.</i>

137
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,270
Your arm's busted?

138
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:20,314
Been a minute since I cut.

139
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:22,757
Been in management too long.

140
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,243
Watch and learn.

141
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:38,974
Okay.

142
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,979
Yo, if me and Ghost knew
you had skills like this,

143
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:47,980
we would've
taken you off the routes

144
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:49,302
and put you in the lab.

145
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:50,543
Is Ghost gonna be coming
down to Chicago

146
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:51,464
to get down on this?

147
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:53,508
Nah.

148
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,271
You two finally
decided to break up?

149
00:08:58,073 --> 00:08:59,913
Ghost dead.

150
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,202
You do it?

151
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,247
<i>Nah.</i>

152
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,090
But I couldn't stop it neither.

153
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:22,658
Sorry for your loss.

154
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,821
Yeah.

155
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:30,707
Me too.

156
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:33,708
Look, it's gonna
take me all night

157
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,350
to get this to that sweet spot.

158
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,792
<i>It'll be completely
undetectable.</i>

159
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,634
- <i>Double the weight.</i>
- Double the profit.

160
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:41,195
That's right.
So what's the split?

161
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:43,037
70/30 my way.

162
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,679
Fuck that.

163
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:46,080
You think I'm
that scared little courier

164
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,602
you knew back in New York?

165
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:48,763
<i>Think again,</i> mano.

166
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,046
I need you and you need me.

167
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:53,090
So it's 50/50.

168
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:02,059
50/50.

169
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:05,701
Why you helping me, Tommy?

170
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:06,902
You wanted me dead.

171
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,864
Why you keep pushing it, huh?

172
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:10,906
It was a long time ago.

173
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,029
You the one that came at me.

174
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,073
- I didn't wanna die.
- And you ain't dead.

175
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,276
That's all that matters.

176
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,734
To Ghost.

177
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:41,459
To Ghost.

178
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:51,628
Yo, JP.

179
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,750
<i>Yo, Tommy.</i>

180
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,793
Yo.

181
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:56,713
- Hey. Oh, man.
- Where you want to put this?

182
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,275
Come on over here.

183
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:01,318
Well, upstairs
is uh, gutted to the studs.

184
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
Down here
is gonna be a motherfucker.

185
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:04,762
<i>Yeah, I bet.
Where do you want these?</i>

186
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:06,283
Come on, man.
Right here.

187
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:08,165
- You're a lifesaver.
- Yeah, dig in.

188
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:10,167
- You're welcome.
- All right.

189
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,889
- Cheese?
- <i>I love cheese.</i>

190
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:14,291
Next. Oh, mmm. Ah.

191
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,974
There we go. All right.

192
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:18,976
Those squares, man.
I'll never get used to it.

193
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:20,658
Come on, man,
that's good stuff.

194
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,582
So who's paying
for Miriam's nursing home?

195
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:26,664
Well, I assume she got
some kind of trust set up.

196
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:28,106
She had money like that?

197
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:29,788
Enough, I guess.

198
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,831
Nobody ever hit up
you or your old man?

199
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,752
Nah.

200
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,796
Me and Herman weren't a part
of her life for a long time.

201
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,517
By the time
we came back around,

202
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,561
she was already in the home.

203
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:43,762
I guess if we wanted
some answers...

204
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,123
No, no, no, no, no.

205
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:46,805
No fucking way

206
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,849
am I ever gonna go
to that crazy bitch.

207
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,249
Kate's out of the picture.

208
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,652
Lot of work to be done in here,

209
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,696
but, um...

210
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:58,537
...I think I'll hold onto this.

211
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,581
What's "this"?

212
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:06,147
You are right there.

213
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,591
<i>Holy shit.</i>

214
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,353
There I am.

215
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:16,996
Doesn't look like we were
ever here at the same time.

216
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,479
Yeah, no wonder we didn't know
the other one existed.

217
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:20,640
What's the plan for this place?

218
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:22,684
Man, I don't know.

219
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:28,167
Look, I appreciate this.

220
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,569
- No...
- But it doesn't feel right.

221
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,491
I can't keep it.

222
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,852
Doesn't feel right
and it doesn't feel legal.

223
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:35,177
Laundromats ain't legal
in Illinois?

224
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,058
That was my business, JP.

225
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,460
Laundromats,
parking lots, nightclubs.

226
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:42,543
Me and my partner
did real good.

227
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:45,065
Sold that shit,
split it right down the middle.

228
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:47,787
So you retired,
headed to Chicago?

229
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:49,389
Yeah, something like that.

230
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:50,630
And your partner?

231
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:53,193
He headed south.

232
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:55,596
Man, you break off
a knot like this, I mean...

233
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:57,197
Well, look,
money ain't got no feelings.

234
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,479
But I do.

235
00:12:58,521 --> 00:12:59,800
Well, is your feelings gonna

236
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,202
keep the lights on here
or at the club?

237
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,444
Money fucks things up,

238
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:05,726
especially with family.

239
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:06,807
Take it back.

240
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:08,649
What's your number?

241
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,090
- I just said...
- No, I know what you said,

242
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:12,853
but I ain't heard
what you need.

243
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,375
Everybody's got a number
so they could breathe.

244
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,419
What's yours?

245
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:24,907
Come on, hit me.

246
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:30,992
One hundred
ninety-six thousand...

247
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,797
two hundred and twenty-three.

248
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:36,760
That's a big breath.

249
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:40,402
Hang on to that money,
all right?

250
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,605
I'll, uh,
I'll see what I can't do.

251
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:45,649
I'll hit you later.

252
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:52,975
This field is going to shit.

253
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:55,137
We should do
some community work.

254
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:57,580
That's a good way
to clean some cash.

255
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:59,581
Let's do something
that's just about...

256
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:01,625
I don't know, man, some good.

257
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,306
Shit, it's all good, nigga.

258
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:06,068
Let me ask you something.

259
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,112
You think money
has a conscience?

260
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:10,993
I mean, for real.

261
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:12,875
We get some new bleachers,
backstops,

262
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,757
put some real grass
in the outfield.

263
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,040
Come on.
All the shit we didn't have?

264
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,481
Ain't nobody gonna give a fuck

265
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,002
about where the money
came from.

266
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:21,524
Man, I am.

267
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,687
Look, everything on your back,

268
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,089
that crib I got you set up in,

269
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,133
it all come
from the same break now.

270
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,934
So think about it.

271
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:32,776
Why shouldn't these
beautiful Black kids

272
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:34,698
from around here
get the same shit that them

273
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,099
little white motherfuckers
in Barrington get?

274
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,301
You know I'm right.

275
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:40,824
But anyway, let's get into
game seven of the series.

276
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,466
Nigga, batter up.

277
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,628
Never saw it.

278
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,430
Lost TV privileges.

279
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:47,671
The fuck outta here.

280
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:48,752
<i>For real.</i>

281
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:50,796
Heard it on a transistor radio.

282
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,758
Only time I ever
felt free in there

283
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,479
was listening to that game.

284
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,521
Damn.
Well, no more excuses, nigga.

285
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,565
Let's go.

286
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:03,930
Come on, let's go.

287
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,171
I just sat my ass down.

288
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,215
Time to work.

289
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:17,061
<i>Look at you
with the homework</i>

290
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,105
on the two biggest players
in Chicago.

291
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,906
What do you know
about the Flynn family?

292
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:23,548
We tight.

293
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,350
Already been to the house
up at the lake.

294
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,394
Little over the top.

295
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,796
You got coffee?

296
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:32,317
Nothing with a kick?

297
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,318
I gotta cut
for another crew today.

298
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,362
Uh...

299
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,250
Breakfast of champions.

300
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,051
Ah, fuck it.
I gotta test the product.

301
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:47,373
Make 'em small.

302
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:01,149
Clean. Nice work.

303
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:03,792
I told you my shit was fire.

304
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,395
You know, it ain't easy
getting an invite

305
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:10,956
up to the big house
in the 'burbs.

306
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:12,878
If you can lock in Sampson

307
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,081
or the Flynns, we're set.

308
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:16,522
Think bigger.

309
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,845
Chicago ain't
like New York, right?

310
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,727
It ain't about Boroughs,
it's about blocks.

311
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,249
And the crews
that used to hold down

312
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,890
these neighbourhoods is fucked.

313
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,652
They all broke apart.

314
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,453
So this whole shit
is up for grabs.

315
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:29,856
Except for CBI or the Flynns.

316
00:16:29,898 --> 00:16:31,618
CBI's the only crew
that matters South Side,

317
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,260
Flynns up north.

318
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:34,501
Yeah, between them
they got a lot of land

319
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:36,103
locked up here in Chicago.

320
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,786
- You ever cut for CBI?
- Only once.

321
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:41,268
Jenard tried fucking me
the whole time I was working.

322
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,950
Guess he did.

323
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:44,432
Piece of shit
still owes me eight grand.

324
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:45,872
I'll get you your money.

325
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:48,395
- And the Flynns?
- Nope, pills only.

326
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,439
They move mad weight.

327
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,721
One more for the road?

328
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,486
You can get your ass
a latte on the way there.

329
00:16:57,847 --> 00:17:00,969
So it's Black and Latin crews
on the south and west side.

330
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,010
Whites up north.

331
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:03,610
Yeah, my guy Jason

332
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:05,052
said that none of them
fuck with each other.

333
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:06,213
- Who?
- Uh, old associate.

334
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:07,294
Retired.

335
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:09,136
Seems like a wasted shot

336
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,178
for Black and Latin
and white crews not to mix.

337
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,579
It ain't New York.

338
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,341
It's a hard line
nobody wants to cross.

339
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:14,823
Yeah, well, I wasn't born
within these lines here,

340
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,867
so I ain't gonna stay in 'em.

341
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:19,027
Well...

342
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,669
The Flynns don't know I'm here,

343
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:22,270
but Sampson does,

344
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:24,792
so I gotta get
this coke out there

345
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,434
to get them to the table.

346
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:28,797
Get this pipeline in motion.

347
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,119
Did you not hear the part
about Black, brown, and white?

348
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,161
Yeah, I heard you,
but if they smart,

349
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:34,923
the only colour they gonna
give a fuck about is green.

350
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,926
And if they too stupid
to do something about it,

351
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,729
then I'm gonna run
the whole fucking table.

352
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,772
You know what?
Let's keep one for ourselves.

353
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:46,855
<i>Ooh-hoo-hoo!</i>

354
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:49,138
<i>Shit, nigga, you rusty.</i>

355
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,380
- It's been a minute.
- <i>I see.</i>

356
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:53,783
I don't know, bro.

357
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:55,264
It look like you
lost your shit.

358
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:56,906
You sure you ready
for this heat?

359
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,788
I stay ready
so I ain't gotta get ready, J.

360
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,670
A'ight, I hear you, I hear you.

361
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,192
I don't know,
you look like you lost your cut

362
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,234
a little bit, bro,
just-just a little bit.

363
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:06,796
You doing a lot of talking,
and not a lot of pitching.

364
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:10,240
A'ight, a'ight.
Here come the janky leg.

365
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:12,522
Gotta watch that leg.
You gotta watch that leg.

366
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:15,325
Ah, yeah!

367
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,807
Steeerike two!

368
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,330
Show me something else.

369
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,212
So what's up, man?

370
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,133
You still fuckin'
with this white boy or what?

371
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:25,295
Man, just pitch.

372
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,297
- Are you?
- Man, pitch.

373
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,659
You ain't answer my question.

374
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:30,340
Because I don't need to.

375
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,423
Pitch.

376
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:34,265
Okay, so what?

377
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:35,986
This motherfucker
just gon' be around

378
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,667
for a minute or something?
Is that it?

379
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,069
He helped me get you
out of jail, right?

380
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:41,872
Fuck all that.
I'm good and you good.

381
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,275
<i>So fuck him, bro.
We don't need him.</i>

382
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:45,956
It don't work like that.

383
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,199
Spare me with
that Buddha bullshit, okay?

384
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,041
The old Diamond

385
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,806
would've popped
this goofy-ass nigga by now.

386
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,326
I'm not the old Diamond.

387
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,370
<i>Yeah, you damn sure
right, you not.</i>

388
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,850
And let me tell you
something else, too, nigga.

389
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,933
This ain't the old days.

390
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,094
Listen to me.

391
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:04,896
I am not your little brother

392
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,618
just happy to be
at the table, nigga.

393
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,620
I am a grown-ass man, D.

394
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:09,821
I earned my seat.

395
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:11,263
I done gave you that seat.

396
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:13,306
Now pitch.

397
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:20,151
You might've been
the motherfucker

398
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,434
that give me that seat,

399
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:25,197
but I'm the one
that made us relevant.

400
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,241
Remember that shit.

401
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,903
So Bennigan passed
the fucking buck?

402
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:52,504
Yeah.

403
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:54,787
He says we need to take it
to the alderman.

404
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,429
Look, if we don't get
somebody else on the inside,

405
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:57,950
this shit's
gonna keep happening.

406
00:19:57,992 --> 00:19:59,995
Well, he's been strong so far.

407
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:04,598
As long as the Feds aren't
building a case against us,

408
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,440
we're good.

409
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:10,123
Our profits are down 12%
from six months ago.

410
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,533
I've told you, we'll come back.

411
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,297
You okay?

412
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,341
Y'know, maybe you should quit
smoking.

413
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,864
Maybe you should stop worrying.

414
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:33,028
Touch of bronchitis.

415
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,553
I need you to go and see
Alderman Maguire again.

416
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:40,434
Send the fucking politician.

417
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,276
Look at those lips.

418
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,439
Perfect for ass-kissing.

419
00:20:44,481 --> 00:20:46,760
Yeah, but somehow,

420
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:48,804
I don't see your brother
in a skirt.

421
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:51,808
Let's agree to disagree.

422
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,289
I need you to convince Maguire,

423
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,131
stop these fucking shakedowns.

424
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,574
No, we can't play fast
and loose with this prick.

425
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,176
Land on a fucking number.

426
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,218
Got it.

427
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,699
I will head by his office
tomorrow and make it happen.

428
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,743
No, not his office.

429
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:10,787
A meal, expensive wine.

430
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,912
That motherfucker's
taking our money.

431
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,913
And I'm not having it anymore.

432
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:19,957
It ends now.

433
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,281
Make sure you wear something,
you know,

434
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,325
stimulate his imagination.

435
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,530
Got it.

436
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,972
- And hey, bunny.
- Yeah.

437
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,858
Put a little sugar on it.

438
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:18,174
You did this?

439
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:20,257
You bought my mom
a new tombstone?

440
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,259
She deserves it.

441
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,303
She gave us her blessing.

442
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,145
Yeah.

443
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:30,430
After I convinced her
you'd look after me.

444
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,795
I saw you with him.

445
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:39,276
So that's why you did this?

446
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,559
'Cause you're jealous?

447
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,281
Because I want you to be happy.

448
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:44,682
If you want me
to be happy, Vic,

449
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:46,764
then stop trying to buy me

450
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:48,808
and start standing up for me.

451
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:52,651
Okay, I just... I need...

452
00:22:52,693 --> 00:22:54,854
I just...

453
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:58,618
Can you wait
for me to figure it out?

454
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,745
I don't know.

455
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:12,832
<i>This fucking guy.</i>

456
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:15,433
Unreal.

457
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:16,875
Let's take him out right now.

458
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,877
Nah, Paulie.

459
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,959
That'd be rude.

460
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,322
Let's see what he's got to say.

461
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:24,643
Then we'll take him out.

462
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:27,088
Hey yo, Walter.

463
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,371
River's almost as cold
as the house on the lake.

464
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:34,813
You surprised to still
see me in Chicago?

465
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,655
No.

466
00:23:36,697 --> 00:23:38,537
I've been around
dumb motherfuckers before.

467
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,742
I'm not clear why you're still
in my fucking city, though.

468
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:44,224
Dumb motherfuckers like me

469
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:46,268
don't follow directions
too well.

470
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,510
You're a bit wee, aren't ye?

471
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:52,271
Your backup?

472
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:54,273
<i>That the best you got, Thomas?</i>

473
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:55,755
Don't sleep on her, Walter.

474
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:57,757
She a hitter.

475
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,880
Nice face.

476
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,924
Walk with me.

477
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,774
How'd you fuck up your face?

478
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:16,298
Shaving accident.
What's your fucking excuse?

479
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,261
Why you run with this asshole?

480
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:22,305
Why's a Polack
work for the Micks?

481
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:26,426
You always answer
questions with questions?

482
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:28,148
Do I?

483
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:34,477
You wanna grab dinner sometime?

484
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:40,243
Shave the moustache,
and we'll talk.

485
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:47,728
Gotta say, Thomas,

486
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,131
I'm not used to people
not following my orders.

487
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:51,933
Good thing I ain't your people.

488
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:55,136
Oh, you think so?
It's in your eyes, boy.

489
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:56,938
I see County Cork in there.

490
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,423
Nah, Walter,
I'm a fucking mutt.

491
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:03,386
Look like a fucking mutt to me.

492
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:06,628
<i>All right, then.</i>

493
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,149
What are you fucking
looking for?

494
00:25:08,191 --> 00:25:09,671
I'm looking
for that long money.

495
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:11,193
I got enough money.

496
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:13,155
Yeah, but do you
got vision?

497
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:15,678
I got a business proposition
I think you might be feeling.

498
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,799
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

499
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:18,240
I recently ran into some coke.

500
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:19,522
Pure motherfucking shit.

501
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:22,003
Fuck! I move pills.

502
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:24,406
I don't fuck with powder
or any other shit.

503
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:26,488
Jesus Christ,
I know you sell pills.

504
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,851
All of Chicago
knows that you sell pills.

505
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:30,292
You a one-trick pony.

506
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,255
Why don't you diversify
your game?

507
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,818
If I'm gonna invest my money
in coke,

508
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,420
then I'm gonna go
with the CBI boys.

509
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:38,862
They make better partners.

510
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,503
Get the fuck
outta here, Walter.

511
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:42,545
You know you never run
with no Black crews.

512
00:25:42,587 --> 00:25:43,706
Stop fronting like
you know the difference

513
00:25:43,748 --> 00:25:45,468
between BLM and BET.

514
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,670
All right, so we got
a student here.

515
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,033
Yeah, you give the people
whatever the fuck they want,

516
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:52,758
and they will pay you
whatever the fuck you ask.

517
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,519
You got some
fucking balls on you, boy.

518
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:57,161
Balls will get you
through the door.

519
00:25:57,203 --> 00:25:58,721
Brains will keep you
in the room.

520
00:25:58,763 --> 00:26:01,364
And now that I'm in the room,

521
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,408
the fuck you gonna do about it?

522
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,894
I'm listening.

523
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:10,854
Good.

524
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:21,265
You ain't exactly
my first fucking choice here.

525
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:22,987
I didn't sign up
for this field trip.

526
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,229
But daddy's corner boy
can't say no.

527
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,912
Look, he told me to do this deal
with you, so here I am.

528
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:30,034
I don't say no when there's
real money to be made.

529
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:31,836
Real money... what the fuck
you know about real money?

530
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:33,798
You probably still
get an allowance.

531
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,880
Look, your coke's
a good product.

532
00:26:35,922 --> 00:26:37,681
Put the Flynn stamp on it,
it's a new revenue stream.

533
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,403
I been trying to tell him
that coke goes hard 365

534
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:41,566
in Chicago,
but he won't go near CBI.

535
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:42,807
Yeah, 'cause rocking
with the South Side

536
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:44,489
bad for public image?

537
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:46,051
I ain't got a problem
with Black crews.

538
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:48,013
But what would people
say about Daddy

539
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:49,654
if sonny was
flipping packs with...

540
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:51,699
Yo, chill with that son shit,
will you?

541
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:54,058
Fuck, how long you gonna
be in Chicago anyways?

542
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,020
Long enough.

543
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:58,505
Why was you making side deals
without your old man knowing?

544
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:00,665
You here to move weight
or what?

545
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:01,787
Yeah, I'm here
to move weight.

546
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,388
Lead the way, son.

547
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:19,407
What the fuck
did you give me, Colin?

548
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:25,253
<i>My heart's racing!</i>

549
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:27,493
Colin, turn that shit down.

550
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:29,816
Colin,
turn that shit down!

551
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,137
Colin, turn
the fucking music off!

552
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,420
Okay, this
is all kinds of wrong.

553
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:37,303
She's fine. Just a lightweight.

554
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:39,065
Let's get the fuck outta here.

555
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:40,667
Fuck this.
I'm calling the cops.

556
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:42,549
You know,
let's not call the cops.

557
00:27:42,591 --> 00:27:44,351
I'm the guy
that's gonna make sure

558
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:46,113
that you get out of here safe.

559
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:47,594
How's that sound?

560
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,637
Good.

561
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,720
Let's go.

562
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:55,522
No.

563
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:57,524
You came here to do a deal.

564
00:27:57,566 --> 00:27:59,326
That's what your old man said.

565
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:01,769
So you are not leaving

566
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:03,971
until we have one.

567
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:06,095
Is that fucking clear?

568
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:11,258
You know,
I love that Papa Flynn

569
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,539
took the training wheels off,

570
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:16,624
but not all the way,

571
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,426
'cause this dude eye-fucking me

572
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:21,151
is clearly here
to hold his baby's hand.

573
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:24,753
Now...

574
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:27,877
who the fuck is this clown?

575
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,280
Oh!

576
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:33,761
Give me the gun.

577
00:28:33,803 --> 00:28:35,805
<i>Give me the fucking gun.</i>

578
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:38,647
This is so good!
Shoot him, Fat Tony.

579
00:28:38,689 --> 00:28:39,688
You ain't fat.

580
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,732
I went keto.

581
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:45,054
Fuck it.

582
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:49,898
Didn't think today was
your day, did you, Fat Tony?

583
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,900
It never is.

584
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:54,303
I got kids.

585
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:57,586
I got four kids.

586
00:28:57,628 --> 00:28:58,948
What was it you were saying
about my old man, Colin?

587
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,429
What was that?

588
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:02,151
I can't fucking hear you!

589
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:05,554
Yo, as much as I like
where this is going,

590
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:06,995
I don't think we want
to haul out a body

591
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,517
in the middle of the day.

592
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,321
Freight elevator is good
for 2,000 pounds, easy.

593
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:14,483
Take you right
to the alley too.

594
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:16,285
Are you kidding me, Tony!

595
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:18,970
All right, Tony,
get her the fuck out of here.

596
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,213
- Please, Vic...
- Shut the fuck up!

597
00:29:24,255 --> 00:29:26,936
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

598
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:29,298
Here ya go.

599
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,701
Now, paint the fucking walls.

600
00:29:31,743 --> 00:29:33,183
No, no, no, wait, wait!

601
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,227
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

602
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:40,710
Jesus fucking Christ, Victor.

603
00:29:40,752 --> 00:29:42,191
Psshh.

604
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,673
You can't handle
one fucking deal?

605
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,795
That motherfucker Colin
was outta line.

606
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:47,838
I'm talking to my son.

607
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,920
The deal didn't make, Da.

608
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:52,004
We gotta take the product
up to Lake County.

609
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:55,526
You can't move
fucking weight in this city.

610
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,570
What chance you think
you got up there?

611
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:03,093
You know what?

612
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,735
<i>Call this fucking idiot.</i>

613
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:06,657
<i>Colin.</i>

614
00:30:06,699 --> 00:30:08,861
Get us back on fucking track.

615
00:30:10,423 --> 00:30:12,543
You can call him if you want,

616
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:14,587
but I don't think
he's gonna answer.

617
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:25,476
All right, you want
to make a real fucking move?

618
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:27,118
Unify all the cocaine.

619
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,162
<i>One deal.</i>

620
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,764
You get Diamond Sampson
to the table.

621
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:34,566
That's it.

622
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:36,609
<i>And we're all good.</i>

623
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:46,860
All right.

624
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:51,664
Ha ha ha. Diamond Sampson.

625
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:56,230
Best hand-eye coordination
that Chicago has ever seen.

626
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,234
I used to fight a little.

627
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:03,836
My coach would always say,

628
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:06,839
"Stay off the ropes
and outta the corners."

629
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,681
Best advice I ever got.

630
00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:11,204
Sound advice.

631
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,485
What, you here to lace 'em up
or just read my press clip?

632
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,690
I'm here for business.

633
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:19,612
I got a meet set.

634
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:22,015
Me, you,

635
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:23,576
and Walter Flynn.

636
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,063
Ain't no white boys crew
got down with us before,

637
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:31,904
and that's not gonna change

638
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:33,786
'cause a white boy
with a little bit of swag

639
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,388
decided he wanted
to kick it around our city.

640
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,630
I ain't never been
no white man's nigga.

641
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:39,553
I ain't about to be one now.

642
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:41,194
<i>Right.</i>

643
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:43,437
So before you move forward
with any deal

644
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,839
or proposition
or any of that shit,

645
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:47,842
you better make damn sure
that you ain't out here

646
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,362
thinking the same shit as them
other white motherfuckers.

647
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:51,965
Oh, I ain't.
You keep forgetting.

648
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:54,368
<i>I ain't from this city</i>

649
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,370
so I wasn't born
into these rules,

650
00:31:56,412 --> 00:31:58,852
so I ain't got to live by 'em.

651
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:01,135
This deal is undeniable.

652
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,617
Fuck them other crews.

653
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,661
This about you.

654
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:08,662
- So Walter Flynn already down?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

655
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,384
What? Come on, you seriously
thinking about Flynn?

656
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:12,226
Yo, yo, me and big bro
having a conversation here.

657
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:14,428
A'ight, boy, you and big bro
ain't having shit.

658
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,631
You know where you at?
The fuck is wrong with you?

659
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,032
It's cool, J.

660
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:19,954
No, it ain't
motherfucking cool.

661
00:32:19,996 --> 00:32:22,679
Nigga, don't no CBI business
go down without me.

662
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:29,165
You want the top seat, D?

663
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:33,568
Only way to get that shit
is to take it, nigga.

664
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,612
What's up?

665
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,133
Ain't no coming back
from this, J.

666
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:40,055
Mm, okay, yeah.

667
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:41,457
Well, there ain't
moving forward without it.

668
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:57,595
Y'all get the fuck out.

669
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:01,639
Let's move forward, nigga.

670
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:06,844
You sure you wanna do this?

671
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,165
Ooh.

672
00:33:10,768 --> 00:33:12,809
All right, let's go.

673
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:19,336
Hey, yo.

674
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:21,497
Who you got?

675
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,339
J, all the way.

676
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:25,702
Always bet on the little man,
you feel me?

677
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:27,746
They both bigger than me.

678
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:30,106
500.

679
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:31,147
You got five?

680
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:33,432
Shit, I got a coup'.

681
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:36,593
Money on the wood
make the backbone good.

682
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:38,638
- Bet.
- Let's get it.

683
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,445
Damn.

684
00:33:52,772 --> 00:33:54,814
<i>Got this, Diamond.</i>

685
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,535
<i>Come on, J, you got it.</i>

686
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:01,018
Let's go, little bro. Come on!

687
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,379
Get him back on his feet.

688
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,982
- Ha ha ha. Okay.
- Let's go.

689
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:13,151
J, go 'head, let them legs fly.

690
00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:14,793
Legs?

691
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,916
Fuck is you
talking about, legs?

692
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,877
Uhh...

693
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,759
Man, stop that
<i>Karate Kid</i> bullshit, man.

694
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,321
Use your hands.

695
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,083
<i>That's your perineal nerve, D.</i>

696
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,606
It's sending a message
to your central nervous system

697
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,167
telling you to tap out.

698
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:31,170
Tap, nigga.

699
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,612
Man, fuck that.

700
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,655
Punk motherfucker.
MMA bullshit.

701
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,458
How you like that?

702
00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:04,644
<i>There we go.</i>

703
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,926
See what I'm saying?
Don't ever bet against a man

704
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:09,649
<i>who ain't got nothing to lose
and everything to gain.</i>

705
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,693
Yeah, whatever.

706
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,896
- Damn.
- A'ight, trip.

707
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,462
You got the top seat, D.

708
00:35:22,144 --> 00:35:24,624
Heavy is the motherfuckin' head
that wear the crown, nigga.

709
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,066
<i>Yo, Diamond.</i>

710
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:28,589
Now that you got
the juice back,

711
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:30,230
what you think about
that sit with Flynn?

712
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:32,594
Set it.

713
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:47,408
I hope you don't mind...
I took the liberty

714
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,329
- of ordering for you.
- Yeah, I'm not here to eat.

715
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:50,931
The chef makes me
a butter-poached monkfish

716
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:52,733
that isn't on the menu.
It's phenomenal.

717
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,455
Besides, you can't do business
on an empty stomach.

718
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:55,416
Alderman,
my family has been very...

719
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,138
It's taxpayers' money.

720
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,899
- It'll be our little secret.
- Oh, okay

721
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:59,941
This is perfect.

722
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,102
Our family should not have
to be bailing out our men...

723
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:03,146
Just one more sec, pumpkin.

724
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:14,195
I detect yellow citrus fruit,

725
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:17,679
white flowers that mingle
with hints of crushed chalk...

726
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,082
You know, I thought
we had an agreement.

727
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:22,284
Agreements
and their terms change.

728
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:25,807
Well, then we need to be
notified on those changes.

729
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:28,850
Give us a firm number
and stop moving the target.

730
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:31,653
I think I mentioned something
to your father about that.

731
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:34,098
Or did I?
So much to do in a day.

732
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,901
If the harassment of my family

733
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,824
or any of our associates
continues in your ward,

734
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,025
then those monthly envelopes
you enjoy so much

735
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,028
will quickly disappear.

736
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,751
And we'll take our business
to another ward.

737
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:50,795
I'm not here to play games.

738
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:54,557
Too bad.

739
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,002
I can think of three right now
that end with us fucking.

740
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:02,645
There are so many pockets in
this city looking to be filled.

741
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,166
Yours can go empty very easily.

742
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,888
Ha.

743
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,051
Relax, Claudia.

744
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,493
Honestly, I don't know
why you don't like me more.

745
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:12,295
We have a lot in common.

746
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:14,057
Oh, we have nothing in common.

747
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,459
<i>Oh, we do.</i>

748
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,743
We both love to eat pussy.

749
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,227
Those fucking envelopes
are the only thing

750
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:25,589
keeping you and your family

751
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:27,633
from going away
for a very long time.

752
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:31,076
I decide when and how much.

753
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:38,482
You know, speaking of families,

754
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,604
I'm so glad to see that
your daughter Molly

755
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:42,686
is attending Sacred Heart.

756
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,288
- Don't you say another word.
- You know, I fucking hated

757
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,532
those uniforms, but...

758
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:50,895
Oh.

759
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:52,617
Look how clean she keeps hers.

760
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:56,261
I bet she would hate it
for it to get covered with...

761
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,304
dirt.

762
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,428
We're good.

763
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,472
The number
will remain the same.

764
00:38:08,435 --> 00:38:10,075
Good.

765
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:11,717
I'll let my father know.

766
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:15,360
Oh, and something
tells me that

767
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:17,001
even if I gave you a manual

768
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:19,764
and a map,

769
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:22,968
you wouldn't know the first
thing about eating pussy.

770
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,209
<i>Good night, Liam.</i>

771
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:38,624
<i>This shit is depressing.</i>

772
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,346
<i>Not even a box of cereal.</i>

773
00:38:40,388 --> 00:38:42,948
I gave up eating
cereal a long time ago.

774
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,550
It's not good for you.

775
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:47,033
If the Flynns can't move that,
I got a way.

776
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,514
Let me run with it.

777
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:50,276
Yeah, I don't think so.

778
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:52,198
Half that shit's mine.
I can do whatever I want.

779
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,879
Why do I get the feeling that
who's ever looking for this...

780
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:55,521
When did you
become so paranoid?

781
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:57,683
Let me buy you out your half.

782
00:38:57,725 --> 00:39:00,006
- No.
- Whose cocaine is this?

783
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:02,008
I already told you
the whole fucking story.

784
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,533
You better have.

785
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:07,376
I think I'm gonna
keep all of it.

786
00:39:08,657 --> 00:39:10,659
Yeah.

787
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:14,983
But I will call you later.

788
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:19,508
Hasta lue... go.

789
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:24,513
Bye.

790
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:48,256
Fuck.

791
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,920
Walter.

792
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:14,162
The boy's late.

793
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:16,124
Don't you worry about that.

794
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,327
<i>He'll be here.</i>

795
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:20,371
Oh, aye?

796
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:24,654
Walter, Vic.

797
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:26,897
Diamond.

798
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,661
Good to see you out, Diamond.

799
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:32,461
Good to be out.

800
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:34,503
Let me get right down to it.

801
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:36,906
Diamond's the biggest
motherfucker on the South Side.

802
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:38,948
The Flynns, y'all got
the North Side on lock.

803
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,870
But in order
for this partnership to work,

804
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:43,433
all this Chicago
Black and white bullshit

805
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:45,074
gonna have to end, Walter.

806
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:47,596
We're ready to work with CBI.

807
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:49,198
- Have access to your cocaine...
- Ah...

808
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,720
In exchange for our product.

809
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

810
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,525
Hold your roll, son.

811
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:58,128
I mean, this is just the first
conversation, isn't it?

812
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,210
I'm listening.

813
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,211
This how shit gonna go down.

814
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,694
CBI's gonna start
moving powder up north.

815
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:05,975
That'll give the Flynns
an opportunity

816
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:07,457
to sell their pills down south.

817
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,499
Below Garfield Ave.

818
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:13,383
Kickback is 10%. Both ways.

819
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:15,185
Huh.

820
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:17,588
And where is
your cut in all this?

821
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,350
'Cause I know
you ain't doing it

822
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:21,431
out of the kindness
of your heart, are you?

823
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:23,593
Five percent.

824
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:25,435
On every deal.

825
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:28,078
Oh-ho.

826
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,161
That's a bit steep.

827
00:41:30,203 --> 00:41:32,243
Walter, been hearing that
your numbers been down

828
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:33,684
for the past couple of months.

829
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:35,366
Thought
you'd be happy about this.

830
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,249
So how've you been
hearing that?

831
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,292
It's the word on the street.

832
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:43,774
How do I know that

833
00:41:43,816 --> 00:41:46,577
your man Diamond here

834
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,541
will keep up
his end of the deal?

835
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:51,142
And no turn around,
stab me in the back

836
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:53,385
first chance he gets.

837
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,826
Because my word
means something.

838
00:41:54,868 --> 00:41:56,668
<i>Your word?</i>

839
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,350
Yeah, does it though?

840
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,472
Twenty years ago,

841
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:03,475
when you rolled up
on Paulie and his wife.

842
00:42:03,517 --> 00:42:05,196
Remember that?

843
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:08,120
Beth catches
a face full of fuckin' glass.

844
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:09,801
Fifty-two fucking stitches

845
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:11,603
to put her
beautiful face back together.

846
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:14,126
Hold up now, we getting
a little off topic here.

847
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,968
It wasn't us and it wasn't me.

848
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,810
Oh, 'cause...'cause...

849
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:20,652
'cause we should just
take your word for that.

850
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:22,696
- Da, let it go.
- Get off of me.

851
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:27,139
That's your trouble,

852
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:29,101
you motherfucking
Black parasite.

853
00:42:29,143 --> 00:42:31,146
Jesus Christ.

854
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:34,426
Is you think
you're untouchable?

855
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,108
- A'ight, you know what? I'm out.
- No, no, no, Diamond,

856
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,030
Diamond, Diamond, come on, man.
Don't leave me here.

857
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:39,832
Not now, not now.

858
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:41,394
Walter ain't gonna
pull that bullshit again.

859
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,438
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

860
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,039
All right, Walter.

861
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:47,721
Go ahead and continue with
your little history lesson

862
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:49,402
<i>and tell your son</i>

863
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,845
how you put nine of my men
in the ground.

864
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:55,408
Nine... because you think
we all look alike.

865
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,370
And I never retaliated.

866
00:42:57,412 --> 00:43:00,894
You never retaliated

867
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:04,017
'cause I'd have buried another
19 more of you motherfuckers.

868
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:06,900
Because I wasn't gon' lose
any more of my men

869
00:43:06,942 --> 00:43:09,743
behind the lies
of a worthless man.

870
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:11,787
<i>Huh.</i>

871
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,515
What the fuck just happened?

872
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,438
It's called history, new guy.

873
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:30,244
You had a chance here, Walter,

874
00:43:30,286 --> 00:43:32,768
to do something
that fucking mattered.

875
00:43:35,892 --> 00:43:38,412
They don't need to matter to us

876
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:41,736
'cause we are Flynns,
you hear me?

877
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:43,458
We're the fuckin' Flynns.

878
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,740
That was our chance
to make a change.

879
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:47,582
Expand the business
in a real fucking way.

880
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:49,343
Know what, son?

881
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:51,626
You gotta shut up and listen.

882
00:43:51,668 --> 00:43:54,509
The Italians or the Greeks
or the Polish

883
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:56,791
find out that
we are in bed with them,

884
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,755
we become outcasts.
You understand that?

885
00:43:59,797 --> 00:44:01,799
If we don't,
we're fuckin' extinct.

886
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,726
Yo, Dime.
Yo, man.

887
00:44:10,768 --> 00:44:12,167
<i>I didn't know
that motherfucker</i>

888
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:13,809
was gonna come at you
like that.

889
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,451
I did.

890
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:16,852
But that ain't on you.

891
00:44:16,894 --> 00:44:18,896
It's on the city.

892
00:44:20,378 --> 00:44:22,380
Damn.

893
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:28,824
This definitely answers
my question about

894
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,147
what it is you do.

895
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:33,952
How could it be an answer
when you never asked?

896
00:44:46,404 --> 00:44:48,444
You fucking kidding me?

897
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:49,766
My car already smells like
we got a dead body in it.

898
00:44:49,808 --> 00:44:51,047
Get a vape.

899
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:52,649
Nothing a grown-ass man smokes

900
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,971
should smell like cotton candy.

901
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:57,016
Let me see the new face.

902
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:01,178
Maybe Flynn's got a new guy.

903
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,221
Could be.

904
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:11,230
Motherfucker.

905
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:05,924
Figured I'd introduce myself

906
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:07,606
to the man who seems
to have little regard

907
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:09,128
for his own short life.

908
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,529
Look at you out here
in these streets

909
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:13,573
rolling up on me
like a motherfucking OG.

910
00:46:13,615 --> 00:46:15,254
Daddy know you out here?

911
00:46:15,296 --> 00:46:17,296
How come
he ain't never put you on?

912
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:19,098
I'm on. Different role.

913
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,061
Yeah.
Well, wherever he has you,

914
00:46:22,103 --> 00:46:24,666
it ain't nowhere close
to where you should be.

915
00:46:26,508 --> 00:46:28,510
What are you actually looking
to get out of Chicago?

916
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:32,552
Every last motherfuckin' dollar

917
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:34,595
'til I'm running it.
You want in?

918
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:38,357
Might be a day late
and a dollar short

919
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:40,119
on that one, handsome.

920
00:46:40,161 --> 00:46:41,841
I don't think so.

921
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,524
Yeah, you're about
to become obsolete.

922
00:46:44,566 --> 00:46:46,086
I've got something
that'll kick your teeth in

923
00:46:46,128 --> 00:46:48,048
a thousand times over.

924
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,370
Sounds fun.

925
00:46:50,412 --> 00:46:52,573
What you got?

926
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:54,334
Stick around and find out.

927
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:56,378
- Is that an invitation?
- Maybe.

928
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:02,062
Chaos creates opportunity.

929
00:47:02,104 --> 00:47:04,106
Yo, what's that mean?

930
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:09,352
Welcome to Chicago, Tommy.

931
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:20,081
The champ is here.

932
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:23,767
What up, fool?

933
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,047
Hey.

934
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:28,810
You sold that dive in the ring
like a motherfucker.

935
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:30,853
He really thought
he put your ass out to sleep.

936
00:47:32,135 --> 00:47:34,175
Yeah, and he bought it.

937
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:35,657
You know this shit
gonna cut CBI

938
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,659
straight down the middle
though, right?

939
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:40,264
'Cause half these niggas,
they gon' go with you.

940
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:43,907
Other half gon' stay with D.

941
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:49,951
Mean, it's the long game, E,
the whole time.

942
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:54,476
When it's all said and done,
they all gon' come with me.

943
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,239
That's you.

944
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:04,046
This shit is incredible.

945
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,090
You know what else
is incredible?

946
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,731
Can't believe it took
three trials with the FDA

947
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:11,654
for them to discover
that the chemical compounds

948
00:48:11,696 --> 00:48:13,698
were too close to cocaine.

949
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:16,178
Third time was a charm.

950
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,263
Buried me.

951
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,703
And there you were,
holding the bag

952
00:48:20,745 --> 00:48:23,546
with an abundance
of this beautiful drug.

953
00:48:23,588 --> 00:48:26,549
All this from
a busted diet pill?

954
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:29,031
God bless America.

955
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:34,880
This is where you
and your family come in.

956
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:38,722
Correction.

957
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:41,805
This is where I come in.

958
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:44,727
If you're hoping for the Flynn
family experience on this one,

959
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:47,530
you're not getting it.

960
00:48:47,572 --> 00:48:50,374
It's just you and me.

961
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:53,497
Makes sense financially.

962
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,541
Money's simple.

963
00:48:57,423 --> 00:48:59,986
People are complicated.

964
00:49:01,467 --> 00:49:05,231
This is just you and me,
understood?

965
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:08,955
Yeah.

966
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:07,133
Oh! So the biggest fire starter
in Chicago

967
00:50:07,175 --> 00:50:09,455
lives in a firehouse.

968
00:50:09,497 --> 00:50:11,499
Smart.

969
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,541
I never started a fire
I couldn't handle.

970
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:16,181
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

971
00:50:18,025 --> 00:50:20,066
Well, I don't want to talk.
