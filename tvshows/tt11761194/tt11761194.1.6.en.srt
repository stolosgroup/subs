<i>Previously on </i>Force...

4
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:25,682
Where you get this from?

5
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:27,243
Wrong question.

6
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:29,325
Right question.

7
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,007
You know you're
the only Flynn I fuck with.

8
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,009
You got that big
fucking Flynn name

9
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:34,290
but no distro.

10
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:36,292
<i>You come to me with this,</i>

11
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:38,374
<i>you better hope
I'm your motherfucker.</i>

12
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,856
It's finer than coke.

13
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:40,817
You think you can
break this shit down,

14
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,258
see what the fuck we got?

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,419
Damn!

16
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,981
Aah!

17
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:47,143
Where's Tommy Egan?

18
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:48,784
- Where's she at?
- <i>Which doesn't quite</i>

19
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,947
make us even after all
the bodies that have fallen.

20
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:52,990
Get down!

21
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,750
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

22
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,672
It went straight through.
It's clean.

23
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,716
<i>God damn.
You're gonna be all right.</i>

24
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,316
The money that I owe you

25
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:01,917
<i>has got nothing to do
with Vic and me.</i>

26
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,280
This face
is not the face

27
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:06,242
that my son's
going to wake up to.

28
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,003
<i>Maybe you should
just sit down, Walter.</i>

29
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:09,325
He's been quiet
for a while now.

30
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:10,606
He's getting ready
to make a big move.

31
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:12,167
<i>So we need
to get inside.</i>

32
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,489
<i>And that's our way.</i>

33
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,850
What would a deal look like?

34
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,532
<i>Would look like
me running point</i>

35
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:19,054
- and takin' 70%.
- 60-40.

36
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,536
Ain't nobody
Black or white dumb enough

37
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:21,817
to fuck with the Serbs.

38
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,018
They haven't done it

39
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,580
because they haven't
had the numbers.

40
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:26,141
<i>You thought this shit
all the way through?</i>

41
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,944
It's fucking CBI,
who I'm good with.

42
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:31,306
<i>You all stay ready</i>
in case I gotta call y'all up.

43
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:33,350
You stay close.

44
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:42,838
Fucker!

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,080
Sh... hold on, E.

46
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,642
You're the only one
who knows how to cook Dahlia.

47
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:49,364
<i>What the fuck
do you mean?</i>

48
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:50,886
<i>Is there a problem, babe?</i>

49
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:52,527
Our drums of Dahlia
were stolen.

50
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:55,490
We have no product.
I'm going to your father.

51
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,353
First time's
always the hardest,

52
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,397
even if they had it coming.

53
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,918
Never really thought
about what happens

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
after you kill someone.

55
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:48,161
Only two things need to happen.

56
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:50,205
You don't get caught,
and they don't get found.

57
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,327
So how many?

58
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,892
Don't matter.
Same two rules always apply.

59
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:00,574
Look, if you wanna go
all the way in this gang,

60
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,618
this shit come
with the territory.

61
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:04,778
And come on,
we gotta keep moving.

62
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,822
We racin' against the light.

63
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:10,904
- She was an orphan.
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

64
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,948
Then ain't nobody
gonna miss her.

65
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,631
You wanna say any last words?

66
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,875
I don't really know
what to say.

67
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:22,677
Say goodbye.

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,759
Goodbye.

69
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,053
Another senseless death

70
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,375
<i>in the city
plagued by violence.</i>

71
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,780
<i>Another young Black man</i>

72
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:48,141
<i>taken too soon.</i>

73
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:51,224
<i>May Elijah Linden
rest eternally</i>

74
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,388
in the arms of our angels.

75
00:04:58,353 --> 00:04:59,992
Yea...

76
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,034
<i>though I walk through
the valley</i>

77
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:04,116
<i>of the shadow of death,</i>

78
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:06,238
You know that nigga wouldn't
be in this fucking box

79
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,443
right now
if it weren't for Tommy, right?

80
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:12,366
We all agreed
on the move, all of us.

81
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:15,648
Now show some respect.

82
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,329
Amen.

83
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,373
Amen.

84
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,601
Simon...

85
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:51,123
was a north side
White Sox fan,

86
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,167
crazy son of a bitch.

87
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:57,569
But he had a heart of gold.

88
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:05,737
May he be in heaven
a full half hour

89
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,061
before the devil
knows he's dead.

90
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:09,861
To Simon.

91
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,983
To Simon.

92
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,669
You okay?

93
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,753
Yeah, I'm fine, fine.

94
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,195
You've had that cough
for a minute now.

95
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:25,719
I know... you know,
as soon as the weather changes,

96
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,440
I'll be good as gold.

97
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:31,885
Jesus Christ, this is a good
turn out for Simon, isn't it?

98
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,089
<i>I should go talk to him.</i>

99
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,172
No, no, no, no.
Let me.

100
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,534
A son needs
his father's shoulder.

101
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:58,311
You were childhood friends

102
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,034
since you were
three years old...

103
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,038
...and he's lying
in that fuckin' box

104
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,721
because of the stupid fuckin'
decisions that you made.

105
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:13,526
He's not coming back from that.

106
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:17,250
So whatever you're into,
I hope you can.

107
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,940
You need to make
things right with him.

108
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,101
It's a two-way street.

109
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,463
If you're making
moves without him,

110
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:33,824
- he feels betrayed...
- I'm not making moves.

111
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:35,626
Okay, Vic.
Whatever you're doing is...

112
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,428
Hey, how 'bout I go in
on that little side hustle

113
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,789
- you tried to bring me in on?
- Too late.

114
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,711
The opportunity's long gone.

115
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,312
You were right.
Designer shit.

116
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,356
Came and went.

117
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:47,598
- I think he's sick.
- Bronchitis.

118
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,642
Every year, same shit.
You're overreacting.

119
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,006
Death comes for us all, huh?

120
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,210
But not yours, not today.

121
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:02,933
Hey...

122
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:05,375
...there's still hope
for your son.

123
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,419
Believe that.

124
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,707
You're not exactly
racking up allies.

125
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,389
It's cost of war.
Price of doing business.

126
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,674
No, fuck that.
We both buried on our side.

127
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,157
Who the fuck
you drop a rose for?

128
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,157
Why are you acting like

129
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,398
this the first time
you ever made a big play?

130
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,679
You need to back the fuck up.

131
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,521
Maybe you just
sat the fuck back,

132
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,563
inherited your
big brother's business

133
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,964
and acted like you
stacked chips.

134
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:36,326
Yo, that's the fuck enough.

135
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,128
No, this is
who the fuck we are!

136
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,809
We all went in there eyes open.

137
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,371
Maybe so,
but we've been talking.

138
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:42,892
Oh, that's some
funny shit right there,

139
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,134
'cause last time I checked,

140
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:46,696
we was all equal
on decisions or talking.

141
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:49,138
We don't have the appetite
for a long war with the Serbs.

142
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,300
We paid too high of a price.

143
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:51,581
They ain't here now!

144
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,625
<i>We got product,</i>

145
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:55,625
and now
we got they pipeline.

146
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,026
Look, we already voted,
so we gonna...

147
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,988
You know what?
I already know. Voted.

148
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,032
<i>You bad for business.</i>

149
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:05,396
A'ight?
Bad for the city.

150
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:08,119
So that's it?

151
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,480
That's it.

152
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,166
Tch. All right.

153
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,208
You know, I guess
honour amongst thieves

154
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,170
is short-lived, huh,
motherfucker?

155
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,773
To make you whole,
we'll buy the coke you got.

156
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,775
All of it.

157
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,817
A'ight.
Ten keys.

158
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,898
I want 38 apiece.

159
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,780
Get the fuck outta here.
Thirty.

160
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,824
Thirty-eight.
Deal.

161
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,464
Deal.

162
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,952
All right.
Deal.

163
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:43,912
Y'all like
the dynamic trio now?

164
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,154
- No.
- No, we're goin'

165
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,555
our separate ways.

166
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:48,277
We'll make arrangement
for the pickup.

167
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,561
Good, let's get this
the fuck over with.

168
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,692
It's not too late
to still make this work.

169
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,854
Too much heat
if we stay together.

170
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,136
Look, man,
you got a real shot

171
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,738
to be your own man on this one.

172
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,782
Not your old man.
Take it.

173
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:15,946
Trying.

174
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,667
Are we good no matter?

175
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:22,152
Long as your snow
don't blow south, we all good.

176
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:30,440
Got the city all cut up?

177
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:33,563
I thought I did.

178
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:37,285
Whatever mine stays mine.

179
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:39,329
Good luck moving your weight.

180
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,250
See you on the other side.

181
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,294
I'll be waitin'.

182
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,817
What'chu gonna do
with your half?

183
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,101
I'ma reinvest in Dahlia.

184
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:54,582
Something I should get down on?

185
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,224
You got a fresh
bullet hole in you

186
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,825
and you already talkin'
about making moves?

187
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,188
I ain't gonna
sit here licking my wounds

188
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,190
and miss an opportunity.

189
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:07,195
Don't fucking touch it.

190
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:08,716
If that shit get infected,

191
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,238
I ain't taking you
to the hospital

192
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,679
if the whole fuckin' arm
turn green.

193
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,161
At that point,
it'll probably just fall off

194
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:15,205
like some <i>barbacoa.</i>

195
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:19,167
Yeah.
Let's make this shit work.

196
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,449
You sure?

197
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,331
Ain't no guarantee return
on your investment.

198
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:25,375
Never is.

199
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,937
Dead money don't make money.

200
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:30,177
All right then.

201
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:33,180
<i>Here, keep that.
Rainy day fund.</i>

202
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:35,224
You invested.

203
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:43,350
<i>So how're we
gonna move Dahlia</i>

204
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:45,755
without people
finding out who we are?

205
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,518
We're gonna do locker drops.

206
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,401
Public lockers,
convention center,

207
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:56,123
people moving in and out,

208
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,845
easy to hide in plain sight.

209
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,207
It's a good system, central.

210
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,649
I been doin'
this shit forever.

211
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:05,094
Just feels kind of low rent.

212
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,455
Dahlia's fashionable.

213
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:10,697
We about selling drugs
or mu'fucking purses?

214
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:12,499
- This is high-end.
- <i>You know who go</i>

215
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,941
- <i>to conventions?</i>
- Who?

216
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,863
People with expense accounts
and money to burn.

217
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,905
Hedge fund guys, housewives,

218
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,627
and socialites just like you.

219
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:21,828
Point made.

220
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,070
The people I got in mind
for this distro

221
00:12:23,112 --> 00:12:24,671
is gonna get texts.

222
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,753
<i>We'll give 'em the time
and location for the invite.</i>

223
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:28,795
How can you be sure
no one will try and fuck us?

224
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:30,397
You can't.

225
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,319
But anybody
that fuck with protocol,

226
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,760
that's a wrap.

227
00:12:33,802 --> 00:12:35,924
One and done.
Ain't no second chances.

228
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,007
I've just got
one non-negotiable term.

229
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,210
Everything negotiable.

230
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:46,973
My family's distro
doesn't get near this.

231
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,976
I think Walter could handle
a little competition.

232
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,939
This stays off my father's
and my brother's radar.

233
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,581
Ain't gonna be
that way for long.

234
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,625
Long enough for it
to be my move.

235
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,826
All right, bet.

236
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:01,668
Until you wanna come out
into the light,

237
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,749
I'll run point.

238
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,711
Liliana could help.

239
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:07,075
- Who?
- Liliana... she good people.

240
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,557
She used to run for me.

241
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,078
She got worked over
by the Serbs.

242
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,682
She took a bullet
and she didn't break.

243
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:18,566
She never gave me up.

244
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:23,609
She had my back.
We need her.

245
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:25,974
My good friend
Reggie's already on board.

246
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:30,296
What the fuck is you
talking about already on board?

247
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:32,618
Don't nobody get to skip
to the front of the line.

248
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,380
We go way back.
I trust him.

249
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,902
Trust ain't even
in your vocabulary right now.

250
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:38,664
Oh, but you trust Liliana?

251
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:39,945
Yeah.
She different.

252
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,308
How is she different?

253
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,270
She ain't distro.

254
00:13:44,312 --> 00:13:46,192
She on our side, a hun'ed.

255
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:49,355
Everyone else we invite
gotta start at step one.

256
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:00,688
Hi, Da.

257
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,092
On my way.

258
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,377
Our patients cannot be
disturbed during the dialysis.

259
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,939
Then they should have chosen

260
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,661
a better fucking dialysis
centre that's not a front.

261
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:17,102
Fuck you.
This is a legit business.

262
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:18,584
You've said that.

263
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,465
All you need to do
is produce a shipping manifest.

264
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:21,827
Do you think
I'm stupid enough

265
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:23,348
to bring something
illegal here?

266
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,751
Al Capone went away
for tax evasion, motherfucker.

267
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:28,075
That's a fascinating
little bit of information.

268
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,236
Get the fuck out my way.

269
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,250
Fuck.

270
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,697
Still waiting on
them documents, Mr. Flynn.

271
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:56,141
And I'm waiting
on due fucking notice.

272
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:58,463
But here you fucking are.

273
00:14:58,505 --> 00:14:59,824
Time's running out.

274
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,826
You need to produce
the proper paperwork.

275
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,788
I fuckin' heard you!

276
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,832
Hello.

277
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,397
- Where have you been?
- Running errands.

278
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:12,959
It'll just be a minute.

279
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,687
Are you mad I wasn't here

280
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,731
or because you don't know
how to do what I do?

281
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:27,453
Both.

282
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,897
Okay, here's
the receipts and freight bill

283
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:35,261
for every pill and dropper
to come through these doors.

284
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,905
Would you like duplicates?

285
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:41,986
Matches up.

286
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,347
This time.

287
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,349
Good.
Now take it, file it,

288
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,111
and please... get the fuck out.

289
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:49,874
And if you wanna try
and build a case against me,

290
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,679
next time bring some
fuckin' evidence to the table.

291
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,124
We're all set here.

292
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:09,175
This today
is why you're not ready.

293
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,096
I've had the Feds here

294
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,700
<i>and you are
nowhere to be found.</i>

295
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,343
You say you wanna step up?

296
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:24,228
That-that-that's fucking great.

297
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,192
So step the fuck up.

298
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,878
I ain't gonna lie, bro.

299
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,520
It took you a little minute,

300
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,362
but you finally got
your head right.

301
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:40,243
Look, the only thing
that nigga Tommy ever brought

302
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,205
was bullshit.
Come on.

303
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:44,968
Tommy's also the one who opened
up the Serb's pipeline.

304
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,531
Whatever, and got E killed
in the process... come on.

305
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,412
We knew the risk.
We knew what was at stake.

306
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:51,334
Nah, look, look, come on,
big bro, listen to me.

307
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,496
I know you got a soft spot
for white boys, all right?

308
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,619
- Ah... I know.
- Okay, all right.

309
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:57,580
But now that we got
this shit on lock,

310
00:16:57,622 --> 00:17:00,503
we gotta make a move, man.
We gotta make it quick.

311
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:03,306
<i>Okay?</i>
Now the Serbs are gone, but...

312
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:05,308
Mirkovic's gonna circle back.

313
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,590
- Bet.
- <i>I'm talking about</i>

314
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:09,512
with both hands out
and stuff.

315
00:17:09,554 --> 00:17:10,753
Gun in one hand,

316
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:12,395
looking to get paid
in the other.

317
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:15,440
Mm-hmm. And shit,
we can't go at 'em again.

318
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,842
That play already been called.

319
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,363
<i>That's what I say we do:</i>

320
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,565
take 10% of everything
we make

321
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,327
and we put that shit
in the escrow account, nigga,

322
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,529
for them...
we don't touch it.

323
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:28,691
As a insurance.

324
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:31,654
Yup, you pretend that
money ain't even there, bro.

325
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:33,055
The shit gone.
It ain't ours.

326
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:36,299
That's all Serb cash for
whenever they come back.

327
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,501
So when Mirkovic pulls up,

328
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:39,582
we pay him his tax.

329
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,864
And we ain't got no problems.

330
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,269
See, now you thinkin'.

331
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:46,068
Come through, baby bro.

332
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,311
Come on, man,
I'm telling you, a'ight?

333
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:50,272
<i>Look, me and you, D,</i>

334
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,877
we got this, a'ight?

335
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:55,478
CBI is everything, bro.

336
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,282
<i>We don't need nobody else.</i>

337
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:02,567
Walter.

338
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:06,248
Walter!

339
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,175
What the fuck happened?

340
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:21,065
Fuck off.

341
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,226
What the fuck happened,
Walter?

342
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:27,031
I didn't eat fuck
all the day, then...

343
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:28,951
I don't know.
Head spins.

344
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:30,913
Lightheaded,
fell on my fuckin' arse.

345
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:32,957
Your head's bleeding.

346
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,561
Get me a fucking bandage.

347
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:41,803
You should see a doctor,
Walter... don't fuck around.

348
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:44,086
Fuck, it's a bit o' blood!

349
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,048
I ain't talkin'
about your head,

350
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,092
you stubborn prick.

351
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,614
You think you can
hide this from me?

352
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,377
I see everything.

353
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,019
You gotta let the kids know.

354
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,823
It ain't right to let them
go through this twice.

355
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,187
You shut the fuck up.

356
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:15,959
Everything that you
fuckin' see here

357
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,242
isn't fuckin' real.

358
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,618
What's cracking, bro?

359
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,100
Look, I got a job for you.

360
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,742
Speak.

361
00:19:40,784 --> 00:19:42,785
It's about that nigga Tommy.

362
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:44,585
Who?

363
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:46,427
The white motherfucker
from the barber shop.

364
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:49,310
Oh, okay.
What you need?

365
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,354
I need you to take
this five for now.

366
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,514
A nickel?

367
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:55,196
Get the fuck
outta here, nigga.

368
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:57,478
Y'all ain't finna catch a body
for no less than a dime.

369
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,323
No, no, no.
No guns.

370
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:02,002
Not yet.

371
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,524
I just want you to watch
the motherfucker,

372
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,446
then report back...
that's it.

373
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,208
So you want me
to babysit this motherfucker?

374
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,049
For five thousand dollars,
you the highest paid babysitter

375
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,691
in Chicago, motherfucker.

376
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,213
You want the job or not?
I ain't got time

377
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,535
- for this shit for real.
- Hell yeah.

378
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:15,696
Fuck.

379
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,137
Just do what I said, man,
a'ight?

380
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:18,819
Gather the information,
report back.

381
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,661
If you can't do that,
just run me my shit.

382
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:22,142
Hey, all right,
all right, chill.

383
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:24,347
Look, I ain't say
I wasn't gonna do it,

384
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:29,432
but if you change your mind,
I'm gonna want that other five.

385
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:31,231
Hmm.

386
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,833
Yeah, I hear you.

387
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,877
- All right.
- All right.

388
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:55,695
<i>You sure this is
the best place to launch?</i>

389
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,538
Don't worry.
Being poor ain't contagious.

390
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,180
Don't be an asshole.

391
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:01,621
Be honest with me.

392
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:03,423
You ever take public
transportation in your life?

393
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:05,265
Like a bus or a train?

394
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,227
- No, no, cabs don't count.
- Wow.

395
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:09,950
Life musta looked
real nice from that backseat.

396
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:11,431
You know, I don't think
this will help my case,

397
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:13,994
but I did backpack
through Europe when I was 17.

398
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:16,278
Took the Eurorail every day.

399
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:18,478
That shit go that far?

400
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,080
I thought it only went
through the what's its name?

401
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:21,040
Disney World.

402
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:23,525
That's a monorail.
Jesus.

403
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:25,565
Well,
I ain't never been there.

404
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:28,368
Eh...
you'd like it.

405
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,129
The song "It's A Small World"
fucks with your brain

406
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:31,411
and stays with you forever.

407
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:33,815
Oh, literally
the worst song ever.

408
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,936
Hey, what's up
with the guy in the khakis?

409
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:39,178
You're describing
like 60% of the people.

410
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,222
No, the cargo pants.
Three o'clock.

411
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,302
Rent-A-Cop
flirting with the girl

412
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,104
by the north elevator.

413
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:47,148
Hang on, hang on.

414
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:49,549
Yeah, no,
he-he don't work here.

415
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,110
Turn back to the left.

416
00:21:51,152 --> 00:21:53,633
What's up with old boy
that's at the nest?

417
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:55,034
<i>He just grabbed
a cup of coffee.</i>

418
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:56,355
He checking in or out?

419
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:59,639
In.
He's on his way to his post.

420
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:03,364
Cops are present...
but minimal.

421
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:07,288
Cameras avoidable.

422
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:10,491
Lockers are prime
and accessible.

423
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,894
You see that shit?
That's what I'm talking about.

424
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,535
Anybody could walk
through there,

425
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:19,338
connect, distro, or a drop.

426
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,140
Yeah.
Liliana can walk through there.

427
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:23,622
I can walk through there.
You?

428
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:25,744
You're the poster boy
for New York drug dealers.

429
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:27,987
The fuck you know about me?

430
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:34,652
Officers.

431
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:36,855
Got any good
crypto tips for us?

432
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:39,099
Early retirement
would be great.

433
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,260
You know, as bizarre
as it's gonna sound,

434
00:23:42,302 --> 00:23:44,822
I like my cash
the old-fashioned way...

435
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:47,545
made of paper and under my bed.
Have a good day.

436
00:23:57,557 --> 00:24:00,117
What am I
the poster boy of now?

437
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,600
I used to do some missions
in suits back in the day,

438
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,523
throw 'em off my scent.
I clean up real nice.

439
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:08,286
Okay.
You look fucking good.

440
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:09,647
And my partner back
in New York,

441
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:11,931
he used to rock
these custom cuts every day.

442
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:15,172
Well, I hope some of whatever
he had rubbed off on you.

443
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,577
Yeah. I hope
some of it did too.

444
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:25,422
So what do we know
about these Serbs?

445
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,384
Lotta talk.

446
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,548
No one wants to
claim the hits yet.

447
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,392
Soon as the smoke clears,
names'll start dropping.

448
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:37,074
Better names
than more bodies.

449
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:40,197
They ain't gonna be
mutually exclusive.

450
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:51,248
Yeah, I could do that.

451
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,696
<i>Gimme a hour.</i>

452
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,751
<i>Oye.</i>

453
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:59,758
Hey, you got any latkes
in that bag, Moishe?

454
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,159
It's the wrong time of year.

455
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,280
You know, I like the ones

456
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:06,202
with the little carrots
in them.

457
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:08,444
Oh no, no.
That's not a latke.

458
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,046
That's garbage.

459
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:13,531
Potato, onion... anything else
might as well be a frittata.

460
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,095
I assume that's for me?

461
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:18,214
Yep.

462
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:19,655
What is it?

463
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:22,138
Something from a new
friend you're gonna like.

464
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,540
An early Hanukkah present.

465
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,782
Oh, again,
<i>shayne punim,</i>

466
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:28,504
wrong time of the year.

467
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,588
Never the wrong time
for this, Moishe.

468
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,952
Okay.

469
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:05,981
Who the fuck
keeps blowing you up?

470
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:08,583
Reggie.
He wants a re-up.

471
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,225
<i>No.</i>

472
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,147
Ain't nobody getting shit
'til we get set up.

473
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:15,032
- Put him back.
- He can be a distro for us.

474
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:17,232
He move real weight?

475
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:18,954
No, but he has connections.

476
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:20,395
Then he's a customer.

477
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:22,157
- And these people you got?
- Hitters.

478
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:24,159
How do you know that?

479
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:25,841
Because this is what I do.

480
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:28,603
This is all I ever been about.
I can read people.

481
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:30,445
I know within like 15 seconds
of meeting somebody

482
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:31,927
if I'm gonna fuck
with them or not.

483
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:33,288
You knew that about me?

484
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,332
I knew it in 10.

485
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:38,533
Don't let that shit
go to your head.

486
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,935
But yeah.
Fuck Reggie.

487
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:42,979
He ain't getting shit.
Ghost him.

488
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:21,057
Oh, shit.

489
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,903
This gonna be fire.

490
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,748
Fuck me.

491
00:28:32,949 --> 00:28:34,951
Are you kidding?

492
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:54,088
I know who you are.

493
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,610
What, are you
fucking traffic cops now too?

494
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,412
Oh, take it easy, Paulie.

495
00:28:58,454 --> 00:28:59,653
This doesn't have
to be contentious.

496
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,095
Don't it?

497
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:02,576
You still got some runway.

498
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,618
You can play ball.
Make things easy on yourself.

499
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,939
Your lips keep movin',

500
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:07,901
but all I'm hearing
is fucking bullshit.

501
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:10,025
How long you gonna cover
for your brother-in-law?

502
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,065
You got nothing on him.

503
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:13,827
We got 26 years
of shit on you.

504
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,869
What makes you think
if Walter goes down,

505
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:17,230
he's not dragging you
with him?

506
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:22,157
That motherfucker floats.

507
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,679
You need a big fucking torpedo
to sink him.

508
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:27,723
And it ain't gonna be me.

509
00:29:39,975 --> 00:29:42,095
Where the fuck
was your sister today?

510
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:45,260
How should I know?
What happened to your head?

511
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:48,063
Got fucked with
by a kitchen cabinet.

512
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:53,266
I need you to find out
what your sister's been doing.

513
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:54,988
Not my job.

514
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,831
So are we gonna do Sunday
dinner here or at Claud's?

515
00:29:57,873 --> 00:30:00,073
What the fuck has dinner

516
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:02,717
got to do
with this conversation?

517
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:05,638
I need you to find out

518
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,042
what your sister
was up to today.

519
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,166
Dad, I'm bringing Gloria
to Sunday dinner.

520
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:14,127
Well, son,

521
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:15,808
I don't think
that's a great idea.

522
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,533
You see, Sunday dinners
are for family only,

523
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:22,895
always has been, always will.

524
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:24,777
<i>She's not welcome.</i>

525
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:28,142
She does not have a seat
at our table.

526
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:33,828
Let's make sure we have
an extra place set.

527
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,076
One, two, three.

528
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:46,799
<i>Oh, okay.
Grab the plug, unplug it.</i>

529
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:48,000
I got it.

530
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,081
- <i>You got it?</i>
- Got it.

531
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:50,122
<i>How about the gas?</i>

532
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:51,604
Yeah, no, the gas is off.

533
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:54,046
- Gas is off? All right.
- Gas is off.

534
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,768
All right, get behind.
Can you get behind?

535
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,129
Oh, yeah.
There we go.

536
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:59,173
That's it,
one more push.

537
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:04,616
Whoo.

538
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:07,900
Man.
Thanks for the assist.

539
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:09,902
- Yeah, no problem.
- You want a beer?

540
00:31:09,944 --> 00:31:11,946
Uh, yeah, sure.

541
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:15,509
Here you go.

542
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,589
Thank you.

543
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:19,711
You're welcome.

544
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,835
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

545
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,078
Yo, JP.

546
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,239
- What up?
- <i>This may not be</i>

547
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:28,640
<i>none of my business</i>

548
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:30,602
<i>so you could tell me
to fuck off, but...</i>

549
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:33,725
how the fuck did you
get so far in over your head?

550
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,531
Look, the shit started slow.

551
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:42,254
Custody lawyers,
private investigators,

552
00:31:42,296 --> 00:31:46,057
uh, the club,
medical for my old man.

553
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:47,619
That'll do it.

554
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:49,581
<i>The hole just kept
getting deeper.</i>

555
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,783
<i>I couldn't dig myself out
fast enough.</i>

556
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,827
Never made enough to keep up.

557
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:56,628
Now, you can tell me
to fuck off...

558
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,309
Fuck off.

559
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,552
But how you rolling
so deep?

560
00:32:00,594 --> 00:32:02,474
Yo, come on, man.

561
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:05,278
I done told you
I was a businessman.

562
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:09,561
Fuck this.

563
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:11,322
I'm trying to have
a real moment with you.

564
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,884
We're having
a real moment.

565
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:14,966
No, you blowing rainbows
and sunshine up my ass.

566
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:17,010
Well, you can't have
one without the other.

567
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:19,771
What the fuck?

568
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,815
I'm trying to keep it
a buck, motherfucker.

569
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:23,975
The fuck are you into, Tommy?

570
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:26,177
Why are you asking a question
you know the answer to?

571
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:27,899
For some fucking peace
of mind bullshit?

572
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:29,901
No, I just been fed
so many lies with this family.

573
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:32,663
I just want
one goddamn truth.

574
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:34,665
Well, if I tell you,
is that gonna change anything?

575
00:32:34,707 --> 00:32:36,709
No.

576
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:40,153
I'm a drug dealer.

577
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:42,713
How long?

578
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:44,275
My whole life.
Well, not my whole life.

579
00:32:44,317 --> 00:32:46,477
I mean, I started out
slingin' pantyhose

580
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,159
and socks on the corner,

581
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:49,640
but I mean,
I always been a hustler.

582
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:51,482
You know, when things
got real tight,

583
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:52,803
- I used to move...
- Oh, no, fuck that,

584
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,485
fuck that, and fuck you

585
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,607
if you think
we're gonna get close on this.

586
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,369
Just 'cause you moved some weed

587
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,570
'cause you thought
it was cool...

588
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:00,931
Oh no, no.
It wasn't just weed.

589
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,413
Or whatever.
I don't give a fuck

590
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:04,775
if you was the Tony Montana
of the Midwest,

591
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,216
you ain't getting
near this shit.

592
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:08,581
You ain't getting near my shit.
Never.

593
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:11,702
I just need to catch
a motherfucking break, man.

594
00:33:11,744 --> 00:33:13,183
Well, it ain't gonna be
with this.

595
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,385
You heard me?

596
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,987
I'll keep helping you out.

597
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,552
Honestly, I-I don't need
no more fuckin' charity.

598
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:22,474
I need to start
making some bread.

599
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,523
<i>Shit, this Serb pipeline</i>

600
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:34,925
<i>like the Yellow Brick Road,
nigga.</i>

601
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,326
<i>We printing money.</i>

602
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:38,048
<i>It's flowing right now,</i>

603
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,732
<i>but we need to lock it down</i>
before Mirkovic comes callin'.

604
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,133
Yeah, you know, we never
really got to get down

605
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:45,177
together like this.

606
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:47,537
This shit feel
full circle though.

607
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:49,860
<i>I told you, bro,
me and you together,</i>

608
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,823
<i>unstoppable.
CBI gonna run this city.</i>

609
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,508
How you know
I'd be able to pull it off?

610
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,111
I was only 18 when you went in.

611
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:02,672
I ain't know shit.

612
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:04,474
Didn't have no real skin
in the game... none.

613
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:06,518
<i>I knew
you could hold it down.</i>

614
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,402
How?

615
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,924
Why you ask so many
damn questions right now?

616
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:14,884
I don't know.

617
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,928
'Cause I ain't never
asked before, shit.

618
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,731
I'm just saying like I was
on my way to the Ivy league,

619
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,653
my nigga,
I'm talking about sweater vests

620
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,615
and all that fly shit.
Come on, man.

621
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:27,096
Get the fuck outta here.

622
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:28,818
You wasn't gonna go
full Carlton.

623
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,460
<i>Nah, nah, you right.</i>

624
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:33,623
<i>I was gonna be decent though.
I don't know.</i>

625
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:35,827
I guess what I'm trying
to say is, shit...

626
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:40,149
There was other niggas in CBI

627
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,433
who actually had seniority.

628
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:45,516
Coulda passed the torch to them.

629
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,359
Yeah, but none of 'em
had what you did.

630
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,043
What's that?

631
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:55,767
My blood.

632
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:59,650
Yeah.
Think we good.

633
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:07,096
Reggie's my friend, Tommy.

634
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,497
Yeah, when you got
a product this good,

635
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,821
you ain't got no friends,
only competition.

636
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:13,502
Okay, well, no offence,
Liliana, you're great,

637
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,385
but she has two feet in already
and I took your word for it.

638
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:18,067
She got skin in the game.

639
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:19,908
- I brought the connect.
- And we both dropping

640
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,952
six figures towards production.

641
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,553
If Reggie know you,
then he know me.

642
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:27,596
And that's a problem.
Trust me on that.

643
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:29,518
We all bringing
something to the party

644
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,759
so we could stay.

645
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:32,843
We don't want nothing...

646
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:37,007
We don't want nothin'
fucking it up.

647
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,970
Get a fuckin' burner.
Bring legit distro.

648
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:45,293
And now, let's go get
that fuckin' cook.

649
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:57,786
Fuck!

650
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:59,830
Hi, Doc.

651
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:06,234
Hey, bro, I don't want
that gig no more, fam.

652
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:08,436
Hey, what the fuck do you mean
you don't want the gig no more?

653
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:10,318
I mean you can keep
the cash and shit,

654
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,000
but I ain't doing it no more,
a'ight?

655
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:14,362
Find someone else
for the job or something.

656
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:15,844
Nah, hold up, nigga.
What the fuck got you so shook?

657
00:36:15,886 --> 00:36:18,568
Find someone else for the job.

658
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,861
I can't go into details,

659
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:36,064
but I am putting distance
between me and my father.

660
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:37,505
I also told him

661
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:40,668
that you're coming to dinner
on Sunday night.

662
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,390
I'm listening.

663
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:44,472
I'm making my own moves.

664
00:36:44,514 --> 00:36:46,914
I don't wanna lose any
more time with this bullshit.

665
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,837
Being with you again felt...

666
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,158
Absolutely right?

667
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,202
Yeah.

668
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:58,566
So what is next?

669
00:36:58,608 --> 00:37:00,610
Whatever we want it to be.

670
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:21,308
Hey, you good?
You good?

671
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,629
Look at me, Gloria.
Look at me.

672
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:24,754
We're okay.
We're okay.

673
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:41,688
You're in my booth.

674
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,971
I don't see your name on it.

675
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:46,015
Look up.

676
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:52,139
- Impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:53,460
Could have been
the next Tyson.

678
00:37:53,502 --> 00:37:55,542
No shit.

679
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,984
I mean, that's not
really a selling point.

680
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,866
Well, it was
a long time ago.

681
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:01,788
You know, it seems like
only yesterday

682
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,231
we saw him beat the shit
out of this Dago...

683
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:06,275
- Goodbye, Rick.
- Heck...

684
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:17,283
"My punches are just
as hard in Chicago

685
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:19,125
as in New York."

686
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:22,128
Sonny Liston.

687
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,010
Are you a fight fan?

688
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,494
Nope.
Just that fight.

689
00:38:30,298 --> 00:38:31,938
What...
you just gonna stand there,

690
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,982
or do you wanna join me
in your booth?

691
00:38:44,512 --> 00:38:46,873
Breakfast for dinner.

692
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:49,355
No, it's actually
breakfast for breakfast.

693
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:51,399
My day's just getting started.

694
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,679
So you a night owl?

695
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:56,282
<i>Yeah.
You?</i>

696
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:58,684
<i>I've been having
trouble sleeping.</i>

697
00:38:58,726 --> 00:38:59,926
New mattress.

698
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:01,969
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

699
00:39:06,214 --> 00:39:07,613
You wanna... do you want a bite

700
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:09,455
or are you
just gonna eye-eat it?

701
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:14,180
My bad.

702
00:39:14,222 --> 00:39:17,983
It's just that Rick stole
my grandma's potato recipe.

703
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:20,105
I didn't steal shit.

704
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:23,349
She gave it to me...
after I gave it to her.

705
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:25,230
Coulda been
your goddamn granddaddy.

706
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,796
I'm sorry about him.

707
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,282
Well, then you, uh, better not
go against your grandma.

708
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,533
Mmm.

709
00:39:48,575 --> 00:39:50,295
Hmm.

710
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,337
- Mmm!
- Yeah?

711
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,819
Well?

712
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:58,303
- Well, Rick's is good...
- Mm-hmm?

713
00:39:58,345 --> 00:40:00,866
...but Grandma holds the belt.

714
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,788
Yeah.

715
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,709
Mmm.

716
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:06,753
I'm Adrienne.

717
00:40:08,395 --> 00:40:10,397
Diamond.

718
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,121
Nice to meet you, Adrienne.

719
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:17,162
It's nice to be met.

720
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,241
You going to cum for me?
Yeah.

721
00:41:37,283 --> 00:41:40,684
Oh, yeah.
Give it to me, give it to me.

722
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,966
Yeah.

723
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:21,244
You, um,
really put in the work.

724
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:29,773
Well, to be honest,
it's been a minute,

725
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:33,656
and I wasn't sure
what I was gonna bring.

726
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:35,498
Come on.

727
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,820
Men always say that
when they think

728
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:39,062
they want us to feel special.

729
00:42:39,104 --> 00:42:41,346
I mean, did you feel special?

730
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:46,071
I did.

731
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,193
Good.

732
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,726
I...
I gotta go meet someone.

733
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,290
Okay, cool.

734
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:13,778
It's work-related.

735
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:17,161
Look at all this shit
and them lucky things.

736
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:19,843
So is all this shit paid for?

737
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:22,083
Yeah, Mai owned it.

738
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,166
Outright?

739
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,408
Free and clear.

740
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,969
Got a lot of shit stacked here.

741
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:30,093
You got everything you need
to start cooking?

742
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:34,257
Uh, we'll need
some... supplies.

743
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:38,822
It's okay.
You ain't gotta be nervous.

744
00:44:39,663 --> 00:44:43,264
You already produced,
and anything that you need,

745
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,066
we gonna get for you.

746
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:46,468
It's just that I didn't think

747
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,309
that this was going
to be an ongoing...

748
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:50,512
Opportunity.

749
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:53,036
Um, I'm not a drug dealer.

750
00:44:53,476 --> 00:44:55,478
Well, good thing for you I am.

751
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,377
What the fuck?

752
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,520
Que pasa?

753
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:21,523
Soto's all the way in.

754
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,044
- Never had a doubt.
- Get everything we need?

755
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:26,088
Yeah.

756
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,129
All right.
You really think Claudia's

757
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:30,690
got the rhino skin for this?

758
00:46:30,732 --> 00:46:32,734
Yeah, I do.

759
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:34,814
Ain't nobody ever gave
her a shot before.

760
00:46:34,856 --> 00:46:38,300
She been waiting for this.
What about the cook?

761
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:41,101
Eh, she cool.

762
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:42,862
She still
in the fucking bathroom?

763
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:44,584
Yeah, she got
a little nervous.

764
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:45,825
Ay-ay-yi.

765
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:47,187
I mean, whatever
you got on her

766
00:46:47,229 --> 00:46:49,069
shook her to the bones.

767
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:50,910
All right.
If Claudia don't have that...

768
00:46:50,952 --> 00:46:52,954
We ain't there yet.

769
00:46:57,198 --> 00:46:59,200
Go check on her.

770
00:47:56,937 --> 00:47:59,218
You all right there, boy?

771
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,500
<i>Someone tried
to take me out.</i>

772
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:03,864
What the fuck?
What?

773
00:48:05,306 --> 00:48:07,146
Is it one of them
Spooks at CBI?

774
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:08,787
I guarantee it was one
of those motherfuckers.

775
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,672
The shooter was white.
White as fuck.

776
00:48:13,634 --> 00:48:16,955
If I had to put money
on it...

777
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,757
I'd say it was the Serbs.

778
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:20,719
Wait a minute, why the-
why the fuck

779
00:48:20,761 --> 00:48:22,763
would the Serbs
try to take you out?

780
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:29,089
That fucking Tommy Egan.
That fucking cocksucker.

781
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,612
You make a move with him?

782
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:35,936
You fucking dumb
son of a bitch.

783
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:37,736
When are you gonna
get it through

784
00:48:37,778 --> 00:48:39,900
your thick fucking skull?

785
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,583
Jesus fucking Christ,
between you and your sister,

786
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:47,465
<i>all I do is run interference</i>

787
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,509
twenty-four fucking seven.

788
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,039
Oh.

789
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:02,600
Hi.

790
00:49:02,642 --> 00:49:04,002
Two nights in a row?

791
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:06,046
<i>I must be doing
something right.</i>

792
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:09,689
Hmm.
What you got in the bag?

793
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:15,613
Oh, we got pancakes,
waffles, bacon, French toast.

794
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,657
You know, breakfast for dinner.

795
00:49:18,098 --> 00:49:21,661
Hmm, that sounds
like a lot of food.

796
00:49:22,822 --> 00:49:24,824
Well, I got some extra.

797
00:49:25,585 --> 00:49:28,428
How do you feel about
breakfast for breakfast?

798
00:49:46,926 --> 00:49:48,365
<i>Que paso, huh?</i>

799
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:50,968
<i>Where's my drugs, puta?</i>

800
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:54,732
You thought I was some sort
of a westside piece of shit

801
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:58,778
whose-whose calls
you don't gotta return, huh?

802
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:01,138
- Been busy.
- Oh, yeah?

803
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,539
Yeah.
Figuring some shit out.

804
00:50:02,581 --> 00:50:04,662
- Me too.
- Mm.

805
00:50:09,228 --> 00:50:12,992
Huh?
We was familia.

806
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:14,671
Okay?

807
00:50:18,117 --> 00:50:21,718
I'm going to miss you,
huh, hermanita.

808
00:50:27,246 --> 00:50:29,126
Aah! Aah... aah...

809
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:33,052
You blinded me, puta.
Aah, you fucking blinded me.

810
00:50:34,413 --> 00:50:36,415
Almost.

811
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,792
This is who we are.

812
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:56,515
And this is what we do.

813
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,101
You bunch of cunts.

814
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,152
You fucker...

815
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:38,915
...you tell Mirkovic he comes
after my boy and my family,

816
00:51:38,957 --> 00:51:41,837
I'll burn this fucking city
to the ground

817
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:44,600
and I'll kill
every motherfuckin' cunt

818
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:46,644
that he's ever loved.

819
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:51,369
Second thought,
she can tell him.

820
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,068
- <i>Pow!</i>
- <i>What!</i>

821
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,830
<i>Body!</i>
