Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,305
Alright, 640, you're out.

3
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:16,307
Come on. Let's go.

4
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:20,894
Let's go!

5
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,414
Walk.

6
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,306
Pod 640.

7
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:05,022
 Move.

8
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:42,644
 Is that it?

9
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,853
Uh, yes, I think so.

10
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,980
- Yes, or you think so?
- Uh, yes.

11
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,900
Your balance is 345...

12
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,983
Oh, sorry. Thank you.

13
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,656
How could you do that to
me? You just fucked me!

14
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,721
Motherfucker!

15
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,519
I'll kill you!

16
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,063
I'll fucking kill you!

17
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,069
Michael Peterson 640.

18
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,859
You know why he
jacked you up, right?

19
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,403
No.

20
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,822
He was waiting on a single
cell for five years.

21
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,908
Was next on the list,
and they gave it to you

22
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,284
because you're famous.

23
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,244
Bell.

24
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,412
Lock-in time!

25
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,872
See you around, Staircase.

26
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,251
Close her.

27
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,896
Sophie Dear Michael,

28
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,731
an old friend visited last week

29
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,275
dying to see the Louvre.

30
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,152
Walking through the
museum reminded me

31
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,738
that you don't have
the luxury of relaxing

32
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,990
while you wait for your appeal.

33
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,117
Our deadline is tight.

34
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,870
Trust that we are
working as fast as we can

35
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,665
to get your story in
front of the world

36
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,834
and finally get you the
trial you so deserve.

37
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,590
In the meantime, you
said the prison library

38
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,800
wasn't stimulating.

39
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,428
So here's a little something
to get your brain working.

40
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,806
Fondly, Sophie.

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Café?

42
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,220
Just look at my
fucking face, David.

43
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,346
David I hear you, Mike, I...

44
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,080
- No, I, I don't...
- I hear you.

45
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,432
I don't need you
to hear anything.

46
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:55,957
I just need you to look at it.

47
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,291
The longer I'm in here,

48
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,335
the more likely it is
I'm going to get killed.

49
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,239
When will we know
about our appeal?

50
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,799
Mike, you know I don't know.

51
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,008
It could be tomorrow.

52
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,303
It could be three months.

53
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,264
So, three months.
Th-that-that's how long

54
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,390
I've got to survive?

55
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,058
Uh...

56
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,036
I'd be shocked if it went
longer than that. Sure.

57
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,353
I-I-I'm not supposed to be here.

58
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,314
I mean, th-this wasn't
supposed to happen.

59
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,983
This, this wasn't
supposed to be.

60
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,111
Mike, I know. I know.

61
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,158
Bill Our appeal
contests the seizure

62
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,492
of Michael's computer.

63
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,370
It was unconstitutional.

64
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,831
Without that, the State
would have no grounds

65
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,375
to bring in the emails,
the, the escorts.

66
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,565
Oh yeah. We're, we're
quite confident.

67
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,841
Yeah.

68
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,092
Of course, you can quote me.

69
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:48,968
I hope you'll quote me.

70
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,012
That's, that's why
I called you back.

71
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,431
- Sell.
- The whole set?

72
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,393
Mom loved them.

73
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,527
How's work?

74
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,071
What do those movie
people have you doing?

75
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,257
You know, just
entry-level stuff,

76
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,367
answering calls, scheduling.

77
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,536
But they, uh, they
hired their last editor

78
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,704
out of admin, so...

79
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,039
Hmm.

80
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,122
Clayton You like LA?

81
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,124
Margaret It's fine.

82
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,212
The people are nicer
than you think.

83
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,715
Reno's just a day away from you.

84
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,759
Martha, too.

85
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,345
You're welcome any time
you guys need a break.

86
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,989
Not sure Martha's boss would
let her have a day off.

87
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,973
Where's she at now?

88
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,475
Some customer service thing.

89
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,398
-What?

90
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,067
Martha's not really...

91
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,390
- Service oriented.
- Pleasant.

92
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,071
- She's...
- Todd Hey, hey.

93
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,490
- Hey!
- Clayton/Hey!

94
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,573
You made it.

95
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,285
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

96
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,913
Hey.

97
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,196
Come on, sit
down. Food's warm.

98
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,833
Great.

99
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,811
I'm gonna go pour myself a
beer. Does anyone want one?

100
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,878
I don't think we have any.

101
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,837
I brought some.

102
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

103
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,837
I'm making pasta. You want in?

104
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,932
I just quit my job.

105
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,016
Oh shit.

106
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,811
What happened?

107
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:26,232
Nothing. I just didn't really
want to be there anymore.

108
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,110
- You okay?
- Sure.

109
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,207
Oh, merde.

110
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,374
Hey, yo, Staircase!

111
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,935
I ain't fucking done
with you, you hear?

112
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,169
You hear me, yeah? I ain't
fucking done with you.

113
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,773
- Corrections officer: Sit down!
- I ain't fucking done with you.

114
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,882
-Sit down!

115
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,966
Take it to your table.

116
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,389
Dear Michael,

117
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,183
I was so happy to
receive your last letter.

118
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,893
As I read it, I could
hear your voice,

119
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,287
which I have become
so familiar with

120
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,855
over the past year.

121
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,566
Which is strange,
since you have no idea

122
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,569
what I look like or sound like.

123
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,988
What do you hear when
you read my letters?

124
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,741
Brigitte Bardot or Pepe Le Pew?

125
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,744
Yes, the documentary is going
well, thank you for asking.

126
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,955
I'm working day and
night to get it finished,

127
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,374
and I remain convinced that
once the world sees it,

128
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,626
it will help your appeal.

129
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,553
You gonna stab me with
that pen, Staircase?

130
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,409
I was thinking I
could just off myself.

131
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,435
Boom, boom, boom.

132
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,518
What do you think?

133
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,226
They'd make me clean it up.

134
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,154
You know about stamps, right?

135
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,198
They're better than money.

136
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,619
Bring 50 "37s" to the yard,

137
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,579
and we'll take care of
your problem for you.

138
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,832
Or don't. Up to you.

139
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,358
Sorry about the
election, Michael.

140
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,484
You know I voted for you.

141
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,610
Oh, you were the one?

142
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,050
I'm so fucking
disappointed in you.

143
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,386
I can't believe
you opened my mail.

144
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,221
My house, my mail.

145
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,390
And don't change the
subject. This is serious.

146
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,350
Tulane is going to take
your scholarship away.

147
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,476
Well, I'm sorry.

148
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,185
Look, Dad, I'm just,

149
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,853
I'm struggling at the moment.

150
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,231
Yeah, well, sorry
doesn't cut it, missy!

151
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,192
These grades are, are laughable!

152
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,253
What the fuck are you doing down
there in New Orleans anyway?

153
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,154
- Trying to get the most beads?
- Gross. No.

154
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,239
Look, Dad, I really,

155
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,742
I really feel like there's
something wrong with me.

156
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,661
I've, I've always had issues.

157
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,514
My, my friends think that I
have a learning disability...

158
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,789
Margie the Martyr.

159
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,667
That's just medical
jargon for lazy,

160
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,794
which I agree
you've always been.

161
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,588
Why are you being so awful?

162
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,608
-I'm going to call Mom. I don't...
-Go right ahead.

163
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,026
Kathleen and I are
on the same page.

164
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,468
And guess what?

165
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,904
We're not paying for
your plane ticket home

166
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,012
for Thanksgiving.

167
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,848
Dad, stop.

168
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,492
We need to start saving
money for when they drop

169
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,225
your financial aid.

170
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,018
Are you kidding me?

171
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,482
I hate him.

172
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,358
What did you do this time?

173
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,694
I'm not going home
for Thanksgiving.

174
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,130
He's not getting
me my plane ticket.

175
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,154
Shit.

176
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,906
Was he, like, normal dad angry

177
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,617
or was it like
spring break angry?

178
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,578
I don't know. I
don't know. He was...

179
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,788
something.

180
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,914
Well, if you're not going,

181
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,833
I'm staying in San Francisco.

182
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,070
Bill, Bill, we
need to be patient.

183
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,240
The appellate court has
had it for months now.

184
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,076
Look, it's, it's all about

185
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,996
how many appeals were
filed ahead of yours.

186
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,374
Do you think that
there's any chance

187
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,668
that we could expedite
with an oral argument?

188
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,921
Our case is strong.
You said so yourself.

189
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,982
Just sit tight. This is going to
be in the rearview in no time.

190
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,008
I need to get back to the kids.

191
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,344
Okay. How are they doing?

192
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,513
You know, their
60-year-old father

193
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,515
was just brutally
assaulted by a meth head

194
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,159
and thrown into solitary
confinement for a week.

195
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,059
How do you think they're doing?

196
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,060
I'm doing everything

197
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,270
in my power to help him, Bill.

198
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,856
And I'm selling
everything the man owned

199
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,233
to keep writing you checks.

200
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,152
So you learning Spanish?

201
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,363
No. No, you don't
really need to.

202
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,698
I mean, Cabo's
mostly resort town.

203
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,782
Lot of Americans.

204
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,170
That's why the timeshare
business is booming.

205
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,752
Here.

206
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,093
The girls, man.

207
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,889
You know, you should
come down sometime.

208
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,267
Nate knows all the good spots.

209
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,019
Yeah, I don't see Becky
letting me do that.

210
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,771
What do you mean
"letting" you do that?

211
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,231
Just bring her.

212
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,207
Big Hey.

213
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,919
Get over here.

214
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,693
- Got the stamps?
- Fifty, right?

215
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,076
Yo, Staircase.

216
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,330
What's good?

217
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,413
Hi. Nice to meet you.

218
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,295
Jesus!

219
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,421
He alright?

220
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,464
He's worried you won't be
cool because he's white.

221
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,470
That true? My skin
make you nervous?

222
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,263
What? No.

223
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,766
- Does it make you nervous?
- No, of course not.

224
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,978
I can tell by the way you
said that you're lying.

225
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,831
- I don't like liars.
- I'm not. I'm just, uh...

226
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,398
I, I don't know how things work.

227
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:34,983
Hey, we ain't got
a problem taking

228
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,152
a white guy's money.

229
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,504
Unless you're in
the Brotherhood.

230
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,848
You're not a Nazi,
huh, Staircase?

231
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,948
No, of course not.

232
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,282
I voted for Gore.

233
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,993
"Voted for Gore."

234
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,580
Alright, man, we all set.

235
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,582
Hit me up every
Monday, you stay set.

236
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,294
You ain't got to worry about
that crackhead no more.

237
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,383
Alright, man.

238
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,226
Big Hey.

239
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,147
You lift?

240
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,734
Dear Sophie,

241
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,338
despite my doubts
about a higher power,

242
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,281
my hands are clasped
in prayer for you

243
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,405
to get the documentary out
sooner rather than later.

244
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,580
My appeal is set
to be decided on

245
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,874
in less than three months.

246
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,002
I always felt the
documentary was the best way

247
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,962
for people to hear
my side of the story.

248
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,717
I feel I must ask a question
that is long overdue.

249
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,386
Why on earth are you
still writing to me?

250
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,781
You're a smart,
accomplished woman

251
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,224
in the prime of her life

252
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,351
who sounds surprisingly
like Pepe Le Pew.

253
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,146
And I'm a convicted criminal

254
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,981
waiting for some
assholes in black robes

255
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,066
to admit mistakes
were made and free me.

256
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,445
The fractured cartilage

257
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,656
in Kathleen's thyroid indicates

258
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,617
a strangulation attempt is...

259
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,412
merely possible.

260
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,040
Dr. I would say it was
highly, highly likely

261
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,667
an attempt at
strangulation was made.

262
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,169
But can you say that

263
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,921
with a reasonable degree

264
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,339
of medical certainty?

265
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,509
Yes. Yes, I can.

266
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,777
Of course, I miss her.

267
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,989
I miss seeing her
face every morning.

268
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,175
I miss her laughing at my jokes,

269
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,284
even when they weren't funny.

270
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,912
What can I do
about it, you know?

271
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,999
Her being gone and this trial,

272
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,585
I can't change any of it.

273
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,089
I'm worried about you.

274
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,385
A great deal of
selfishness and ego

275
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,972
goes away with age.

276
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,157
You can't help it, you know.

277
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,810
You watch yourself get
old and fat and stupid.

278
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,521
And so you worry
about other things.

279
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,025
Other people.

280
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,109
Those you love.

281
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,444
Like you guys.

282
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,930
- Kathleen.
- Carol.

283
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,182
Hi. Hi!

284
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,808
I can't believe this.

285
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,852
I was just talking
about you last night.

286
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,104
-Oh. I was telling my friends

287
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,814
how you set me free.

288
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,066
Aw.

289
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,820
Oh. Okay.

290
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,447
Oh man, it is good to see you.

291
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,532
You too. You look good.

292
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,409
Yeah, I am good.

293
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,746
- Where are you working now?
- Bowman and Girard.

294
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,069
It's a mid-sized firm downtown.

295
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,709
Money's good?

296
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,418
Not great.

297
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,295
About little more than half

298
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,504
of what I was making.

299
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,297
But it's fine.

300
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,883
The hours are completely humane.

301
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,557
You know, when I
took a step back

302
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,226
away from it all,

303
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,771
I can see I was really,
really struggling at Nortel.

304
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,318
But it used to be fun, right?

305
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,403
I mean... it was work,

306
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,906
but we were doing pretty well.

307
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,324
Yeah.

308
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,409
Then it changed.

309
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:42,415
Now, I can actually see my kids.

310
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,292
We've even got a Club
Med trip planned.

311
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,086
Turks and Caicos.

312
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,980
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, that's great, Carol.

313
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,465
That's... it's really great.

314
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,126
Hi.

315
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,211
Hi. Um, this is a
family heirloom.

316
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,672
I'm sorry, it's not for sale.

317
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,466
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,635
Larry. You should
have called, Larry.

319
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,470
We would have let you in first.

320
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,471
Oh, that's okay.

321
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,014
Didn't want to be a bother.

322
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,641
But weren't there two?

323
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,184
- Two what?
- Deer.

324
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,312
Uh, to be honest,
I have no idea.

325
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,539
Well, how much you
want for this bad boy?

326
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,188
- Oh no, no, no, no.
- Nonsense.

327
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,190
Michael needs the money.

328
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,736
Let's call it... a hundred.

329
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,698
Thank you.

330
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,541
Remember, I'm right next
door if you need me.

331
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,995
Oh, come on.

332
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,498
- I'm retired now.
- Oh.

333
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,792
Got nothing but time.

334
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,340
So, for my peace of mind,

335
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,716
I need someone dedicated

336
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,385
to making the commissary
deposits every week.

337
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,137
It's, it's all my food,

338
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,348
uh, writing materials, stamps.

339
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,075
- It's, it's everything.
- I can take over.

340
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,476
No, I've got it.

341
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,239
I've done it the past
six months. It's fine.

342
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,913
Yeah. But you're in Mexico, and
I'm in the states. It's easier.

343
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,248
You know they have
banks in Mexico.

344
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,190
I'm just trying to
give you a break.

345
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,417
Let's just say it's Todd, okay.

346
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,360
It's Todd. You get the dogs.

347
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,652
I hate those fucking dogs.

348
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,675
You know, Bill's
expecting a good haul

349
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,618
from the estate sale.

350
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,370
And the house? Any interest?

351
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,789
Uh...

352
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,517
we're less optimistic there.

353
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,835
What's that supposed to mean?

354
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,648
It, it's looking like it's going
to go for less than asking.

355
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,174
What, like a million?

356
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,558
More like...
seven-fifty. Seven.

357
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,352
Seven? Are you kidding me?

358
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,063
It's got six fucking
bathrooms! Why?

359
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,775
Because of what
happened in there.

360
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,630
So I'm going to be broke
when I get out of here.

361
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,697
-Yo, man,

362
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,323
I don't have to fucking be here!

363
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,867
Man Okay, okay.

364
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,035
I fucking don't.

365
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,453
- This is horrible.
- Clay.

366
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,038
It is. I don't know
how I survived...

367
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,123
You only did four years.

368
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:28,915
- I know.
- And you were guilty.

369
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,834
Sorry.

370
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,002
Sorry. I'm just...

371
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,005
I'm just upset about
losing the house.

372
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:02,086
Okay. Slower still, yes?

373
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,198
Thoughts?

374
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,910
Notes?

375
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,790
One more time, please.

376
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,861
Dear Michael,

377
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,738
I've so enjoyed
our correspondence.

378
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,821
Perhaps too much.

379
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,992
Because of that,
I need distance,

380
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,287
and I will be taking a
break from writing you.

381
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,874
I hope you understand.

382
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,418
To keep you occupied, I'm
sending along another book,

383
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,794
since you're
sticking to your lie

384
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,755
that you finished Proust.

385
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,198
It was my favorite
as a young girl.

386
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,343
But I haven't read it in years.

387
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,304
I'm hoping you can read
it and then tell me

388
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,764
if it's as good as I remember.

389
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,475
I fear my memory has distorted

390
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,435
my perception of it.

391
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,062
Hopefully, you can
tell me I'm wrong.

392
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,146
Fondly, Sophie.

393
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,154
Dear Sophie, I'm sad to know

394
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:33,696
you can't write me for a time.

395
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,407
But I understand.

396
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,659
I know how complicated
life can be.

397
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,952
I felt I had to respond

398
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,662
to thank you for
the book, though.

399
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,582
It was also one of my
favorites when I was young.

400
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,126
I've often felt like Alice
during this whole ordeal.

401
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,755
Like I've gone through
the looking glass.

402
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,382
And prison is every bit the
hell it's made out to be.

403
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,842
Worse than war.

404
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,345
Hell, war was even
fun sometimes.

405
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,472
But it's full of
interesting people

406
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,600
who can be funny, gentle, loyal.

407
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,453
It's hard to square up with
what I know they've done.

408
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,437
Corrections officer:
Head count, gentlemen.

409
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,732
Let's go, gentlemen.

410
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,442
It'll make for a
good novel one day.

411
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,279
I can feel my
imagination turning on

412
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,657
thanks to you.

413
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,829
I've actually been thinking
a lot about Paris lately.

414
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,456
Closing my eyes and imagining

415
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,860
this little cafe Kathleen and
I used to frequent in the 4th.

416
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,212
La Reine Rouge.
Do you know it?

417
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,898
When I win my appeal, I
would like nothing more

418
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,090
than to go there with you.

419
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,681
We could sit, have a glass
of wine, and people watch.

420
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,768
I feel like you'd
enjoy that too.

421
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,730
You documentary subject and
hopefully one day, friend,

422
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,691
Michael Peterson.

423
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,622
Oh, merci.

424
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,758
Can you say that with
reasonable degree

425
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,303
of medical certainty?

426
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:20,803
Dr. Yes. Yes, I can.

427
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,555
Okay.

428
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,266
Et voilà...

429
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,475
Clayton?

430
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,394
Oh!

431
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,489
It's too hot outside
for that shit.

432
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:32,036
You girls were really
something tonight. Come on in.

433
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,538
Oh, can't stop, won't stop.

434
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,331
Okay.

435
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,684
Come on in. We'll
show you the place.

436
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,708
I like it. I like it.

437
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:40,920
2,400 square feet.

438
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,005
Brand new construction.

439
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,049
A tub you could drown in.

440
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,176
And fuck me...

441
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,095
the pool.

442
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,721
It's a goddamn work of art.

443
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,974
You ladies...

444
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,643
yeah, you'd look
pretty good next to it.

445
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,726
Hmm. Hmm.

446
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,231
When you come to Cabo...

447
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,817
no one knows who you are.

448
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,818
You can do anything you want.

449
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,069
It's fantastic.

450
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,991
Well, my family's been
vacationing here for years,

451
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,327
so everybody knows us.

452
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,330
Well, that's exactly
why you need this place.

453
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,708
And I-I'm telling
you, we could have you

454
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,834
in this condo by Monday.

455
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,419
Oh, easily.

456
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,045
Keys in hand. Done, yours.

457
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,339
That is crazy.

458
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,843
Real estate takes
forever in Boston.

459
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,011
Well, you know...

460
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,015
things are faster down here.

461
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,017
Uh, ten rolls of stamps, please.

462
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,411
- Commissary worker: Any stationery?
- Uh, not today. No.

463
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,438
Oh, and one of those
honey buns, actually.

464
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,773
-Alright.

465
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,526
Try again next week.

466
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,028
Try again?

467
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,614
- No money, no order.
- What?

468
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,032
There's no money
in your account.

469
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,451
No, my son Todd puts,
puts money in every week.

470
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,412
- Just look again.
- Why would I look again when there's nothing to see?

471
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:39,495
Check next week.

472
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,915
You don't understand.
I need this.

473
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,498
I really need this.

474
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,208
Step out of line, 640.

475
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,375
- Please, I don't...
- Now.

476
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,419
- No, I need this!
- Step out of line now!

477
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,713
Hey, Staircase.
- Inmate-Hey.

478
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,434
Hey, BK. How's it going?

479
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,758
Chillin'. You
seem hyped though.

480
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,939
I don't have the stamps.

481
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,191
Not today.

482
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,193
Soon.

483
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,571
I see.

484
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,076
I just need one more
day. That's all.

485
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,079
I need the stamps,

486
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,080
or J-Smoke gonna
fuck your ass up.

487
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,499
This ain't no damn charity.

488
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,793
Start the game over.

489
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,840
So my son forgot.

490
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,636
He didn't put money in the...

491
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,815
It's a free country.

492
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,359
Stand where you got to stand.

493
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,486
Thank you.

494
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,686
Fuck! Fuck!

495
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,106
Oh shit!

496
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,732
Oh shit!

497
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,319
Oh my god.

498
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,449
Pick up, Nate. Pick up, Nate.

499
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,992
-Fuck!

500
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,579
Fuck!

501
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,760
Dude. What happened
last night?

502
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,802
Are you joking?

503
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,309
There's blood.

504
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,393
Goddamn it, dude.

505
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,687
You fucked up the whole deal.

506
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,689
Nate, Nate, what
happened to the girl?

507
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,524
- What girl?
- The one that I was, um,

508
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,627
that I was hanging with,
the girl with the pink bra.

509
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:18,405
What? She left
right after you fell

510
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,657
and hit your head or something.

511
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,301
You better not have
fucked the place up.

512
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,125
Yo, Todd.

513
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,922
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So she's okay?

514
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,133
Whatever. She's got a
massive fucking hangover.

515
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,221
But... look, bro,

516
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,181
you need to lock your shit down.

517
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,450
Otherwise, we're
gonna have to rethink

518
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,851
this whole business arrangement.

519
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,704
And I set my account to auto-pay,
so it'll never happen again.

520
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,105
Thank you. Thank you so much.

521
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,482
Yeah, of course, Dad.

522
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,402
What the hell
happened with Todd?

523
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,861
It's not like him.

524
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,339
I don't know, he
must be really busy

525
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,572
with his real estate thing.

526
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,574
He says it's going really well.

527
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,659
Oh, good for him.

528
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,415
Hey. Dad.

529
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,878
It's just... this is a lot.

530
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,970
I wasn't going to mention
this until things were...

531
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,848
What? Oh god, what?
What? What is it?

532
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,808
No, it's, it's good.
Becky's pregnant.

533
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,103
Oh.

534
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,688
Oh.

535
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,024
Oh wow.

536
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,069
You're going to
be a grandfather.

537
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,490
Come here.

538
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,622
Alright, 640, make space.

539
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,671
Um...

540
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,633
well, I, uh,

541
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,011
I hope my appeal comes
through be-before he's born.

542
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,305
You know, I want to
be there for you.

543
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,809
Well, David says any day now.

544
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,962
And we think it's
going to be a she.

545
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,150
A she?

546
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,461
Oh wow. Now girls
are a handful.

547
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,320
You know that, don't you?

548
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,654
Yeah, that's...

549
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,906
that's what I keep hearing.

550
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,866
Yeah.

551
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,451
Oh my god.

552
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,078
Whoa, whoa, Margaret, what
are you talking about?

553
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:30,996
Dad didn't tell you?

554
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,432
I thought you were
on the same page.

555
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,542
Wait. Wait. What happened?

556
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,502
He went through my mail,

557
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,712
found out I got some bad grades,

558
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,231
and flipped out,
that's what happened.

559
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,840
He told me you weren't going

560
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,550
to buy me a ticket
home for Thanksgiving.

561
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,010
So, I'm not coming.

562
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,845
Well, no...

563
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,406
I can give you the
money for a ticket.

564
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,681
Mike doesn't need to know.

565
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,433
It's too late. I
made other plans.

566
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,643
With who?

567
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,228
I'm going to Aunt Blair's.

568
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,354
Aunt Blair's?

569
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,789
Oh, come on, you do not
want to go to Rhode Island.

570
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,690
Whatever. I, I've
got to study.

571
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,985
I'll see you at
Christmas, if I'm invited.

572
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,072
Kathleen.

573
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,574
Your table's ready.

574
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,117
- Oh.
- It's been too long.

575
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,953
George, so good to see you.

576
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:11,745
She really did seem lighter

577
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,539
not working at Nortel, you know.

578
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,123
There was a brightness to her.

579
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,876
- Good for her.
- Check in with her in six months.

580
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,714
- What does that mean?
- Well, she's, um,

581
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,716
she'll be tearing her
hair out with boredom.

582
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,385
She's addicted to the grind.

583
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,511
Another bottle?

584
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,514
It's pricey.

585
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,408
You really think you have
everyone's number, don't you?

586
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,934
I mean, I think I got Carol's.

587
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,622
I'd love for someone
to take the wheel.

588
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,606
Have an easier job. No job.

589
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,192
What are you talking about?

590
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,360
You're a workaholic, too.

591
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,070
What would you even do?

592
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,239
Uh, go fishing
more, for starters.

593
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,615
Uh, no, you wouldn't.

594
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,242
Everything okay, Mr. Peterson?

595
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,910
Yes, George. Fantastic.

596
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,204
Um, another Sancerre.

597
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,372
Fine choice, Mr. Peterson.

598
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,802
Oh, Kathleen, I've been
meaning to tell you.

599
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,211
We're going to my
sister's for Thanksgiving.

600
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,130
So thank you for the
invitation, but...

601
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,881
Maybe just I can come?

602
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,010
Well, I'm thinking of sitting
this year out, actually.

603
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:09,970
Oh really?

604
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,972
Yes, Kathleen, do say more.

605
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,891
Well, some of the kids
aren't coming home.

606
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,975
Who?

607
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,896
Don't you look so surprised.

608
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,607
Margaret.

609
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,501
She's going to Rhode Island
to be with Aunt Blair.

610
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,319
Aunt Blair?

611
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,195
Jesus, that kid's a
glutton for punishment.

612
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,281
What about Martha?

613
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,825
She hasn't picked up her phone.

614
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,746
I'm sorry, honey.

615
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,914
I know how important
Thanksgiving is to you.

616
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,125
No, it's okay.

617
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,377
My sister's been begging
to host for a decade,

618
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:46,131
so I might just take a page
out of the Carol playbook

619
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,466
and take the night off.

620
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:56,141
Hey. A toast to giving
ourselves a break.

621
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,477
Yeah. To, uh, what's her name?

622
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,145
- Carol.
- Carol?

623
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,064
- To Carol.
- To Carol.

624
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,744
So, since we're going
to be out of town,

625
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,913
you know what that means, buddy?

626
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,206
- What?
- You're going to have

627
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,957
-to come over and feed the bats.

628
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,144
Have we told you the latest
with those fucking things?

629
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,920
Who knew they were so
hard to get rid of?

630
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,464
-Hmm?

631
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,238
- Do you mind?
- Hm.

632
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,578
Thanks.

633
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,039
You know, for the assist.

634
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,874
The other day, you know.

635
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,044
Not telling me to scram.

636
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,218
Sorry to hear what happened.

637
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,720
Oh.

638
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,972
That's all sorted
out now, so I'm...

639
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,519
No, I'm, I'm good for a while.

640
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,396
You know, my, uh...

641
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,772
my youngest was busy with work.

642
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,566
And my oldest, Clayton?

643
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,317
I'm going to be a grandfather.

644
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,575
You're really relaxed.

645
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,495
When I lost, it
took me a minute.

646
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,331
Lost? Lost what?

647
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,421
In October 2003,

648
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,590
novelist Michael
Peterson was convicted

649
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,924
of the murder of his wife,

650
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,843
Nortel executive
Kathleen Peterson.

651
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,637
His defense team
led by David Rudolf

652
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,389
immediately filed for an appeal.

653
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,725
But today, a three-judge panel

654
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,603
rejected Peterson's arguments
that his trial was filled

655
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,938
with inflammatory,
irrelevant evidence

656
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,690
and judicial mistakes
that prevented him

657
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,275
from getting a fair trial.

658
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,321
The decision comes nearly a
year after his conviction.

659
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,948
Now, Michael Peterson
and his defense team

660
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,242
are headed to the North
Carolina Supreme Court

661
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,606
where they will
have one final...

662
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,122
So, hang, hang on a
second. Can you hear me?

663
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,416
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

664
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,210
Okay. Um, look, Mike,

665
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,628
we obviously didn't want you

666
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,671
to find out this way, alright?

667
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,006
I'm, I'm sorry.

668
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:33,632
Oh, you didn't want me
to find out standing

669
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,675
next to Bob the pedophile?

670
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,260
You didn't think that was ideal?

671
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,970
Look, I, I understand
your anger, Mike.

672
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:43,475
It was one appeal in
a stack of a thousand.

673
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,393
Uh, we didn't know

674
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,646
when we were going to hear,
and we can't exactly just,

675
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,081
you know, ring your
doorbell, so...

676
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,399
What does it say?
What does it say?

677
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,502
The ruling? Can
you send me a copy?

678
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,820
Yeah, we'll send it. Of
course, we'll send it.

679
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,130
It says, you know,
they actually agreed

680
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:59,199
with our argument that
the state's conduct

681
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,994
in seizing your computer
was unconstitutional.

682
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,329
So why am I still fucking here?

683
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,624
Because then they ruled
two-to-one that it was...

684
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,335
Immaterial to the final outcome.

685
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,087
Wait, immaterial to the outcome?

686
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,338
My fucking life. The outcome?

687
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,107
Tom Yes. That what they
found on your computer

688
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,759
didn't sway the jury
one way or another.

689
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,844
Well, listen, listen.

690
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,512
Because it was a split decision,

691
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,055
the appeal automatically goes up

692
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,515
to the state supreme court.

693
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,642
And our odds are much
better at that level.

694
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,353
So how long will that take?

695
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,313
Well, uh, could be another year.

696
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,482
- Or... or two.
- Fuck.

697
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,566
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

698
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,901
I know. Well...

699
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,695
I am with you

700
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,030
until this is over.

701
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,741
Right here.

702
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,870
You know that, right?

703
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,497
Come on, I can't
get off this call

704
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,915
if you're mad at me.

705
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,043
No, I'm not mad, Dave.

706
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,837
I, I got to go.

707
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,255
-Alright, uh...

708
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:12,938
Let me, uh...

709
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,525
let me see if I can get her.

710
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,693
Can you guys...

711
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,112
can you guys hold on?

712
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,488
Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,616
I'm here.

714
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,701
Okay, cool. One second.

715
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,286
- You okay, bro?
- Yeah.

716
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,538
Yeah, all good.

717
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,259
Hey.

718
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,695
I can be in San
Francisco tomorrow.

719
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,971
I'm fine.

720
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:49,559
Okay, let me, let
me loop the boys in.

721
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,939
So what's important to remember

722
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,148
is that this isn't the end.

723
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,107
There's going to
be a second appeal.

724
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,777
Is this just going
to go on for years?

725
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,111
It has not been years.

726
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,782
It's been, what,
maybe ten months?

727
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,368
It's been three
years since Mom...

728
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,751
Look, we just need
to... buckle up.

729
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,087
Alright? Refuel.

730
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,298
Right. There's still
moves left on the board.

731
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,258
Yeah. It'll all be fine.

732
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,928
Bonjour.

733
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,774
Um, no.

734
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,780
One night, she was...

735
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,544
You know, this, this
house is, is filled...

736
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,202
with so many memories.

737
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,707
You know, I, I feel her here.

738
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,795
I, I just always think

739
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,214
she might walk through
that door any moment.

740
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,594
Smiling, laughing,

741
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,721
reminding me that I'm,
I'm late for something.

742
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,316
Oh!

743
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,018
Hi.

744
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,186
- Oh my god.
- Oh god.

745
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,187
I'm so sorry. I
didn't mean to...

746
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,355
I got it. I got it.

747
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,190
I got it. I got it.

748
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,609
I didn't mean to
scare you. I, I, uh...

749
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,128
- You're, you're new here, right?
- Uh, yeah, kinda.

750
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,905
Dearest Margaret,

751
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,531
We've never met, but I spent

752
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,910
many precious hours with
you and your family.

753
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,247
This documentary is the
result of those hours.

754
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,457
We hope we did justice
to your family's story.

755
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,462
Please know that to me,
this is not the end.

756
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,305
Yours truly, Sophie,

757
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,432
editor, Maha Productions.

758
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,062
Corrections officer: Hey, 640.

759
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,064
Visiting hours.

760
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,941
What?

761
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,741
Staircase.

762
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,655
Michael.

763
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,995
Sophie.

764
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,012
-You're here.

765
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,680
I am here.

766
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,307
Yes.

767
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,435
Wow.

767
01:00:48,305 --> 01:01:48,330
