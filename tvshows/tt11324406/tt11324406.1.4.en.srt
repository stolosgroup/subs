<i>Jean speaking French...</i>

<i>Sophie speaking French...</i>

<i>Jean speaking French...</i>

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,083
<i>Okay.</i>

8
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:51,115
<i>I know you've been reluctant</i>

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,257
<i>to speak on camera about</i>

10
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:54,593
<i>your relationship
with Michael until now.</i>

11
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,553
<i>So thank you.</i>

12
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:58,096
<i>Of course.</i>

13
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:00,015
<i>How long
have you been together?</i>

14
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,176
Hm... 12 years.

15
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,980
Right after the trial ended.

16
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:07,105
How did you meet?

17
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,649
Well...

18
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:14,112
Hm...

19
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,318
C-Can we start with
something else?

20
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:19,197
Okay, let's start with today.

21
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,562
Do you think today is proof

22
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:25,878
that the justice system works?

23
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,495
It's hard to say.

24
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:35,825
What is justice?

25
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,206
<i>I've said from day one</i>

26
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,078
<i>that it can only be one thing.</i>

27
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:43,360
<i>Speaking French...</i>

28
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,051
<i>This is Sonya
Pfeiffer for ABC 11 News.</i>

29
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:55,518
<i>It's been a long and winding
journey, but we're here.</i>

30
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:57,931
<i>Day one of
the Michael Peterson trial.</i>

31
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:59,182
<i>A year and a...</i>

32
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,933
<i>A trial's simply two sides</i>

33
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,019
<i>competing to tell
a better story.</i>

34
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:04,437
<i>We're gonna contend to you</i>

35
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,839
<i>that after a vicious argument
with his wife,</i>

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,194
<i>Michael Peterson
murdered Kathleen</i>

37
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:14,557
<i>in cold blood,
beating her in the head...</i>

38
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:17,903
<i>with this.</i>

39
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,956
<i>And where is this</i>

40
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,081
<i>elusive murder weapon?</i>

41
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:27,794
<i>They can't find it
because it doesn't exist.</i>

42
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,215
<i>The fact of the matter is,
Kathleen had some wine,</i>

43
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,469
<i>some champagne,
and some Valium</i>

44
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:37,470
<i>and fell.</i>

45
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:39,639
<i>And 12 jurors declare</i>

46
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:41,597
<i>one of the stories the winne.</i>

47
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,129
<i>And that story
becomes justice.</i>

48
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,979
<i>And what sort of
sexual activities</i>

49
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:48,064
<i>would you perform for men</i>

50
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:49,875
<i>that you might
have been prepared</i>

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,671
<i>to perform
with Michael Peterson?</i>

52
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,538
<i>I mean, pretty much
anything under the sun.</i>

53
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,132
<i>I mean, pretty much
anything under the sun.</i>

54
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:14,840
<i>Is it fair to say
the men you serviced</i>

55
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:19,512
<i>were bisexual as opposed
to being homosexual?</i>

56
00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:21,973
<i>I'd go so far
as to say that they were</i>

57
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:23,898
<i>mostly straight married guys</i>

58
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,083
<i>with some minor
homosexual tendencies.</i>

59
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,526
<i>Can you identify state's
exhibit 72 for me, please?</i>

60
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,336
<i>Yes, that is my... blow poke.</i>

61
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,867
<i>You blow through it.</i>

62
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,702
<i>And you gave one of these blow pokes</i>

63
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,037
<i>to every member
of your family?</i>

64
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:47,957
<i>Yes.
For Christmas of 1984.</i>

65
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,890
<i>Including Kathleen?</i>

66
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:53,961
<i>Yes. She was not only
my older sister,</i>

67
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,007
<i>but she was my best friend.</i>

68
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:57,925
<i>You did state to police</i>

69
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,762
<i>the only relationship you saw</i>

70
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:03,640
<i>between Michael and Kathleen</i>

71
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:06,601
<i>was a "truly loving,</i>

72
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,604
<i>respectful marriage."</i>

73
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:10,773
<i>Right?</i>

74
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:12,732
<i>That was
an old version of me.</i>

75
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:14,108
<i>The new informed me,</i>

76
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:16,069
<i>the me sitting here
in this courtroom,</i>

77
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,906
<i>can confidently say
that I have no idea</i>

78
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,825
<i>who the hell
Michael Peterson was then</i>

79
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,096
<i>or is now.</i>

80
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,738
<i>Does that clear it up for yo?</i>

81
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,498
<i>Justice is a, is a construct</i>

82
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:31,626
<i>little more than a game,</i>

83
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,963
<i>a game that shapes
the outcome of a man's life.</i>

84
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,925
<i>As for what's
happening today,</i>

85
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:41,442
<i>this feels
bigger than justice.</i>

86
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,278
<i>I would say, um, it's fate.</i>

87
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:50,228
<i>You've got cast-off
outside the header</i>

88
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:52,648
<i>and on the west wall
of the hallway.</i>

89
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:53,856
<i>How could that happen?</i>

90
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,982
<i>The assailant was standing</i>

91
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,610
<i>on the outside
of the stairwell,</i>

92
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:00,252
<i>swingin' the weapon...</i>

93
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:08,037
and creating this

94
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,206
blood cast-off pattern.

95
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,626
So to be clear, in your opinion,

96
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,170
this had to have been a beating?

97
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,422
That's correct.

98
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,006
The impact spatter

99
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,927
on the inside
of the defendant's shorts

100
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,011
simply does not occur

101
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,015
unless he's standing
over her as he strikes.

102
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,724
And that's consistent
with crime scenes

103
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,228
you've overseen in the past?

104
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:33,855
This is extremely consistent.

105
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,733
And why should we trust you?

106
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:40,820
Well, sir, I've written
over 200 bloodstain reports

107
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:44,490
and overseen... 500 scenes.

108
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,507
That guy looks like a penis.

109
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,329
No further questions, Your Honor.

110
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:52,871
You may be dismissed.

111
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:55,660
- Let's take a 10-minute recess.
- Jesus.

112
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:57,670
It looks bad on TV, dude.

113
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:59,565
<i>What do I keep telling you?</i>

114
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,626
<i>Do not watch that shit.</i>

115
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,369
Yeah, but the commentators
are saying...

116
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:06,637
Hey, listen to what I am saying.

117
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:08,688
I am sitting here
where it's real.

118
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,433
We gotta get going.

119
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,977
<i>Things are going great. Okay?</i>

120
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:15,405
<i>When Radisch takes the stand,
things are gonna go our way.</i>

121
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,524
Yeah, look, I... I just really
feel like I should be there.

122
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,554
Clay, hold on.
Hold on one second.

123
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,612
Alright.
I'm headed back to Reno.

124
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:24,469
I'll see you in
a week and a half.

125
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,171
Todd!

126
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:28,173
Todd.

127
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,624
So... tomorrow is huge.

128
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,960
They're going big,
showing these autopsy photos.

129
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:41,631
So we really need
everyone there.

130
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,397
Arm-in-arm. United front.

131
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:49,737
I can't go. I'm sorry. I can't.

132
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:53,392
Okay, I hear that. I do.

133
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,478
And no one's going to force you.

134
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,172
Of course,
you're going to force me.

135
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:59,482
That's what
this meeting is about.

136
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,234
I mean,
would anyone really notice

137
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:02,401
if she wasn't there?

138
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:07,782
Um, I mean, maybe
10, 15 years ago, no.

139
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,506
But, you know, now there's...

140
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,537
cameras everywhere.

141
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,176
Everyone sees everything.

142
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:15,554
So...

143
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,751
if you're absent
and Caitlin is there...

144
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:20,753
Optics aren't great.

145
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:23,589
I mean, Clayton's
been asking to come home.

146
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:26,634
- You know, maybe he should...
- No, no, no.

147
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,970
No, not for this.
Just keep pushing him off.

148
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,694
Okay.

149
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:32,962
Well, maybe Martha could take

150
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,157
one of Kathleen's Valium,
you know.

151
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,229
- Or just a half.
- No. No! I'm not going to go.

152
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:40,439
I'm not going. I'm not
going to sit there and watch.

153
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,693
I'm not going to do it.

154
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:43,662
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm not going.

155
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,100
I'm not going.

156
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:46,913
State your name and profession

157
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:48,406
for the court, please.

158
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,158
My name is
Dr. Deborah L. Radisch.

159
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:52,827
I'm a forensic pathologist

160
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,630
and the associate
chief medical examiner

161
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:56,455
for the state of North Carolina.

162
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,294
And you performed the autopsy
on Kathleen Peterson?

163
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,475
That is correct.

164
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,794
If it pleases the court,

165
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:05,131
I'd like to display
exhibit 79a and 79b,

166
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,731
in a large format
for easy viewing.

167
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:11,470
These images are... graphic.

168
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:13,931
Proceed.

169
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,921
I think I'm going
to have a panic attack.

170
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,347
Yeah...

171
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:57,266
- Can't we object?
- Shh.

172
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,658
- David, stop her...
- Not now.

173
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,271
Dr. Radisch,

174
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,440
you ruled Kathleen's death
a homicide.

175
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:06,192
I did.

176
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:07,735
From blunt force trauma
to the head.

177
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,739
You think
the fractured cartilage

178
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:14,200
in Kathleen's thyroid indicates

179
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:17,578
that a strangulation attempt
is merely possible?

180
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:19,897
It's more than possible.
It's probable.

181
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:23,834
But your report said
it was only,

182
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:27,755
what, suggestive of
a strangulation attempt?

183
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,716
I would say it was
highly, highly likely

184
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,302
an attempt
at strangulation was made.

185
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:36,681
But can you say that
with a reasonable degree

186
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,557
of medical certainty?

187
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,851
Yes. Yes, I can.

188
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,896
Okay. Then would you say
with a reasonable degree

189
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,734
of medical certainty that
Kathleen Peterson was killed

190
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:51,237
by blunt force trauma
to the head?

191
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:52,627
Yes.

192
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:55,849
- Okay. May I approach?
- Yes.

193
00:09:56,993 --> 00:10:00,329
I just want to put
these binders up here.

194
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,540
- Ms. Radisch.
- Dr. Radisch.

195
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,667
Forgive me, Dr. Radisch.

196
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,877
Um, I want you to tell me

197
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,922
if, um, these appear
to be a collection

198
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:11,590
of all the autopsies

199
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:15,344
involving blunt force trauma
to the head in North Carolina

200
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:18,389
from 1991 to 2003.

201
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:19,765
Objection.

202
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,084
Overruled.

203
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,768
She may respond
however she'd like.

204
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:29,984
I don't think I can give you
an accurate answer to that.

205
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:31,277
- Not today.
- Lright.

206
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:35,364
Alright. Well, we went back
at least a decade

207
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:40,161
and pulled the case files
for every beating death

208
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:42,329
in the state of North Carolina.

209
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:45,791
Two hundred fifty-seven,
to be precise,

210
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,476
and found that in every case,

211
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:53,522
whether the object was hollow

212
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:54,759
or hard

213
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:56,969
or thin or heavy,

214
00:10:57,053 --> 00:11:00,112
every single time,

215
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,351
the beating resulted
in either a skull fracture

216
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:07,619
or massive injury to the brain.

217
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:10,066
In many cases, it was both.

218
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,568
Are you aware of this?

219
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:13,944
No. Because like I said,

220
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:15,780
I haven't had a chance
to review these...

221
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:17,865
Alright.
Well, let's, let's just assume

222
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:20,048
for right now that it's true...

223
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,259
which it is.

224
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:29,627
Kathleen Peterson didn't have
any skull fracture, did she?

225
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:32,101
She didn't, but she
did have a multitude...

226
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,381
- Doctor...
- ...of facial injuries

227
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:34,381
- and broken cartilage.
- These...

228
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:36,550
These are
yes-or-no questions, Doctor.

229
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:39,235
Was there skull fracturing?

230
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,155
No, there wasn't.

231
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:44,934
She also didn't
have any broken bones.

232
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:47,728
- No.
- Or contusions on the brain.

233
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:50,397
No, she did not.

234
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:53,123
Or edema, did she?

235
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:54,749
No.

236
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:59,532
Given that
some combination of these

237
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:04,760
was found in literally
every one of these cases...

238
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,876
is it possible in order
to reach the conclusion

239
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,520
that Kathleen Peterson's
death was...

240
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,980
a homicide...

241
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:20,886
that you were coached
by the DA?

242
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,304
Objection.

243
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:24,056
Withdrawn.

244
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,019
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

245
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:30,769
You may be dismissed.

246
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:00,873
Did I ever tell you about the
first time I heard classical music?

247
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:05,128
My parents and I were,
uh, we're driving back

248
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:07,408
from a Little League game
and, um...

249
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,936
I was upset about something.

250
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,366
I guess we must have lost.

251
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:15,122
And, uh...

252
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:19,028
we were listening
to, uh, to Armed Forces Radio,

253
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:20,821
which was, you know,
it was the only,

254
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,908
only station we could get
growing up near Dad's base.

255
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:26,675
And as we were pulling up
to the house,

256
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:28,342
<i>a sweet little place,</i>

257
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:30,511
this came on.

258
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,224
Mahler's Fifth.

259
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:36,685
First Movement.

260
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:42,118
<i>My dad went to turn it off,
and I grabbed his hand.</i>

261
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:43,969
I said, "Stop. No."

262
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:50,657
It was the most fabulous thing
I'd ever heard.

263
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54,146
Now, Dad didn't listen.

264
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,148
He just flipped it off,
went inside.

265
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,582
He never liked to be
too far from his bourbon.

266
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,654
But my dear mother,

267
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,948
<i>she turned the radio back on,</i>

268
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:06,048
and she stayed
in the car with me.

269
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:08,884
And we listened.

270
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,974
And the music...

271
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:20,714
washed over me.

272
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:23,649
Just... it overwhelmed me.

273
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:28,111
And I was...

274
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:30,614
hooked.

275
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:35,604
Just so much emotion,

276
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,205
so much drama, so much truth.

277
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,778
All without saying
a single word.

278
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:52,928
David won't let me talk,
so I take it out on you.

279
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:55,207
I don't know how
you're gonna get all my

280
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,669
rambling into one film.

281
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,311
Our editor is suggesting
we make it longer, actually.

282
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:05,426
TV series.
Maybe six or eight episodes.

283
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,011
Really?

284
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:08,846
Oh. This is the part.

285
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:29,834
<i>The facts
of the case suggest truth</i>

286
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,909
<i>is indeed stranger than fiction.</i>

287
00:15:32,386 --> 00:15:34,465
<i>A second woman,
Elizabeth Ratliff,</i>

288
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,582
<i>mother to Martha
and Margaret Ratliff,</i>

289
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,959
<i>was found dead
at the bottom of the stairs</i>

290
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:41,378
<i>20 years ago in Germany.</i>

291
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,082
The coffin will leave
its Texan home

292
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,043
and begin a 1,200-mile journey

293
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:47,259
<i>across middle America
to North Carolina,</i>

294
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:48,802
<i>where an autopsy
will be performed</i>

295
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:51,082
<i>by medical examiner
Deborah L. Radisch.</i>

296
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,763
<i>Do you believe
in objectivity?</i>

297
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:56,727
<i>No.</i>

298
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:59,146
<i>The only way to get close
to objectivity</i>

299
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,607
<i>is by recognizing
how subjective we are.</i>

300
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:05,152
<i>We see the world based
on our past experiences.</i>

301
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:08,447
<i>And I think the only way
to get close to objectivity</i>

302
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:09,990
<i>is to realize
it doesn't exist.</i>

303
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:31,526
Doesn't look good, Mike.

304
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:41,063
Both at
the bottom of the stairs,

305
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,981
both have seven lacerations.

306
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:44,149
Peterson...

307
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:46,485
Ratliff.

308
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:48,237
They look nothing alike.

309
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,906
And they're saying
that the brain was clean.

310
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,547
No signs of an aneurysm.

311
00:16:53,284 --> 00:16:54,701
In what fucking universe

312
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:56,370
can they assign the same person

313
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:58,324
that did Kathleen's autopsy
to do Liz's?

314
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,680
It's a conflict of interest.

315
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:05,418
Why didn't you stop this?

316
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,856
You went too hard at her, Dave.

317
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:10,759
Radisch?

318
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:12,094
Oh, I'm sorry,

319
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:13,971
was I supposed
to take it easy on her?

320
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,858
What does this mean?

321
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:28,194
Like, really mean?
Like, no spin, no bullshit.

322
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,741
What, what can Hardin
do with this?

323
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:31,405
They're going to call
more witnesses.

324
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:34,283
People from Germany
who were there,

325
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,285
- who remember it.
- Remember what?

326
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:39,678
It was 25 years ago,
and nothing happened.

327
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:42,916
The Germans said
there was an aneurysm.

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,539
You know,
there wasn't even any blood.

329
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,231
Well, there was
some blood, Michael.

330
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:53,509
So, what's the strategy?

331
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:57,514
We keep appealing
to common sense.

332
00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:00,684
This is a strange coincidence,
nothing more.

333
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:05,397
There is no such thing
as a staircase killer

334
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:07,691
who emerges every 20 years

335
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,235
to hurl his victims
down the steps.

336
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,612
<i>Okay.</i>

337
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:14,305
<i>Caitlin, are you going
to be the best dancer...</i>

338
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:15,446
<i>I'm gonna try.</i>

339
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:17,416
<i>- Yeah. We need help.
- I'm getting this.</i>

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,244
<i>- I'll show you.
- Okay.</i>

341
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,412
<i>One, two...</i>

342
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,581
<i>- I always...
- No!</i>

343
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:25,265
<i>We'll try again, we'll
try again, we'll try again.</i>

344
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,259
What are you doing here?

345
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:36,678
Well, so the DA's
whole case revolves

346
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:40,557
around proving
that Dad beat Mom...

347
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,267
uh, Kathleen,
with the blow poke.

348
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:45,437
So what I'm doing

349
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:47,314
is I'm looking through
all these videos

350
00:18:47,398 --> 00:18:49,956
to prove that
it's been missing for a while.

351
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,356
And has it?

352
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:54,045
Mostly. It doesn't seem
to be there.

353
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:59,257
Is this project related
to the second autopsy finding?

354
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,581
It's...

355
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,771
It's my fault, you know,
I could have said no.

356
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,517
Right?

357
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,637
<i>Caitlin. Hi!</i>

358
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,767
<i>- Hello.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

359
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,315
<i>That's all you're getting.</i>

360
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:35,362
<i>It looks delicious.</i>

361
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:37,364
<i>All right...</i>

362
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,754
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

363
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:48,750
You didn't remember
to pick up my suit, did you?

364
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,558
I have that town hall debate.

365
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,978
It's at the VA.

366
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,896
In your closet.

367
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:58,933
The plumber is coming
to fix the pipes

368
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:00,372
but we need to do
something about the bats

369
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:01,636
or else it'll happen again.

370
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,764
We will. We will.

371
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:07,102
- How's the neck?
- Oh, much better.

372
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,186
Except when it hurts.

Ohh!

I feel like you're mad at me.

382
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,661
I'm upset, yeah,
because you were late.

383
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:54,733
Well, I'm sorry.
I was, um, studying.

384
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:57,000
I mean late again.
You're always late. So...

385
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:00,447
Alright. Well, I just said
I was sorry, so...

386
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:03,923
Well you're always sorry, but
nothing ever seems to change.

387
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,384
Okay.

388
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,271
Um, what's going on here?
Where is this coming from?

389
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,146
Not everyone gets
a second chance

390
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,834
- in life, Clayton.
- Oh, okay.

391
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,257
- But you did.
- Yeah. Okay.

392
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:21,593
And you seem determined
to screw it right up.

393
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:23,334
Look, I did my time,
alright?

394
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,430
I don't give a shit
about spring break, Clayton!

395
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:27,474
Jesus.

396
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:30,060
I'm still pissed
about what happened in July.

397
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,895
- Okay?
- Wait. For real?

398
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,689
Yeah, for real!

399
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,691
It was a big deal.

400
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,619
And you really don't seem
to understand that.

401
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,096
If Becky is completely over it,

402
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:41,144
why do you get to hold
some kind of a grudge about it?

403
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:42,698
- That's total bullshit!
- Okay. Alright.

404
00:21:42,782 --> 00:21:44,091
- You know what?
- You're treating me like I'm,

405
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:45,458
like I'm some kind of
a fucking child.

406
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:46,243
You're right.

407
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:47,786
You're a totally responsible,

408
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,287
fully formed adult.

409
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:50,163
So... yeah,

410
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,458
let's just listen
to the radio in silence

411
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,584
while I drive you to school.

412
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:56,044
You know what, Kathleen,
you go around acting like

413
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,839
you're so morally superior
to everyone.

414
00:21:58,923 --> 00:22:01,425
You've never copped to the fact
that you started fucking my dad

415
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,135
when he was still married
to my mom.

416
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:08,237
What, I...

417
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,059
Who told you that?

418
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:12,561
We all know.

419
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,027
We just don't rub
your face in it.

420
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,924
You're a fucking hypocrite.

421
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,795
You mind your temper, Clayton.

I got there at
7:30 in the morning like always.

432
00:22:50,975 --> 00:22:53,685
And it was
the first thing I saw,

433
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:55,410
Liz just lying there
like a doll.

434
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:59,399
Was there blood?

435
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,526
Oh yes. Everywhere.

436
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,362
The floor.
The walls. The stairs.

437
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:06,948
Blood everywhere.

438
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,992
What did you do next?

439
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:11,328
Well, my first concern

440
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:13,038
was for Martha-Baby
and Little Gee-Gee.

441
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,388
I loved these
little girls so much.

442
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,045
I... I went upstairs
and got them.

443
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:23,021
- And then what?
- I made sure they were okay.

444
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,912
And then I went
to the toilet and vomited.

445
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,347
Ease up.

446
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,548
And after that?

447
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,476
I went and got Michael next door.

448
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,061
He came in, took a look around,

449
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:40,857
and said that Liz
had a brain aneurysm

450
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:44,027
and that she must have fallen
down the stairs from that.

451
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:47,155
And had anyone with
any medical authority arrived

452
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,866
who could verify
this guess of his?

453
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,204
No. Michael sort of
proclaimed it.

454
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,081
And... and then it was true.

455
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:58,750
That's when I started
getting a feeling.

456
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:01,753
What sort of feeling?

457
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:03,713
That Michael had done
something horrible.

458
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:06,091
Bjection. Speculation.

459
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:07,759
Sustained.

460
00:24:07,843 --> 00:24:09,465
Ms. Schafer,

461
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,255
in your statement
to German police,

462
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,640
you never mentioned
the blood or the vomit

463
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:17,352
or any suspicions at all

464
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:19,757
against Michael Peterson.
Why is that?

465
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:21,523
I'm not sure I understand.

466
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,732
Well, if you didn't
mention anything at the time

467
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,945
and there are no photographs
to corroborate,

468
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,826
I'm just wondering
how you could be sure

469
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,920
any of this happened at all.

470
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,748
Well, that's easy.

471
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,287
When I saw the reports
about Kathleen,

472
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:39,082
Liz's death started coming
back to me in flashbacks.

473
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,376
Right, and... I'm sorry.

474
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,753
You've been having flashbacks?

475
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:45,143
Yes.

476
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:49,232
They come in short scenes,
they're very vivid.

477
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,972
Um...

478
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:56,142
Just to be clear,
you-you're referring

479
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:59,603
to these mental images
as... flashbacks

480
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:01,865
and not actual memories.

481
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,069
Yes.

482
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:04,816
Hmm. Isn't it also true

483
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,526
that you remained employed

484
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,487
by Michael Peterson
for the period of a year

485
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,756
following the event?

486
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:14,563
Isn't that a questionable thing to
do if you thought he was a murderer?

487
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,369
But that's why I did it.

488
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:17,829
I wanted to keep an eye on them.

489
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:21,666
Michael was very strict
with the boys.

490
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,294
- Alright, well, let's stay on topic.
- I am.

491
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:27,130
I stayed because I didn't want
the same for the girls.

492
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:29,549
- Objection, Your Honor.
- I failed.

493
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,760
I should have
protected you, Martha-Baby.

494
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:33,219
I should have
protected you from him.

495
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:34,471
Your Honor, move to strike.

496
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:38,308
Get to the car.

497
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,355
Mr. Peterson, did you beat
your baby daughter in Germany?

498
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:46,024
Mr. Peterson,
just one question. Tell us...

499
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:50,418
- Martha!
- Jesus Christ, Martha.

500
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,865
Martha.

501
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:55,506
Hey. Are you okay?

502
00:25:57,578 --> 00:25:59,913
- Come on! What the fuck, Martha!
- Martha.

503
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,539
Martha.
Martha, knock it off. Todd!

504
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:02,832
I'm trying, okay.

505
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,209
Open the door, dammit.

506
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,544
- What was Agnes talking about?
- Open up!

507
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:07,777
What was she going to say?

508
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:09,089
How do I know?

509
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,121
She's a broken woman
who wants her 15 minutes.

510
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:13,510
She told me the truth.
She said that she loved us.

511
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,804
For Christ's sake.
Now is not the time.

512
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:17,011
Martha!

513
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:18,139
Just answer the question.
Please.

514
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,475
I'm telling you,
she's full of crap.

515
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,352
Then why do I feel like this?

516
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:23,742
Michael!

517
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:27,132
- Martha.
- Because they want you to.

518
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:28,733
Now open the goddamn door.

519
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:30,986
Martha.

520
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,612
- Michael!
- Dad.

521
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:34,239
- Only one question.
- Now!

522
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:35,946
Mr. Peterson.
Mr. Peterson, one question.

523
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,671
Mr. Peterson.

524
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:40,912
Mr. Peterson, one question.

525
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:42,595
Damn it, Martha!

526
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,003
Come on. Hurry, Todd.

527
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:50,353
Mr. Peterson!

528
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:55,301
<i>Now about subjectivity,</i>

529
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:58,653
<i>how can we relate to stories
that threaten our own?</i>

530
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,643
<i>Some of us go
toward the threat.</i>

531
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:06,452
<i>We search
and question and dig.</i>

532
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:14,293
<i>And some of us rationalize.</i>

533
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:19,382
<i>Try to force the stories
to fit together.</i>

534
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:33,214
<i>Some of us simply don't engae</i>

535
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:36,649
<i>and bury the thread
deep inside.</i>

536
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:42,362
<i>And some of us...</i>

537
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,325
<i>seem not to be
threatened at all.</i>

538
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:57,113
So we open Mike's defense
with the jury walk-through.

539
00:27:57,197 --> 00:28:01,826
Now this provides the context
for all the experts,

540
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,328
all the science,

541
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:06,331
and says we, the defense,

542
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,293
are going to invite them in.

543
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,042
Why wouldn't we? Alright.

544
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:12,796
The staircase is an open book,

545
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,255
and so are we

546
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,926
because we have nothing to hide.

547
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,058
David, I'm not sure it's a good idea.

548
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:23,181
Hey, look who I found
creeping outside.

549
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:25,475
- Oh my god!
- How you doing, Clay?

550
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,865
Clay.

551
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,395
- Clay!
- Oh, hey.

552
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,537
Hey, guys. Hey, Mom.

553
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,361
Hey, Clay. What's up, man?

554
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:38,238
Uh, yeah, nothing much.
I just, uh...

555
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:41,449
How-how long
are you in town for?

556
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,034
Uh, I took a couple weeks off.

557
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:45,120
I thought maybe
I could get the Trans-Am

558
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:46,510
up and running again.

559
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,890
I wanted to help,
so I came home.

560
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:56,604
I hope that's okay?

561
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:03,152
I'm glad you're here.

562
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:07,058
- Your Honor, how are you?
- Great. Great.

563
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:09,928
- Are we ready to bring in the jurors?
- I believe we are.

564
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:14,732
Darren,
please bring in the jurors.

565
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:16,749
Alright, let's go, people.

566
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:24,632
Here you go.

567
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:35,142
<i>What would you
say is a storyteller's job?</i>

568
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:38,548
Hmm.

569
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:40,000
<i>What do you mean?</i>

570
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:41,259
This way.

571
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,943
<i>I mean, should he present the truth</i>

572
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:46,153
<i>as he sees it?</i>

573
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,533
<i>Or is persuasion
also part of his job?</i>

574
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:55,023
<i>Maybe she can do both.</i>

575
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:56,446
<i>But, you know,
in my experience,</i>

576
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:59,048
<i>people don't like
to be persuaded.</i>

577
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:06,534
<i>So the storyteller must accept
that she can control</i>

578
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,786
<i>what the story says</i>

579
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,331
<i>but not how it is read.</i>

580
00:30:28,473 --> 00:30:30,350
<i>You can only
show what looks to you</i>

581
00:30:30,434 --> 00:30:31,782
<i>like the truth...</i>

582
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:37,204
knowing that it may look
to someone else like a lie.

583
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:41,208
I swung my weapon at you.

584
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:45,963
And here you can see
the cast-off pattern.

585
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,951
We found no cast-off

586
00:30:48,035 --> 00:30:50,092
in the staircase
at the Peterson house.

587
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:53,164
And what do you make

588
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:56,167
of the blood spatter

589
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:59,837
that you did find, Dr. Lee?

590
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:03,800
That it
is plentiful and chaotic,

591
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:07,679
like someone coughing,
shaking her head,

592
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:09,806
moving around.

593
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,031
Not an organized attack.

594
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,102
Hey, Rain Man.

595
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:16,055
So in your
opinion, Dr. Lee...

596
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:16,859
Knock it off.

597
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:17,930
...would you say

598
00:31:18,015 --> 00:31:20,672
Kathleen's death
was an accident?

599
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,492
In my opinion, yes.

600
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:27,132
The scene is more consistent
with a fall.

601
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:30,243
There was simply way
too much blood for beating.

602
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:32,898
I mean...

603
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:37,930
You oppose SBI agent
Duane Deaver's findings?

604
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:41,001
But didn't you recently
complement his skills

605
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:42,883
as a blood spatter analyst?

606
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:44,382
I don't recall.

607
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:45,466
Okay.

608
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,943
Do you recall giving him
a copy of your book?

609
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:51,639
Oh yes.

610
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:52,890
May I approach, Your Honor?

611
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:55,157
- You may.
- Thank you.

612
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:03,249
Please read this inscription
right here.

613
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:09,991
"To Agent Deaver,
one of the best.

614
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:13,536
Keep up the good work.
Sincerely, Dr. Henry Lee."

615
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,386
Thank you.

616
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:23,504
You wouldn't write that if you
didn't feel that way, would you?

617
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:24,894
Well...

618
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:27,091
I give everyone courtesy.

619
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:29,427
That's Chinese culture.

620
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:32,430
Uh, what was I
supposed to write,

621
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:35,767
"Dear Duane.
Don't quit your day job"?

622
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:47,070
Dr. Lee,

623
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:49,864
you can't definitively
rule out a beating

624
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:52,075
in the death
of Kathleen Peterson, can you?

625
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,494
No.

626
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:56,135
But no one can.

627
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,307
Thank you. That's all.

628
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:08,299
<i>It's an outrage.</i>

629
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:09,509
<i>Pure and simple.</i>

630
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:11,761
<i>So I think we take some fund,</i>

631
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:13,388
form an exploratory committee,

632
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,099
and see if we can find out

633
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:18,351
what went wrong.

634
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:21,053
See, that's
exactly the sort of answer

635
00:33:21,138 --> 00:33:22,730
I want to change.

636
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:26,317
Maybe discussing
potentially evaluating

637
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:28,111
actually doing something.

638
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:31,114
- Now...
- I want to talk about the lie.

639
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:33,616
Uh, sir, you need
to submit questions.

640
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,619
You said you received
a Purple Heart in Vietnam.

641
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:38,204
- Sir...
- Now, now, hold on a minute.

642
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:39,664
That's a sacred thing.

643
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,874
And you know what? You didn't.

644
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,585
- Sir, if you can just take a seat?
- Can I be heard?

645
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:47,463
That's not something
you make a mistake about.

646
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,202
No, sir.

647
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:49,415
If you would
like to submit a question...

648
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:52,117
You lied! He lied! He lied!

649
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:54,190
If you could
just calm down, please, sir?

650
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:19,162
And to top it all off,

651
00:34:19,246 --> 00:34:20,621
we have an
imaginary murder weapon.

652
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:24,876
So, uh, at the risk
of tempting fate,

653
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,378
I think Tom would agree that
we are about ready to close.

654
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:30,855
- Yes?
- I want to testify.

655
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:41,350
Look, Mike, uh,
we've been over this.

656
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:43,728
No. They, they don't know me.

657
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:45,396
Who doesn't know you, Mike?

658
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,356
No, the jury.

659
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,442
Now, it's, it's my life
on the line here.

660
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:51,819
And I want to tell my story.

661
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:54,947
You know, tell them
how much I loved Kathleen.

662
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:57,241
You know, I deserve
to be heard here, don't I?

663
00:34:57,325 --> 00:34:58,794
- Yeah. Dad's right.
- Clayton.

664
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,161
- No, he deserves to talk.
- Come on. Come on.

665
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:02,387
- He's the one on trial.
- Listen!

666
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:05,750
Listen. I hear what
you're saying, Mike.

667
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:06,834
I do.

668
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,420
I... just listen
to me for a second.

669
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:13,466
I know how nerves can flare up
at the eleventh hour.

670
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,108
But we cannot let them
take the wheel.

671
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:21,349
Your case is strong.
We just have to stay calm.

672
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,115
See it through to the end.

673
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,657
Come on, motherfucker! Come on!

674
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:49,085
Come on!

675
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,979
Yes!

676
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,986
Fuck me!

677
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:15,403
I found it. I found it.

678
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:17,153
I found it.
I found it. I found it.

679
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:20,672
I found it!

680
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:25,705
I found the fucking blow poke!

681
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:27,618
Clayton, don't
fuck with us right now.

682
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:28,874
- Seriously, don't fuck with us.
- I am "us."

683
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,418
Why would I fuck with us?

684
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:32,378
I found it right there
just like that.

685
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:35,172
You found it right there because
you fucking planted it right there.

686
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:36,749
What? I didn't plant it!

687
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:38,796
Jesus! What the fuck
is wrong with you?

688
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:40,438
This is a good thing.

689
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:43,529
It's not like
there's blood on it.

690
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,199
Of course, there's
no fucking blood on it.

691
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:50,605
You know what?
This is so classic you.

692
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:52,315
You come home out of nowhere
and you come and you fuck up our shit.

693
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,456
Would you both just shut up!

694
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:56,959
Just shut up.

695
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:02,381
I mean, I don't believe it.

696
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:06,176
How many times
did they search this place?

697
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,557
I should call Dave, right?

698
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,771
Dad?

699
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:23,773
She must have put it there.

700
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,768
<i>Look, Mike, the thing's intact.</i>

701
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:30,409
There's no blood.

702
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:33,022
This could be good,

703
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:33,773
provided you're telling
the truth.

704
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:36,150
Well, of course, I am. Jesus!

705
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,737
Alright, so we hold
all the cards here, right?

706
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:41,489
This works for us.

707
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,325
The DA says the blow poke's
the murder weapon.

708
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,035
We prove him wrong.
It's right here.

709
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,787
It's fucking clean.

710
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:49,622
What else are they wrong about?

711
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:51,728
Right?

712
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,399
Now, if you can
answer these next ones

713
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:56,212
just as truthfully as you can.

714
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:58,506
Alright? Because if we
put you on the stand

715
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,299
to say how you found
the blow poke,

716
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:04,095
Hardin will zero in
on any uncertainty,

717
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:06,138
any, um, evasion.

718
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:08,140
Right. Of course. You got it.

719
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:09,725
Okay.

720
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,185
Alright.

721
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:14,188
So I understand you have a DUI

722
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,778
on your record, is that right?

723
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,901
Two DUIs?

724
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:22,279
Good. Uh, always be honest.
Don't let him catch you lying.

725
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:23,948
Alright.

726
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:28,327
Uh, April 1994, you were
a sophomore in college.

727
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:30,705
Got in a little trouble,
is that right?

728
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:33,874
Yep. Went on spring break.

729
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,960
Right.

730
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:38,796
And, uh, how much
prison time ultimately

731
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,006
did you end up
spending for planting

732
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,481
those pipe bombs in Duke?

733
00:38:45,553 --> 00:38:46,804
Well, they didn't go off.

734
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,320
To be fair,
they weren't designed to.

735
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:49,943
They were just like a diversion

736
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,851
so I could get
to the laminating machine.

737
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,227
Wait, the laminating machine?

738
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:54,603
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

739
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:57,231
To make fake IDs

740
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:59,859
to get beers for me
and my buddies.

741
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:03,571
But it was... uh, four years.

742
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:05,649
All told, four years
in Fed for the bombs.

743
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:08,617
It wouldn't have been that long
except they found more here in my room.

744
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,186
More bombs?

745
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:15,043
Do, do we really need
an audience?

746
00:39:15,128 --> 00:39:17,146
Uh, well, you're
going to have one in court.

747
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,670
My son is finishing
his second master's in May.

748
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:21,060
Computer engineering.

749
00:39:22,131 --> 00:39:24,606
That's great.
Turning over a new leaf.

750
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,986
But, um, while we are
still on the old one,

751
00:39:30,098 --> 00:39:33,809
I need to ask you
about July 4th, 2001.

752
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,854
Oh yeah.
I, I was drunk, I guess.

753
00:39:36,938 --> 00:39:40,164
And me and Becky had a fight.
She called the cops.

754
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,375
Because?

755
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:47,364
You hit her, correct?

756
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:52,950
We had a fight,
and I shoved her once.

757
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:55,915
Not hit. She called the cops,
but she forgave me.

758
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,868
- We're, we're engaged now.
- H-h-hang on.

759
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,510
Tom, h-how can they
even bring that in?

760
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:05,216
Uh, look, they get a whiff
of domestic violence,

761
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,469
this could be
a real issue for us,

762
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:09,887
given what Agnes has alleged.

763
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:12,223
Victims often become
the abusers.

764
00:40:12,307 --> 00:40:16,602
Right? They'll ask,
did your father ever hit you?

765
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:18,979
- What?
- Ever hit Kathleen?

766
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:21,607
No, my dad never
hit anyone. I would have seen.

767
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:23,361
Okay, but maybe there
are things that happened

768
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:25,148
in this house
that you don't know about.

769
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:30,538
You're aware that the state
has pornographic photos

770
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:33,744
and videos
from your dad's computer.

771
00:40:33,828 --> 00:40:36,831
Did you know anything
about that prior to the trial?

772
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:40,417
Uh, about any of what?
Can you be more specific?

773
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:42,127
Uh, his sexuality.

774
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:43,769
Oh, well...

775
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,573
he's a pretty sexual person.

776
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,677
I was always jealous of him
and Kathleen's sex life.

777
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:51,053
Ew! Oh my God.

778
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:52,680
Jesus Christ, Clayton.

779
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,431
What, Todd?
Nothing but the truth.

780
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:56,767
Okay. R-right.
Uh, specifically,

781
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:59,034
were you aware
of his interest in men?

782
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,508
I-I mean,
we never talked about it.

783
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,503
Because a son's role is not
to question his father, right?

784
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:12,199
But I walked in on him
jacking off once

785
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:15,024
to something kind of gay.

786
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:18,153
- What?
- Petersons are fucking crazy.

787
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:19,999
What do you mean, the Petersons?

788
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:21,908
I mean, you and Todd and Dad.

789
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:23,919
Like, why can't you guys
just be normal?

790
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:26,043
Margie, can you keep
your little sister in check?

791
00:41:26,128 --> 00:41:28,628
No, she's right. I'm sick
of defending you guys, too.

792
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:31,510
Oh, really? Really. You're going
to say that in front of our mother?

793
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:33,751
Our mother, that took
you in off the street.

794
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:35,732
Well, all you
do is hit her up for money.

795
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:37,009
You guys make everything worse.

796
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:39,351
You rack up debt.
You embarrass us.

797
00:41:39,436 --> 00:41:41,288
- I mean, how are we supposed to...
- Hey!

798
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:45,078
I run a successful website.

799
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:47,650
You sound like a psychopath!

800
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:55,632
I beg your pardon, Michael.

801
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:58,787
It's the children.

802
00:41:58,871 --> 00:42:01,290
You'd be in some fucked-up
German brothel right now, okay?

803
00:42:04,252 --> 00:42:06,337
- Hey!
- I said, be quiet!

804
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:08,645
That's enough!

805
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,011
Clay's not testifying.

806
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:16,639
- But, Dad...
- Forget it!

807
00:42:16,723 --> 00:42:21,560
If anyone is going to testify
about this fucking blow poke,

808
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:25,230
it's going to be me!
And I am going to testify.

809
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:27,024
For the good of my case,
for the good of this family.

810
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:30,375
And before we all
fucking kill each other.

811
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:44,208
Should have just stayed
in Baltimore.

812
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:55,010
No use trying, David.
My mind's made up.

813
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:56,407
Uh-huh.

814
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,650
Well, maybe you're right.

815
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:01,418
Can we talk it through?

816
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:05,187
They are going to ask you

817
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:07,621
about the Purple Heart

818
00:43:08,316 --> 00:43:10,609
to establish a pattern of lying.

819
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:12,334
Well, I...

820
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,663
it's true, I lied about that.

821
00:43:14,898 --> 00:43:17,658
About being injured in Vietnam.

822
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:22,204
And you told everyone,
including Kathleen,

823
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:25,847
that for your bravery,
you earned a Purple Heart?

824
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,184
Why, Mike?

825
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:30,935
Because...

826
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:33,814
I was injured,

827
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:36,107
just not in the war.

828
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:38,387
It was afterward.

829
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:41,446
A car accident when
I was stationed in Japan.

830
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:44,810
But I do have a Silver Star.

831
00:43:44,894 --> 00:43:46,937
And a Bronze Star, with valor,

832
00:43:47,021 --> 00:43:50,414
because... once...

833
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:55,293
a marine in my command
was blown up by a grenade.

834
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,259
Here.

835
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:04,635
John Cuddy.

836
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,920
We were close.

837
00:44:12,004 --> 00:44:14,230
I dragged his mutilated body
back to the foxhole.

838
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,403
He died in my arms.

839
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:24,530
So did Kathleen.

840
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:32,539
You learn CPR
in the military, don't you?

841
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:34,985
Yes.

842
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:37,419
Well, when you
first called 911...

843
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:42,340
you said Kathleen
was still breathing.

844
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:46,121
Then you called back

845
00:44:46,205 --> 00:44:47,748
a couple minutes later,
said she wasn't.

846
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,639
In between, did you perform CPR?

847
00:44:50,751 --> 00:44:52,058
No.

848
00:44:52,587 --> 00:44:55,228
- No. I was in shock.
- Shock?

849
00:44:57,008 --> 00:44:58,967
Vietnam vet.

850
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:00,511
Bunch of different colored stars

851
00:45:00,595 --> 00:45:02,846
and obviously saw combat.

852
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,863
You went into shock?

853
00:45:07,768 --> 00:45:10,952
It wasn't like war.
It wasn't like anything.

854
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:13,107
It was just,

855
00:45:13,191 --> 00:45:14,539
just her...

856
00:45:15,776 --> 00:45:17,375
in pain...

857
00:45:18,821 --> 00:45:20,962
leaving me...

858
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:24,660
and me begging her not to go

859
00:45:24,744 --> 00:45:27,511
and... she wouldn't listen.

860
00:45:29,957 --> 00:45:31,623
It was the worst moment
of my life.

861
00:45:33,836 --> 00:45:35,477
I believe you, Mike.

862
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,383
But how does a jury know

863
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:42,317
it's not just
another Purple Heart?

864
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:46,947
Not just another lie.

865
00:45:48,643 --> 00:45:50,310
I want to leave it
up to you, I do.

866
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:51,812
I mean, it's your life.

867
00:45:51,896 --> 00:45:54,231
But I can get the blow poke in

868
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:55,315
without putting you
or Clay on the stand,

869
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,485
and your case
won't suffer for it.

870
00:45:58,569 --> 00:45:59,955
But if I don't tell them...

871
00:46:02,365 --> 00:46:03,964
how will they know?

872
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,516
Let me know what you decide.

873
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:25,651
Dad.

874
00:46:27,556 --> 00:46:29,030
It's fine, Clay.

875
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:39,408
<i>A coup
for the defense today</i>

876
00:46:39,562 --> 00:46:41,338
<i>at the tail end
of the Peterson trial</i>

877
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,072
<i>as the alleged murder weapon
has surfaced.</i>

878
00:46:44,156 --> 00:46:45,616
<i>Rudolf has produced</i>

879
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,910
<i>the so-called
missing blow poke,</i>

880
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:50,078
<i>arguing that Durham PD
did not search</i>

881
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:51,288
<i>thoroughly enough for it</i>

882
00:46:51,372 --> 00:46:53,290
<i>and failed to ever ask
the defense</i>

883
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:54,625
<i>whether it had been found.</i>

884
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:56,585
Alright. Does this appear
to be the blow poke

885
00:46:56,669 --> 00:46:59,811
that Mr. Hardin mentioned
in his opening statement

886
00:47:01,215 --> 00:47:04,149
as being mysteriously missing?

887
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:07,359
Yes, it does.

888
00:47:08,514 --> 00:47:11,072
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

889
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:14,659
You may be dismissed.

890
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,855
Alright.

891
00:47:16,939 --> 00:47:19,733
Does that witness conclude
your case, Mr. Rudolf?

892
00:47:37,084 --> 00:47:38,390
Yes, it does, Your Honor.

893
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:41,269
The defense rests.

894
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:52,015
<i>Though it's not yet clear
whether this ninth-inning discovery</i>

895
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:54,685
<i>has given the jury
more questions or answers,</i>

896
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:56,603
<i>it certainly
has changed the game.</i>

897
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:57,639
Sneaky shits.

898
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,148
<i>Ultimately, um,</i>

899
00:47:59,232 --> 00:48:00,866
<i>you know what,
it doesn't change the autopsy.</i>

900
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,360
<i>My mother was beaten to death,
whether it be with a blow poke</i>

901
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:05,362
<i>or something else,
and Michael Peterson did it.</i>

902
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:06,947
Amen, sweetheart.

903
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:09,497
<i>Caitlin Peterson,
where was the weapon found?</i>

904
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:11,410
Okay. How does this bit sound?

905
00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:15,163
Do you really think
Kathleen knew

906
00:48:15,247 --> 00:48:17,472
Michael was bisexual?

907
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:21,461
Does that make
common sense to you?

908
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:25,090
Do you think
it was okay with her

909
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:27,273
that he was writing
those emails to Brad?

910
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:29,011
I'm not even going to mention

911
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:31,805
the rest of what we found
on his computer

912
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:33,807
because it is obscene.

913
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:35,907
I-I'm sorry. Obscene?

914
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:38,117
Obscene.

915
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:40,314
Is that the best
we got for this guy?

916
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:44,234
No, he beat his wife like a dog!

917
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:46,167
I want to nail his ass
to the wall.

918
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,250
<i>Not to mention</i>

919
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:04,880
the rest of what we found

920
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:07,313
on Mr. Peterson's computer,

921
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:09,983
because it is filth.

922
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:16,933
Pure-T... filth.

923
00:49:29,363 --> 00:49:32,839
This is hardcore porn.

924
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:39,873
This ain't people involved
in relationships.

925
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,343
This is just any-which-way.

926
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:47,381
And it is not how
so-called soul mates...

927
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:49,633
conduct themselves.

928
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,968
Your job is not to decide

929
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:54,137
whether Michael is innocent.

930
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:55,389
Your job is to decide

931
00:49:55,473 --> 00:49:58,183
whether the prosecution

932
00:49:58,267 --> 00:50:02,410
has sufficiently proven guilt.

933
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,078
Which they have not.

934
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:08,402
Their case is riddled
with holes,

935
00:50:08,486 --> 00:50:12,114
unanswered questions,

936
00:50:12,198 --> 00:50:15,757
doubt after reasonable doubt.

937
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:25,168
The missing murder weapon

938
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:28,061
isn't missing.

939
00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:31,105
And it was never used...

940
00:50:32,593 --> 00:50:34,150
in a murder.

941
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,723
There is no credible motive.

942
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:42,450
And you don't just decide
to kill your wife for no reason.

943
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:45,355
I think about that old expression,

944
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:47,441
what if these walls could talk?

945
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:49,526
Ladies and gentlemen,

946
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,150
the people contend to you

947
00:50:51,235 --> 00:50:52,395
that these walls are talking.

948
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:55,854
Kathleen Peterson

949
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,243
is talking to us
through the blood

950
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:01,329
on these walls.

951
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:04,040
She is screaming out

952
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:07,085
for truth and for justice.

953
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:09,045
The defense has told us

954
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:12,021
Kathleen Peterson died
in an accident.

955
00:51:14,176 --> 00:51:15,482
But Kathleen

956
00:51:16,303 --> 00:51:17,609
is telling us

957
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:20,280
she died of murder.

958
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:26,146
<i>Kathleen was my life.</i>

959
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,732
<i>I've whispered her name
in my heart a thousand times.</i>

960
00:51:32,486 --> 00:51:34,552
<i>I would never have done
anything to hurt her.</i>

961
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:40,327
<i>And we will prove it in cour.</i>

962
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:42,287
<i>December 21st, 2001,</i>

963
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:44,748
<i>Michael Peterson turned
himself in to the police.</i>

964
00:51:44,832 --> 00:51:46,458
<i>Only five years earlier,</i>

965
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,251
<i>the future looked bright
for Michael and Kathleen,</i>

966
00:51:48,335 --> 00:51:51,379
<i>getting married at their
Forest Hills mansion with family.</i>

967
00:51:51,463 --> 00:51:54,898
<i>To Kathleen, our sister.</i>

968
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:57,525
<i>And to Michael,</i>

969
00:51:58,345 --> 00:52:00,388
<i>our new brother.</i>

970
00:52:00,472 --> 00:52:02,599
<i>Kathleen's
sisters now find themselves</i>

971
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:04,267
<i>standing with the prosecutio,</i>

972
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:05,644
<i>hoping for the jury to delivr</i>

973
00:52:05,728 --> 00:52:07,729
<i>some justice for their siste.</i>

974
00:52:07,813 --> 00:52:10,398
<i>Well, it's
going to be a beautiful sunny day today.</i>

975
00:52:10,482 --> 00:52:12,400
<i>And we can expect
much more of the same</i>

976
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:13,735
<i>over the next
couple of days.</i>

977
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:14,110
<i>You might want
to do something...</i>

978
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:16,294
Todd?

979
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:19,324
Margaret?

980
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:23,343
Kids?

981
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,155
Ms. Forewoman,
would you please pass

982
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:00,545
the bailiff the verdict?

983
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:05,300
Thank you.

984
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:33,273
Now, if you think you're going
to have difficulty

985
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:34,691
accepting the jury's verdict,

986
00:53:34,775 --> 00:53:37,736
we're going to give you
an opportunity

987
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,377
to leave right now.

988
00:53:44,702 --> 00:53:46,259
Alright, Ms. Clerk.

989
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:50,415
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

990
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:52,500
you have returned
the following verdict

991
00:53:52,584 --> 00:53:54,336
in the case of
State of North Carolina

992
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,436
versus Michael Iver Peterson.

993
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:02,483
And...
that's all she wrote.

994
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:06,779
Want to grab another?

995
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:09,267
We got that nice Pinot
from Bill.

996
00:54:09,351 --> 00:54:12,118
Mm. I should
really call it a day.

997
00:54:13,105 --> 00:54:15,732
I still have
to check that email.

998
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:18,234
Well,
I don't know who you are,

999
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,237
but my wife never says no
to a second bottle.

1000
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:23,782
Oh, she sounds fun.

1001
00:54:23,866 --> 00:54:25,732
She is.

1002
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:31,591
Oh hey.

1003
00:56:35,455 --> 00:56:36,804
You're still up.

1004
00:56:42,629 --> 00:56:44,729
What's up?

1005
00:56:47,342 --> 00:56:48,648
Kathleen?

1006
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,278
I always knew, I think,

1007
00:56:52,806 --> 00:56:54,447
somewhere underneath.

1008
00:56:55,684 --> 00:56:57,560
I mean, who knows,
maybe I even liked it.

1009
00:56:57,645 --> 00:57:00,120
What are you talking about?

1010
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,167
Why didn't you tell me?

1011
00:57:07,988 --> 00:57:10,281
You could have told me.
It could have been our secret.

1012
00:57:10,365 --> 00:57:11,671
I think...

1013
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,452
Yeah, I-I think I could
have lived with that.

1014
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:17,011
Kathleen, come on.
What are you talking about?

1015
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:22,683
I'm talking...

1016
00:57:25,923 --> 00:57:28,814
I'm talking about the porn...

1017
00:57:29,843 --> 00:57:31,678
and the escorts and the men,

1018
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:34,904
the men, the men!

1019
00:57:40,062 --> 00:57:42,453
Whatever you think you saw...

1020
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:44,649
you're drunk.

1021
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:47,041
I'm a writer.

1022
00:57:47,569 --> 00:57:49,794
Alright?

1023
00:57:50,822 --> 00:57:52,240
It's called research.

1024
00:57:52,324 --> 00:57:53,783
Research?

1025
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,424
Oh my God.

1026
00:57:56,328 --> 00:57:58,678
Stop lying, Michael.

1027
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:03,001
Oh, God, the lying!

1028
00:58:03,085 --> 00:58:06,462
The arrogance, the selfishness.

1029
00:58:06,546 --> 00:58:07,547
I mean, Jesus!

1030
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:10,967
You have managed me
and humiliated me,

1031
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:12,760
and I swore to myself
that I would never be

1032
00:58:12,844 --> 00:58:14,817
this woman again,
this fucking victim.

1033
00:58:14,902 --> 00:58:17,021
Kathleen, come on. Come on.

1034
00:58:17,106 --> 00:58:18,545
This is ridiculous.
Let's just...

1035
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,334
Oh no, you don't, pal.
Not this time.

1036
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:22,854
No, no, you don't get to Michael
Peterson your way out of this.

1037
00:58:22,938 --> 00:58:24,647
- Listen to me.
- No.

1038
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:27,540
No, you listen to me!

1039
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:44,849
I am, I am your wife.

1040
00:58:52,592 --> 00:58:54,859
And I'm, I'm leaving you.

1041
00:58:55,095 --> 00:58:57,180
No, you're not.

1042
00:58:57,264 --> 00:58:59,849
You're, you're tired
and you're drunk...

1043
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:00,850
I am not drunk!
Stop saying that.

1044
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:04,395
I am not drunk. I am leaving!

1045
00:59:04,479 --> 00:59:06,731
I am done
playing house with you!

1046
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:08,399
Lower your voice.
Lower your voice, Kathleen.

1047
00:59:08,483 --> 00:59:09,317
You are nothing
but a fucking fraud.

1048
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:13,029
You are nothing
but a thief and a con man.

1049
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:15,156
And you have nothing.

1050
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,784
You are nothing.
Do you hear me, Michael?

1051
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:19,786
I have given my whole life

1052
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:20,954
to a pathetic
closet case nothing!

1053
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:24,040
I said shut up!

1054
00:59:24,124 --> 00:59:25,430
Oh!

1055
00:59:31,173 --> 00:59:32,382
Stop!

1056
00:59:41,808 --> 00:59:43,114
Oh my God.

1057
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:45,917
Oh God.

1058
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:48,143
Kathleen. Fuck!

1059
00:59:49,441 --> 00:59:50,747
Just... Oh my God.

1060
00:59:54,279 --> 00:59:55,947
Oh fuck. Fuck!

1061
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,337
Fuck.

1062
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:03,219
Oh God.

1063
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:08,334
Alright. Okay?
Here you go.

1064
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:11,671
No. No, honey.
Honey, it's okay.

1065
01:00:11,755 --> 01:00:13,756
Here you go. You're okay.

1066
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,758
You see? You're alright.

1067
01:00:15,842 --> 01:00:17,191
No, no, no.

1068
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:23,280
You're alright. It's okay.

1069
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:25,268
It's okay.

1070
01:00:25,352 --> 01:00:26,858
Uh, you tripped.

1071
01:00:52,254 --> 01:00:54,130
Oh God. Baby.

1072
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:00,067
Honey, you're alright.

1073
01:01:00,554 --> 01:01:02,111
Okay. Okay.

1074
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:08,701
Kathleen?

1075
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:11,773
Kathleen.

1076
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:42,678
Ms. Foreperson,
on behalf of the jury,

1077
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:44,445
do you affirm this verdict?

1078
01:01:45,765 --> 01:01:47,573
ForewoYes.

1079
01:01:49,936 --> 01:01:52,661
Mr. Peterson, would you
please stand where you are?

1080
01:01:57,194 --> 01:01:58,361
Is there
anything that you would like to say

1081
01:01:58,445 --> 01:02:00,711
before the court
imposes sentencing?

1082
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:04,047
I would only...

1083
01:02:07,454 --> 01:02:08,704
It's okay.

1084
01:02:08,788 --> 01:02:10,930
It's okay.

1085
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,558
It's okay.

1086
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:16,254
It's okay.

1087
01:02:19,466 --> 01:02:21,997
Alright, Ms.
Clerk, the defendant is imprisoned

1088
01:02:22,091 --> 01:02:24,679
to the state of North Carolina
Department of Corrections

1089
01:02:24,763 --> 01:02:26,889
for the remainder
of his natural life

1090
01:02:26,973 --> 01:02:28,697
without the benefit of parole.

1091
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:33,023
Bailiff, would you please take
the prisoner into custody?

1092
01:03:02,634 --> 01:03:03,676
Hold here.

1093
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,568
You'll be taken outside
in a minute.

1094
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:37,307
Not now, Jean. Please.

1095
01:03:55,395 --> 01:03:58,495
- Are you alright?
- No, I'm not.

1096
01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:03,834
I'm scared.

1097
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:09,715
<i>Okay, Sophie.</i>

1098
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:13,927
Let's try this again.

1099
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:18,519
What is your relationship
with Michael Peterson?

1100
01:04:26,593 --> 01:04:28,594
<i>It's okay.</i>

1101
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:30,263
<i>Mr. Peterson, would
you please stand where you are?</i>

1102
01:04:30,347 --> 01:04:31,889
<i>Alright, Ms. Clerk.</i>

1103
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:34,183
<i>The defendant is imprisoned
to the state of North Carolina</i>

1107
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:43,651
<i>Bailiff,

1108
01:04:43,735 --> 01:04:45,194
<i>the prisoner into custody.</i>

1109
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:46,612
<i>Dear Michael...</i>

1110
01:04:46,696 --> 01:04:49,630
<i>you don't know me,
but I know you.</i>

1111
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:56,163
<i>I've followed your story
with bated breath,</i>

1112
01:04:56,247 --> 01:04:58,847
<i>hoping for the exoneration
you so deserve.</i>

1113
01:05:01,836 --> 01:05:04,130
<i>I know you're innocent
and that you and your family</i>

1114
01:05:04,214 --> 01:05:07,231
<i>have been failed
by a broken justice system.</i>

1115
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:14,015
<i>I know because I've seen it,</i>

1116

<i>moment by moment,
frame by frame.</i>

1117

<i>And rest assured,

1118
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:37,386
<i>your story will be told.</i>

1119
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:40,055

Hm?

1123
01:05:52,345 --> 01:05:54,680
<i>Kathleen and I
were watching a movie,</i>

1124
01:05:54,764 --> 01:05:57,433
<i>um, "America's Sweethearts."</i>

1125
01:05:57,517 --> 01:06:00,534
<i>I-I think it was probably
