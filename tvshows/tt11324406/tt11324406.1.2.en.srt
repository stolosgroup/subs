Pour vous.

3
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,978
Didn't Mom used to
put pineapples on it?

4
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,938
I looked, I, I
couldn't find any.

5
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,774
Well, it's going to be perfect.

6
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,403
Um... Let's use
the fancy glasses.

7
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,488
Yeah?

8
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,796
Hey!

9
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,381
Get! Get!

10
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,896
Hey.

11
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,316
Just one more.

12
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,736
That's it.

13
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,488
Look what I found upstairs.

14
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,367
Oh, wow.

15
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,536
Mom's Christmas sweaters.

16
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,370
She kept all of them.

17
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,873
She bought a new
one for this year.

18
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,085
Might be Dad.

19
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,298
Nope, it's the DA.
Won't fucking let up.

20
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,844
Jesus!

21
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,760
It's your Auntie Blair. Hmm?

22
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,188
I got it. I got it.

23
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,072
- Good luck.
- Yes. Hello?

24
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:04,947
Blair Merry Christmas, Margie.

25
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,366
Merry Christmas to you.

26
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,327
Did you get to mass?

27
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,512
No, we didn't make it to church.

28
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,581
- But you prayed, though.
- Yeah, we prayed.

29
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,251
Margie, I've been thinking
about Thanksgiving,

30
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,544
what we spoke about?

31
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,962
This has nothing
to do with that.

32
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,148
I don't want to talk about it.

33
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,882
But I've been thinking
about you girls,

34
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,093
- about what happened in Germany.
- You know we don't

35
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,970
remember Germany.

36
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,890
Look, our ham is
ready. I got to go.

37
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,451
- Okay. I'm here if you need me.
- Merry Christmas.

38
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,685
God bless you girls.

39
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,907
Got it?

40
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,325
- - Yeah.
- - It's Dad.

41
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,080
Electronic voice: This is a call
from the Durham County Jail.

42
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,415
Do you accept the charges?

43
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,334
Yes, I accept the charges.

44
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,210
Well, isn't that sweet of you?

45
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,088
I cover your ass for 25 years,

46
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,210
and now you're finally willing
to cough up some dough.

47
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,300
Yeah, for now.

48
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,461
I mean, it depends how long
they keep you in there for.

49
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,805
Has your bail posted yet?

50
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,722
Any day now.

51
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,975
Uh, put Margaret on
the phone, will you?

52
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,606
- Hey, Dad.
- You guys unwrap presents yet?

53
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,108
Uh, no, not yet.

54
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,818
They're not gonna
do it themselves.

55
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,696
I know. It's just, it's
not the same without you.

56
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,406
Honey, nothing feels
right about this.

57
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,703
The DA keeps calling.

58
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,246
Well, you just
keep ignoring him.

59
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,459
So, have you spoken
to Candace or Lori?

60
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,085
I haven't gotten through.

61
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,713
Uh-uh, no.

62
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,548
What? Really? Nothing?

63
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,631
No.

64
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,473
Look, just make sure
everyone sticks together.

65
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,601
I miss you.

66
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,894
I miss you, too.

67
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,228
We all do.

68
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,730
I'll, I'll see you soon.

69
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,564
- Alright?
- Okay.

70
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,066
- I love you.
- I love you.

71
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,651
- Love you.
- Love you, Dad.

72
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,735
Love you. Bye.

73
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,093
Hi, you've reached Mark,
Ash, and Candace Zamperini.

74
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,386
Leave a message.

75
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,806
Automated This is a call
from the Durham County Jail.

76
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,351
Mark, darling, would
you stoke the fire.

77
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,550
It's getting a little chilly.

78
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,853
Sure.

79
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,642
- Jesus, man, be careful.
- Oh, fuck off, Todd.

80
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,920
Caitlin, open your present.

81
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,718
She remembered what I wanted.

82
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,361
It's the wrong one.

83
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,614
Well, she, she has lots
of presents to buy, so...

84
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,617
Had...

85
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,495
Mom just made a mistake.

86
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,331
People keep saying that
she just... made a mistake.

87
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,710
Like it's her fault
that she died.

88
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,879
Look, it could happen to anyone.

89
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,882
Alright? She just had
too much to drink and...

90
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,343
Stop saying that she was drunk.

91
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,221
No one said Mom
did anything wrong.

92
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,474
- It just happened.
- She had some wine.

93
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,019
She was stressed out because
she had to make money and work

94
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,621
- and take care of everybody!
- Caitlin, Caitlin...

95
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,772
No, she wasn't
drunk, Todd, okay,

96
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,524
you fucking asshole!

97
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,360
Why, why are you
suddenly calling her Mom?

98
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,321
It's not like you
ever called her that.

99
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,327
I mean, if she just
fell down the stairs...

100
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,541
You know, this... This
seems so fucking pointless.

101
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,045
Did you get those waiters?

102
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,006
For Saturday?

103
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,966
The ones with the bow ties.

104
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,050
Yeah. For Sunday.

105
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,512
Saturday.

106
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,056
The fundraiser's on Sunday.

107
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,811
- Who told you that?
- You did, Michael.

108
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,730
I'll be in New York on Saturday
for Caitlin's parents' weekend.

109
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,983
Shit.

110
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,426
You think anyone's
going to show?

111
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,421
You always worry about these
things, and they always work out.

112
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,039
They work because of you.

113
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,881
I'll be there.

114
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,842
Don't you worry.

115
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,146
Remember we promised you'd
give Clay a lift to school.

116
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,939
I remember!

117
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,901
Thanks for the ride.

118
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,152
Dad said it wasn't a big deal

119
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,445
since it's on your way to work.

120
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,697
It gives us a
chance to catch up.

121
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,199
It's hard when
everyone's so busy.

122
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:03,866
Yeah.

123
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,076
So what have you been up to?

124
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,871
Uh, you know, just
trying to figure out

125
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,206
my money situation.

126
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,875
It's, uh... it's, it's tight.

127
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,003
Yeah. There never seems
to be enough, right?

128
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,381
And Becky? Work's good for her?

129
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,050
You guys are good?

130
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,133
Yeah, we're, it's fine.

131
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,774
Woman Was the attack on
the World Trade Center...

132
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,944
In your professional opinion,

133
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,779
do you think we're
going to experience

134
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,862
a massive outbreak...

135
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,409
It's not your fault.

136
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,999
Ma'am, it's a mercy.

137
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,083
That's what we do.

138
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,003
Thank you, Officer.

139
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,604
You reach a clearing in
the middle of a forest.

140
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,773
Your footsteps are light.

141
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,611
Count each step in your mind.

142
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,989
One

143
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,158
two

144
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,120
three

145
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,414
- four...
- Four.

146
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,498
Five...

147
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,625
- Hi. Oh.
- Six...

148
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,295
- Am I interrupting?
- Seven

149
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,630
- eight...
- I had a weird morning.

150
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,300
- Nine...
- Well, John and Frank Dunn

151
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,383
want a meeting.

152
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,221
- And again...
- When?

153
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,931
Later this afternoon.

154
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,891
One, two...

155
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,435
Well, about what?

156
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,812
Three, four...

157
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:57,521
Okay. Thanks.

158
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,066
- Five...
- Sure.

159
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,971
You served?

160
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,184
- Marines. You?
- Same.

161
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,104
Semper Fi till I die.

162
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,526
You from around here?

163
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,528
Nah. Just visiting.

164
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,322
Thought I'd check out the scene,

165
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,408
see what Durham's about.

166
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,329
Yeah...

167
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,795
You want to, uh

168
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,840
want to tell me what it's about?

169
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,010
Oh, you know

170
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,223
it's about

171
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,600
this and that.

172
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,321
ManMortgages, man.

173
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,823
I'm telling ya.

174
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,033
That's where the money's going.

175
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,285
Ya know?

176
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,626
Is it just me, or is it
like a sauna in here?

177
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,848
Man Mr. Peterson.

178
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,975
Jim!

179
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,020
Read your column this week.

180
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,773
The target on my back
is getting pretty heavy.

181
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,275
You keep going after
the little guys.

182
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,860
You know, you rack up wins.

183
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,363
If you tackled a real
issue, I'd let up.

184
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,076
Mm. Well...

185
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,496
I'm sorry. Sometimes
the truth hurts.

186
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,997
You keep on lookin'
for the truth.

187
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,294
One day, you might
trip right over it.

188
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,301
So Nortel is going
to write you a check

189
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,469
for Kathleen's back pay.

190
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,805
That'll cover bail,

191
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
Rudolf's retainer, initial fees.

192
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,227
I, um...

193
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,313
I don't know how we're
going to swing the rest.

194
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,162
We got bigger things
to worry about.

195
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,446
Candace and Lori,

196
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,532
they're not answering my calls.

197
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,144
Do you think the DA got to 'em?

198
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,542
It's horseshit.

199
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,710
I mean, they never,
never liked me.

200
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,174
I'm going to need a favor.

201
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,929
I need you to tell
the kids about...

202
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,269
- You want me to tell them about...
- The photos.

203
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,857
You know, and, uh, you
know, my interest in, um...

204
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,280
They're going to ask,
is it just the photos,

205
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,742
or were you, you
having an affair.

206
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,327
Oh, Bill, for Christ's sake.

207
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,288
An affair?

208
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,748
Kathleen was the only one.

209
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,294
She really knew me.

210
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,461
Kathleen knew everything?

211
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,547
Of course.

212
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,967
Uh, the police

213
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,431
found some photos on
your dad's computer.

214
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,934
Um,

215
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,105
well, the photos were
of an intimate nature.

216
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,360
And, and that nature
was homosexual.

217
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,947
They were, uh,
homosexual... photos.

218
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:04,536
Just a bunch of
stupid, stupid photos.

219
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,793
Okay?

220
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,883
- Kids, you, you have any...
- So Dad's gay?

221
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,551
- What?
- No.

222
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,302
No, no, no, no. He likes women.

223
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,846
He loved Kathleen. Uh, just...

224
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,351
Uh, he likes the idea of men.

225
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,648
Right now, I know this
is a lot to process,

226
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,067
but it, it gets easier.

227
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,693
Wait, when did you find out?

228
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,196
Uh, I guess I've

229
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,823
always known

230
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,493
since we were little.

231
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,537
You know, life wasn't
always easy for your dad.

232
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,121
So Dad's bisexual?

233
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,374
Bingo.

234
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,459
Did you guys know?

235
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,005
Remember those jean shorts?

236
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,675
- The really short ones.
- Did Mom know?

237
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,094
- Those fucking shorts.
- I tried to throw 'em away.

238
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:02,844
No, wait, did Mom know?

239
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,639
Yes, uh, Kathleen knew.

240
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,019
Alright. Well, this
doesn't matter.

241
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,565
- I mean, Dad's Dad.
- Right. Dad's Dad.

242
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,072
Is that it?

243
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,574
Yeah.

244
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,116
David You've been
locked up too long.

245
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,910
Let's get you the
fuck out of here.

246
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,746
Make a path. Make a
path. Make a path.

247
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,710
Take your time. We
have nothing to hide.

248
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,086
Michael, excuse me...

249
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,930
We'll be making a
statement at a later date.

250
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,766
Thank you very much. Excuse me.

251
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,059
Excuse me.

252
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,978
So, we're going to need access

253
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,980
to your accounts,

254
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,440
all your financials.

255
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,484
Bill, didn't you give
this man his money?

256
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,402
- - Yeah. Of course.
- - No, no, no, no.

257
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,696
We need to do
forensic accounting.

258
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,616
The DA's going to say you killed
Kathleen because of your debt.

259
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,702
I killed her for the money?
I just optioned my book.

260
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,455
Oh? Well, how, how
much you get for that?

261
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,291
He got ten. Ten, ten thousand.

262
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,919
- Oh.
- The backend's ridiculous.

263
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,130
Well, uh, Tom Maher's going
to take care of financials.

264
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,799
- You met Tom yet?
- No.

265
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,008
Bill, you just got to go.

266
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,319
They'll, they'll
get out of the way.

267
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,011
What are we going
to do about the DA?

268
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,304
That's it.

269
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:09,971
There you go. That's it.

270
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,099
Have you read the papers?

271
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,534
Hardin's trying to
make me look like,

272
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,601
like Satan incarnate.

273
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,560
Don't sweat Hardin.

274
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,144
We got Judge Orlando Hudson.

275
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,229
Who's he?

276
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,190
He and I go way back.
He's a good one.

277
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,691
Uh, is that it, Ron?

278
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,777
Uh, what about
those French guys?

279
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,153
Ah, right.

280
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,530
This is a first for me.

281
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:30,283
Uh, I got a call from a
couple documentarians.

282
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,536
I looked into them
myself. They're legit.

283
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,763
They even got a flick out
now with some Oscar buzz.

284
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,957
They want to make a movie
about the US justice system.

285
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,834
Our case would be
some sort of example.

286
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,918
Really?

287
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,170
What do you think?

288
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,548
We could get a call lined
up, but let's sit on it.

289
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,800
Not a priority.

290
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,427
Well, the French
do have good taste.

291
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,140
He's here!

292
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,189
- I love you!
- Margaret; Oh, we missed you.

293
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,567
It's so good to see you.

294
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,527
Mm. Hey, kid, get over here.

295
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,113
- Come on.
- It's good to have you home.

296
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,340
- That's better. That's better.
- - Are you okay?

297
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,366
Alright, hold on, hold on.

298
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,578
- Let me go take a shower.
- We missed you!

299
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,121
And get some of
the stink off me.

300
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,582
I'm making you lasagne.

301
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,458
Got a nice bottle
of red for you.

302
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,211
Uh, you guys talked
to Uncle Bill, right?

303
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,045
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- It went well?

304
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,381
- It went well.
- Good.

305
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,257
Good!

306
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,986
I got it!

307
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,742
Fred.

308
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,327
My dad's here.

309
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,079
Hi, girls.

310
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,247
Hi.

311
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,043
I am, um, so sorry.

312
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,837
Thank you, Fred.

313
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,132
Let's just go outside.

314
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,015
I don't want to be
indelicate here,

315
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,476
but your mom's back
pay from Nortel,

316
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,103
they paid it out.

317
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,523
Plus the life insurance
money, I mean.

318
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,109
It's, it's a lot.

319
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,424
I mean, enough to rent something

320
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,154
while all of this is happening.

321
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,490
Everyone can move together.

322
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,955
Mike... didn't mention anything?

323
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,498
No.

324
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,793
They don't really have
time to talk to me

325
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,419
unless it's about,

326
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,546
like, scheduling an
interview or something.

327
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,471
Candace keeps leaving
these crazy messages

328
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,557
about Mike and, like,
things in the house

329
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,685
he could have used to...

330
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,522
She wants me to go
and check and see

331
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,190
if anything's missing.

332
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,984
I am so sorry, Cay.

333
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,404
She keeps trying to tell me

334
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,073
what I already know, that...

335
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,703
You already know what?

336
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,373
Mike is bisexual.

337
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,005
Okay.

338
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,717
Did Mom ever say
anything to you?

339
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
About Mike and that stuff?

340
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,222
Uh, no. No.

341
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,183
Your mother and
I, basically, um,

342
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,102
just talked about you.

343
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,397
I, uh...

344
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,733
Cay, I don't know how
to say this, but, uh

345
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,778
the DA called.

346
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,238
Yeah, they're calling everyone.

347
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,200
Yes. But there's
photos of Kathleen.

348
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,454
They were taken after she fell.

349
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,248
And they're going
to be released.

350
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,417
And it sounds like
these photos are,

351
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,128
are pretty bad, Caitlin.

352
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,922
And I do not want you
to see them, you know,

353
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:17,844
just accidentally on the
cover of a newspaper or on TV

354
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,637
or, or God knows where.

355
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,016
Oh, sweetheart.

356
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,979
It's okay.

357
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,399
It's okay.

358
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,193
Why don't you,

359
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,776
why don't you come
stay with me tonight.

360
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,156
At the hotel?

361
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,080
Okay?

362
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,545
So catering's all
set for Saturday.

363
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,549
And I thought you
might want these.

364
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,760
Oh, thanks. Hey, did
you hear anything?

365
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,055
Now management's saying that
they got it figured out,

366
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,556
so they don't need the meeting.

367
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Figured what out?

368
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,601
I don't know.

369
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,812
And Caitlin's on line three.

370
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,398
Oh.

371
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,692
Okay.

372
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,489
Wait. What? What do you
mean you're not coming?

373
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,117
Kathleen Well, I, I have to
help Mike with his fundraiser.

374
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,493
I'm really sorry.

375
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,454
Why can't you make
it up to Mike, Mom?

376
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,374
Honey, the fundraiser
is very important.

377
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,877
And it's happening this weekend,
whether I want it to or not.

378
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,300
How about I come see
you in two weeks?

379
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,803
No. It's not the same. I'll...

380
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,572
I'll just, I'll see you
at Thanksgiving then.

381
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,931
No, don't be like that.

382
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,014
No, I got to go.

383
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,892
No...

384
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,232
It's going to be a
feature-length documentary

385
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,485
focusing on the prosecution,
defense, and the judge.

386
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,612
I got to say, I'm,
I'm real concerned

387
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,322
with confidentiality.

388
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,117
The tapes are being sent
to Paris as we film.

389
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,910
It'll get a lot more complicated

390
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,495
than just, um,
shipping some tapes.

391
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,790
Absolutely. But we've been there

392
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,500
with our last movie.

393
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,420
Well, we haven't and
that's what's important.

394
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,590
That's irrelevant...

395
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,176
So what you're saying is
you, you want to leave Paris

396
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,720
and come to Durham?

397
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,721
Yes, we'd relocate.

398
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,932
Well, that's absolute insanity.

399
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:28,683
I mean, Paris is beautiful.

400
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:33,313
And Durham is, um... Durham.

401
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,193
Uh, Michael, Jean here.

402
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,070
Um, do you know Paris well?

403
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,656
Intimately. Kathleen and
I wanted to retire there.

404
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,700
And we wanted to get a
little place in the Mara is.

405
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,538
Whichever case we focus on,

406
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,707
we'll be making
something for the ages.

407
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,295
You're talking to other people?

408
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,298
Yes. A few. It's, it's standard.

409
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,225
I-I'm worried about some things

410
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,810
that will come to
light, so to speak.

411
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:17,774
Well, I'm, I'm happy to,
to address these concerns.

412
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:24,322
Kathleen and I were
very much in love.

413
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,575
She was my soul mate.
Of that, I'm, I'm sure.

414
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,204
But I'm, I'm also bisexual,

415
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,582
which happens to be a problem

416
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,168
for some people, you know,
especially in Durham.

417
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:41,256
Uh, Michael, for, for us,

418
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,007
your sexuality is not a problem.

419
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,804
Listen, um

420
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,558
we'll give it some thought.

421
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,393
Great. Let's stay in touch.

422
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,686
Thank you.

423
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,693
- Hey.
- Hi.

424
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,447
- How's the hotel?
- It's fine.

425
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,032
Thanks for meeting me here.

426
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,580
The house is so... stressful.

427
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,707
Can't wait until they clean

428
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,210
everything up.

429
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,051
Um...

430
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,392
So I-I've been thinking...

431
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,897
Mike... lied to us.

432
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,569
What do you mean?

433
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:49,490
About... like, small things.

434
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,492
I mean, Dad tells stories.

435
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,121
Yeah. But like, the
Purple Heart thing. And...

436
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,249
Like, we didn't know
that he was gay.

437
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,336
- Bisexual.
- Okay, bisexual. Whatever.

438
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,337
That's like an important part.

439
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,756
It's a very important
part of who somebody is.

440
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,760
And he... he kept that from us.

441
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,054
From... from all of us.

442
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,515
- I mean, not from Mom.
- No, she would have told me.

443
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,517
What, she would have told
you about her sex life?

444
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,644
No, not the details,

445
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,270
but she would have found a way

446
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,354
to let me know.

447
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,209
Like, she told me. She
told me what happened

448
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,902
with my Dad, Fred, what he did,

449
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,528
and how he cheated on her.

450
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,364
Yeah, but Dad
didn't cheat on Mom.

451
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,365
- You think it's gross?
- No, I don't think it's gross.

452
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,700
I think it's

453
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,327
wrong, okay.

454
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,788
They were married,
and she loved him.

455
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,713
How did a woman

456
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,386
end up at the bottom
of the stairs dead

457
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,892
from blunt force trauma?

458
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,397
With an object

459
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,816
heavy enough to kill

460
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,905
but light enough not
to fracture a skull.

461
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:13,408
Now that's a difficult
combination to replicate,

462
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,826
for most.

463
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,578
But not for us.

464
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,332
At SBI, we get it done.

465
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,762
You want me to run inside

466
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,181
so you can continue ruminating?

467
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,015
Hmm?

468
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,562
Need anything?

469
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,439
Only that you'll
hurry back, right?

470
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,016
That be it for you?

471
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,149
I, uh, I gotta get going.

472
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,000
- What happened?
- Nothing.

473
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,502
It's nothing, I think.

474
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,846
It's a big day for us. Hmm?

475
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,094
We've got two stories to tell.

476
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,363
The story of what
happened that night

477
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,533
and the story of the great love

478
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,701
between you and Kathleen.

479
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,329
I haven't been
able to find anyone

480
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,541
that's willing to say one
bad thing about you two.

481
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,876
Most folks were jealous.

482
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,710
I hate to think what
my neighbors would say

483
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,878
about me and the wife.

484
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,130
Right. But we can't find anyone

485
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,049
willing to testify
that Kathleen knew

486
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:39,428
about... your...
diverse interests.

487
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,267
You talked to my
friends about that?

488
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,769
That's what we do.

489
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,899
Got to know what the DA
is going to dig up on you.

490
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,442
As long as you're
honest with us,

491
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,529
we don't expect any
surprises from the DA.

492
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,240
- Right, Ron?
- I got eyes in the courthouse.

493
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,454
Which is how I came about these.

494
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,959
Uh, hold up. So these are,

495
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,170
uh, Kathleen's autopsy photos.

496
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,343
You need to look at them.

497
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,267
Why?

498
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,813
All autopsy photos
are bad... Mike.

499
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,106
These are worse.

500
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,735
I don't want you to be
surprised in the courtroom.

501
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,529
I'm a veteran, David.

502
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,907
I've seen death.

503
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,619
Doesn't mean I need
to see more of it.

504
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,204
I wouldn't ask you if I
didn't think it was important.

505
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,790
Well, I, uh, I'm
not looking at them.

506
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,294
Not tonight. Not ever.

507
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,297
You see that? That's how my
wife deserves to be remembered.

508
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,298
Hmm?

509
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,717
Photos of her lying
in some morgue,

510
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,011
that's not Kathleen.

511
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,472
Look, we hear you, Mike,

512
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,158
but we need you to take
a look at these photos.

513
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,100
I, I don't even know why
I'm listening to this.

514
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,269
Fuck. I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

515
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,945
Hey, you want to see what
your mom looked like, huh?

516
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,655
Of course not, Dad. Never.

517
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,156
Oh, good. That's good.

518
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,892
You're a beautiful young woman.

519
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,562
Your mother was
beautiful as well.

520
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,189
Inside and out.

521
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,277
Can you tell me about her?

522
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,116
I'm sorry, do you
mind if we don't talk

523
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,367
about my mom right now?

524
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,286
Of course. Of course.

525
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,290
You have two stepsisters,

526
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,835
Margaret and Martha Ratliff.

527
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,963
How are you all holding up?

528
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,046
We're okay.

529
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,844
At least we're, we're
trying to be okay.

530
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,139
This is a tough time.

531
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,475
Yeah, it is.

532
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,855
It's made even more difficult

533
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,607
by seeing your stepfather,
Michael Peterson,

534
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:42,403
being accused of hurting,
of killing your mother.

535
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,796
You clearly think
so highly of him.

536
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,663
"Michael Peterson stopped
my mother's tears.

537
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,083
"He restored her strength
and her confidence

538
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,918
"and showed her that
she could find true love

539
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,587
after my father's deceit... ".

540
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,786
Wait, where did you get that?

541
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,132
It's a school paper you wrote.

542
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,426
Yes, but how did you get it?

543
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,596
David, Mr. Rudolf,
gave it to me.

544
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,347
Yeah. Uh, Mike saved it

545
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,266
uh, and thought you'd
like to share it

546
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,768
considering the circumstances.

547
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,234
I, I think actually
I need a minute.

548
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,071
I-I'm sorry, can I use,
can I use your bathroom?

549
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,771
Mike, you upstairs?

550
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,272
That looks great, you guys.

551
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,941
So just through to
the dining room.

552
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,404
Michael, will you
please grab my shoes?

553
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,449
Just straight through
there. Thank you so much.

554
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,534
Hi!

555
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,493
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

556
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,995
- Thank you.
- The place looks great.

557
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,872
You're going to make
Mike a million bucks.

558
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,290
I'd settle for ten grand.

559
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,126
And look who I ran
into at the florist?

560
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,752
- Dennis the Menace.
- Hey.

561
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,338
Oh my gosh. Dennis
Rowe. Here, thank you.

562
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,508
I hope you don't mind
an under dressed guest.

563
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,635
Oh, come as you are, as
long as you got a checkbook.

564
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,302
Let's go get the
rest of the flowers.

565
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,137
- Yeah.
- Thanks, you guys.

566
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,644
- See you in a minute.
- Yeah. See ya.

567
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,102
Mike, uh, let me
introduce you to the team.

568
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,105
Henry Lee, our blood guy.

569
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:41,856
Werner Spitz, who wrote the book

570
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,692
on forensic pathology.

571
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,402
Faris Bandak, injury
bio mechanics.

572
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,447
And, uh, Tim Palmbach,
our crime scene analyst.

573
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,243
Why don't we, uh,
take a look up close?

574
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,206
Faris, why don't
you, uh, get in there

575
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,627
and see if, uh, you
need to be close up.

576
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,546
- Werner.
- Nah, this is too tight.

577
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,095
- Hey.
- Brent It's Brent. How's it going?

578
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,388
I only got a minute.

579
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,682
- I got a big event tonight.
- Oh, yeah?

580
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,558
I'm kind of a, kind
of a powerful guy.

581
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,602
You could show me next week.

582
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,188
Let's make sure our
dates don't change again.

583
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,790
- I really want to meet you.
- I promise.

584
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,150
Mike! Guests are
arriving! Next week.

585
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,651
See you then.

586
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,948
Come on. What are you
doing? People are here.

587
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,075
- Jesus, look at you.
- What?

588
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,159
Aah!

589
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,086
Bam, the head only hits once,

590
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,630
but the impact causes
multiple wounds.

591
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,633
The flesh splinters.

592
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,263
Even so

593
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,601
one fall can't explain
seven lacerations.

594
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,685
Two falls then?

595
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,440
It helps to explain the blood
on the soles of her feet.

596
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,866
Hey, come...

597
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,954
So we're in the locker room,

598
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,040
and Hardin's whining
about my articles.

599
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,668
That bingo hall expose
was incendiary stuff.

600
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,421
Honestly, we, we got rapists
running around Durham,

601
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,799
and Hardin's wasting
finite resources

602
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,259
going after bingo halls.

603
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,361
Hope none of your
grandmothers got busted.

604
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,804
Oh, unless they're also rapists.

605
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,518
Dennis, meet Michael,
Kathleen's husband.

606
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,437
Oh, uh, Dennis Rowe.
Nice to meet you.

607
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,023
You're the one
running for office?

608
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,110
Uh, yes, yes. A pleasure.

609
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,987
Now, where is that,
that wife of mine?

610
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,866
Now's just, it's
really not a good time.

611
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,703
Um... can you just send

612
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,788
the, the documents to my email?

613
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,516
Devon I'll get that
right over. Did you bring

614
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,332
- your laptop home?
- Yeah, of course. I brought my laptop home.

615
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,501
It's, you know,
it's my third leg.

616
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,169
Kathleen, where are you hiding?

617
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,897
I've got more to go over
with you, like the...

618
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,215
Let me call you back.
Yes, I'll call you back.

619
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,599
Uh, you can put the checks
in the basket there.

620
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,892
Thank you!

621
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:32,401
So this is where
she's falling back

622
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,902
down the stairs,

623
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,947
and then she hits her head

624
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,783
right here.

625
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,827
The back.

626
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,412
Then she goes down,

627
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,123
hitting her head
a second time here

628
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,917
and ended up here,

629
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,086
then the cough.

630
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:56,842
And on this side and she turns
over her head and then...

631
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,221
See, that's both sides.

632
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,768
And then she will try
to pull herself up.

633
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,604
That's why the blood
marks on the, on the wall,

634
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,064
and then loses her balance,

635
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,232
goes back

636
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,569
all the way here.

637
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:18,072
And then that is
her last position.

638
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,370
Speech. Speech, Michael.

639
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,871
Let's hear from the candidate.

640
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,832
Uh, that would be me.

641
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,084
Okay.

642
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,167
Um...

643
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,588
Oh. Uh, alright. Thank you.

644
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:41,595
Every man deserves
a second chance.

645
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,764
But not every man gets one.

646
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:48,602
So I'm honored to receive
so much support for mine.

647
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:52,106
I couldn't be happier to be
running for city council.

648
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,942
Durham means the world to me.

649
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,025
And so do all of you.

650
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,239
But before it gets too late,

651
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,033
let me introduce

652
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,077
the evening's entertainment.

653
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,456
The Durham Dance Company.

654
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,180
Look at what you've done.

655
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,515
Look at this.

656
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,267
You're incredible.

657
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,216
I'm tired, Michael.

658
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:47,095
Like, all the time. To my bones.

659
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,181
I need help.

660
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,433
I know, baby.

661
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,518
I know.

662
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,437
I'll make it easier, I promise.

663
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,022
I promise.

664
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,192
Woman Help!

665
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,739
Help! Anybody!

666
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,575
Help me!

667
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,327
Somebody!

668
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,080
Help!

669
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,665
I need help!

670
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,333
Anybody!

671
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,586
Help me!

672
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,547
- - Mike.
- - Help!

673
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,317
- - Mike... help me.
- - Please!

674
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,426
Hey, buddy.

675
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,345
Help!

676
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,056
Let's take a walk.

677
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,100
I need help! Anybody!

678
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,435
Help me!

679
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,229
Help!

680
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,482
Anybody. Hel...

681
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:00,961
She's on the stairs.
You're by the pool.

682
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,297
You couldn't hear a
goddamn thing out here.

683
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,300
Nothing.

684
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,991
Hey, you've reached
Caitlin At water.

685
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:31,825
Please leave your
name and number,

686
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,244
and maybe I'll get back to you.

687
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,537
Honey, it's me.

688
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,873
Uh, I wanted to say sorry

689
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,625
for missing parents' weekend.

690
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,920
Um, Mike's night was a, a hit.

691
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,882
He may even win this thing.

692
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,717
Uh... listen.

693
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,012
Sometimes things happen in life,

694
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:56,516
and, uh, you got to make
a choice about what to do.

695
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,978
And there's no clear right way,

696
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,898
and there's no clear wrong way.

697
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,942
What I'm trying to
say is, uh, sometimes

698
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,695
there's no option that's
going to make you feel

699
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,113
completely good.

700
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:14,910
So, uh, you gotta look
at your choices and

701
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,955
make a tough decision.

702
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,336
I know you're upset,

703
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,543
but I'll make it up to you.

704
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,508
'Cause I'm your mom.

705
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,344
I love you.

706
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,724
You're stuck with me, kid.

707
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,702
Shit.

708
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,002
Oh my god!

709
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,288
Kathleen suffered
numerous injuries.

710
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,371
For fuck's sake.

711
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,750
After tonight,

712
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,461
we can account for
nearly all of them.

713
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,045
Alright?

714
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,300
She wasn't beaten to
death by her husband

715
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,593
with some sort of a weapon.

716
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,804
She wasn't, uh,
attacked by an intruder.

717
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,055
Kathleen fell.

718
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,307
Twice.

719
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,895
Mike and Kathleen eat dinner.

720
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,482
They watch a movie,

721
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,026
uh, "America's Sweethearts."

722
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,987
She speaks briefly to a coworker

723
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,823
before they decide to end
an already lovely evening

724
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,242
by taking in the stars.

725
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,797
Stay for one more.

726
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:37,511
Why shut out the day
before it is done?

727
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,554
Because some of us have jobs.

728
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,517
I got to get some
stuff done before bed.

729
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,351
Hmm.

730
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,686
You take a pill
to help you sleep?

731
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,813
Yeah.

732
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:49,855
Come to bed soon, okay.

733
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,483
Oh.

734
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,779
Let's do it tomorrow.

735
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,161
Oh.

736
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,579
Oh!

737
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,314
Oh god, Michael, help me!

738
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,941
And when Mike finds her,

739
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,859
she's still breathing.

740
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,405
So... he holds her,

741
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,908
he grabs towels,

742
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,868
wipes her face clean.

743
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,578
He calls 911.

744
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,248
Begs for help.

745
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,042
But

746
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,461
it's too late.

747
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,552
You know, sometimes, when
we do everything we can,

748
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,721
it's

749
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,224
it's still not enough.

750
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,520
It's never enough.

751
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,283
Alright, so she falls twice.

752
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,286
Um, blood's everywhere.

753
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,754
What about the
scratches on her face?

754
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,083
What, what about the,
you know, broken,

755
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,460
you know, neck bone?

756
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,252
- Thyroid...
- I'm sorry.

757
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,755
- Thyroid cartilage.
- Thank you.

758
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,798
I mean, do we say
how she got those?

759
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,592
- No.
- Why not?

760
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,678
Because you don't get them
falling down the stairs.

761
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,246
Maybe her throat hit the wood,
her face banged the wall.

762
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,189
I don't, I just, I'm
not worried about it.

763
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,196
Sorry I'm late.

764
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,947
This is Miss Black.

765
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,050
She's my assistant
DA on the case.

766
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,700
I know, she left messages.

767
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,119
Caitlin.

768
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,704
Uh, Fred At water.

769
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,330
- Caitlin's father.
- Fred?

770
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,415
Well, isn't that something?

771
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,833
I'm Freda.

772
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,086
Uh, my daddy wanted a boy,
but he got me instead,

773
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,923
so he just went ahead
and added an A...

774
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,674
Can we just get on
with it, please?

775
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,593
Yes, ma'am.

776
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,472
As we said, autopsy photos fall

777
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,681
into public domain.

778
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,853
That means that eventually,
they'll be everywhere.

779
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,523
For anyone to see.

780
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,631
How bad was she hurt?

781
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,801
There were a
variety of injuries.

782
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:13,680
Uh, bruises, scratches,

783
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,640
lacerations.

784
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,228
Defensive wounds.

785
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,272
Your mom lost a lot of blood.

786
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,530
Her blood alcohol was 0.07

787
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,742
with a Valium level of
0.15 milligrams per liter.

788
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,662
To put it simply,
by legal standards,

789
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,415
she wasn't intoxicated
when she died.

790
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,175
Oh god.

791
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:51,759
Oh god.

792
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,262
Oh god. Oh god!

793
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,479
Caitlin, we firmly believe
your mom didn't die

794
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,064
from an accidental fall.

795
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,444
We believe Michael
Peterson killed her.

796
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,324
With what? What does that?

797
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,511
The weapon's yet
to be identified.

798
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,664
Wait, what the fuck?

799
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,540
Yeah. What the fuck is right.

800
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,584
I thought she was
smarter than that.

801
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,877
But Fred's an idiot, so...

802
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,545
What does this mean?

803
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:31,007
Well, clearly, it means we
can't talk to her anymore.

804
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,343
We, we, we can't talk to anyone.

805
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,678
Family is all we got.

806
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,601
Remember, this takes time.

807
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,394
The trial's not going
to start for months.

808
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,105
Caitlin has one hour.

809
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,067
She needs to stick to
her room, only her room.

810
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,486
She would like some of
Kathleen's jewelry, if possible.

811
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,947
That, that will be
settled with the estate.

812
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,990
Uh, now there's one more thing.

813
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,869
Some filmmakers are going to be
making a documentary about the case.

814
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,334
- Is this a good idea?
- It's not necessarily a bad one.

815
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:10,004
It could be a good way for me
to tell my side of the story.

816
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,506
Do we have to do anything?

817
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,466
No.

818
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:14,968
Girls, just go back to school.

819
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,678
Live your lives.

820
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,682
Clay, you gotta move to
Baltimore with Becky.

821
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,978
Hmm? Keep you out
of the spotlight.

822
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,981
And Todd,

823
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,899
you got to step up, be
the man of the house

824
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,026
while I'm distracted by
all this fucking nonsense.

825
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,995
I have to get my hair stuff.

826
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,329
It's in the bathroom.

827
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,798
Your home, it's lovely.

828
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:36,942
We're excited to
begin the process.

829
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,217
Oh, as am I.

830
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,970
So where do we, uh,
start this thing?

831
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,472
How about where the night began?

832
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:45,600
Kathleen and I were
watching a movie,

833
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,101
uh, "America's Sweethearts."

834
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,896
I think it was probably
around eleven o'clock.

835
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:50,979
And, uh,

836
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,776
uh, it's something we would do.

837
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,361
You know, watch movies.

838
01:00:56,444 --> 01:01:00,573
And when the movie
ended, we took our wine.

839
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:02,575
And, uh, what we
would usually do

840
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:06,412
on a nice night is, um, we would

841
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,374
come on, come on
out to the pool.

842
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,418
Because it's, I
always think about

843
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,546
um, pretty much the nicest place

844
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,756
on the property.

845
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,884
Uh, keep walking.

846
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:20,967
We're doing a wide shot.

847
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:30,812
So I stayed out by the pool,

848
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,439
and Kathleen had
a conference call,

849
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:37,026
you know, some kind of work
obligation in the morning.

850
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,912
So... that was it.

851
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,455
Down by the pool,

852
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:54,168
that was the last time I
saw Kathleen, uh, alive.

853
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,130
No, she was alive when
I, when I found her here.

854
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,508
But... barely.

855
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:15,481
Michael, um, making
a documentary

856
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,276
is, is more than
filming and talking.

857
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,778
It's, it's about a relationship.

858
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,823
And you and I, we're just
getting to know each other huh?

859
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,033
So it's always

860
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,578
a little strained
in the beginning.

861
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,164
You thought I was strained?

862
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,957
We'll just do it again.

863
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,750
- Do it again?
- Yes.

864
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,546
With, um, with more emotion.

865
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,506
I want to see how
you really feel.

866
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,508
I just told you how I feel.

867
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,720
Yes, of course.
Of course. But, um

868
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:49,515
when you go to bed
at night, you know,

869
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,060
and, uh, and the
room becomes dark

870
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,354
and you start thinking
about your wife.

871
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,024
No. No, I'm not going
to prostrate myself

872
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,525
for the sake of your film.

873
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,994
Okay? You go talk
to the DA for that.

874
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,405
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

875
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,784
Who's that?

876
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,952
That's my mother.

877
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,390
I mean, Patty told me she booked
a room at the Holiday Inn,

878
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,707
I didn't believe her.

879
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,126
Hello!

880
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,377
I saw that you were busy,

881
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,796
and I didn't want to bother you.

882
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,811
You did the right thing.

883
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,651
I know Kathleen loved
those girls, but

884
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,946
they're a lost cause now.

885
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,540
You know that she'd
been laying there

886
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,200
a whole hour before she died?

887
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,204
Do you think she was
in a lot of pain?

888
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,377
Oh my god.

889
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,631
Oh my god.

890
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,677
Oh my god.

891
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,345
What are you doing?

892
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,974
That son of a bitch.

893
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,226
What are you doing?

894
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,776
- Candace!
- What are you doing?

895
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,989
Candace, stop!

896
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,368
- - Candace, stop!
- - Candace!

897
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,162
You're scaring us.

898
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,039
Son of a bitch.

899
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,713
That son of a bitch
used the blow poke.

900
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,342
That son of a bitch
used the blow poke!

901
01:04:49,305 --> 01:05:49,677
