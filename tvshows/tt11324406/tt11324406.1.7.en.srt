2
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,574
Come on.

3
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,038
Oh.

4
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,879
Fuck, I'm forgetting things.

5
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,825
Tyrone? What the...

6
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,581
Ow!

8
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:44,996
It's horseshit.

9
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,995
I'm not taking the goddamn plea.

10
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:54,057
So... what,

11
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:57,544
you want a retrial? Hmm?

12
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,862
It's not what I want.
It's what I need.

13
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:02,393
I am not going to say
I killed Kathleen.

14
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,709
Jesus, Michael.

15
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,194
Michael, think of the money,

16
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,006
the years you'll waste
fighting for this.

17
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,048
I am not a moron. I
know the implications.

18
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:19,301
- If we say these words...
- If I say them...

19
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,870
If you say them, no more prison.

20
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,559
You want me to get up and say I'm
responsible for the worst night of my life,

21
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,285
that I'm responsible for
Kathleen's suffering?

22
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,417
Did you listen to what I read?

23
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,985
We're saying you didn't
do anything wrong.

24
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,356
Not until the very
end where I say

25
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,691
I did everything wrong.

26
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:37,343
I'm not going to say I'm guilty.

27
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,073
I can't.

28
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,433
I want to avoid anything

29
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,128
that puts your freedom at risk.

30
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,704
I want your kids
to stop worrying.

31
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,856
They'll understand.
They, they'll support me.

32
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,347
Mike, look around.

33
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,401
This is all the support you got.

34
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:57,427
I told them not to come!

35
00:04:57,452 --> 00:05:00,426
Not to bother hearing their
father perjure himself!

36
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,720
You could be found
guilty. Again.

37
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:04,322
Yeah, with what evidence?

38
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,515
Everything the DA had is
inadmissible or compromised.

39
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,001
Except for your lies, Michael.

40
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,143
Your character.

41
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:12,909
Those are still in play.

42
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,263
You can't walk back from deceit.

43
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,736
From how people see you.

44
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,658
I'm not taking the plea.

45
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,327
I won't do it.

46
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,829
Class is going well.

47
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:44,136
Um, the students
seem more attuned.

48
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,517
I'm sorry, Sophie.

49
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,346
My days don't provide
much inspiration.

50
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,814
I'm, uh, returning to Paris.

51
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,196
- Jean needs his muse.

52
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,190
We're having trouble
with the third act.

53
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,612
- Hmm.
- So...

54
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:12,221
So when do you come back?

55
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,729
I'm not, I'm not sure.

56
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:18,922
We're hoping to
finish the film soon,

57
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,464
but I don't know.

58
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,216
It's hard to say when.

59
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,345
Penny for your thoughts?

60
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,573
Thoughts about what?

61
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:35,722
Come on. About me.

62
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,693
- Us.

63
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,714
This.

64
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,931
Well, I'll go back to Paris,

65
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:43,904
and then I'll... I come back

66
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:45,514
and then, uh...

67
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,034
That's all.

68
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,644
Right. You come
home to Durham.

69
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,839
I don't think Durham will
ever be home, Michael.

70
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:56,367
You-you-you're the
only reason I'm here.

71
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:58,311
Well, we'll figure it out.

72
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:01,093
It'll be okay.

73
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:07,862
"Through her hand. I
feel the pulse of life,

74
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,175
"of passion.

75
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:14,261
"And I want all of her.

76
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:16,337
"Her lips, her hair,

77
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,563
"the skin I've yet to see.

78
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,358
"But the fates have
denied the carnal.

79
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:28,480
"Leaving me to be tempted and
contented by the spiritual,

80
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,368
"the ethereal, the simple purity

81
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,120
"of her words and mind.

82
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,206
But is that enough?"

83
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,874
Came to me last night.

84
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:42,891
Thoughts?

85
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,762
To Margie, my sister.

86
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:54,469
I'm proud of you.

87
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:58,851
I am almost 30. I'm divorced.

88
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:02,087
I'm using a cardboard
box as a table.

89
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,793
I'm proud of you
for leaving him.

90
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,945
I know Lucas was a,
he was a good guy.

91
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,219
He was the best guy.

92
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,407
I hope he's okay.

93
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,392
Yeah, see, you've got to

94
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,411
take all of that energy
that you're putting

95
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:16,354
on other people and
focus it on yourself.

96
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:17,755
What do you mean?

97
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,516
Well, when you finally start

98
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,531
paying attention to yourself,

99
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,295
you can't hide anymore.

100
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,906
Okay. So what am
I ignoring here?

101
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,930
Lucas used to say the same shit.

102
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,123
We've been through a lot,

103
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:31,804
and you've never
really talked about it.

104
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:33,039
You know, we've never...

105
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:34,787
You can either let
the past haunt you

106
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,133
or you move on.

107
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,263
I can't change what
happened. You can't either.

108
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:41,378
True. But I can try
to understand it.

109
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,148
Why I felt like
something was wrong

110
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:45,592
even before that night.

111
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,820
And that's why, you
know, I'm going to,

112
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:48,930
I'm going to go back home.

113
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:51,733
What do you mean go home?

114
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,307
Just tell me what
you're talking about.

115
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:02,964
I've saved up almost enough
money to go to Germany.

116
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,129
I've been talking to Patty,

117
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,225
and she still lives in
the same apartment complex

118
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,340
that we grew up in.

119
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,381
She says she can take
me to Mom's house

120
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,945
and bring Agnes over to talk.

121
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,346
- You're going to Germany?
- Oh, Margie.

122
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,289
I knew you would be
pissed. I knew it.

123
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,351
And I don't want to
hide things from you.

124
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,915
Well, then, next
time, just keep quiet

125
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,980
about your bullshit
self-exploration.

126
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,815
You know, you're supposed
to be helping me.

127
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,134
And now I have to
worry about you again.

128
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,280
Fuck! I always have
to keep an eye on you,

129
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:30,821
and it's so fucking tiring

130
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,682
because I'm always,
for years, worrying

131
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:35,326
if you're high somewhere
or if you have a job

132
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,726
or if you're going to do
something to yourself.

133
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,758
Germany's going to help.

134
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:41,452
Why do you care?
Why are you so mad?

135
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,178
I mean, every time I talk
about when we were kids,

136
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:46,406
you shut down, just like Dad.

137
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:47,791
Don't go.

138
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:50,537
For me.

139
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,134
Please.

140
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,488
I'm sorry. I have to.

141
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:57,781
Fuck you.

142
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:19,854
Hey, John, I want you
to come here a sec.

143
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,549
SBI is dirty.

144
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,391
Given more time, I can prove

145
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,461
that consequential evidence was
withheld and misrepresented.

146
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,506
I mean, test
results were hidden.

147
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,176
Now, this man is
serving a life sentence,

148
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,121
missing valuable time
with people he loves.

149
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,327
So would Durham
be the focus here?

150
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,661
- Definitely. Let's
get you down there.

151
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,063
We need evidence of
misconduct and motive.

152
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:49,674
You got to see this.

153
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,509
Body's already in the morgue.

154
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,302
My god.

155
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,531
It's unbelievable.

156
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,647
Darling. How's Paris?

157
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,881
Everything's good here.

158
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,791
Fantastic. How's the old man?

159
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,722
Uh, Jean?

160
00:11:57,871 --> 00:12:01,541
Uh, stressed but surviving.

161
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,442
Tell Jean I said hello.

162
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:05,492
I'd love to see
him here sometime.

163
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,436
Michael, I've got to go.

164
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,325
Speak soon.

165
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:11,140
Bye.

166
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,386
I was surprised
to get your email.

167
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:20,090
What email?

168
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,710
About the homicide.

169
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:23,385
Hmm?

170
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,323
Injuries are congruent
with a beating.

171
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:30,996
Okay. I don't know
who sent that to you,

172
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:32,496
but it wasn't me.

173
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,631
Maybe You have
something on your...

174
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:38,755
Oh!

175
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,154
So, a man was killed.

176
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:44,996
Police are pursuing a suspect.

177
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,814
The newspaper's
writing about it.

178
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,498
Seems like there's clear motive.

179
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:51,455
And the murder weapon
is a heavy flashlight.

180
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,315
So what's the connection?

181
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,810
Cause of death is blunt
force trauma to the head.

182
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,837
- It's a homicide.
- Okay.

183
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,224
And there were no skull
fractures, which means...

184
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,701
- No.
- The nature of Kathleen Peterson's death

185
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,285
is no longer an anomaly.

186
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,152
But all those autopsy reports.

187
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:10,207
Every other beating case,

188
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:11,859
they all had skull fractures.

189
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:13,692
Until now.

190
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,017
You said there was motive.

191
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,194
Officially, robbery gone wrong.

192
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,511
But Detective Holland thinks
the men knew each other.

193
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,585
Sorry. Dr. Radisch, can
I show you something?

194
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,630
Excuse me.

195
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:54,714
Rowe?

196
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:56,593
Let's get ahead of it...

197
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:59,146
It was Dennis Rowe?

198
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,632
Dennis Rowe. R-O-W-E.

199
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,659
My sources say he has a limp.

200
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:04,856
A limp?

201
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:08,413
Says you had sex with
him four or five times.

202
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:09,740
Oh, you're shitting me.

203
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:14,142
- That's what he's claiming.
- Oh my god!

204
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,338
Rather know now than later.

205
00:14:15,363 --> 00:14:16,690
Did he indicate where

206
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:18,417
this great love
affair took place?

207
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,363
Hello?
- Jean.

208
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:07,287
Wow. Okay.

209
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:07,985
I will take them.

210
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,932
And, uh, I'll split
it on these two.

211
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:16,538
You got it.

212
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:21,107
So, uh, are you excited
for the holidays?

213
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:23,116
Well, I was,

214
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:24,776
but my boyfriend and I broke up,

215
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,803
and now I'm devastated.

216
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:28,672
Oh! Before the holidays?

217
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,949
God, some people are strange.

218
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,255
I guess it can be stressful.

219
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,578
Well, apparently
he was so stressed,

220
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:35,723
he had to fuck other people.

221
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,999
- It's complicated.
- Look up, please.

222
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:44,108
My first husband, Fred,

223
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,325
he used to lie all the time,

224
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,175
and I was like, "Never again.

225
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,177
"Never again.
Give me the truth.

226
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,811
The good, the bad,
and the ugly."

227
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,460
You know what?

228
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:55,974
The stories I make
up in my own head

229
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,890
are far worse than reality.

230
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,343
Makeup artist: But
you're married again?

231
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,954
Yup. To a real piece of work.

232
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:08,874
Yeah. He's the strangest,

233
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:12,970
most exciting person
I've ever met.

234
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,242
That sounds great.

235
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,880
- And impossible.
- That's it.

236
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:18,093
It's always two
things with Michael.

237
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:20,037
- Michael. That's his name?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,637
Unless he's pulling a long con.

239
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,733
- Yeah.

240
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:25,997
So this watch is $300 more?

241
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:28,321
Yes. The diamonds
make it special.

242
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:30,116
Yeah.

243
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:31,991
Uh...

244
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,193
Okay, well, I'm going to have
to go with the cheaper one,

245
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,890
and I would love
it gift wrapped.

246
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:37,915
Of course.

247
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,593
Oh, you're shitting me.

248
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:48,298
Hello?

249
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,533
M.P. What is up, man?

250
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,532
I'm sorry. Who is this?

251
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,656
Simon.

252
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,862
- Your agent.
- Oh, Simon.

253
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:58,971
Yes!

254
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,212
"Charlie Two Shoes."

255
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:03,065
- Remember that old horse?
- Sure. I wrote it.

256
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:04,897
Simon: Yeah, right.

257
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,215
Sorry. Anyways,

258
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,761
I just got off the phone

259
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,673
and I got some really good news.

260
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,235
Hey, Patty.

261
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:35,764
Hello, Martha baby.
You've arrived.

262
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,103
Oh, I trust you traveled well.

263
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,745
Airplanes are so fast.

264
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:43,798
Thank you again for having me.

265
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:45,430
Of course.

266
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,870
Once you're settled in
here, we can head over

267
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,727
to your mother's
house this afternoon.

268
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:50,752
Okay.

269
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,251
It is so good to see you.

270
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:58,736
Let's get you cleaned up.

271
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:35,724
You lit this match.

272
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,155
Son of a bitch
can't stop cheating.

273
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,513
Now it's gonna burn.

274
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:44,243
Hi. Freda Black?

275
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,601
My name's Evelyn Ivins.

276
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,438
You got something
that needs cleaning?

277
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,493
My partners and I, we're,

278
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:01,343
we're filming
follow-up interviews

279
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,661
for a documentary

280
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:04,313
to, uh, investigate

281
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:06,340
what we've learned
over the years.

282
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:08,326
- Sure.
- Do you mind putting it in?

283
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:09,351
The, the wire.

284
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,033
That's it.

285
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,011
Fire away.

286
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:23,884
Thanks so much for coming here.

287
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:29,708
I'd like to know more
about your past employer.

288
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,354
Honey, I've had
several past employers.

289
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,472
Yeah, the Durham
District Attorney.

290
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:38,841
Thank you.

291
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,468
Oh, I'm not one
to kiss and tell.

292
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:44,586
Even though you're the one
working at a dry cleaner

293
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:45,855
and Jim Harden's a judge?

294
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:51,916
I'm sure the case
was complicated,

295
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,328
but, you know, at
the end of the day,

296
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,272
everything pointed to murder.

297
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,091
Kathleen Peterson was killed

298
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,362
at the bottom of that staircase.

299
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,636
Did you ever consider
the alternatives?

300
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,383
Honestly, not much.

301
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,353
I don't ignore facts.

302
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,313
You had debt, work stress,

303
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,892
empty nest, infidelity,

304
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,847
and the discovery of a lie.

305
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:19,527
I wish murder wasn't
predictable, but...

306
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,237
it is.

307
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:25,744
So... what if it was murder?

308
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:27,807
Okay.

309
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:30,613
Go on.

310
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,673
Michael sleeps with a man.

311
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:34,854
- Dennis.

312
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,697
So you heard about Dennis Rowe?

313
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:42,521
What-what-what's this
interview really about?

314
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:44,471
I'd like to know more
about the relationship

315
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,281
between the Durham DA

316
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:49,434
and the State Bureau
of Investigation.

317
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:53,229
- SBI.
- Well, the SBI is an independent agency,

318
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,107
uh, arriving at
objective conclusions

319
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,466
based on the evidence in hand.

320
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:00,940
There is no relationship.

321
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,156
Well, what I found suggests

322
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:05,228
that isn't really
what's going on.

323
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,618
The DA's office,

324
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:09,187
they write the year-end
performance reviews

325
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:10,713
for all SBI analysts.

326
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,873
What are you suggesting?

327
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,351
That it's pretty hard
to stay objective

328
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,993
when your raise is
being determined

329
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:18,081
by the prosecution.

330
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:19,399
No.

331
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:20,915
Honey, the Durham DA

332
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,292
and the SBI aren't
hiding anything.

333
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:24,985
It's no secret.

334
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:27,391
I mean, it may be problematic,

335
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,792
but it's not illegal.

336
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:34,360
Until the problematic
relationship encourages SBI

337
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:37,565
to shade evidence or hide
it to suit the DA's needs.

338
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,586
Okay. Alright,
well, uh, go on.

339
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,322
Dennis tells someone he
knows about a rich man

340
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,405
with a big house

341
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,201
and... accidentally

342
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,829
puts an idea into
a bad man's head.

343
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:54,274
And that bad man
goes to 1810 Cedar,

344
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:55,901
ends up killing Kathleen.

345
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,794
Kathleen and Dennis
had the same injuries.

346
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,588
So the same man could
have killed them both.

347
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:01,989
Art: So what you're saying is

348
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,391
Rowe tells Tyrone
Lacour about Peterson.

349
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,668
Tyrone Lacour?

350
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,320
Uh, I'm sorry, who's this?

351
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,307
Well, he, he killed Rowe.

352
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,549
Career criminal...

353
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,019
Oh, I'm sorry. Your
mic. I can't...

354
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:16,837
- Wait.
- What?

355
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,306
You know, I started
as a defense attorney.

356
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,571
My family, they had
run-ins with the law,

357
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,740
and I thought when
I get the chance,

358
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,894
why not help those in need?

359
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,312
But then I met the needy.

360
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,837
Men,

361
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,127
mostly men,

362
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:48,579
doing... horrible
things to women.

363
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,180
And as a defense attorney,

364
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,835
I had to do my best
to get 'em off.

365
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,118
But you know what? When it
came to the wife beaters,

366
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,767
I didn't even really have
to try all that hard.

367
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,703
You know, hit a woman
and give her a little...

368
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,064
If you're unlucky, you get

369
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,985
three months max in county.

370
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:08,572
But steal a man's car?

371
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:10,147
No, now we're
talking real crime.

372
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:13,502
Say Lacour's, he's late on rent.

373
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:14,788
Sorry.

374
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,581
So he goes to Peterson's

375
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,666
to steal some stuff
that he could sell.

376
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,609
He surprises Kathleen.

377
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,345
One thing leads to
another, and, uh,

378
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,179
you've got yourself
a crime scene

379
00:24:25,204 --> 00:24:26,416
worth making a movie about.

380
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,992
- Exactly.
- Yeah, but we,

381
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:32,472
we didn't find any
signs of an intruder.

382
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:34,374
Maybe you missed the signs.

383
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,884
No, we didn't, we didn't miss
any 'cause there weren't any.

384
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:40,951
Because, because Lacour,

385
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,100
he knew Peterson...

386
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:49,072
in the same way
Dennis knew Peterson.

387
00:24:50,192 --> 00:24:52,277
Michael knew Lacour?

388
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:54,647
Oh yeah. When we
questioned Rowe, he folded.

389
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:57,347
Told us that
Peterson was getting

390
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,457
a piece of Lacour too.

391
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,042
Lacour didn't need to break in

392
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,569
because he'd been there before.

393
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:03,686
With Michael.

394
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:07,397
Michael slept with both of them?

395
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,543
Uh, Michael Peterson
fucked a lot of people.

396
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,375
But this Lacour thing,
it's good, Sophie.

397
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,818
It's real good.

398
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:19,487
I'm going to follow up on this.

399
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:21,955
I got worn out helping
the wrong people, so...

400
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,773
I decided to switch teams.

401
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:28,877
I could make a difference
in the DA's office.

402
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:31,984
And it felt good, mostly.

403
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,009
Sometimes it didn't.

404
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:40,278
Because you weren't
playing fair.

405
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:41,958
Life's not fair.

406
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:44,379
And the law reflects that.

407
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,671
If I think someone's
done something wrong,

408
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,227
how am I going to
live with myself

409
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:50,174
if I don't do
everything in my power

410
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,776
to stop 'em from
doing it again, huh?

411
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:55,266
Freda, there are three
men from around the state

412
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:58,558
who have been executed
on faulty SBI evidence.

413
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,336
They were killed for
crimes they didn't commit.

414
00:26:03,216 --> 00:26:04,217
That true?

415
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,733
I'm working on a specific case.

416
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,609
There's a man sitting in prison

417
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,111
who shouldn't be there.

418
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:14,365
I got an order of
napkins I need to press.

419
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,268
Will you testify to
the quid pro quo nature

420
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:19,212
of the SBI/DA relationship?

421
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:22,227
You know where to
find me, sweetie.

422
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:35,341
I can't really remember her.

423
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:37,979
Your mom was an angel.

424
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:40,509
She treasured you girls.

425
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:45,125
What was she like
after my dad died?

426
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,008
Oh, Liz was a mess.

427
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:48,492
She couldn't understand

428
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:50,617
why something like this
would happen to her.

429
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:52,236
To you girls.

430
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,073
After she died, your
emotions were so big.

431
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,824
You had tantrums.

432
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,516
That's what made Michael so mad.

433
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,262
He couldn't control you.
He didn't like that.

434
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:04,789
So he did bad things.

435
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,890
Did you see him hit me?

436
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:13,516
No.

437
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:16,790
I only saw what happened
after he hit you.

438
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:19,875
Bruises on your arms, your face.

439
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,902
It was unbearable.

440
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:24,137
You were too young to
remember, but Margaret.

441
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:25,538
She could tell you.

442
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:28,191
- She knows.
- No. That's not right.

443
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:29,982
Aunt Blair could tell you

444
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:32,001
how horrible Michael
was bouncing you

445
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,277
from home to home.

446
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:36,347
Michael and Patty kept
giving you away to people.

447
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:37,832
Giving us away?

448
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,575
There was a German
couple who wanted

449
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,101
to adopt you and Margaret.

450
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,460
It didn't work out with them,

451
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:44,069
so you went to Texas.

452
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:45,873
Then Memphis. Then Aunt Blair.

453
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:47,375
Wait, what are
you talking about?

454
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,319
Then Michael wanted
to keep Margaret

455
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:50,953
and give you away.

456
00:27:50,978 --> 00:27:53,311
Your mama and papa
were already gone.

457
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:56,509
Could you imagine taking
your sister from you?

458
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,307
What was so wrong with me?

459
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:02,750
Patty Peterson: Oh, Martha.

460
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,320
You were simply acting

461
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:06,601
like a child who
had lost her father

462
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,336
and then her dear mother.

463
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:11,695
Lightning struck twice, and
it just made you a nightmare.

464
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:13,180
That's all.

465
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,666
- I was three.
- You had fits and tantrums.

466
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,491
You hurt yourself. You
were bruised all the time.

467
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:22,969
We, we could not assuage
your inner turmoil.

468
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,620
Michael and I loved you,

469
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:28,690
but it seemed we could
not love you enough.

470
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:30,483
So you tried to give me away?

471
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,053
Jesus, Patty.

472
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:41,864
I live my life trying my best

473
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:44,807
and also believing

474
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:48,578
that everyone else
is trying their best.

475
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,531
And that is all people can do.

476
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:55,388
That's all we can
expect from them.

477
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,779
I extend this philosophy
to all my children.

478
00:28:59,526 --> 00:29:00,900
And even to Michael.

479
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:08,764
When I feel disappointed, I
know it's simply my belief

480
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,368
in a reality that
never truly existed.

481
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,734
Are you disappointed, Martha?

482
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:23,985
I just wonder

483
00:29:25,602 --> 00:29:28,272
if all of this
hadn't happened...

484
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:32,104
who would I be?

485
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,882
If things had been different,

486
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:38,680
you would be different.

487
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,368
For what it's worth...

488
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,340
I really love who you are.

489
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:57,559
And I look forward to knowing
the Martha you will become.

490
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:14,855
You look beautiful.

491
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,168
Beautiful women
deserve good news.

492
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,696
- Hmm. We do?
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:22,827
Simon called.

494
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,152
- Simon?
- My agent.

495
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:27,641
Right.

496
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:30,127
Remember "Charlie Two Shoes"?

497
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,593
Oh yeah, I loved that book.

498
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:34,997
Well, that book just got
optioned by some producer

499
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,941
who wants to turn
it into a movie.

500
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,092
- Big one.
- Really?

501
00:30:38,117 --> 00:30:40,730
- Yeah.
- Michael.

502
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,318
You're not just telling me
something I want to hear

503
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,567
to make me feel better, are you?

504
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:45,595
Check my phone.

505
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:49,098
Simon called. The
option's guaranteed.

506
00:30:49,123 --> 00:30:51,251
What happens then,
I have no idea,

507
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:52,285
but it seems promising.

508
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,603
Wow.

509
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,041
- How much?
- $10,000.

510
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:00,446
Okay.

511
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:03,550
Well, tomorrow we'll celebrate,

512
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:05,035
have a fun dinner.

513
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:06,842
I'll go and buy that
watch for Caitlin

514
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:07,742
that she really wants.

515
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,727
She's got such good taste,

516
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:10,801
just like her mother.

517
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:13,307
Oh shit.

518
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,772
We gotta light the
candles and leave.

519
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:41,543
- Something happening at Nortel you're not telling me about?
- I know!

520
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,693
Kathleen.

521
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,529
Excuse me.

522
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:46,847
Hey, Devon.

523
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,624
Isn't this pretty crazy?

524
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:52,823
- Maybe a little much.
- Yeah.

525
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,542
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

526
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,939
Remember CommTech? The
company Nortel bought?

527
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:25,394
Yeah, of course.

528
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,816
Well, they just sold it.

529
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:29,847
- Who?
- They, as in, we.

530
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:32,410
Nortel sold it
for, like, nothing.

531
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,578
Who told you that?

532
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,521
Amber, Ethan's assistant.

533
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:38,464
She saw something on his desk.

534
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,120
What does this mean?

535
00:32:40,145 --> 00:32:42,480
Why would we sell a
company we just bought

536
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:44,423
for less than we bought it?

537
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:45,614
I don't know, whatever it means,

538
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:46,981
we can't do anything
about it tonight.

539
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:48,005
So just...

540
00:32:58,036 --> 00:32:59,036
Okay.

541
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:03,941
I'm sorry to ruin your night.

542
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,298
Why don't you go
flirt with someone

543
00:33:06,323 --> 00:33:07,616
you shouldn't be flirting with.

544
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,362
Okay.

545
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:11,787
Oh.

546
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:16,038
Your cocktail.

547
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,904
You see that line?

548
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,467
I had to butter up the
bartender just to cut in front.

549
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:22,852
He's cute.

550
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:24,811
I could get his number.

551
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:27,028
For whom?

552
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:41,812
Hey, Sophie.

553
00:33:47,043 --> 00:33:48,767
You have bad news?

554
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:52,190
The Lacour theory
was good, Sophie.

555
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:53,769
It was really good.

556
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,607
How do you know it wasn't him?

557
00:33:56,863 --> 00:33:58,689
Tyrone's got the perfect alibi.

558
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:01,201
Check again.

559
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:03,770
The night Kathleen
died, he was in jail.

560
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:06,467
That man wasn't at 1810 Cedar.

561
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,839
At least not in December 2001.

562
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,284
You came around.

563
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:14,845
You know Kathleen didn't fall.

564
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,013
No.

565
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:19,646
We don't know
that. Not for sure.

566
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,640
In my experience, a woman
either has an accident

567
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:22,665
or she doesn't.

568
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:27,002
But, hey, that's just,
that's just my experience.

569
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,563
Well, in my experience,
I've always found life

570
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:32,279
to be far more complicated

571
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,870
than yes or no, black or white.

572
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:38,901
An owl, or something
you've never thought about.

573
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,596
Sophie, sometimes life
isn't complicated.

574
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:47,469
The answers, they're sitting
right there in front of you

575
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:48,774
just waiting for you to see 'em.

576
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,276
I don't need you here anymore.

577
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,097
Take care, Sophie.

578
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,152
I didn't know you were back.

579
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,436
Is everything okay?
Are the kids...

580
00:35:45,461 --> 00:35:46,629
I never left Durham.

581
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,093
Hmm.

582
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:52,767
Well...

583
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:57,844
you didn't have to lie to me.

584
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,880
- Why did you?
- Dennis Rowe.

585
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,167
You slept with him.

586
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,234
Dennis was killed.

587
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:09,246
Okay.

588
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,385
Blunt force trauma to the
head with no skull fractures.

589
00:36:14,918 --> 00:36:16,310
No.

590
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:19,999
That's unbelievable.

591
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:23,432
Oddly, that's not the part
that's hard to believe.

592
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:28,724
The man who killed him was
another man you... knew.

593
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,872
Tyrone Lacour.

594
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:36,193
You slept with him, too.

595
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:39,857
Michael...

596
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:43,423
you know, I thought maybe
I finally got the answer

597
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,742
that if this guy
had killed Kathleen,

598
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:48,933
that it was all a
horrible mistake.

599
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,544
But all I did was
open Pandora's box.

600
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,802
This is crazy.

601
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:00,037
Michael!

602
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:02,559
Don't you have anything to say?

603
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,841
I-I-I lied about Dennis.

604
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:11,331
I don't know Tyrone.

605
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:13,685
At least, I don't think I do.

606
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,677
I mean, sure, it's possible.

607
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,979
Sophie, I don't want
to be the reason

608
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,662
you can't get the life you want.

609
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,869
If you need something more,

610
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:28,480
if you need something
different than this,

611
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:30,048
than me,

612
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:31,074
I understand.

613
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,051
But you're what I want.

614
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,725
I'm not her.

615
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,167
I'm not Kathleen.

616
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:47,360
No, I know you're not.

617
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:50,035
I want the truth,
just like she did.

618
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:54,423
And...

619
00:37:56,236 --> 00:37:58,694
I won't share you,
not in that way.

620
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,205
No, you don't. And you won't.

621
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:02,814
You know, I'll give
you everything.

622
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:11,802
So what do you want to do here?

623
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:16,994
I need more time.

624
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,171
Jean.

625
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:37,618
Sophie.

626
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:41,113
Sophie, Sophie, Sophie...

627
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,832
Um...

628
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:37,625
Shit.

629
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,514
David: Is there
anyone in the room

630
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,040
who thinks she didn't know?

631
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:01,594
Mike said Kathleen knew.

632
00:41:01,686 --> 00:41:03,852
So she must have known, right?

633
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,072
Right?

634
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:17,549
Has anyone in this room
ever successfully hidden

635
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,242
anything from their wives?

636
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:23,805
Moving on.

637
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,653
With Freda's help, we can prove

638
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,863
that they didn't have the
results to convict him,

639
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:32,157
and they buried
exculpatory evidence.

640
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:33,750
Before we go public,
you're 100 percent sure

641
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,077
this guy didn't do it.

642
00:41:35,102 --> 00:41:36,117
He's innocent.

643
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,593
But there's more.

644
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:42,154
It seems to be a systemic issue.

645
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,963
I can't tell you how
widespread the corruption goes,

646
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:47,656
but I can say for sure

647
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:49,516
this isn't just a one-off thing.

648
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,319
He's not the only victim here.

649
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:54,385
Alright. Do we have motive?

650
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,834
Motive?

651
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:58,381
I think I got that too.

652
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,231
I'm not sure there's
anything to find.

653
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:11,061
Keep looking.

654
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,181
Case 432. What's shaking
with that lawnmower?

655
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:24,560
- Sir, what's going
on? On your knees, sir.

656
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,794
On your knees. On your knees.

657
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,753
- On your knees.
- What's going on?

658
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:27,796
Keep your eyes to the front.

659
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,114
Evidence now shows that

660
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:31,383
the North Carolina State
Bureau of Investigation

661
00:42:31,408 --> 00:42:33,661
has failed to
perform their duty.

662
00:42:33,686 --> 00:42:35,846
Findings by the Innocence
Project revealed

663
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:38,415
that SBI frequently
withheld test results

664
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,255
that contradicted the DA's case.

665
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,811
And this is how Greg Taylor
spent 19 years in prison

666
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:45,712
for a crime he did not commit.

667
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:47,805
Taylor was convicted in 1993

668
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,749
in the beating death
of Jacquetta Thomas.

669
00:42:49,774 --> 00:42:52,326
The only physical evidence
was a spot of blood

670
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:54,562
found near the wheel of his SUV.

671
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:57,676
But further testing by
SBI revealed the substance

672
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,201
was inconsistent
with human blood.

673
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:02,895
This second test was never
shared with the court

674
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,875
or with Taylor's defense.

675
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,710
Evelyn Ivins, an attorney

676
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:08,904
for the North Carolina
Innocence Project,

677
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:11,223
led the investigation into SBI.

678
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:13,858
Our findings in the
Greg Taylor case suggest

679
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:17,428
SBI labs intentionally
hid exculpatory evidence

680
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,878
that would have exonerated him.

681
00:43:18,938 --> 00:43:21,107
Further investigation
leads us to believe

682
00:43:21,144 --> 00:43:23,713
that the corruption
between state DA

683
00:43:23,738 --> 00:43:27,105
and the supposedly independent
investigative unit,

684
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,008
it's a complex web of lies,

685
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:31,284
which is why we are thrilled

686
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,671
to announce audits of
all SBI cases to date

687
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,407
to ensure other
wrongly convicted men

688
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,488
and women get
their day in court.

689
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,324
What the fuck?

690
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,768
Sir. No, I'm going in.

691
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,133
You can't go in there.
- Bill: Yes. Call security.

692
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:49,711
Sir! We're very good friends.

693
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:51,675
Trust me. He's going to
be very happy to see me.

694
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:57,928
My money was on tomorrow,

695
00:43:57,953 --> 00:43:59,079
but tonight works.

696
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:00,981
David, this SBI thing

697
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,876
is just absolute insanity.

698
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,970
Those, those motherfuckers!

699
00:44:05,995 --> 00:44:07,402
Okay, settle down, Bill.

700
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:08,783
We always knew they
were full of shit.

701
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:10,244
Now we have proof. You,

702
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:11,955
you should have known
how corrupt they were.

703
00:44:11,979 --> 00:44:13,730
- Jesus Christ!
- Of course, I knew.

704
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:15,343
They were all corrupt.

705
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:17,954
Which was why we
ran our own tests.

706
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:19,647
It's why I cost so much.

707
00:44:19,677 --> 00:44:21,303
But when the state
audits our case,

708
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,493
they aren't going to
find any SBI wrongdoing.

709
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:25,901
We kept our eyes on things.

710
00:44:25,926 --> 00:44:27,499
You think Tom
Maher's going to let

711
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,084
some bullshit like this fly?

712
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:32,897
We can't give up.

713
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:36,050
Hey, nobody said
anything about giving up.

714
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:37,118
You did.

715
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:40,206
Three years ago.

716
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:43,220
You left my brother
to rot in there.

717
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:47,452
Come on, sit. Please, sit.

718
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,895
Bill, hey.

719
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:50,845
Come on. Please, sit.

720
00:44:52,227 --> 00:44:53,227
Sit.

721
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,752
I don't keep this
because I'm in it.

722
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,352
I keep it 'cause I'm not.

723
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:18,628
It reminds me of Michael.
The mistakes I made.

724
00:45:19,056 --> 00:45:21,016
The ones you only
see in hindsight.

725
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:27,649
I don't like to lose.

726
00:45:29,316 --> 00:45:32,152
And I really don't like
seeing my clients in prison,

727
00:45:32,177 --> 00:45:34,262
especially when
they're innocent.

728
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,404
But we already did some digging.

729
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,613
SBI didn't fuck us.

730
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:43,605
Yes, David, but?

731
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,591
An SBI agent did.

732
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:49,704
A Mr. Duane Deaver lied
about his experience.

733
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,992
He lied on the
stand, under oath.

734
00:45:52,017 --> 00:45:54,644
He said he was an expert.

735
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:56,630
That he had overseen, what,

736
00:45:56,655 --> 00:45:59,158
500 blood spatter cases.

737
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:00,675
At the time Deaver testified,

738
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,453
he'd only been to
fifty-fucking-four.

739
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:06,686
- Deaver perjured himself?
- Yeah.

740
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:08,006
W-what does that get us?

741
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,575
Well, we've been here before

742
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,518
with the computers.

743
00:46:12,678 --> 00:46:15,772
We need to prove that
Deaver's testimony swayed

744
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:17,036
the jury enough

745
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:19,402
that had it not been included,

746
00:46:19,427 --> 00:46:21,596
the verdict could
have gone another way.

747
00:46:21,621 --> 00:46:24,040
- And then?
- And then maybe,

748
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:28,361
maybe by the grace
of a reasonable God,

749
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,372
we get a hearing for a retrial.

750
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:34,902
Not a retrial, but...
a hearing for one.

751
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,547
If that goes the
way we want it to,

752
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,272
he will be out.

753
00:46:40,308 --> 00:46:41,655
- That's good.
- Yeah.

754
00:46:44,456 --> 00:46:46,124
- That's good.
- It's really good.

755
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:51,478
I don't care what it
takes or how long.

756
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:55,028
You're going to make
up for these mistakes.

757
00:46:56,558 --> 00:46:58,638
You're going to figure out
how this helps my brother.

758
00:47:00,186 --> 00:47:02,439
And you're going
to do it for free.

759
00:47:08,546 --> 00:47:10,233
He's not listening to reason.

760
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:12,205
You, uh, you may want to rethink

761
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,827
your tickets for tomorrow.

762
00:47:13,852 --> 00:47:15,077
He's not taking the plea?

763
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:16,793
I'll speak with him.

764
00:47:16,818 --> 00:47:18,904
Okay. Be my guest.

765
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:21,182
Tell him he's
being a fool. Okay?

766
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:23,292
A moron. This has been
years in the making.

767
00:47:23,317 --> 00:47:26,410
He is lucky to be here today.

768
00:47:26,435 --> 00:47:28,101
He could go back to prison.

769
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:30,936
That is a very real reality.

770
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,412
Just let me talk to him, David.

771
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:44,491
I know this wasn't
our plan. I'm sorry.

772
00:47:45,182 --> 00:47:47,768
We've talked about this.

773
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,493
You'd have to lie
about that night.

774
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:55,041
To get what you want.

775
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:57,649
What we want.

776
00:47:58,468 --> 00:47:59,886
But I can't lie anymore.

777
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:02,187
I'm not perfect.
Jesus, no man is.

778
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,298
But I'm not this. Mm-mm.

779
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:09,775
And the kids,

780
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:11,216
the money.

781
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:15,591
But if I don't sign,
it all starts again.

782
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,080
Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

783
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,897
And if you take this plea,

784
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:21,008
you can leave Durham tomorrow.

785
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:24,501
And finally... be done.

786
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,446
Whatever you decide.
I'll be here.

787
00:48:29,882 --> 00:48:31,283
But I must say one thing.

788
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:35,421
The DA doesn't care about
what really happened.

789
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,582
People who believe
you're guilty,

790
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,326
they do not care
about other truths.

791
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:41,483
The table's crooked, Michael.

792
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:44,272
No matter the circumstance,
they'll never say they were wrong.

793
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:45,429
Why the fuck not?

794
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:46,901
Why can't they just see
that's what happened?

795
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:47,926
They made a mistake.

796
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,111
We get to go back
and correct it.

797
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,971
We get to fix the past,
and that's never an option.

798
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,725
But today...

799
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:55,996
today it is.

800
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:59,822
I need to speak with Jean alone.

801
00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:10,390
Kathleen Peterson's office.

802
00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:12,943
Sure.

803
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:33,350
Kathleen.

804
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:35,959
Kathleen.

805
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:38,499
They want to see you.

806
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:50,754
Remember you have Mike's
celebration dinner tonight.

807
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,119
This one was done.

808
00:49:56,144 --> 00:49:57,225
Yeah, it's gonna be a long day.

809
00:49:57,249 --> 00:49:58,877
Yeah, it's brutal,

810
00:49:58,902 --> 00:50:00,361
but what can we do?

811
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:04,450
Thank you for joining
us on such short notice.

812
00:50:04,526 --> 00:50:06,819
- Of course. Sit.

813
00:50:18,535 --> 00:50:20,862
I wish we could say
we called you here

814
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:23,346
with better news, but, um...

815
00:50:25,424 --> 00:50:28,752
it seems we won't be giving

816
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:30,779
end-of-year bonuses.

817
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,378
Oh.

818
00:50:45,194 --> 00:50:47,154
Okay. That-that...
Yes, that is...

819
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:52,003
that is bad news.

820
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,065
None of us will be
receiving bonuses.

821
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:56,930
The third and fourth
quarters were, uh...

822
00:50:58,897 --> 00:51:00,283
challenging.

823
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:05,025
So, no year... No,
no year-end bonuses.

824
00:51:06,558 --> 00:51:07,851
Correct.

825
00:51:19,298 --> 00:51:21,300
See, I was just
sitting at my desk,

826
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:24,287
and I watched our stock drop

827
00:51:24,312 --> 00:51:27,056
27 percent in
under four minutes.

828
00:51:28,374 --> 00:51:32,754
Um... I mean, it has
not stopped going down.

829
00:51:33,616 --> 00:51:35,701
So, I mean, who
cares about bonuses?

830
00:51:42,158 --> 00:51:44,702
I just lost my retirement.

831
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,976
All of it.

832
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,837
Nearly a million dollars.

833
00:51:50,122 --> 00:51:51,602
Ohh!

834
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,452
Oh my...

835
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,585
Sorry I'm late.

836
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:10,140
Did you come straight
from the gym?

837
00:52:10,165 --> 00:52:11,671
Indeed.

838
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:12,721
Here.

839
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:19,137
- Have you been home?
- Busy day.

840
00:52:19,321 --> 00:52:21,240
Someone gave me a list
of Christmas chores.

841
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,931
What should we order?

842
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:28,997
Oh, I, uh, I already did.

843
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:30,315
I ordered, I ordered a lot.

844
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:32,752
Celebration.

845
00:52:39,908 --> 00:52:42,452
But seriously, this book option

846
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,025
could lead to some real money.

847
00:52:45,443 --> 00:52:48,488
And then you can rest, not
worry so much about Nortel.

848
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:50,017
That's great. I
mean, it's really...

849
00:52:50,999 --> 00:52:52,835
That's great, Michael. Um...

850
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:57,011
I have to tell you something.

851
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,235
Shoot.

852
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:03,118
I, I thought you would have
already known, but, um,

853
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:04,531
our stocks...

854
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:06,548
Nortel.

855
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:11,009
It's all gone.
Everything's gone.

856
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:13,418
What are you talking about?

857
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,994
Retirement account. Moving
to Paris in ten years.

858
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:20,781
I mean, all our dreams, they're,
they're... they're dead.

859
00:53:23,128 --> 00:53:24,338
It's all gone.

860
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:26,734
The bubble burst.

861
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,561
You're shitting
me. We're poor?

862
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:33,002
All those hours and work trips

863
00:53:33,027 --> 00:53:36,155
and... sacrifices.

864
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,414
I mean, I have...

865
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:40,807
wasted...

866
00:53:41,408 --> 00:53:44,447
wasted years of my life.

867
00:53:46,278 --> 00:53:49,274
And now I'm sitting here in
this fucking Chinese restaurant,

868
00:53:49,299 --> 00:53:52,063
and I don't even know if I
can afford this stupid meal.

869
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,064
Michael: Hey, no.

870
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:54,449
The movie's going
to work out, huh?

871
00:53:56,646 --> 00:53:57,646
What?

872
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,030
Do you think some
Hollywood producer's

873
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:03,098
going to come along and
make you a millionaire?

874
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:04,541
Are you kidding?

875
00:54:04,566 --> 00:54:06,235
You're fucking
kidding me, Michael?

876
00:54:07,398 --> 00:54:09,943
We'll figure it
out. It'll be okay.

877
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,674
The only way this will be okay

878
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:15,752
is if I make it okay,

879
00:54:15,777 --> 00:54:18,120
and I am way too
fucking exhausted.

880
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:20,487
You're not alone here.

881
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:22,890
Well, sometimes I think it
would be easier if I was.

882
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:26,380
Oh, I see.

883
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:28,865
What? What do you see?

884
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,829
- Joan of Arc burning before me.

885
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:35,197
- What?
- You know, you used to be fun.

886
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,668
Your eyes, they used to
have a light behind them.

887
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,986
And now all I see is,
is this stress case.

888
00:54:40,011 --> 00:54:42,889
You forgot what it is
to smile, to be alive.

889
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:46,919
Fuck you, Michael.

890
00:54:46,944 --> 00:54:48,971
You know, you, you used
to take care of yourself.

891
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,538
You used to be a
really good time.

892
00:54:50,563 --> 00:54:54,050
A good time?

893
00:54:54,284 --> 00:54:57,746
I am too busy to be
anyone's good time.

894
00:54:57,938 --> 00:54:59,440
I am busy working.

895
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:01,843
I am busy raising your children.

896
00:55:01,868 --> 00:55:04,319
I mean, Margaret and Martha,
they were a mess before me.

897
00:55:04,616 --> 00:55:07,263
And the boys. Your boys.

898
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,515
I am the one who supports them.

899
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,583
I am the one who visited
Clayton in prison.

900
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,819
And Todd, god, he is so lost
looking for your approval,

901
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,929
I don't think he'll
ever find his way home.

902
00:55:16,954 --> 00:55:19,500
And you just wander through
life, going to the gym

903
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:23,348
and yelling at the dogs
and spending my money,

904
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:26,177
promising these big,
beautiful dreams like Paris,

905
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:28,493
and then you don't do a goddamn
thing to make them happen.

906
00:55:28,518 --> 00:55:29,954
I mean, I thought
I married a man.

907
00:55:30,037 --> 00:55:32,789
It turns out all I got was a boy

908
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,623
who is only good

909
00:55:34,648 --> 00:55:37,026
for getting drinks at the bar.

910
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:45,717
Say something.

911
00:55:47,571 --> 00:55:48,571
Michael.

912
00:55:49,782 --> 00:55:51,033
Are you even here?!

913
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:00,339
Of course, I am.

914
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:02,717
I'm here for you,

915
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:04,550
for the kids,

916
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:06,809
for my parents,

917
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,809
for my men in combat.

918
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:11,385
I've always been here.

919
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:14,494
Maybe you're the one
who's disappeared.

920
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:17,458
Maybe the problem is that the life
you have isn't the life you want.

921
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:20,129
And I am damned, Kathleen, if I'm going
to continue to be your whipping boy.

922
00:56:20,153 --> 00:56:21,362
So figure it out!

923
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:24,002
Or move on.

924
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:26,065
Congratulations.

925
00:56:41,323 --> 00:56:42,902
You're upset.

926
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:45,168
You shouldn't drive.

927
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,813
I'm gonna finish the song.

928
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:27,544
Fuck!

929
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,630
This is it!

930
00:59:49,421 --> 00:59:50,931
Yes!

931
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:09,065
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

932
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:00,967
Hey, Margie.

933
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:13,522
Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

934
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,132
- Ahhh!

935
01:01:17,157 --> 01:01:19,451
Look how strong your dad is!

936
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,327
Baby, come here.

937
01:01:26,722 --> 01:01:28,307
Want to give Aunt Margie a hug?

938
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,126
Hi, Aunt Margie.

939
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,188
Hey, Clay.

940
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:35,241
- How are you?
- Yeah, good.

941
01:01:35,446 --> 01:01:36,944
- Don't you wanna go say hi?
- Hi!

942
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:40,473
Oh my god. You girls
are getting so big!

943
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:42,991
Okay, come on. Let's go in.

944
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:46,561
How are you?

945
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:48,076
I'm fine. How are you?

946
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,749
- Nervous.
- Yeah.

947
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,461
- It's gonna be good.
- Hey, Clay, grab my bag.

947
01:01:54,305 --> 01:02:54,233
