00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,995
Hi. I'm Andy Millman.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,437
What would you rather do,
have your child die of thirst or dysentery?

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,714
That's not a choice
that you or I have to make, is it?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,872
But one in five people don't have
access to clean drinking water.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,430
Every day, millions of people have
to drink the only water available to them

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,556
and they run the risk of dying.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,794
You can help put an end to that terrible risk
by pledging just £5. Please help.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,115
Cut.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,315
-Was that all right?
-That was fantastic.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,958
-Brilliant, my pleasure.
-Thank you so much.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,632
That was so wonderful. Chris!

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,314
-Hi, hello. How are you?
-What's this for today?

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,913
-It's for people in the Third World...
-Yeah.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,228
...who don't have clean drinking...

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,153
This screen.
Are you gonna project anything on there?

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,117
Oh, we don't know yet. I'm not quite sure.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,033
Okay. Because we have an album
coming out, Greatest Hits.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,429
Maybe just put a picture
of the album cover on it.

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,919
-Oh, ah...
-Just simple.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,992
I think, probably, if we're gonna
project anything, we'll show sort of pictures

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,355
of people dying
because of a lack of clean water.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,510
Could they be holding the album?

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,513
Not really, no. I think that might be
a bit inappropriate, perhaps?

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,874
Oh.

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,190
I presume at some point
you're gonna have some footage

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,192
of these people walking around
looking sad, miserable.

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,919
What about some music? Check this out.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,877
(HUMMING)

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,198
-Is that one of yours?
-Yeah, yeah. Trouble.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,238
Just say at the bottom,
"This is available, Coldplay, Greatest Hits. "

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,993
-I'm not quite sure what's gonna happen yet.
-Easy. Easy.

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,958
-So easy! All right, okay.
-I think probably...

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,749
-Now, where do you want me to stand?
-Just there, that's great.

34
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,675
-Hey, I know you.
-You all right?

35
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,194
Are we having a laugh?

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,272
-Are you having a laugh? Yeah.
-Yeah. I could come on your show.

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,715
-What's your audience, five or six million?
-That'd be fab!

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,712
I don't know. I think it's weird,
celebrities just popping up in a sitcom,

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,074
you know what I mean?

40
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,469
-It'd be good. I could play myself.
-Right.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,755
What would Chris Martin be doing
visiting a factory in Wigan?

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,432
-I don't know. You work it out.
-We will.

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,555
-We won't.
-We will.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,993
-When do you shoot?
-Thursdays.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,911
-I can't do Thursdays.
-Oh, never mind. Okay.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,274
-I can do Wednesdays.
-We can move it.

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,952
-We can't move it, can we?
-No. We can.

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,792
-Well, move it.
-I'll have... Yeah.

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,076
Can we get on with this?
I've got to do AIDS and Alzheimer's

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,470
and landmines this afternoon,
and I want to get back for Deal or No Deal,

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,949
plus Gwyneth's making drumsticks.

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,035
Do some bloody work.
What's up with you lot?

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,917
-We're depressed, Mr Stokes.
-Why?

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,831
Radio's broken, Mr Stokes.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,835
Statistics prove that workers are much more
productive with musical accompaniment.

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,758
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,196
Oh, we can't work without music.

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,034
Can't work without music!
Who are you, seven bloody dwarves?

I'm not made of money,
and we've spent the budget for the year,

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,357
so I don't know what we're gonna do.

-I don't believe it.

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,875
-It's only Chris Martin from Coldplay.
-Hey.

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,030
Chris, what are you doing here,
in a factory in Wigan? It's mental.

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,918
Well, Ray, I'm just in the area
to promote our new album,

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,194
Coldplay, The Greatest Hits.

00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,034
And I thought I'd pop on over and say hello.

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,076
Right. When's that due out?

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,470
It's coming out on the 17th of this month
and it's gonna be really great.

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,439
Oh, fantastic. Well, this is gonna sound
absolutely ridiculous,

75
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,718
-but do you mind performing a song for us?
-Are you having a laugh?

Well, it's politeness, innit?

Just being polite. We are celebrating
with that lovely bit of muffin.

What would be the best news
you could get today?

107
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,152
You're going full time
at the Carphone Warehouse.

108

I don't work
at the Carphone Warehouse any more.

-All right.
-No, what news could you get

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,273
that'd mean you've finally got the
critical respect you've been looking for?

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,635
I don't know. BBC One comedy with
catchphrases and stupid wigs

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,077
filmed in front of a live studio audience
of morons is suddenly considered cool?

114
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,513
That's never gonna happen, is it?

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,034
No. You've been nominated for a BAFTA.
Best Comedy Performance.

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,599
-Really?
-Yeah.

117
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,154
Not going to win, though.
Something classier than this'll win.

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,593
No, no. Because I was thinking the same,

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,432
and then I was looking down
the list of nominees

120
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,717
and it's all crap this year,
so you've got as good a chance as anyone.

Cheers.

More good news as well.
I had a call from a toy manufacturer

123
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,036
and they're quite keen to put out
a Ray doll for Christmas.

-Same people who watch your show.

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,114

that's what I'm going for.

128
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,192
Don't slag them off 'cause those people
spend a fortune on this sort of tat.

Oh, that Crazy Frog made millions.

I'd have thought, or trying to crack Japan.

It's not bad for a frog, though, is it?

133
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,391
It's very good for a frog, Bar,
if you don't mind me saying.

134
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,472
I'd have thought he's probably the second
richest frog in the world after Kermit.

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,155
-Kermit, yeah. There was his nephew, Robin.
-Ah, Robin was good.

136
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,912
Looked set to take over the empire
for a while, didn't he?

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,149

something down my front?

00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,879
Are there any of these that are...

151
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,873
It's all very expensive.
I don't think you can afford anything.

152
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,195
-How do you know what I can afford?
-Oh, just a hunch.

153
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,398
Hunch, you're a hunch.

154
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,198
-Hmm?
-Nothing.

155
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,911
-Nothing in there?
-No, nothing. Come on, let's go.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,719
-Oh, where we going now?
-Somewhere, just anywhere else.

157
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,677
-What exactly are you looking for?
-I'm looking for a place

158
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,512
where people aren't quite as rude.

159
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,875
-Who was rude?
-Her in there.

160
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,598
-What happened?
-She just looked at me

161
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,116
like I shouldn't be there,
like I was a piece of dirt.

162
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,155
-Come on. Come on.
-Oh, no, no.

163
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,993
(PRETTY WOMAN PLAYING)

164
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,752
-That one?
-Yeah.

165
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,036
Good day.
My friend here was looking for a dress.

166
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,873
I wondered if we could help her with that.
Gold Card there.

167
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,996
-Well, I'm sure we can.
-Hmm. Good.

168
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,756
-Yeah, I think she was looking at this one.
-Oh, wonderful. How much is that?

169
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,757
£2,500.

170
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,636
£2,500?

171
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,472
-Do you want that?
-Yeah.

172
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,788
(GRUNTS)

173
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,236
-lf you don't want it, don't have it.
-No. I want it.

174
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,238
I can definitely afford it.
It's just a matter of is it the right dress?

175
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,389
Yes.

176
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,716
Could we bring it back
if there's something wrong with it,

177
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,279
say, after this coming Sunday?

178
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,478
-No. We don't do refunds.
-No, no, no. But if it didn't fit.

179
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,471
-She should try it on.
-I know, but what if she got fat?

180
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,879
-By Sunday?
-No.

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,238
What if the stitching there
was to be pulled apart slightly?

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,514
-Pulled apart?
-Just came apart?

183
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,879
Just normal wear and tear.
The sweat rot under the old armpit.

184
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,634
Cuts through the old stitches.

185
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,315
Could we...
Let's make absolutely sure, okay?

186
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,119
Always good to be sure. Sorry about this.

187
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,838
-You're not thinking...
-What?

188
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,833
I'm gonna ask you a question now.
Consider the answer, okay?

189
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,317
Do you really want me to spend £2,500
on that dress?

190
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,435
Yes.

191
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,719
She does! Aw. Go on.
We've all learnt a lesson today.

192
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,110
There's a chance it won't fit.

193
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,075
It's not even tax deductible.

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,633
Do you do celebrity discount?

195
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,193
-Well, I don't know who she is.
-She's nobody.

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,872
Are you having a laugh?

197
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,269
-No, we don't do discount.
-No.

198
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,635
Not, "Are you having a laugh?"
Watch this and comprehend.

199
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,711
Are you having a laugh?

200
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,313
Does no one here know...
Is she having a laugh?

201
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,550
-Do you know?
-Oh, yeah. You're from that sitcom.

202
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,392
-Correct.
-Any good?

203
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,476
Not really. It's a bit broad.
Relies on catchphrases and funny wigs.

204
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,118
Sorry. Did I ask for a critique?

205
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,509
Shall I come down to the storeroom
and say you haven't swept up right?

206
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,953
Unbelievable.

207
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,598
-So you don't do celebrity discount?
-No.

208
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,992
-No, not 1%? Couldn't give me 1%?
-Oh, okay. I'll do you a 1% discount.

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,159
-What's that?
-On £2,500? £25.

210
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,596
Not worth it.
I'd rather you stuck it on if anything.

211
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,239
Well, shall we just leave it as it is?

212
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,873
-That's your Christmas and birthday.
-Yeah, okay.

213
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,110
Never would have spent that much.

214
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,799
Those are £600.

215
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,949
(LAUGHING)

216
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,598
-They're very expensive.
-That's not why I was laughing.

217
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,398
I was laughing
they weren't expensive enough in a way.

218
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,994
That's what tickled me
when I first saw the 600.

219
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,752
What do you think?

220
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,988
-Do you think it's all right?
-Yeah.

221
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
-Can I get it?
-Yep.

222
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,518
WOMAN: Andy!
WOMAN 2: Andy!

223
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,830
-Andy.
-Andy, will you win tonight?

224
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,672
Oh, it's just, you know,
flattering to be nominated.

225
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,716
-Is that your girlfriend?
-No, no, no.

226
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,631
-Yeah, all right.
-Always tell journalists the truth

227
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,392
and let them change the facts later.

228
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,278
-And who are you wearing?
-Maggie.

229
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,918
-No.
-Who are you wearing?

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,639
-Maggie Jacobs.
-No. Whose dress is that?

231
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,438
-It's mine.
-Ah, okay. Thank you.

232
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,238
She won a competition.
Don't speak to anyone else tonight.

233
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,912
-What did l...
-Not even to me.

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,197
Dale! Dale! Darling, Dale!

235
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,999
Toby Anstis.

236
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,953
-Have you ever eaten a worm?
-I don't even know what a "worrrm" is.

237
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,237
There's an "r" in it.
You should "prrronounce" it "worrrm".

238
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,788
Old girlfriend. Oh, God. Shall we...

239
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,029
-Andy!
-Hi!

240
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,269
-Hi!
-You all right?

241
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,193
Yeah, I'm good, thanks. Yeah.
God, you've done well.

242
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,475
Yeah. All downhill from here.

243
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,112
Well, are you... What's... Um...

244
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,990
What... Are you BAFTA tonight?
Are you... First time?

245
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,551
-Well, yeah, as part of the Holby team.
-Good luck with the...

246
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,995
-Um...
-Yeah, thanks, thanks.

247
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,954
-And good luck to you as well.
-Absolutely.

248
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,239
-Yeah, it's a pity. No, we should ask...
-Yeah. I'll see you later.

249
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,392
-Okay. Good luck with the...
-Thanks.

250
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,799
-Good to...
-Good luck.

251
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,711
See you later. Cheers.

252
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,551
-Who was that?
-The most boring woman in the world.

253
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,755
-Really?
-Yeah.

254
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,558
-How do you know her?
-I went out with her for a while

255
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,153
when I was an extra on Holby City.

256
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,754
-Oh, and then she dumped you?
-No. I dumped her.

257
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,592
-You dumped her?
-Yes.

258
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,079
-Really?
-Yes, it does happen.

259
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,037
-When was this?
-Couple of years ago.

260
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,429
Was that before or after
you lost your virginity

261
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,592
-to the one who looked like Ronnie Corbett?
-After, obviously, it was two years ago.

262
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,274
What, so you lost your virginity
a long time ago then, did you?

263
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,793
Yes. I'm in my forties.

264
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,359
-I know, but when?
-A long time ago.

265
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,078
Exactly. What age were you?

266
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,311
-Oh, I don't know.
-What? 16? 17?

267
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,879
-Were you older than that?
-Oh, what is all these questions?

268
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,110
I lost my virginity. Full stop.

269
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,192
-Why were you attracted to Ronnie Corbett?
-I wasn't attracted to Ronnie Corbett.

270
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,396
She just happened to look like
Ronnie Corbett.

271
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,438
It was the bank's Christmas do.
I was drunk, all right?

272
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,636
-Oh, the bank's Christmas do?
-Yeah.

273
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,950
But you didn't start working there
till you were 28.

274
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,271
Oh, who are you? Columbo? Leave it.

275
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,834
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage, Davina McCall.

276
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,194
Good evening and welcome to
the British Academy Television Awards,

277
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,159
and in front of me are a whole host
of understandably anxious stars,

278
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,631
all wondering whether they're going to walk
away with that most coveted of awards,

279
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,756
the BAFTA mask.

280
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,753
Now to our first category this evening,
it is the Lew Grade...

281
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,038
WOMAN: I also want to thank
our inspiring and bossy boss...

282
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,954
ROB BRYDON: And the BAFTA goes to...
Oh, my favourite, Jamie's Prison Dinners.

283
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,998
MAN: Thanks to a terrific production team.
You weren't a production team,

284
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,672
you were family and thanks for everything...

285
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,311
SIR DAVID FROST: Unlike newspapers,
our TV newsrooms have to remain impartial,

286
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,391
at least theoretically...

287
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,508
MAN: The winner is,
The Woman Who Gave Birth To Herself.

288
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,197
DAVID DIMBLEBY: But right in my eye line,
on all fours like a dog...

289
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,432
MAN: The BAFTA goes to
South Bank Show:. Dick and Dom Special.

290
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,430
-Well, hello.
-All right?

291
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,714
Everything all right here?

292
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,997
We could do with
some more wine, please, waiter.

293
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,839
-Comedy gold. Absolute comedy gold.
-Thank you.

294
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,595
I love it.
No, actually here in an official capacity.

295
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,150
-Oh, yeah?
-Part of the Best Drama nomination

296
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,312
for Paul Abbott's Cock of the North.

297
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,630
-I imagine you saw it.
-I didn't.

298
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,757
I had quite a large part. It was...
It was good, you know.

299
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,389
Best Drama.
The Holy Grail, as it were, of BAFTAs.

300
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,677
But you're, of course,
you're here with your sitcom, aren't you?

301
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,069
-Yep.
-Yeah, well. Good luck.

302
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
-Yeah, and you, mate.
-Well, you deserve, you know...

303
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,392
-I understand it's very popular.
-Yeah.

304
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,358
-Yeah. Good luck, mate.
-Yes, well, I'll...

305
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,839
-Better get back.
-See you later.

306
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,878
-Drama crowd, as it were.
-Yeah.

307
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,078
-But... Yeah. Catch you later.
-Cheers, mate. Yeah.

308
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,436
MAN: We are on air live
in 45 seconds and counting.

309
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,396
Many of you at home and in this room
probably don't recognise Len Shearman,

310
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,914
but you'd certainly recognise his work.

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,675
Len was one of the most influential
and passionate drama producers

312
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,432
in the history of television.

313
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,229
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-And in an industry famous for back-biting

314
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,869
and bitchiness, he was
a gentleman of unquestionable integrity.

315
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,758
Sorry. Hello, all right?

316
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,272
Oh, for...

317
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,829
-Sorry I'm a bit late, l...
-Shut up.

318
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,433
Richard Briers.

319
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,197
I... I was a bit late because I was just
waiting for this, which is the prototype of...

320
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,556
-It's the prototype of the Ray doll.
-I don't care.

321
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,480
-There he is.
-Oh, who's gonna buy that?

322
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,552
-Like I said before, stupid people.
-Yeah. Who are these stupid people?

323
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,073
That is brilliant. Can you buy them?

324
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,912
It's good, isn't it?
You will be able to buy them.

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,752
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

326
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,398
Turn it off! What are you doing?

327
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,755
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

328
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,112
I was with Len only a few days
before the end...

329
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,270
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

330
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,588
...and he didn't have long.

331
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,999
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

332
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,798
Just turn it off.
Take the batteries out or something.

333
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,233
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

334
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,038
Have you got one of those
very tiny screwdrivers?

335
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,189
-Are you having a laugh?
-His wife...

336
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,113
-Is he having a laugh?
-He leaves his loving wife...

337
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,316
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

338
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,674
Take the batteries out.

339
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,990
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

340
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,318
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

341
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,717
Is he having a laugh?

342
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,158
Are you having a laugh?
Is he having a laugh?

343
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,273
Tacky shit!

344
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,160
-Oh, dear. I think it's broken.
-Yeah. I think you're right.

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,752
Pull my trousers up.

346
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,316
-Oh, hello. Andy's friend, Maggie.
-Yes, hi. Yeah.

347
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,429
He didn't introduce us,
so, hello, pleased to meet you.

348
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,033
Hi.

349
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,833
-God, you two used to go out?
-Oh, for about 10 minutes.

350
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,990
Why did he let you go?
Look at you, all lovely.

351
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,799
-Oh, thanks.
-Bit of a catch for him.

352
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,235
A man that didn't lose his virginity
till he was 28

353
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,108
and that was to a woman
who looked like Ronnie Corbett, so...

354
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,072
God, what did you say to him when he said
he couldn't go out with you any more

355
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,628
because he thought you were boring?

356
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,750
He... He said it was because I was boring?

357
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,635
Hmm?

358
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,796
He told me it was because he'd just come
out of a long-term relationship

359
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,314
and he wasn't ready for something else.

360
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,994
(STAMMERING) Not boring, not boring.
He didn't say that you were boring.

361
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,834
He said... I think he said that
the BAFTA thing, the kind of, the ceremony,

362
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,835
doing all the clapping was probably
gonna be boring because, um...

363
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,071
Coming up, we have
the prestigious BAFTA Fellowship,

364
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,550
but first, the award for Comedy Performance.

365
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,837
So please, will you all welcome Harry Hill?

366
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,311
Commiserations again, Andy.

367
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,994
I knew I wouldn't win. I'm not in it
for the awards anyway. Well done.

368
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,197
Still, it's nice to have some
recognition from one's peers, isn't it?

369
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,952
Listen, it's not really my business,

370
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,032
but have you considered doing something
without a laughter track?

371
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,872
I think they're considered rather
old-fashioned these days.

372
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,394
You know, if you want to pick up
one of these old gongs.

373
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,789
Not bothered.
As I say, not in it for the awards.

374
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,836
Also, I don't know, wigs and silly glasses,

375
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,797
bit undignified for men of our age,
don't you think?

376
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,791
I don't think we're the same age, but cheers.

377
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,589
-Looks a bit desperate is all I'm saying.
-I don't feel desperate.

378
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,911
As I say, it's a knock-about comedy.
I'm not into high-art, so...

379
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,195
Ah, yes, but as Oscar Wilde
so wonderfully put it,

380
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,592
"We are all in the gutter,
but some of us are looking at the stars."'

381
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,114
He was probably looking up men's trousers,
the old poof.

382
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,349
Sorry?

383
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,436
-He was looking up at the stars, yeah.
-Yes. That's right.

384
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,590
I'm off to look at some stars myself
right now.

385
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,716
-You'll be seeing stars in a minute.
-What?

386
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,997
Nothing. Why do you keep coming back in?

387
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,112
-Andy.
-What are you doing?

388
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,553
Come in here. It's all kicking off in here.

389
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,313
-I'm not coming in there.
-Come in here.

390
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,153
-What are you doing? What?
-Just come in.

391
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,233
(SNORTING)

392
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,835
-Who's that?
-Oh, hi!

393
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,031
-How are you doing? All right?
-Yeah.

394
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,633
He's one of us. Don't worry.

395
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,790
-I'm not into this.
-No, it's all right. Just have a little bit.

396
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,314
-It'll just cheer you up a bit.
-No, no, no.

397
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,391
What's going on in there?

398
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,196
I'm just finishing up.
Excuse me for five minutes.

399
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,077
Why are you doing a woman's voice?

400
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,879
-How many people are in there?
-One.

401
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,072
That's a different voice.

402
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,037
Two, including the woman
that you just heard.

403
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,599
Open the door.

404
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,908
Right, let me explain, okay?

405
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,436
I was just in here, and I was leaving,
and he put his... That's my agent.

406
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,476
Darren Lamb, nice to meet you.

407
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,073
You shouldn't say your name.
Never tell them your name.

408
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,673
Well, don't...

409
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,799
Well, he knows who...

410
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,197
-It was your fault.
-Why was it my fault?

411
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,352
Well, because they saw your head over
the cubicle door.

412
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,192
They saw your head under the cubicle door,

413
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,192
but there's no point
in arguing amongst ourselves, we're...

414
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,235
Well, well, well, the Three Stooges.

415
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,753
-Sorry. Is something funny?
-Your joke was excellent.

416
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,068
Shut up.

417
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,671
Corbett. It's always bloody Corbett.

418
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,871
You see, I expect it of him.

419
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,598
But you, you're the new kid on the block,
aren't you?

420
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,478
I mean, how'd you fall in with his crowd?

421
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,629
Is this it or is there any more?

422
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,630
Just a bit of whizz, you know,
to blow away the cobwebs.

423
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,870
Hand it over, then. Come on.

424
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,435
-And where did you get it?
-I don't remember.

425
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,592
Now, don't piss me about.
Where did you get it?

426
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,558
I don't remember.

427
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,837
Was it Moira Stuart?

428
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,559
I can't say.

429
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,957
Look, we don't want you.
Just give us a name, you can walk free.

430
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,474
You don't get it, mate, do you?
I don't remember.

431
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,835
All right,
here's something you will remember.

432
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,117
You're banned from BAFTA.
You can never win a BAFTA now.

433
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,553
-What? Me as well?
-Yeah, all of you.

434
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,755
Oh.

435
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,717
You can never attend
any of our varied events.

436
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,429
You can't come to the film BAFTAs,
you can't come to the TV BAFTAs,

437
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,670
and you can't even come
to the Children's BAFTAs.

438
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,591
What about the Welsh BAFTAs?

439
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,035
Well, would you attend the Welsh BAFTAs
if you were asked?

440
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,510
-Probably.
-Okay, expect a call.

441
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,909
-He'll come to the Welsh BAFTAs if you want.
-Yeah.

442
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,912
Yeah, we're after, you know,
more respected comedians.

443
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,434
-Makes sense.
-Get out of my sight.

444
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,191
-That's all of you, yeah.
-Makes sense?

445
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,034
-I reckon I could have had him in a fight.
-Yeah. You idiot!

446
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,233
And the winner is Holby City.

447
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,394
Thank you all very, very much indeed.

448
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,236
-I'd like to thank...
-Is that the girl you lost your virginity to?

449
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,312
-Who?
-The one that looks like Ronnie Corbett.

450
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,711
That is Ronnie Corbett.

451
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,954
-Why would she be wearing a tuxedo?
-She might be a lesbian.

452
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,952
And why would I lose my virginity
to a lesbian?

453
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,429
I don't know. She might have turned
lesbian after you slept with her.

454
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,308
...we all say thank you for that.
On a personal note, thank you to my partner.

455
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,674
Once again, thank you...

456
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,832
Well, I can never win a BAFTA
as long as I live.

457
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,478
-Why?
-I don't want to go into it.

458
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,994
This is a shitty night.
Can't get any worse, though.

459
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,278
I'd just like to say to Andy Millman, right,

460
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,192
I may be boring,

461
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,674
but at least I didn't lose my virginity
when I was 28

462
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,273
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

463
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,511
to a woman who looks like
Ronnie fucking Corbett.

464
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,269
Prick!

465
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,592
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

466
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,518
No explanations needed. What's up next?

467
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,149
Huw Wheldon Award
for Specialist Factual, brilliant.

468
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,788
-Oh, can we get a cab?
-No. We'll walk.

469
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,030
I'm joking.
If we sell the dress, we can get a limo.

470
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,237
-Sorry, can I get your autograph, please?
-Sure.

471
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,873
-What's your name?
-It's Paul.

472
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,279
(THUDDING)

473
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,072
