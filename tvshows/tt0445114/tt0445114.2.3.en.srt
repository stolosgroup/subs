There's a story here
about the Brazilian rowing team.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,070
They were practising on Amazon, and
it's full of piranha fish, and they capsized.

Says in paper they were in danger
of having their cocks eaten.

12

Why would piranhas go for the cocks first?

at back of boat shouting "stroke".

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,671
If I were a piranha,
I'd draw the line at eating cocks.

Oh, you don't get it, do you?

It's second-hand. 1,500 quid.

65

That's an insult. I would rather smash it up

66

so this could be a good in.

I said, "Will he still get paid

71

"even if his performance is crap?"
They said yes. So it's a win-win for us.

You didn't ask them that?

I was worried that if you got the gig

they might fire you.

-Oh, they've seen the show?

and they watch television. They're... Yeah.

I don't need these.

149
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,238
They're just for the character.

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,029
Even if I did need glasses in real life,
you know, I never read.

151
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,194
Right.

152
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,155
Oh!

153
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,551
-Hey?
-What?

154
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,795
-Fags.
-Yeah.

155
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,755
-You smoke, do you?
-Me? Oh, yeah, just a little bit, yeah.

156
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,438
-You?
-No.

157
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,877
No, no, no, good girl, good girl, very wise.
I've gotta cut down, really.

158
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,759
-I've done it with a girl.
-What?

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,076
I've done it with a girl. Intercourse-wise.

160
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,111
-So if you're looking for...
-WOMAN: Daniel?

161
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,509
Here's my mum. Say they're your fags.

162
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,756
-What you doing?
-Nothing.

163
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,115
-She's trying to give me fags.
-What? No, I'm not!

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,316
You should know better,
you're old enough to be his mother.

165
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,356
Yeah, and she was trying
to have it off with me.

166
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,035
Oh, well, of course she was,
you're bloody gorgeous. Come on, you.

167
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,917
-Makes me sick.
-What?

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,391
These showbiz dwarves who use their
powers to get women out of their league.

169
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,391
-Who, Warwick?
-No, Paul Daniels.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,390
Here, if she's into short men,
you could be in with a chance.

171
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,799
-I'm not short.
-Yeah, you are.

172
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,030
No, I'm not. No, no, 5' 8", average height.

173
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,519
Well, average in your day.

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,989
-My day? Born in the '60s.
-Early '60s.

175
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,638
-Quite early.
-1960?

176
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,676
-No.
-1961?

177
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,715
-That'll be why you didn't grow.
-I did grow.

178
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,758
With all the powdered egg
and the rationing and everything.

179
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,115
-That was the war.
-Yeah, well, whatever.

180
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,112
Do you know what?
You've got small man complex.

181
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,315
What's that?

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,552
You're bad-tempered, grumpy,
you want power and people to respect you.

183
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,349
Oh, like that little famous person.
What's his name?

184
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,237
-Begins with an "N".
-Napoleon.

185
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,197
Noel Edmonds.

186
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,794
I'm not short. I'm average height and that's...

187
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,996
I can see how it is upsetting for you
'cause there's him...

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,149
It's not upsetting.

189
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,310
-He's even smaller than you are...
-'Cause I'm not small.

190
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,960
He is getting all these
attractive and beautiful women and...

191
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,632
-We all are.
-But you're getting nothing.

192
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,597
Well, no way. I'm getting them.

193
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,194
Well, there was the one
that looked like Ronnie Corbett.

194
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,236
-And we know why you went for her.
-Why?

195
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,359
-Because she could look you in the eye.
-It's not a competition.

196
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,352
It's not like she saw us both
and went, "Oh, I'll have the short one."'

197
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,759
-Is that you or him?
-Him!

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,319
See? There's the temper.

199
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,710
I'm saying,
if she'd met us both at the same time,

200
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,314
we don't know who she'd have chosen.

201
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,393
-Well, I think I know who she'd have chosen.
-Who?

202
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,358
Huh? No, I'm not gonna say
because it'd sound arrogant.

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,955
I don't wanna...
But if she was single and she met us both...

204
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,439
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

205
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,431
-Tell me.
-Oh, for... Just think.

206
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,751
-I'm thinking.
-Your own thoughts. Stay out of mine.

207
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,350
-Really stodgy, innit?
-Honestly, I'm sick of this.

208
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,159
Can we go somewhere nice tonight?
My treat, but a proper restaurant.

209
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,468
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

210
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,152
All right, then.

211
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,512
-Hey, gang, what we doing?
-Just been eating.

212
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,751
Yeah, yeah, sweet.
Look, thanks for covering my arse earlier.

213
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,991
-The offer still stands.
-What offer?

214
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,359
You know.

215
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,557
I'm gonna go and get a drink.
Does anyone want anything?

216
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,756
-I'll have a cup of tea.
-Get me a bourbon, would you, babe?

217
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,432
I think it's mostly just teas
and coffees and things.

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,839
Then get me a cup of joe, would you?

219
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,434
And make it strong.
I don't like the weak shit. Oh!

220
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,713
Look, when she comes back, make
some excuse and leave us alone, will you?

221
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,312
What you got planned?

222
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,275
-You... You've unravelled it?
-Ready for action.

223
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,751
Let's just hope it's big enough.

224
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,438
Um, can I have my johnny back?

225
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,836
"May" I have my johnny back?

226
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,514
-May I have my johnny back?
-"Please."'

227
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,113
Yeah.

228
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,270
It's not called a johnny, though, is it?

229
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,794
-Durex?
-No, that's a brand name.

230
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,439
"May I have back
my prophylactic or sheath?"

231
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,513
-May I have my prophylac...
-"Tic".

232
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,591
Tic. Prophylactic.

233
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,831
-Can I have it, please?
-Yes.

234
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,718
Excuse me.
Haven't you forgotten something?

235
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,556
Oh, thank you, Dame Diana.

-Yeah, that'll be fine.

-It's really nice of me?
-Yeah.

242
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,039
Well, me and my friend Andy,
Andy Millman, were talking,

243
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,598
and he was surprised that you'd chosen
someone like Warwick over...

244
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,794
Well, someone like him, who's...
Do you only like small people?

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,956
I don't like him because he's small.
I like him 'cause he has a nice personality.

246
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,234
Oh, well, that's good then,

247
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,313
because Andy was just saying that if you
didn't mind someone who's a little bit taller,

248
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,118
then he's up for it.

249
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,999
Sorry, so your friend is so arrogant,
he thinks he just has to give the word

250
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,198
and I would immediately leave
my fiancי for him because he's taller?

251
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,918
Do you understand how offensive that is?

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,152
-Yeah, it's a bit out of order, isn't it?
-It is out of order.

253
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,913
He shouldn't really have said that,
should he?

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,036
No, he shouldn't have said that.

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,750
Hello, Andy, how's it going, mate?
Paul, mate.

297
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,671
I was just passing,
want to clear up all this nonsense

298
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,432
about you having a go
at Down's syndrome people.

299
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,158
-About what?
-We've had this woman come to us,

300
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,390
saying that you were having a go at her kid
who's Down's and that.

301
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,595
-Are you a journalist?
-Huh?

302
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,636
-Are you a journalist?
-Sort of, yeah, just freelance.

303
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,075
Just trying to turn this round,
get the truth out there for you.

304
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,310
So what happened?
The Down's syndrome's making a racket,

305
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,753
you tell him to shut up,
his mum's up in arms.

306
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,558
I didn't tell anyone to shut up.

307
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,234
It's political correctness gone mad.
You can't say what you think any more.

308
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,436
-Well, no...
-Is that yes? Yeah...

309
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,112
I didn't know he was Down's syndrome.

310
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,474
You're in a restaurant with your girlfriend...

311
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,312
-She's not my girlfriend.
-She's a girl who's your friend.

312
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,992
-Yeah.
-I'll put girlfriend for the sake of ease.

313
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,071
-She's not my girlfriend.
-For sake of shorthand.

314
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,559
She's not my girlfriend.

315
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,517
You're in there, you heard a noise
and it was driving you mad?

316
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,113
You can't say "mad" nowadays, can you?

317
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,112
-He was making a noise and I got a little...
-Mad? You got mad?

318
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,236
-The mad kid was driving you mad?
-I wouldn't say that.

319
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,117
Can't say he's mad nowadays, can you?
Or mental?

320
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,349
I wouldn't say he was...

321
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,271
Can you make it clear
I didn't know he was Down's syndrome?

322
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,749
-I will, I will.
-Write that down.

323
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,035
-Are you actually writing anything?
-Yeah, yeah.

324
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,429
So, you complained,
the mum came over, she went nuts?

325
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,317
-She was agitated...
-So she went mad?

326
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,197
So you could say she was
going madder than her son?

327
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,157
-I wouldn't say that, no.
-Would you say she was going mental?

328
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,673
-No, I wouldn't...
-So you might say mental?

329
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,398
-No, I wouldn't...
-Can't say anything nowadays, can you?

330
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,277
-I wouldn't...
-lf you wanna say "mental", you can't.

331
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,399
-I've got to go. See you later.
-Cheers, mate. Cheers, got everything I need.

332
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,677
"In a shocking outburst
that will stun comedy fans everywhere,

333
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,752
"so-called TV funny man
Andy Millman lost his temper

334
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,628

"at a £100-a-head restaurant."'

336
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,754
£100 a head?

337
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,478
Well, it was about 80 quid between us,
but go on.

338
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,994
200 quid for a meal for two people!
How the other half live.

339
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,354
Sorry, that makes me sick.

340
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,670
"Millman had been glugging red wine
with his girlfriend."'

341
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,318
-Oh, pissed.
-No, I'd had one drink.

342
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,038
-Did you glug it, though?
-Did I what?

343
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,192
-It says here you glugged it.
-I don't know what glugging is.

344
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,633
(GLUGGING)

345
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,075
Never glug. Always sip a lovely wine.
Never glug it.

346
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,550
Can we stop saying "glug"?
And I wasn't even drinking red wine.

347
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,517
Maggie was drinking red wine, I had a beer.

348
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,750
"Millman had been glugging red wine

351
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,157
-I didn't say that.
-Well, someone did.

352
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,800
"Says mum Maureen Wilson,
'l used to be a fan of Andy's,

"'if he thinks I'll ever watch
his programme again, he's having a laugh.""

355
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,592
She's used the old catchphrase against you.
Stitched you up there, it's witty.

356
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,079
Yeah, as if she ever said that.

357
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,438
As if she's making little jokes
if she's that angry. She didn't say that.

358
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,595
Sorry, what can we do about this?
Can we sue?

359
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,669
I don't think it's worth it.

360
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,990
This sort of thing
is tomorrow's fish and chip paper, isn't it?

361
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,877
He's not having fish and chips any more.
200 quid for a meal!

362
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,996
-You'd have trouble doing that a chippie.
-You would.

363
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,719
-I didn't spend 200 quid.
-It says 230 in this one.

364
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,028
-Lies.
-No, it does.

365
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,315
No, I don't mean you're lying,
I mean they're lying.

366
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,597
-They make stuff up, don't they?
-I don't know about that.

367
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,911
You've never heard of a paper
making stuff up?

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,309
Of course they do.
They made stuff up about you two.

369
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,029
When they said you went into the
East Enders bosses to beg for his job back

370
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,475
and you were on your knees
and then you burst into tears.

371
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,596
They made that up.

372
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,510
-Yep.
-Didn't they?

373
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,749
Yeah.

374
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,113
Bullshit.

375
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,513
I guess only time will tell. Anything else?

376
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,319
Let's move to this story
about the actor Andy Millman.

377
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,435
Who's he?

378
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,750
He's that guy, you know,
he does the "Is he having a laugh?"

379
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,558
Yeah, I'm with you. Go on.

380
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,996
Well, he's in a restaurant
and he's insulted a Down's syndrome boy.

381
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,198
Both mother and son are completely
devastated as it was an unprovoked attack.

382
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,794
-Did he hit him?
-Well, it doesn't say.

383
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,714
If he did strike the boy, then he deserves
to be banned from television.

384
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,552
(APPLAUSE)

385
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,953
So have you heard about this?

386
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,113
TV actor Andy Millman
has hit a Down's syndrome child.

387
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,317
Today we're asking,
are celebrities out of control?

388
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,836
Is it one rule for us
and another for the rich and famous?

389
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,669
Tony's on the line.
What do you make of this Millman character?

390
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,036
What can you say, Nick?
It's disgusting. It's absolutely disgusting.

391
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,236
I mean, excuse my French,
but I think he's a shit.

392
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,312
No, you're excused in this case
because I think you're right.

393
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,039
You know I don't normally tolerate
foul language on the air,

394
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,951
but what else can you say
about this piece of work?

395
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,715
Well, the thing is, I heard he also
hit the mother. Punched her in the face.

396
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,633
He punched the mother? Oh, my God!

397
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,473
Tony, thank you, that gives
a whole fresh new life to the story.

398
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,600
Coming up today,
what made rising star Andy Millman

399
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,830
punch a defenceless Down's syndrome child

400
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,992
and his elderly,
wheelchair-bound mother in the face?

401
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,150
Denise Robertson will be here to speculate.

402
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,958
Plus, Rwanda revisited.

403
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,952
Twelve years after the genocide,
a harrowing report

404
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,474
from Big Brother 2 winner, Brian Dowling.

405
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,158
Andy, quick, come here,
come here, look, look!

406
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,632
Oh! What the...

407
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,792
Thank you so much for having me on.
It's great to be able to clear the air.

408
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,916
I know there's been
a lot of press speculation and so on.

409
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,150
-What's he doing?
-Well, I spoke to Andy,

410
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,840
and he's explained everything to me,
and the truth is this.

411
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,754
He is successful now, and he wanted to go
to a classy restaurant, you know,

412
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,559
-as I'm sure you sometimes want to.
-Sure.

413
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,154
As he said to me, you know,
he's got some cash now,

414
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,516
he does not want to have to associate
with riff-raff, and why should he?

415
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,716
So, he's gone in this posh restaurant
with his friend

416
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,315
and there is a mother in there with her kid,
and her kid's making a load of noise,

417
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,153
load of racket and it's just ruining it
for everyone, you know.

418
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,438
And he's obviously furious, Andy, because
he's paying through the nose for this grub.

419
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,671
I mean, it's silly money.
And so he complains to the mother,

420
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,832
and they get into this ruck,
and the thing is he didn't realise

421
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,471
that the kid was, you know,
mentally deranged, or whatever,

422
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,152
because he could only see him from behind.

423
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,471
And I defy anyone to be able to identify,
from behind,

424
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,074
you know, one of these mongoloids.

425
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,832
I'm sorry, a mongoloid?

426
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,673
No, I mean, if you had a bunch
of people lined up over there, you know,

427
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,116
and one of them was a mongoloid
and they had their backs to you,

428
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,395
I defy anyone
to be able to tell which one it was.

429
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,629
I think I could.

430
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,597
Big words, Richard,
but I don't think you could.

431
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,989
No, I'm sorry, I think I could.

432
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,992
Can we try and sort that out
for tomorrow, you know, just get a few in?

433
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,036
I don't think we can do that, Richard.

434
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,838
Oh, come on, Judy, let's see.
It'll be interesting.

435
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,353
It would be interesting.

436
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,078
Darren, thank you very much.

437
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,311
Thank you. Oh, but before I go,
do you remember Barry off East Enders?

438
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,628
-Yes.
-Do you remember Barry?

439
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,475
Well, he's recorded a CD, did it in his garage.
And it's only available on the internet.

440
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,312
It's Barry singing songs from the shows.

441
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,436
-He's got a lovely voice, Richard, really.
-Yeah, yeah.

442
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,909
-The great thing about it is...
-Good, well, that's sorted that out.

443
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,560
-At least I've got my best man on it.
-I said to him, you know,

444
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,791
you say something's for charity,
doesn't matter if it's a load of old tat,

445
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,030
it'll go straight to the top of the charts
and then...

446
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,078
Yeah, can I have
The Sun newspaper, please?

447
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,594
ANDY: Um... Okay, thanks, thanks, everyone.

448
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,672
Now, Dougie, I asked your mum

449
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,672
what's the one thing you'd most like
in the whole world,

450
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,877
-and she said an X-Box. Is that right?
-Yes.

451
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,235
Okay, so what have we got here, then?

452
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,709
Yes! Thank you.

453
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,352
Do you apologise then, Andy?

454
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,034
It wasn't a case of an apology.
It was a misunderstanding,

455
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,032
-so no apology necessary.
-The X-Box is apology enough.

456
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,111
It's not an apology, but, you know...

457
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,077
-And you're happy with that, then?
-I am, thank you.

458
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,559
Very happy.

459
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,279
-And can I just say, as a further apology...
-It's not an apology.

460
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,999
I've been talking to Maureen
and we both agree it would be appropriate

461
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,834
for Andy to donate to a charity
of Maureen's choosing his entire fee

462
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,912
for the film that he's currently
working on, after agency deductions.

463
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,992
JOURNALIST: Well, that's very generous.
It's a lovely surprise.

464
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,514
It is a surprise, big surprise.

465
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,149
-Hi.
-Oh, hiya.

466
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,355
Hi.

467
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,799
Well, you know who I am, what's your name?

468
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,235
-Erm, my name's Claire.
-Claire.

469
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,911
You've got a lovely necklace on, Claire.

470
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,150
Thank you, that's very nice, thanks.

471
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,549
Would you... Do you fancy dinner?
Are you free tonight?

472
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,878
I'm not, actually, no. No, I'm engaged.

473
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,313
Well, um, tomorrow?

474
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,439
No, thank you, no, I won't.
I won't go out for any meal with you. Yeah.

475
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,792
-Not even brunch?
-No, not even brunch.

476
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,119
Hey, Maggie, listen.
I'm gonna cut to the chase

477
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,953
because I respect you too much
to bullshit you.

478
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,231
-It's over, yeah?
-Sorry?

479
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,073
It's over between us. I don't want tears.
That's the kind of guy I am.

480
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,309
You knew that going in.

481
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,393
I just think it's better we end things now
before you fall in love with me any deeper.

482
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,677
You knew it wasn't forever,
I said it was playtime, we had some laughs,

483
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,149
but I cannot be tied down to one chick.

484
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,749
Okay.

485
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,309
And I don't wanna waste this on you.
Got a better bird now.

486
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,075
Well, thanks for your honesty.

487
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,039
(CLEARS THROAT)

488
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,714
-Something to remember me by.
-You brushed your teeth today?

489
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,153
-Yes!
-Yes, that was...

490
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,356
-WARWICK: Oi, Radcliffe.
-What?

491
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,351
-What have you been up to?
-Nothing.

492
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,715
Don't lie.
You've been chatting up my fiancיe.

493
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,712
-She's just told me.
-Mum.

494
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,995
Don't call for your mum.
You were chatting up my bird,

495
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,036
so act like a man
and deal with the consequences.

496
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,395
-I was just...
-I was just... Na-na-na-na!

497
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,595
You speccy little git.

498
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,716
-These aren't real glasses.
-You're a speccy git.

499
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,030
-Leave him alone. He's just a boy.
-I'm 17.

500
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,078
-And what's this gotta do with you?
-He's doing nothing, is he?

501
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,912
Oh, don't stick your big nose in, love.

502
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,797
-All right, calm down.
-Oh, you!

503
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,916
I'm glad you're here
'cause you had the same idea.

504
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,035
What?

505
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,317
I know you sent your little mate
in here to do your dirty work for you,

506
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,799
trying to undermine me.

507
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,279
-What have you done?
-Nothing.

508
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,590
-What have you done?
-You think it's okay, do you?

509
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,113
Trying to steal my fiancיe?

510
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,997
-I don't know what you...
-You shit!

511
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,832
What are you doing? What are you doing?

512
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,798
-What do you think I've got this ring for?
-I don't know, you're a hobbit?

513
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,995
You fat shit!

514
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,913
Look, I don't know what the rules are
for fighting a midg... Try that one.

515
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,355
That usually works in cartoons.
What are you doing?

516
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,034
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.

517
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,998
Accidental knee.

518
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,355
-CLAIRE: Oi, what are you doing?
-Lucky shot.

519
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,556
-What have you done?
-He was going mad at me. The face...

520
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,995
Babe, babe, babe.
Sweetheart, Warwick, Warwick.

521
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,559
-Is he not...
-Sweetheart, Warwick.

522
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
-He's breathing. Oh, it's all right.
-I can see he's breathing.

523
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,954
Warwick? You all right?
Sweetheart, sweetheart.

524
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,792
Have you still got that cat suit
from The Avengers?

525
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,074
CLAIRE: What happened?

526
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,388
Go away, Daniel.

527
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,870
ANDY: His eyes are open.
Right, okay, let's move on now, come on.

528
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,157
Remember that charity that you promised
to give half of your film fee to?

529
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,231
You mean the charity you promised
to give half my film fee to?

530
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,435
That we agreed to give some money to.

531
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,909
Well, they're basically quite keen
to get hold of the cash...

532
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,355
Well, I was kicked off the film.
There is no fee.

533
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,431
But they're expecting the money.
We've got to give it to them.

534
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,272
They don't know what the fee was
for the film, do they?

535
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,238
They do. They do,
'cause I mentioned it to them.

536
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,031
I've got to give them wages
I haven't even earned?

537
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,998
It's okay, we can pay the money we owe
from the money we get for the sitcom.

538
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,832
-How much is it?
-It's about half.

539
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,275
-Half an episode?
-Well, half the whole series.

540
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,157
I've got to give them half my wages
for the entire series?

541
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,992
You're the one who insulted the kid with...

542
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,798
I didn't insult him, I didn't know he was...

543
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,997
You must have upset him in some way
'cause you made it into the papers.

544
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,911
Talking of the papers,
you've made quite a splash again,

545
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,595
but annoyingly, they didn't sort of go
with the giving the kid an X-Box angle.

546
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,193
What did they go with?

547
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,840
"TV Bully Kicks Dwarf In Face."'

548
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,992
Accurate. But as you say,
there's no such thing as bad publicity.

549
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,913
-"Pick On Someone Your Own Size, Fatty."'
-Oh, maybe there is.

550
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,718
This is the worst one.

551
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,519
"Suicide Bombers Get Lotto Funding."'
Look at that.

552
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,549
-What's that got to do with me?
-Well, nothing, it's just shocking, isn't it?

553
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,950
What they're up to.
Oh, no, actually, what am I talking about?

554
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,158
This is the worst one in The Mail.
"Gypsies Are Eating Our Pets."'

555
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,629
Ooh.

556
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,079
(STAMMERING)
Yeah, I know, it's number three.

557
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,629
Damn!
