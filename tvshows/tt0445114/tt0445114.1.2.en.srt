1
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,703
Horatio.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,940
Emma. What are you doing here?

3
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,670
I couldn't bear to let you go
without saying goodbye.

4
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:17,106
You shouldn't have come, Emma.
People will talk.

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:21,151
Let them talk.
I'm tired of hiding our love away.

6
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:24,109
- I'm not ashamed of how I feel.
- Neither am I.

7
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,308
But we both know we shouldn't be together.

8
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:29,908
- Shouldn't? Who says we shouldn't?
- My conscience.

9
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:34,143
My conscience tells me
everything I feel for you is wrong.

10
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:38,345
But my heart, my heart says...

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,825
I can't live without you.

12
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,631
- Promise me you'll return.
- I promise.

13
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:47,468
Because if Napoleon doesn't kill me,

14
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,752
then being away from you surely will.

16
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,632
Cut! Yeah, brilliant, thank you.

17
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,314
- Could you see me?
- Yeah, definitely.

18
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:09,946
Excellent. We'll get out
before that fat little extra gets his face in.

19
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:13,946
Okay.

20
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:18,752
Rest the guys for 10 minutes.

21
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,750
That's correct. Yeah, great.

22
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,636
We're moving on to 37.

23
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:37,318
Hey. Who are we using
for the girl by the carriage?

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,232
We thought this one.

25
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:43,997
No, I said I needed some decent tits
and they're... rubbish.

26
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:49,835
Well, I could maybe pad them up a bit.
Or just sort of, like, push them...

27
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:52,118
- You could use these.
- Bingo.

28
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:55,320
Bingo these in half an hour
after I've had a wee fiddle with them.

29
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:58,839
- I just need to squeeze them.
- Well, work on them over lunch, yeah?

30
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:02,120
Because at the moment
they're just, urgh, nothing.

31
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:04,320
- Okay.
- Good.

32
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:06,235
Would it be easier just to use these?

33
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:10,841
We made a decision to use mine, so can we
just go with these? If I just squeeze them...

34
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,756
It would be less work.

35
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:16,395
You've got padding at the bottom of them.
Can I get some padding?

36
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,276
This cow's like,
she's like sticking her tits in his face

37
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:26,155
and I'm saying, "He said he wanted to use
my tits. Can we just go with my tits, please?"

38
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,203
I think Meryl Streep
went through a similar thing.

39
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:31,279
- I know it's not important but...
- It is important.

40
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:34,006
I remember Laurence Olivier
having a rant in Richard III

41
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,682
because they wanted to use
stunt testicles and he said,

42
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,965
"Listen, these gonads are going to be seen
because they went to RADA.

43
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:42,882
"You either use the Lord Olivier plums
or nothing at all."

44
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:44,322
Next.

45
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:47,162
Ahh... And what do you recommend,
my good man?

46
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,681
- Chicken's the warmest.
- Is it? I'll have that, then.

47
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,277
Chicken.

48
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,686
Your heart's not in this, is it?

49
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,365
Although one of your pubes is, I see.

50
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:09,562
- Straight in there like that, no messing.
- It's not a pube, it's a dog hair.

51
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:12,485
It's all right, it's not a pube,
it's a dog hair, everyone.

52
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:15,167
I thought it was a pube.
It's not, it's just a dog hair.

53
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:19,644
If you do get a hair in there, he just
gets it out with his big sausage fingers.

54
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,449
- I don't know why I do this.
- What?

55
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:28,322
All this. "Oh, we'll cut before
the fat bloke gets his face in shot."

56
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:31,929
It's just absolutely demeaning.
I don't know why I put myself through it.

57
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,244
- Because you're an actor.
- This isn't acting.

58
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:36,724
Getting the back of your head
or your arm in a shot.

59
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:40,012
And bloody Ross Kemp in every scene,
he gets all the lines.

60
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,451
Do you know what I mean?
Why is he the star and not me?

61
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:45,004
There but for the grace of God go I.
And it's just... What?

62
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:46,654
- It's not quite.
- Well, it is.

63
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:48,328
It's not just luck, is it?

64
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:51,170
- Why not? We're about the same age...
- No, he's younger than you.

65
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:53,407
- No, he's not. We're about the same age.
- Is he?

66
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:56,136
- Yeah.
- He looks a lot younger than you.

67
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:58,333
You're having a laugh.
He hasn't got any hair.

68
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:01,057
He's meant to look like that.
He's shaved it all off.

69
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,288
It's like cool, it's like Vin Diesel.

70
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,688
Vin Diesel?
Sorry, are we looking at the same bloke?

71
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,647
Have another look, right. Look at him there.
He looks more like Zippy from Rainbow.

72
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,058
Hello!

73
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:15,974
Bungle, what are you doing
in the Queen Vic, Bungle?

74
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:19,814
Phil, why did you sleep with my wife?
Look, look.

75
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,739
Vin Diesel hasn't got
a perfectly round little head

76
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,288
that opens and shuts like Pac-Man, look at it.

77
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,860
- He's got less chins than you as well.
- One chin, one chin each.

78
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:32,661
- Yeah, but yours is growing another one.
- Shut up.

79
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:35,210
In five years' time,
he's still going to look pretty rugged

80
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:40,502
- and you're just going to look like a pelican.
- A pelican? Good, nice one.

81
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,454
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

82
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,102
Well, obviously him.

83
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:48,300
- Husband material?
- Could be.

84
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:51,535
- What are you basing it on this time?
- Don't know but look at him.

85
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,457
He's all dashing and handsome in his green.

86
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:57,823
Why do men not dress like that nowadays?

87
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:00,339
Because they'd get beaten up on the Tube.

88
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:17,062
- All right?
- All right, Greg.

89
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:19,584
- Indeed I am.
- Good.

90
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:23,656
I'm actually working across the way,
Studio H, the big one.

91
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,626
Doing a film with Mr Vinnie Jones.

92
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,383
So, actually, just learning a few lines
I've got to do with him later.

93
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:32,619
- Lines?
- Yes, indeed.

94
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:34,342
Well done.

95
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:36,739
So what's your part in this epic, then?

96
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,821
The fourth seaman from the left or...

97
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,389
Hardly.

98
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,507
You got something a bit more...
Bit meatier, bit more substantial.

99
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,582
You got a speaking part or a... No?

100
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,865
Not in this one, no.

101
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,829
- Seriously, how do you survive?
- Don't worry about it, really.

102
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:53,550
- Digging into the savings?
- Not really.

103
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:56,510
The pile diminishes, does it?
Gotta get some work soon.

104
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:58,947
- Gotta get some work soon.
- Working all the time, mate.

105
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:00,863
- Don't worry about it.
- Sort of.

106
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:03,069
Are your parents still sending you money?

107
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:06,702
Well, yeah. Either that or I,
you know, threaten to sign on.

108
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:10,183
And lo! The cheque doth cometh in the post.

109
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:12,230
- It keeps the wolf from the door.
- Good.

110
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:14,986
How is the door of the house
your parents bought you, is that all right?

111
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,427
- Yes, it's fine.
- Good.

112
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:19,632
- Look, I've got lines to learn.
- Thanks for coming over and sharing that.

113
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:22,434
- Seriously, mate, something will crop up.
- Don't worry about it.

114
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,346
Don't worry about it, mate.
Worry about yourself.

115
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:25,629
- Stiff upper lip.
- Yes.

116
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:28,947
- And other clichיs too numerous to mention.
- Don't mention them then.

117
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:31,311
- See you later, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

118
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,227
Tosser. Not you.

119
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:03,113
Excuse me. Do you mind
if I go in front of you, please?

120
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,350
- What?
- Can I go before you?

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,194
- Why?
- I've got a little bit of a stomach upset.

122
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,680
Oh, okay.

123
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:16,277
- Hello.
- Hi.

124
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:19,354
I think she wants to go in front of you,
she's got diarrhoea.

125
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:23,159
Don't want it exploding everywhere. Messy.

126
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:26,595
Thank you.

127
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,041
Saw you looking.

128
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,355
Thought I'd better get it out of the way.

129
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,759
Yeah, it is me.

130
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:50,844
Hi, I'm Andy.

131
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,165
- How you doing?
- Oh!

132
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,884
- Sorry, did that hurt?
- No...

133
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:58,925
Good. I was worried I might have hurt you.
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

134
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:02,886
If I had meant to hurt you, you wouldn't
have any ribs left so you got off lightly.

135
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,401
- Let's leave it there.
- Okay.

136
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:10,042
You know, I love playing military parts.

137
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,563
Well, as you know, I was in the SAS.

138
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,325
No. I knew you did that TV show
about the SAS.

139
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:21,159
Yeah, but how did I know
how to do all that shit in it?

140
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,001
I assumed you had consultants and stuff.

141
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,809
If that's what you believe,
then that's what you believe.

142
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:29,802
All right, I wasn't in the SAS
for six months and they didn't say,

143
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,121
"Ross, why don't you give up
this acting lark?

144
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,088
"We could really do with you
in Afghanistan."

145
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:36,809
- Did they?
- Couldn't say.

146
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,202
All I know is, if I do get into a fight,
I'd better have an escape route

147
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,603
because I don't want to go to prison
for murder, because that's what it would be.

148
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,365
Because my body is a lethal weapon.

149
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:50,002
And me in prison, face like this.

150
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:52,572
Pretty boy.

151
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,893
I'd be in the shower just lathering up,

152
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:58,966
a couple of guys would come in
wanting a bit of Kemp arse.

153
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:01,045
I'd see them in the mirror and...

154
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:07,729
What I'm saying is,
you'd best not get into a fight with me.

155
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:09,728
Sure.

156
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,487
Or a conversation.

157
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:24,334
What do you do when you're not doing this?
What's your day job?

158
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,408
I work in a pub.

159
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,694
- What about you?
- I do this full time. I'm an actor.

160
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,132
- You do this full time?
- Yeah, yeah.

161
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:33,970
Like most actors, I act full time.

162
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:37,414
Yeah, but this isn't really acting, is it?
I mean, this is extra work.

163
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:40,171
Well, no, supporting artist work, innit?

164
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:43,410
But it's just, this is just pocket money.
I am actually an actor.

165
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,970
Right. I was gonna say 'cause you can't
really make a living from being an extra.

166
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,208
No.

167
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,373
No, but he used to have a proper job.
He used to... He owns his own house.

168
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,533
Doesn't have to pay a mortgage
so he can afford to live on a pittance.

169
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:58,613
I don't live on a pittance, though, do I?
People pay me to act so...

170
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,009
- Yeah, you say you're an actor.
- Yeah, I do.

171
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,138
- But what have you actually acted in?
- I've appeared...

172
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:06,975
I mean proper acting, not walking in
the background. I mean, actually speaking.

173
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:09,655
- I know.
- Well?

174
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,740
- What, you want me to...
- Yeah.

175
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:13,858
Okay.

176
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,533
- My Family, the Robert Lindsay sitcom.
- Really?

177
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:20,695
Yeah, it was just a thing,
sort of a scene on the bus

178
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,614
and the bus conductor come along

179
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:25,741
and, "Tickets please," and I just went,
"Yeah, sure, no problem."

180
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,622
- Did you?
- Yes.

181
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,382
- That was the line?
- Yeah.

182
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:32,137
He comes along and goes, "Tickets please,"

183
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,896
and I go, "Yeah, no problem. Mate,
there you go."

184
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,545
So if I got that episode and watched it,
that's what I'd see you say,

185
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,741
- "Sure, no problem."
- Well, yeah.

186
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,861
"...there you go."

187
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:43,506
Well, I didn't... What was that?
What's the line?

188
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,702
- What's the problem?
- What is the line?

189
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,538
The conductor wants the ticket,
I'm showing him it.

190
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,379
And what do you say?

191
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,264
He asks for my ticket.

192
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:53,179
- Yeah.
- And I go...

193
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:57,341
I can't hear what you're saying.
No, let's do it like it is actually on the screen.

194
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:00,738
I'll be the bus driver, okay,
and you just be you, all right?

195
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,262
Tickets please, can I see your tickets please?

196
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,218
I can't hear anything.
No one can hear anything.

197
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:09,426
- It was years ago.
- But that's not proper acting.

198
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,704
- What is it, then?
- I can tell you what acting is.

199
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:14,987
- I can tell you what I've acted in...
- Not interested.

200
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,506
I've acted in, and I'm talking proper
speaking parts, in Emmerdale,

201
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,148
- Silent Witness.
- Silent Witness?

202
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,710
- Silent Witness.
- Shh!

203
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,540
I was a narc in The Bill,
that was a recurring character,

204
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:28,862
that was three episodes
and really good lines of dialogue.

205
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:31,102
You haven't even been in The Bill, have you?

206
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,706
- I don't want to be in The Bill.
- You haven't even been in The Bill?

207
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,510
Listen, I don't want to be in The Bill.

208
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:37,788
- Have you ever been in Casualty?
- Yeah.

209
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:41,582
- The TV show Casualty?
- Well, no, but... No.

210
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,392
Right, this is the deal.

211
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:04,195
You've been my agent
now for, what, five years?

212
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:07,632
And you're not getting me
any real acting work.

213
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:10,514
- Nothing's coming in.
- Nothing's coming in. In five years?

214
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,713
That's the problem.
I'm as annoyed as you are.

215
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:16,756
But I'm not sure there's a demand for,
you know, little 45-year-old blokes.

216
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,872
43.

217
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:21,189
Whatever. You know, I wonder,
are you sure you want to be an actor?

218
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,476
You've given it five years, nothing's come in.
Maybe it's time to just throw in the towel.

219
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:28,755
My agent, ladies and gentlemen. My agent.

220
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,956
- Look... Hello, mate, all right?
- Sorry to interrupt.

221
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,758
- That's all right. Do you know Barry?
- All right, Shaun. How's it going?

222
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,912
I'm working with a friend of yours
at the moment, Ross Kemp.

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,479
- How is he?
- Yeah, good.

224
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,836
I wouldn't mention Ross' name round here.
Ross is sort of mud with Barry

225
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:46,197
because it was Ross that persuaded
Barry to leave EastEnders.

226
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,079
Ross leaves, he goes to ITV.
He says it's a million pounds or nothing.

227
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:50,674
They give him a million pound contract.

228
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:54,550
So I go with Barry and say we want a million
pounds or nothing, they chose nothing.

229
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:58,112
They went with the nothing option that time,
didn't they?

230
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:01,718
You were upset, weren't you? Depressed.
Couldn't get out of bed for two weeks.

231
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,714
I was livid and looking back,
what I should have done is,

232
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:06,795
I shouldn't have given them
the nothing option. I should have said,

233
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:09,876
"We want a million pounds or we want £500,"

234
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,681
and that way we'd have
definitely got something.

235
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:13,402
- £500?
- Exactly, this is it.

236
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:16,875
- But live and learn, don't you?
- This isn't living though, is it?

237
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,637
Don't start that again.
I've got loads of stuff for you.

238
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:20,919
Like what?

239
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:24,475
There's a light flickering in the gents.
Could you have a tinker with that?

240
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:26,237
Yeah, I could do that.

241
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:29,796
Could I use your computer later?
I've just got to get the new CV knocked up.

242
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,877
Yeah, yeah, knock yourself out.

243
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:35,322
- Well, see you.
- All right, then. Cheers, B.

244
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:43,077
Sorry, the reason I'm here is
I want to know what your plan of action is.

245
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,998
What's your strategy?
What is your business plan?

246
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,398
My plan is when you get some work,
then I can start making some money.

247
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,922
Because what I'm no good at is,
you know, breaking an act.

248
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:54,365
So when I'm successful, you can deduct
12 and a half percent, no problem.

249
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,519
15 for adverts.
That's what I'm hanging on for, really.

250
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:59,169
You just want someone
to call up and give me an advert.

251
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,808
That would be amazing, brilliant.

252
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,450
Right, okay.
Make sure the phone's on the hook, then.

253
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,159
You joke about it. It was unplugged
for two days. No one noticed.

254
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:14,883
The man does not know where to start, okay?

255
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,766
This is my CV that he's sending
out to people.

256
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:21,606
I mean, casting agents, producers.
He typed it himself, okay.

257
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:27,041
"From 1986 to 1999 Andy Millman
worked at the Natwest in Wokingham.

258
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,052
"Andy left this comfortable,
adequately-paid job

259
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:35,126
"to try and become an actor,
despite his age, weight and looks.

260
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:38,809
"Andy claims to be a great actor
but has not yet had the chance to prove it

261
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:42,968
"because, so far, he's had no offers
except extra work which, as you know,

262
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:45,727
"is pointless and badly paid.

263
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:49,251
"Acting is Andy's dream.
If you can make that dream come true,

264
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:51,054
"please, please call."

265
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,334
- I mean, it's like he's writing to Jim'll Fix It.
- Oh, you have to fire him.

266
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:59,615
I can't fire him, can I? I can't bear to see
his stupid little face. He'd be devastated.

267
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,291
- Yes, but it's your career.
- I know.

268
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:05,687
What are you going to do?
I mean, you'll have to find all your own work.

269
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:08,770
Yeah, having a dog and barking yourself
springs to mind.

270
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:12,931
Start today, start now.
Go up to the director and ask him for a line.

271
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:15,772
Ross Kemp.
You've spoken to Ross Kemp, haven't you?

272
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:18,053
- Yes.
- Go up to Ross Kemp and ask him for a line.

273
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:22,018
Just say to him, "I thought you were
brilliant in EastEnders, Ultimate Force.

274
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,090
I loved you in Spandau Ballet.

275
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,250
- What?
- Spandau Ballet.

276
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,777
He wasn't in Spandau Ballet.
That was Martin Kemp.

277
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,055
Martin Kemp was in EastEnders
and Spandau Ballet.

278
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,176
- Who's this one?
- Ross Kemp.

279
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,456
- Are they not brothers?
- No.

280
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,970
Martin Kemp and Gary Kemp
were the brothers.

281
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,939
- Well, who's this one?
- Ross Kemp.

282
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:46,014
- Who's his brother?
- I don't know if he's got a brother.

283
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:50,779
Yes, he does. He's got that little bald one
with the pink face that looks like him.

284
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,535
Phil Mitchell?

285
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:56,173
His on screen brother. Phil and Grant
Mitchell, but they're not really brothers.

286
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:59,415
Yes, they are. They're the Mitchell brothers.

287
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:03,816
What do you mean, the Mitchell brothers?
You know his name is Ross Kemp.

288
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:08,136
What bit's confusing you?

289
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,103
The brothers.

290
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:13,902
The brothers?

291
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:15,300
What?

292
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:19,422
Is that confusing you, too?
Do you think we've landed in the future?

293
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:21,258
Shut your face.

294
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:25,624
You see, this is why I can never
go and speak to that guy

295
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:29,586
because I'm not smart enough for him.
He's an intellectual.

296
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,420
How do you know he's an intellectual?
You've never even spoken to him.

297
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:35,659
- Well, he reads the big papers.
- Oh, the big papers, sure.

298
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:38,661
See, it's always the same,
if a bloke is really smart,

299
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,388
I just always worry that
I'm not clever enough for him.

300
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:45,348
He's going to want to talk about politics
or whatever and I won't know what to say.

301
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:49,708
One time, I went out with this bloke and
we were in the pub playing the quiz machine

302
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,102
and it was for a fiver and the question
came up "Who discovered America?"

303
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,499
And I just panicked and I said, "Colombo."

304
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,786
See, you're laughing because I'm stupid.

305
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:02,864
No, it's an easy mistake to make.
They sound the same.

306
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,431
That's what I thought.

307
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,503
- You should just go and talk to him.
- You think?

308
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,345
Yeah, I don't know why you're so shy.
Just go and talk to him.

309
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:27,151
The FT.

310
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:29,509
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

311
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,991
NASDAQ, you twat, what are you like?

312
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:37,386
- You play the markets, do you?
- Oh, yeah.

313
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,467
How's it going? Any tips?

314
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:46,031
Buy high, buy low. Buy low, sell high.

315
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:53,111
- What you reading?
- It's Frank Kermode's book on Shakespeare.

316
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,995
It's for my new PhD.

317
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:58,468
Shakespeare, eh? Oh! Bloody genius, him.

318
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,119
Midsummer Night's Dream. Bottom...

319
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:06,032
- Oh, how is your diarrhoea?
- Fine, it's good.

320
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,237
- I'm going to get a coffee, I think.
- I've got to go and call my broker anyway.

321
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,709
All right. I was going to ask
if you wanted to get one.

322
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,837
Definitely. He's not there anyway,
he's away on holiday.

323
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,349
All right.

324
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:27,950
Hiya.

325
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:33,480
They're making a film over there
with Vinnie Jones.

326
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:37,757
What's he doing making a film?
He's a bloody footballer.

327
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:42,398
- Look at the size of those lights.
- You reckon they're big lights?

328
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:45,203
If I wanted big lights, I could have big lights.

329
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:48,276
I just don't want big lights.
I want small lights if anything.

330
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:55,682
I know an old colleague of yours
actually, Shaun Williamson.

331
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,394
- Shaun?
- Barry off EastEnders.

332
00:18:58,485 --> 00:18:59,998
- Oh, Barry, yeah.
- Yeah.

333
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:03,122
We've got the same agent
because I'm actually a real actor.

334
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm just, well, not just an extra

335
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:08,957
so if there was a line going in this
with just a little bit of dialogue,

336
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:12,562
it'd be great for me because,
as I said, I'm a proper actor.

337
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,845
Yeah, I hope you're better than him.
I mean, he's a bloody footballer.

338
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:19,124
He's good at what he does, isn't he?
The old "hard man" thing, I suppose.

339
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:23,565
- Because he actually is in real life so...
- You reckon? You think he's a tough guy?

340
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:27,039
I'd like to see him come at me
with all that "I'm a hard bastard" stuff.

341
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:31,839
I'd say, "Put the baseball bat down,
it's just you and me, skin on skin."

342
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,283
Stripped to the waist, to the death.

343
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:41,365
I'm trained.
He starts with me, I will destroy him.

344
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:50,439
Okay. Well, as I say, if you could
put a word in, I could just do a line.

345
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:53,330
Yeah, I'll sort that out for you, no problem.
No problem.

346
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,404
Really?

347
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,086
Cheers. I'll see you later.

348
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:12,572
I tell you, if there's a hag, a washerwoman,
toothless wench to be had, it'll be me.

349
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:16,125
I'm never the one that gets to wear
the taffeta dress, it's not fair.

350
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,489
- They've padded you up.
- That's actually me.

351
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:23,967
I was going to ask, I hope it doesn't seem
pushy, but would you like to go for a meal?

352
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:26,206
Yeah, I'm starving.

353
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,412
Oh, not right now but I thought maybe later.

354
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:31,966
Yeah, no, absolutely, yeah. Oh, I'd love to.

355
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,207
- Good.
- Okay, then.

356
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:55,938
What you doing here?
Still scavenging the bins for food, are you?

357
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,013
No need. Bloody waiting on a scene
I've got to do with Ross Kemp.

358
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,773
He asked me personally so... Good, though.

359
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,453
Yeah, well done.

360
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:10,329
- Shame it's only telly but, you know...
- Not really.

361
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:14,131
It's something. I mean, keep at it,
you might make it into the films.

362
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,339
Yeah, but what I wouldn't do is
do a film with Vinnie Jones,

363
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:19,094
he's a footballer but that's all right.

364
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:22,334
You say he's a footballer
but he's still been in films, hasn't he?

365
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:24,937
You know, with John Travolta
and Nicolas Cage.

366
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:28,174
What did he get paid for that, by the way?
Because I was talking to Ross...

367
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,937
You know Ross got a million pounds
to go to ITV?

368
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,141
- Yeah. Pretend to be a hard man.
- Not really.

369
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:37,341
- Unlike Vinnie. Real life hard man.
- Hmm.

370
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:41,781
Yeah. On a serious note,
Ross explained to me,

371
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:46,461
you know, Ross was trained by the SAS
and he said if Vinnie Jones

372
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:51,336
tried his antics on with him, he'd rip him
apart so you might want to warn him that.

373
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:52,825
- He said that?
- Yeah.

374
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:55,739
I'm not stirring shit, just warning.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

375
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:58,295
I don't care about him,
but I wouldn't want to see him get hurt.

376
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:00,423
I've said my bit so...

377
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:04,136
- I've got to go. I'll see you later.
- See you later, mate.

378
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:11,259
You've done so much.

379
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:15,225
Not really. I'm probably a bit older than you.

380
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:17,425
- How old are you?
- 34.

381
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,980
Well, I'm actually older than you
but thank you very much.

382
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:23,902
Well, you don't look it.
I thought you were in your 20s.

383
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,140
You never, did you? Oh, God.

384
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,064
I'm not!

385
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,621
- Anything you fancy?
- Possibly.

386
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,907
- I meant on the menu.
- I know.

387
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:50,146
- What have you been saying?
- About what?

388
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:53,862
Why am I hearing that Vinnie Jones
is looking for me and he wants to batter me?

389
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:55,591
I haven't said anything.

390
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,552
How's he know I've been slagging him off?
Who have you been speaking to?

391
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:01,467
No one. You're not scared of him, are you?

392
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:04,751
No. Not with what I could do to him.

393
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,269
- With your SAS stuff and that.
- Yeah.

394
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,426
I mean, do you know what that stands for?

395
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,824
SAS? Special Air Service.

396
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:14,674
What?

397
00:23:14,756 --> 00:23:16,986
Special Air Service, isn't it?

398
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,715
- It doesn't stand for that.
- Doesn't it?

399
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:24,392
I've talked to actual SAS people,
they've told me what it stands for.

400
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,149
What does it stand for, then?

401
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:29,551
Super Army Soldiers.

402
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:35,714
Su... Are you sure?

403
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,710
Yeah, I mean actual SAS people
have told me that.

404
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,677
The actual guys themselves
and they should know.

405
00:23:41,758 --> 00:23:46,038
- They weren't winding you up?
- They wouldn't do that to one of their own.

406
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,548
No. I thought it was Special Air Services.

407
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,394
Special Air Services? I mean, that sounds
like FedEx or something, doesn't it?

408
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:59,077
Registered delivery or whatever. Do you
think a postman needs arms like these?

409
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:02,074
Did I get these muscles lifting jiffy bags?

410
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:06,995
Definitely not.

411
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:13,036
If Vinnie Jones comes near me
looking for a fight, I will unleash hell.

412
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:17,036
Okay.

413
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:28,005
- Well, that was fun.
- Absolutely.

414
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:30,918
- Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?
- I'd love to.

415
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,233
Okay.

416
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:36,202
Right, just go through.

417
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:44,677
You're sweet, you're hot chocolate.

418
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:57,643
Come on, love, you're like a dead horse.
Put a bit of minge around it.

419
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:00,237
Okay.

420
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:08,244
- I head-butted a horse once.
- He must have really annoyed you.

421
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,728
Kemp.

422
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,562
All right, Vinnie, how's it going?

423
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,768
Never mind the "All right, Vinnie, how's it
going" bollocks. What you been saying?

424
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:18,570
- What are you talking about?
- What's all this I've been hearing?

425
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,166
- Shit about you think you're harder than me.
- Where have you heard this?

426
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:25,766
Some extra I've been doing a scene with
said he heard it over here.

427
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:29,845
You been trying to impress the extras
by telling them you're harder than me?

428
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,684
I haven't said anything.

429
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:35,163
You think you're well hard, don't you?
Are you hard?

430
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:36,401
No.

431
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:40,771
No, you're not.
And if I hear you slag me off anymore,

432
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:43,970
I'll come over here and I'll show you
what really hard is.

433
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:47,808
- Do you know what really hard is?
- Beating me up and that.

434
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,885
Yeah. Do you know what really hard is?

435
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:51,966
Beating up and that.
Kick him in the bollocks.

436
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:54,330
- No need to be specific.
- All right.

437
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:57,565
This is the final warning.

438
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,655
Come on.

439
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:20,610
- What?
- Nothing.

440
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,375
Why didn't you use your SAS stuff on him?

441
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,970
Because I don't know any.

442
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:32,176
What, you don't know kung fu
and all the lethal moves?

443
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,409
No.

444
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:37,608
Why did you say you did?

445
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,296
Why do I say I can hold my breath under
water for three and a half minutes? I can't.

446
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,653
I panic in water, if anything.

447
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:49,414
I can't get you a line either,
if that's why you're still here.

448
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:52,778
- Really?
- I haven't got any power around here.

449
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,137
I've told people
I've got a line and everything.

450
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,371
Sorry.

451
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:00,621
Don't worry about it.

452
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,813
Every job I do I get bullied.

453
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:05,495
Bullied?

454
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,859
People calling me names and that.

455
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:13,417
If it doesn't stop soon,
I think I'm just going to finish it, end it all.

456
00:27:14,464 --> 00:27:16,500
Do what I thought I'd never do.

457
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,142
Suicide?

458
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:22,662
No, go to Family Affairs. I've had an offer.

459
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:26,776
There's no bullying at Family Affairs,
they're really nice people.

460
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,380
Sure.

461
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,863
All I want to do is act.

462
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,659
And you're good.

463
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:36,981
Am I?

464
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:40,064
Yeah, of course you are.

465
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:43,020
Put your hat on.

466
00:27:44,588 --> 00:27:48,707
Look at that, looks brilliant.
Hair and everything.

467
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:50,622
Yes.

468
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:52,745
Look at all these.

469
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:55,659
Your medal. Shiny, innit?

470
00:27:56,305 --> 00:28:56,931
