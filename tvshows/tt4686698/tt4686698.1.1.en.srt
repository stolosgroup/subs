2
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:28,497
Tremblay! Ici!

3
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:31,073
Papa...

4
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:34,276
Please wait, please!

5
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:37,578
Have mercy.

6
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,880
Please.

7
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,255
This is your own doing.

8
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:50,858
This is not your land.

9
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:52,703
You shouldn't be here.

10
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,029
But don't worry...

11
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,985
I'll be seeing ya.

12
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:19,792
Take the guns, pelts,
powders and supplies.

13
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,219
Leave nothing.

14
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:22,721
- Philippe, come!
- Whatcha done?

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,855
I found him hiding.

16
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:32,863
Do you know who I am, boy?

17
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:38,339
Declan Harp.

18
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,906
I want you to do me a favor.

19
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:46,513
I want you to run on home

20
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,816
and I want you to tell him.

21
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,092
You tell him I'm here.

22
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,095
You're letting him
live. Word will spread.

23
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,004
They'll know this is you.

24
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,094
I'm counting on it.

25
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:02,078
"Declan Harp then
bound the three soldiers

26
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,717
and began torturing them.

27
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,173
He cut off most of their skin,

28
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,129
removed their fingers,

29
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,783
disemboweled them,

30
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,456
and while they still lived,

31
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,579
removed their genitals.

32
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,644
Once he was finished, he executed 'em.

33
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:20,350
He made off with the entire
cache of pelts from the outpost

34
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,681
as well 12 kegs of gunpowder,

35
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,554
sixteen muskets,

36
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,574
and two weeks worth of provisions."

37
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:28,712
Impressive.

38
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,421
That's high praise indeed,
coming from you, Lord Benton.

39
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,189
I just mean...

40
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,349
That your methods

41
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,908
are somewhat legendary.

42
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:48,268
Anyone can remove a body
part, Captain Chesterfield,

43
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:50,628
the trick is to be able to do it

44
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,800
while keeping the captive alive

45
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:56,471
so as to obtain the
information they withhold.

46
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,973
One of the tongues of
the slain was removed.

47
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:00,994
Defeats the purpose, don't you think?

48
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,658
Remove the genitals

49
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:04,340
and the tongue will move.

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,947
I could have Harp and his
men drawn and quartered

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,868
within two days of
landing in the New World!

52
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:12,020
What do you know of Declan Harp?

53
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:14,627
I know

54
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,791
he's half-Irish,

55
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,619
half-native.

56
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,294
You trained him yourself,

57
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,698
and you held him in high esteem

58
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,611
before his betrayal of the company.

59
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:27,138
Send me.

60
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,504
I'll bring you back whatever
part of Declan Harp you want.

61
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:34,093
Our profits are declining, Chesterfield.

62
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,169
We are losing millions.

63
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,702
This is a matter I
must personally see to.

64
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:43,983
Sir, Harp is little
more than a wild animal

65
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,515
- living in the forest.
- Living with the natives,

66
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:48,533
developing trade routes,

67
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,635
gaining their trust.

68
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,902
His savagery is precisely
what makes him dangerous.

69
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:03,057
Besides...

70
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,563
Declan Harp's defiance has the potential

71
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,872
to be a much bigger problem.

72
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,941
He makes us appear
weak to our competitors.

73
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:14,478
Killing him is not enough.

74
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,763
We must make an example of him.

75
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:23,503
We must make him suffer.

76
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:28,470
- Stop! Thieves!
- Come on, Clenna,

77
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:29,825
I thought you could
keep up with the boys!

78
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,475
Shut yer arse, Michael Smyth!

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,290
Good, say our names loud and all!

80
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:37,783
Lose him in the market, double back!

81
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,776
Hey, stop!

82
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,807
no wonder you're so slow,

83
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:59,800
you can't see a thing under there.

84
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:03,881
One eye is all I can
handle with your ugly mug.

85
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,740
What's going on here now?

86
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,426
Saving your sister's all.

87
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,105
- You're welcome.
- That'll be the day.

88
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,432
Merchant's gone.

89
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:27,519
Let's see what's for dinner.

90
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,351
It's rotten.

91
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:36,851
- All of it.
- You grabbed the rubbish sack.

92
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,050
We can't keep doing this.

93
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:40,741
We need to nick something big

94
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,768
or we're not gonna survive
another winter here.

95
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,159
You make it sound so easy.

96
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:50,427
Never said it was gonna be easy.

97
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:58,469
The ship!

98
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,227
Where would we hide it?

99
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,582
We're not gonna nick the
whole ship, you dimwit.

100
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:05,694
- We're gonna rob it.
- This is bollocks.

101
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,354
Look how heavily guarded that boat is.

102
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:08,177
It's perfect.

103
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,390
No, it's pretty ducking
far from perfect!

104
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,586
There's no way we can get near the gold.

105
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:15,640
If there's even any on board it'll
be guarded like a virgin's honey pot.

106
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:16,960
We're not going for the gold.

107
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,735
Then what are we going for?

108
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:23,502
Gunpowder.

109
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:25,201
Gunpowder, is it?

110
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,468
Could you pick something that
won't blow the face off ya?

111
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,662
Do you know what we could get
for a keg of black powder, Clenna?

112
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,232
'Cause I'm done with this shit.

113
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,940
Even if we're caught and
hanged we're no worse off.

114
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,712
I need something more,
we need something more.

115
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:43,007
I want a life for us together,
free from this misery.

116
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,081
Besides, if we can't
summon the courage to steal

117
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:49,214
a keg of black powder from a
bunch of fat English arseholes

118
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:50,882
then we deserve to die in this hell.

119
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:04,557
Bang.

120
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,577
Bang.

121
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,942
Hello, Rivard.

122
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,372
Right on time, Harp.

123
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,315
These are spectacular quality!

124
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,045
How many more of these
are you able to get?

125
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,813
For you? None.

126
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,305
I'm confused.

127
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:34,702
Perhaps you don't understand
my French accent so well.

128
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:37,491
I understand you.

129
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,631
Then why refuse a paying customer?

130
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:43,101
Well, that's a conversation I
need to have with your employer.

131
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,022
I work for no man.

132
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,757
I work for the Fleur-de-lis.

133
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:48,262
You work for the highest bidder.

134
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,457
Samuel Grant,

135
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,095
a wealthy American new to Montreal.

136
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:56,132
Grant is one of several
men with whom I do business.

137
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:57,567
I wanna meet him.

138
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:58,948
No.

139
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:02,178
Why would you want such a thing?

140
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,225
Do not overestimate your standing.

141
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:07,951
You're just the middleman.

142
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:12,590
I cannot do business like this.

143
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:15,038
I guess I'll take my business
to one of your competitors.

144
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:16,317
No, okay, okay!

145
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,189
I'll speak to Grant.

146
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,522
I'll try to set up a meeting,

147
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:23,766
but he's going to ask
what you have to offer.

148
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:25,927
This amount of furs will not be enough.

149
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:33,129
The Lake Walker tribe.

150
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,865
The Cree?

151
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:38,439
You have an agreement
with them for trade?

152
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,741
I will.

153
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,385
Fine.

154
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:45,018
But if you cut me out of this, you...

155
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:48,304
You will, very
badly hurt my feeling.

156
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,535
Set it up, Rivard.

157
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,549
What's all this fuss
about pushing off tonight?

158
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,453
Lord Benton is in some kind of hurry,

159
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,544
and I ain't gonna be the one
who gets in his way, Mule.

160
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,270
Bloody pain in my arse.

161
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,290
I'm taking a piss.

162
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,489
- Did you see the size of that one?
- This changes nothing.

163
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:25,990
If anything it's more
reason not to get caught.

164
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,004
Tom...

165
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:29,459
If there's any sign of trouble

166
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,562
make a serious racket
and we'll sneak off.

167
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,573
Be careful, Clenna.

168
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,338
Don't act like you care, Michael Smyth,

169
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:39,003
that's how babies are made.

170
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,113
Powder.

171
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:50,239
Gently,

172
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,453
or the last thing to go through
your mind will be your arse!

173
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:19,350
Clenna, a little help please.

174
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:25,209
Having a lunch, were
ya? Ooh, what the hell?

175
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,477
- He said if I yelled he'd kill you!
- Shut your mouth!

176
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,360
Now, what are we gonna do
with you shit rats?

177
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:34,271
Run!

178
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,898
I got 'em!

179
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:39,816
Tommy!

180
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,953
Clenna, run, run!

181
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:47,762
They're on the run!

182
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,709
Over there!

183
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:01,484
- Where is he?
- I think he jumped.

184
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,127
Should we report this?

185
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:05,548
Fuck to that. Search the ship.

186
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,252
Make sure there ain't any more of 'em.

187
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:30,730
- All right?
- Two!

188
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:33,214
Give me some line! A little looser!

189
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,220
- How's that?
- All that squared away!

190
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,328
No.

191
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,911
- All right, watch your backside!
- No, no!

192
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,380
Swing it around now, lads! Hey!

193
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:47,765
- Did you hear about last night?
- No.

194
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:49,790
Three little shits tried
to sneak onto the ship,

195
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,912
two boys and a girl.

196
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:56,484
What happened to the
filthy little bastards?

197
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,217
Mule killed one of 'em,

198
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,585
says he stabbed him and
tossed him overboard.

199
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:03,316
- What about the girl, she dead, too?
- Nah, got nabbed.

200
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:05,391
She'll be under lock
and key at Bow Street,

201
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,603
she's a pretty little thing.

202
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,578
They're gonna eat her alive in there.

203
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:09,188
Stop it!

204
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,313
Can never be too sure.

205
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,554
My brother just died!

206
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:22,357
I can comfort you.

207
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:25,942
Get her in there!

208
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,951
Don't!

209
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:29,783
No!

210
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:32,610
Come back here! Please!

211
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:36,715
Please!

212
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:38,479
Please.

213
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,823
Let's get, let's get the raw cheese!

214
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:04,830
Good evening.

215
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:06,440
A long journey!

216
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:07,906
You must be thirsty, Father?

217
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:11,098
Dry to the very bone, Ms. Emberly.

218
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:13,693
I see that governor Threadwell
is your guest tonight.

219
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:14,930
Every night.

220
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:20,901
I'm afraid my profession,
though spiritually rewarding,

221
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,763
leaves me with an empty purse.

222
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,401
Well then, you're in luck.

223
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,020
There is another currency I
can accept as you well know.

224
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:34,780
There's news from the
north Labrador Sea.

225
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,696
A ship, on its way here,

226
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:39,350
rounded the head of
Hudson's bay a fortnight ago.

227
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:41,100
Who's on board?

228
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,703
A senior HBC company man.

229
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,588
Very important.

230
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,042
I'll find out tomorrow,
you have my word.

231
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,463
In the meantime...

232
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,524
I require...

233
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,532
I require many things.

234
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,468
I require brandy,

235
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:02,668
and I require you, my
dear, on your knees,

236
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,760
with your skirts up over your head!

237
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:09,406
You've missed the fact
that I am wearing britches,

238
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,591
Governor Threadwell.

239
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,015
Perhaps the Governor
knows who's aboard that ship...

240
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:17,220
Coming down the bay, a company brig.

241
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,523
That would be Lord Benton
with my reinforcements.

242
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,759
It's about bloody time.

243
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,661
He's a formidable man, Benton.

244
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:29,439
We fought the Prussians together.

245
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:34,684
He once saved my life twice in one week!

246
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,301
- Reinforcements!
- Reinforcements!

247
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:42,651
It makes sense.

248
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:46,398
Lord Benton's outpost was
burned, his men killed.

249
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,705
He wants to handle it personally.

250
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:51,311
Bringing with him the power
and might of the great company

251
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:53,862
with the backing of all England herself.

252
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,388
God help us all.

253
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,812
No, priest,

254
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,043
what he brings is opportunity.

255
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,570
Down here, let's go.

256
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:22,247
Come on, hurry up!

257
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:26,396
So did you get those plates?

258
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,733
Yes, sir, the ones from
Lord Benton's cabin.

259
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:32,135
And the other thing I
asked for, did you get that?

260
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,736
Yes.

261
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,839
Then give it here!

262
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:41,508
Very nice.

263
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,514
You can't keep making me steal things!

264
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:47,472
- They'll find out.
- Shut your gob!

265
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,884
No one'll find out,
and if you tell, boy,

266
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,553
I'll slit your throat!

267
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:54,970
What's this?

268
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:58,478
What we got here, then?

269
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:00,404
You dirty bugger!

270
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:02,396
Been down here all this time, have ya?!

271
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:04,095
Eating my biscuits?!

272
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:06,197
All hands on deck!

273
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:08,250
All hands on deck!

274
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,671
Let's go! Let's go!

275
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:24,350
Someone among you has taken
something that belongs to me.

276
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:29,294
This is your opportunity to step forward

277
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:32,293
if you wish to have mercy shown.

278
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:34,628
No one?

279
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,686
I want everyone on this ship searched.

280
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,268
I have it here, my lord!

281
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:41,732
I found it on this...
On this, on this stowaway.

282
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,282
This lad ducked down in the hold.

283
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,860
He must've snuck into your
quarters and stole this.

284
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:47,338
I wondered whose it was.

285
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,483
Throw him overboard.

286
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,359
He's lying! It was him! It was the boy!

287
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,367
The cook made him do it!
I heard them in the cargo!

288
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,679
Wait.

289
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,685
Where are you from?

290
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,111
Ireland.

291
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:05,154
The south country by the sounds of it.

292
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:08,672
Yes. I'm telling the truth, my lord.

293
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,118
The cook made the boy do it.

294
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:12,490
Check his bunk, he has more.

295
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:14,231
Lying bastard!

296
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:24,846
Check his bunk.

297
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,269
Right...

298
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,482
Watch out!

299
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:36,539
Now here's a man who
appreciates a sharp blade.

300
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,198
I... no!

301
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:02,476
Brave lad, aren't you?

302
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:04,119
What's your name?

303
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,545
It's... Michael Smyth.

304
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:10,175
Take the galley boy below deck.

305
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,958
We'll deal with him later.

306
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:17,008
And get young Michael
here some food and a bunk.

307
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:18,695
You heard the man!

308
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,599
Come!

309
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,607
Should we talk later when you're...

310
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,400
less distracted?

311
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:38,777
Do I look distracted to you?

312
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,118
No, sir.

313
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,546
At last count there were
nearly a dozen companies

314
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,206
cutting into our business here:

315
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:50,874
Declan Harp,

316
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:53,119
the Scottish Brown Brothers,

317
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:56,531
and a handful of other
parasites out of Montreal.

318
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:59,546
They are all choking off our trade.

319
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,856
This is all our territory.

320
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:04,453
Only if we can control it.

321
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,419
We must first destroy Harp's operation.

322
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,389
It will send a message to the others:

323
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,161
we will not tolerate
competition of any kind.

324
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:17,737
Attempt it and you will suffer the wrath

325
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,335
of this great company.

326
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:21,482
The problem, sir,

327
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:24,284
we can't destroy him
until we know where he is.

328
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:25,922
He has hidden eyes everywhere.

329
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,312
How are we gonna get close to him?

330
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:29,915
A Trojan horse.

331
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:32,894
Which has just arrived. Come!

332
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:37,616
You wanted to see me, Lord Benton?

333
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:39,706
This one looks young and strapping.

334
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,520
Some respect.

335
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,300
This man saved my life.

336
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,588
Come in, Michael.

337
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,745
Did they feed you?

338
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,556
They did, yes, thank you.

339
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,932
And you had a chance to rest properly.

340
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,251
Yes.

341
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:56,532
Good.

342
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:02,047
Now it's come to my attention
that you and your friends

343
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:04,860
tried to rob a keg of
powder from my ship?

344
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:06,372
Right. That.

345
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,235
It's a bit of a
misunderstanding, my lord.

346
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:10,940
I'm convinced of it.
You risked your health

347
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,684
to disarm a dangerous man today.

348
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:15,706
I am obliged to repay you.

349
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,411
It's not necessary, but if you insist

350
00:23:18,451 --> 00:23:20,898
I find gold to be the
easiest for such transactions.

351
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:24,046
You've never seen a piece of
gold in your worthless life, boy.

352
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:26,790
Pay no attention to
Captain Chesterfield,

353
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:30,137
he has a delicate constitution at sea.

354
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:34,055
A man needs to make his
own way in this life.

355
00:23:34,554 --> 00:23:35,856
No handouts.

356
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:39,817
But how would you like
to work for the most

357
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,827
powerful company in the world?

358
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:43,425
How do you mean?

359
00:23:43,452 --> 00:23:45,430
I need you to find someone.

360
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,025
A trapper,

361
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,773
Declan Harp.

362
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:52,137
His father was originally
from your part of the world.

363
00:23:52,186 --> 00:23:55,320
You will tell him that you
were a stowaway on this ship

364
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,485
and that you want to make
your fortune in the fur trade.

365
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,398
Countrymen helping each other out.

366
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:03,262
That's your way, innit?

367
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,373
You will gain his trust.

368
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,784
Then you will return to
me with his exact location

369
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:14,095
and the number of men under his command,

370
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,163
for which you'll be paid
handsomely in silver.

371
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,951
And we'll forget all about
those robbery charges.

372
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,197
There was a girl with me.

373
00:24:28,737 --> 00:24:29,933
Clenna Dolan.

374
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:32,522
Her brother was killed in the attempt

375
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:34,510
and she's been taken prisoner in London.

376
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:36,769
She's paid her debt with the loss.

377
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,359
Clenna Dolan.

378
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:45,016
I'll send word the next ship back.

379
00:24:45,647 --> 00:24:47,017
She'll be released.

380
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,867
And the cook's boy,
he goes free as well.

381
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:50,651
- Don't push it.
- Done.

382
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,189
This Declan Harp,

383
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:03,062
how will I find him exactly?

384
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:05,209
We have a guide at Fort James

385
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:07,497
who can take you into the wilderness.

386
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:09,980
Let it be known that you're Irish

387
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,953
and looking for your countryman.

388
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:15,291
Spread that about and the
chances are Harp will find you.

389
00:25:17,177 --> 00:25:18,522
I won't let you down, sir.

390
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,137
I hope not,

391
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:22,842
for sweet young Clenna's sake.

392
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:45,930
Who is this muskrat?

393
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:49,161
Jean-Marc Rivard here to see Mr. Grant.

394
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,368
Mr. Grant,

395
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:58,616
thank you for seeing me.

396
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:01,892
That's a beautiful coat.

397
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:04,606
I don't believe I've
ever seen its source.

398
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,337
It's seal.

399
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:07,780
From the ocean?

400
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,585
Hard to set a trap there?

401
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,721
I need you to travel north with me

402
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,971
up to James Bay. There's
someone you should meet.

403
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:26,592
You asked me to meet
with you so that you could

404
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,791
ask me to meet with someone else?

405
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:30,947
Well, when you put it that way it seems

406
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,736
somehow a bit silly, but,

407
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:37,117
this man is a special supplier

408
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:39,702
looking for a particular type of buyer.

409
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,229
So why didn't you bring him here?

410
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,406
We have to go to him.

411
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,746
I pay you to meet with these suppliers

412
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,814
so that I don't have to.

413
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:56,129
Perhaps I should find someone else

414
00:26:56,142 --> 00:26:58,595
who understands what I need.

415
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:01,225
Well, like a wife?

416
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,312
He will only speak with you.

417
00:27:10,843 --> 00:27:14,429
Mr. Grant, I would hate for
you to miss an opportunity

418
00:27:14,443 --> 00:27:16,342
to make a lot of money.

419
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,587
And who is this supplier?

420
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:19,906
Declan Harp.

421
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:26,814
The man who used to work for
the Hudson's Bay Company and now

422
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:28,217
steals from them?

423
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,877
That's who you want me to meet?

424
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,241
It sounds bad when you put it like that.

425
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:34,486
Does it?

426
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:38,610
I've no intention

427
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:40,748
of traveling into the wilderness

428
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,997
to meet with a notorious cutthroat.

429
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,723
You may leave me.

430
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:47,608
No, no, no! You two have
much in common, Mr. Grant!

431
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:51,207
You are both men on the rise!

432
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,164
You are both ambitious, intelligent.

433
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:56,342
You are the men of the future!

434
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,635
Harp's power is growing.

435
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,292
He can deliver the Lake Walker tribe

436
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:05,146
and all their furs!

437
00:28:06,797 --> 00:28:09,524
Work with him and with me,

438
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,853
we could destroy the competition.

439
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,429
Lord Benton, the Hudson's Bay Company,

440
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,526
wipe them off the map!

441
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:28,734
Okay, Monsieur Rivard,

442
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:33,434
I will meet with Declan Harp...

443
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:37,537
But he comes to me.

444
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:42,808
All right!

445
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:44,672
Tie it down, man! Tie it down!

446
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:47,031
Land ho! Land ho!

447
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,644
It's the New World, Michael!

448
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:57,021
I've never seen anything like it.

449
00:29:04,803 --> 00:29:05,772
Let go.

450
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:12,297
Where do you want these?

451
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:14,651
C'mon then.

452
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,422
You killed my friend you piece of shit!

453
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:21,830
Yeah, I'm glad the little
shit rat got what it deserved.

454
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,955
He had a name, Tom, you
better show him some respect!

455
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,509
I should just stick
my blade in your chest

456
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:27,213
and let you bleed out
like a little piggy.

457
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,635
Lord Benton will have you hanged.

458
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:30,184
All I gotta do is take you to our guide,

459
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,016
you can go die out
there all by yourself.

460
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,295
Watch where you're going!

461
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:34,424
We're not looking for any trouble.

462
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:36,460
Stay out of this, and you,
get out of my way, little man,

463
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,474
or I'll snap you in half.

464
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:40,528
Hey wait!

465
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:57,796
Come on. There is trouble.

466
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:01,881
- Come on, then.
- I didn't do this!

467
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,463
It doesn't matter. Nothing
can be done for that fool now.

468
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,441
- Hold on, look!
- Is he dead?

469
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:13,360
Did you see it? He stabbed
him right in the neck,

470
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,263
literally out of nowhere. He
just died right on top of me!

471
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:18,667
Welcome to Fort James.
Watch your step. Come on.

472
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:20,010
Where are we going?

473
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:22,678
The last thing you want is
those soldiers asking questions.

474
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:25,810
Here.

475
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,866
This is for me, dear? Non...

476
00:30:30,187 --> 00:30:32,705
You must tread softly
in this place, my son.

477
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,724
The soldiers have only
one thing on their minds:

478
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:37,220
protect the gold and
the fur is the gold.

479
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:38,913
Wait, who are ya?

480
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,452
Father James Coffin at your disposal.

481
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:42,952
And you are?

482
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,922
Michael Smyth.

483
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:47,941
- What's a priest doing in this part of the world?
- What else?

484
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:50,428
Bringing the mercy of
our Lord Jesus Christ

485
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
to these miserable sinners.

486
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,780
And you've just arrived.
Lord Benton's ship.

487
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:57,151
Company man, are you?

488
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,420
Heading out to the wilderness.

489
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:01,055
I'm supposed to be meeting a guide.

490
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:02,955
- I have silver to pay him.
- That's me.

491
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:04,592
I'm your guide.

492
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:06,922
- You're a priest.
- Also a guide.

493
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:07,996
Call it a sideline,

494
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:11,084
but I've seen a great deal of
this wild land, Michael Smyth.

495
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,791
I can find whatever piece of
wilderness you're looking for.

496
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:18,363
I'm looking for countryman of mine.

497
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:20,037
Goes by the name of Declan Harp.

498
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:22,140
Extremely unwise.

499
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,878
Harp is a madman.

500
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,020
Maybe I should look
for another guide then?

501
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:29,676
Wait a moment, my son,

502
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:33,056
are you sure you have enough
silver to pay for a good guide?

503
00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:35,032
Sure, I already told you so.

504
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:37,207
Very well.

505
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,123
I'll take you to Declan Harp, but

506
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,027
at least let's rest up first
before our long journey.

507
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:45,662
I know a quiet little place.

508
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,361
Well, on your way!

509
00:31:51,394 --> 00:31:53,247
Come on, time to go.

510
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,366
Go!

511
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,078
Enough of that now, step off.

512
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,569
Another drink, Mike?

513
00:31:58,592 --> 00:32:00,356
Look, I've already paid for our ale,

514
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:02,813
I'm not paying for any more
until you take me to Declan Harp.

515
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:09,570
This should cover it.

516
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,418
And then some.

517
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,896
- So you're a thief?
- Just his price for salvation.

518
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,435
We all have one, you know.

519
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:21,262
And are you gonna rob me
too when I turn me back?

520
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:24,040
Of course not! You have so little.

521
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:25,931
which is good,

522
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:29,300
because it means you don't
have the sickness yet.

523
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:30,968
The sickness?

524
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:33,380
When you put too much
silver in the hands of the

525
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,305
kinds of people who come here,

526
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:36,728
it awakens something.

527
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:39,268
- Drunkenness and thievery?
- Yes...

528
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:43,096
Among other things, and a need for more.

529
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:46,266
Some people have no self-discipline.

530
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:51,650
The priest and the boy.

531
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:53,456
I want to know what they're saying.

532
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:54,837
Yes, Miss Emberly.

533
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:59,933
Most think the sickness is about money,

534
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,998
and it's really about power, Michael.

535
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,665
Some want more power,

536
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:08,277
and some don't want to
give up the power they have.

537
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:10,724
When someone gains more,

538
00:33:10,768 --> 00:33:12,926
someone else has to lose it.

539
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:15,886
You have to be careful here

540
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:19,759
or you will get pulled
in by the sickness too.

541
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,136
And you have to know

542
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,036
that going to the interior
to meet Declan Harp

543
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:30,417
may cost you your life.

544
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,238
On the house!

545
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:39,038
Are you seeking salvation, my love?

546
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:42,413
Because I'm the only one in here

547
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:44,532
who can give it to you.

548
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:47,592
I'm afraid it's probably a
little too late for me, Father.

549
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:48,975
Nonsense!

550
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:53,192
You'll be in my dreams tonight.

551
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:55,313
Well, then you better start dreaming.

552
00:33:57,397 --> 00:33:58,830
Are you really a priest?

553
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:01,319
The boy then ran off,

554
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:02,830
disappeared into the crowd.

555
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:05,375
And you witnessed the entire incident?

556
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,326
- And he didn't kill our man?
- No, it was a frontiersman.

557
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,766
I didn't see his face.

558
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,230
The boy's entirely
innocent of the crime,

559
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:14,341
that one, at least.

560
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:16,344
Well, thank you for coming to us.

561
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,198
It's my duty, Milord.

562
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:21,491
Clearly the boy has value to you?

563
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,108
Did you see where he went?

564
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,743
No, I didn't, no.

565
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,444
He looked frightened.

566
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:29,005
Can't say that I blame him,

567
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,809
bearing witness to a
brutal murder like that

568
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:33,519
- and just upon arrival.
- Indeed.

569
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,379
I will certainly keep a watch for him.

570
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:37,475
Yes, I'm sure you will.

571
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,589
My Lord, if I might pro...

572
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,714
If I might propose,

573
00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:48,065
there's not much happens
here in fort James

574
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,747
that I don't know about.

575
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:52,801
Perhaps we could be
of help to each other.

576
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,387
I'd like to help you right
now in fact, Miss Emberly.

577
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:03,044
Imogen here is part of my house staff.

578
00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:07,095
Perhaps she can be of some use
to you in your establishment.

579
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:09,618
That's very generous of you

580
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:12,352
- but I couldn't possibly...
- Nonsense. I insist.

581
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:18,150
I'll find her lodging tonight.

582
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,550
She can start in the morning.

583
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,784
Excellent.

584
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:31,186
I don't trust her.

585
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:35,153
That's why we now have eyes
and ears in her little tavern.

586
00:35:35,273 --> 00:35:37,793
Now you go and find Michael Smyth.

587
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:40,595
He's out there somewhere with no guide.

588
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:42,097
Fix it!

589
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:51,945
I could... I could...

590
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:56,052
So what's the story with your friend?

591
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,782
He is not able...

592
00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:06,037
to hold his ale.

593
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:12,275
Tell me more.

594
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:30,791
Quite a mess.

595
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:36,872
It's Mary, is it?

596
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,914
Yes, sir. If you're
looking for Miss Emberly

597
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:40,532
she'll be here momentarily.

598
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,841
You don't want this
slipping down too far,

599
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,064
encourage the animals
that venture in here,

600
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:58,075
do you?

601
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,270
Captain Chesterfield.

602
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:05,030
- Thank you, Mary.
- She can stay.

603
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,226
Tell me something, Mary.

604
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:12,766
Was there a boy in here last night?

605
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:15,244
An Irish lad fresh off the boat?

606
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:22,289
Yes, sir.

607
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:25,935
Was he alone?

608
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:27,910
He was with the Father, sir.

609
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,168
A priest? Not a guide?!

610
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:31,839
No, sir.

611
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,504
What else?

612
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,441
That's it.

613
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:37,388
They had too much to
drink and they left.

614
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:40,077
What else?!

615
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,623
- Stop it!
- You stay back or I'll fucking gut you!

616
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,617
Where did they go?

617
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,259
They were chased to
the river by some men.

618
00:37:56,996 --> 00:37:59,232
Let her go!

619
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:10,398
You and I don't need to be
enemies, Captain Chesterfield.

620
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:12,329
Friends like you I don't need.

621
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,457
You offered me your help, but
you leave me passed out drunk.

622
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:21,724
What kind of priest are ya?!

623
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,566
What kind of priest are you in need of?

624
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,277
I'm beginning to doubt your wellness.

625
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:28,275
Open your eyes, Michael.

626
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:30,803
This is no place for a boy like you.

627
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,819
Take it.

628
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,637
Walk back into town,

629
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:40,249
pay for the next ship
returning to England. Go home!

630
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,194
I can't.

631
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:45,439
Surely you could explain to Lord Benton

632
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,243
that this is not the life for you!

633
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,346
I can't go home.

634
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:56,788
The girl I love back in London,

635
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,008
her life is in my hands.

636
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:02,056
This silver would get me home,

637
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:03,135
but it wouldn't free her from prison

638
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:04,545
or keep her from being hanged.

639
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:06,554
I made a deal with Lord Benton,

640
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:08,773
I have no choice.

641
00:39:11,705 --> 00:39:14,007
You said you would take
me to Declan Harp, Father.

642
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:15,921
Now take me!

643
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:18,273
Michael, the truth is...

644
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:20,680
Easy now, my son,

645
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:23,154
- we're of no danger.
- Ha!

646
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,290
Put your hands up! He
said you might say that!

647
00:39:33,446 --> 00:39:35,487
Captain Chesterfield.

648
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:38,829
What the hell was that for?!

649
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:41,391
For making me come out
here and track you down.

650
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:43,626
It seems we're off on
a bit of the wrong foot.

651
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:44,826
Captain Chesterfield, is it?

652
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:46,691
- Father James Coffin...
- I know who you are.

653
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:48,279
What are you doing with the Irish boy?

654
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,988
- Well...
- He's my guide.

655
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:51,632
Your guide?

656
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,454
This is your goddamn guide!

657
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,850
Yes, well, honestly, it's
all been very chaotic...

658
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,040
You haven't an honest
bone in your body, priest.

659
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,680
It's true that God
works in mysterious ways,

660
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,910
- but one mustn't blame the messenger...
- This snake had no intentions

661
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:05,630
of taking you anywhere near Harp.

662
00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:08,048
Now that is a bit of hasty judgment

663
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:11,036
- without all...
- Shut your fool mouth before I cave it in.

664
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,783
It's late. Make camp by the lake.

665
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:17,676
Don't let these two out of your sights.

666
00:40:18,445 --> 00:40:21,278
All right, sir, come with
me. Let's go, come on.

667
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:23,288
That's it.

668
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:26,988
You're lucky I found you.

669
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,489
If you don't find Harp,

670
00:40:29,788 --> 00:40:31,265
I have a feeling

671
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:34,332
something bad will happen to
that sweet little girl of yours.

672
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,895
And I swear to Christ he pissed himself

673
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:44,052
right there in front of me!

674
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,744
That's not what she said!

675
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:48,306
I know, exactly. Come on, lads.

676
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:50,613
Do you want see your other rifle!

677
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:56,866
- Have some of this.
- Pass it round, pass it round, yeah.

678
00:40:57,064 --> 00:41:00,020
- That's not the same.
- Did you bring that out? It's a ration.

679
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:11,351
Dear mother of Mary,
we are in the fire now.

680
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:13,481
Deliver me, Lord, of all
people, your loyal shepherd

681
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,782
in this time of great peril!

682
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,330
Follow. Now.

683
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:22,223
- No, no, please!
- Follow. Now!

684
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:23,258
You don't understand!

685
00:41:23,285 --> 00:41:25,842
I'm a man of God! A
priest of the church!

686
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:27,094
Please!

687
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:37,615
These are Harp's men.

688
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:39,347
They are ruthless.

689
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:40,962
Why did you say you'd be my guide

690
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,389
if you didn't actually
have the courage to take me?

691
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:46,301
It's time you stop talking.

692
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:26,660
This is a far worse
place than I've ever seen.

693
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,226
Hey!

694
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:34,561
Michael, I've done my work
brought you to the interior,

695
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:36,006
my job here is done.

696
00:42:36,371 --> 00:42:39,685
If we survive this you should
know that I expect full payment,

697
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:41,970
and a little extra for my trouble.

698
00:42:44,614 --> 00:42:47,215
I found them in the
bush. Three soldiers.

699
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,146
Why were you with English soldiers?

700
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:14,499
I had nothing to do
with those hateful pigs.

701
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,126
Their leader threatened to kill me.

702
00:43:16,337 --> 00:43:18,409
I, I just want to be
paid as per my contract

703
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:20,675
with young Michael here
and I'll be on my way.

704
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,828
You're not going anywhere, priest.

705
00:43:23,182 --> 00:43:26,053
The soldiers found us wandering
in the wilderness, lost.

706
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:28,682
They were gonna take
us back to the fort.

707
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:33,612
And why were you wandering
in the wilderness?

708
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:40,418
I was looking for you.

709
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,500
I want to make my
fortune in the fur trade

710
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:45,403
and I hear you're the
man to help me do it.

711
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,721
You're gonna have to do
better than that, lad.

712
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:58,047
Why are you with this...

713
00:43:59,281 --> 00:44:00,907
Priest?

714
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:03,051
I hired him as my guide but...

715
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:04,643
but I learned he was lying to me

716
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:06,937
- and had no intention of helping me.
- No, Michael, that is not

717
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,787
completely true. Mr. Harp,
I am a man of many contacts.

718
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:11,768
Many of them are great suppliers of fur.

719
00:44:11,888 --> 00:44:13,804
I could easily connect you to them

720
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,978
upon my return to
civilization, of course.

721
00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:18,273
I know this one. He's a loudmouth drunk.

722
00:44:18,308 --> 00:44:19,584
He can't be trusted.

723
00:44:20,855 --> 00:44:23,257
You're right, that's me,
but I, but I can change.

724
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:25,019
I'm better than that, you'll see.

725
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:28,361
What better place to turn
over a new leaf than here?

726
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,584
- He needs to die.
- Harp,

727
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:32,633
I am a man of divine provenance!

728
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:35,400
Keeping me in your company
will put God on your side!

729
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:36,932
You are of no value to me.

730
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:38,127
You can't just kill him!

731
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,764
I won't let you kill him!

732
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:42,500
You watch, boy!

733
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,715
Take 'em both!

734
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,425
I have information on Lord Benton!

735
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:48,701
I have information on Lord Benton!!

736
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:58,080
All right, boy,

737
00:44:58,677 --> 00:45:00,475
you have my attention.

738
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:05,024
Tell me about Benton or join the priest.

739
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:15,244
