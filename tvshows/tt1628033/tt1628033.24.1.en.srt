00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,880
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,920
- We're back! 
- CHEERING

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,760
- And we've got lots and lots of shiny new cars.
- That's right.

00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,040
CHEERING

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,240
That's right.

00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,080
In fact, here's a look at what's coming up over the next seven weeks.

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,680
# My mother told me "Son, let it be"... #

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,880
Oh, it's on!

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,320
# Sold my soul to the calling... #

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
Let's go racing!

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,920
# Sold my soul to a sweet melody... #

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,240

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,480
# Now I'm gone, now I'm gone now I'm gone

I'm done. Have the car, I'm out.

HE LAUGHS

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,040
Oh, the acceleration is enormous!

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,080
Whoo!

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
The way this is written,

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,640
it sounds like I just kicked your ass here.

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,960
HE LAUGHS

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,920
# Oh, gimme that fire... #

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,840
My knob's come off!

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,640
# Oh, gimme that fire... #

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,520
Oh, yes! What a thing!

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,360
# Oh, gimme that fire... #

31
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,640
THAT is immature.

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
Ooh. OK.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,920
All righty.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,080
Wow, that's a lot for the eyes.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240
Looks OK to me.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,720
OK...let's kick it off with this.

38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,920
The LaFerrari.

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,680
Costs £1 million, and only 500 will ever be built.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,360
Interesting, isn't it, that adding "La" to a name

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,480
makes it sound more exotic,

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,520
whereas "Le" - not so much, really.

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,840
LAUGHTER

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,320
I get it. I see what you did there. You got... You got me.

45
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,120
We don't need to go into your last name. All right.

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,320
Anyhow, the LaFerrari.

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,280
You hear that, you think, "Ferrari's VIP area," right?

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,280
The fastest, the most advanced, the most exclusive.

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Well, nearly. Because, in the world of Ferrari,

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,320
turns out there's a V-VIP area -

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,240
- somewhere off-limits to us mere commoners.
- Mm-hm.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,960
Somewhere home to a truly extraordinary machine.

53
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,240
Here it is, the Ferrari FXXK.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,360
And, no, that name is NOT accidental.

55
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
- Oh, my
- BLEEP
- days.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,240
It's based on the bones of the LaFerrari hypercar,

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,120
but it's been intensified in every department.

58
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,680
Only 40 will ever exist,

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,320
and it costs over £2 million.

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,040
Or at least it would, if you could buy it.

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,640
Which you can't. Even if you're a zillionaire,

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,640
you don't just phone up Ferrari with your credit card details.

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,160
Oh, no.

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,320
First, you must have been judged, in Ferrari's words,

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,560
to "have the right mind-set."

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
You must be invited.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,800
In fact, the FXXK is so unattainable,

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm the first outsider ever permitted to drive one.

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,920

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,480
So, just for today,

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,880
you can keep your LaFerraris,

72
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,640
your everyday hypercars.

more lightness,

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,440
more grip.

78
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,080
So much MORE.

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh! Oh!

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200
The speed is preposterous!

82
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,000
If you believe it,

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,440
it has 1,050 horsepower.

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,720
That's 87 more than the LaFerrari road car.

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
It's SO physical.

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
It gets inside your body.

87
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
Sensational, addictive, mighty, corrupting power!

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,600
0 to 60 takes just over two seconds,

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,320
but this car lives way beyond that.

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,160
Just keeps going...

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,920
until your brain implodes...

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
..like a collapsing star!

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,840
Like the LaFerrari, the FXXK has a KERS system

94
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,680
harvesting energy wasted underbraking.

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
If I brake hard now,

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,520
I can feel a kind of pressure behind my eyeballs, forcing them forward.

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,480
But here the system is F1 spec,

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,040
and when it uses that energy to boost the performance

99
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,280
of the 6.3-litre V12 engine...

100
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,400
..it just bungs you down the road.

101
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,240
It's not like a normal car experience of acceleration.

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,200
Here we go. I accelerate in third and...

103

104
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,560

Good Lord.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,600
And then there's the traction control.

107
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,360
Because Ferrari doesn't want to kill its wealthiest customers,

108
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,760
they're some of the most sophisticated systems

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,800
I've ever encountered.

110
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,600
I can just bury the throttle coming out of turns,

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,320
and it just manages it beautifully.

112
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,640
I suppose part of the thrill of this car is...

113
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,040
building up the courage to switch them off.

114
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640

118
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,680
Now, this is a good way to ruin some very expensive tyres.

119
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Fortunately, changing them is easy,

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,680
because your £2 million FXXK

121
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,160
also comes with its very own Ferrari pit crew...

122
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,680
..just like a modern Formula One car.

123
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,440
But, unlike a modern Formula One car,

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,960
it doesn't need to comply with a great big rule book.

125
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,000
In fact, it doesn't need to comply with the rule book...well, at all.

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,240
Ferrari basically said to its engineers,

127
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,760
"Knock yourselves out, do whatever the hell you want.

128
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,320
"Just make it fast.

129
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
"CRAZY fast!"

130
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,720
And this being Ferrari...

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
..crazy fast on the straights is just the start.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,320
The true nature of this car lies in the way it corners.

You can't see it but, boy, can you feel it.

136
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,480
It's lawless, savage.

137
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,640
It's motorsport unlimited.

138
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Unbound by rules,

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
the FXXK can delve deep into the dark art of aero.

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,400
From that enormous active wing to the insane diffuser,

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,720
its hunger for downforce crushes the tyres into the tarmac.

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,520
The aero through this left-hander.

143
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
Wow! Into the deck.

144
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Right now, it feels about the fasted thing ever made, to me.

145
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,160
'The performance of the FXXK is so extraordinary,

146
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
'it recalibrates your understanding of...

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,920
'what a car is capable of.

'It's wonderful, intoxicating.

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,120
'It's so cutting-edge, it's...'

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,640
I got quite a high water temperature now, so I need to just cool it down.

151
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,560
'..well, it's high maintenance.

152
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,040
'And that means your pit crew will spend a lot of time

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,800
'fiddling about with stuff you don't understand.'

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
Needs a reset on the, er...

Er...

156
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,680
And this ultimate Ferrari thoroughbred is so extreme,

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,040
you can't drive it on the road,

158
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
and it doesn't qualify for any existing race series.

ENGINES ECHO

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,520
So, as a car, the FXXK doesn't really make sense.

161
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,240
But it's not meant to.

162
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,960
It's not really a car.

163
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,200
What it is is a ticket...

164
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
to the most exclusive private members club on the planet.

165
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,120
And this club has one final members-only benefit.

166
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,200
You see, up to now, the car has been holding back,

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,920
saving power to make sure its batteries never run flat.

168
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,280
But the FXXK has something called Qualify Mode,

169
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,600
and that gives you all the petrol power

170
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,800
and all the electric power in one massive hit.

171
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,080
Maximum attack for one lap only. And, well...

172
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,320
since I've only got one lap left, well...

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,840
you can't take it with you.

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,880
1,050 horsepower!

175
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
What a car! What a day!

176
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,080
Drink it up. Drink it up, it's the last lap.

177
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,200
Unbelievable. I'll never get to do that again.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
I'm staggered I've had a chance to do it in the first place.

179
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,200
When the world's electric...

180
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,600
..I think I'll remember this day more than every other.

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,880
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

182
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,200
- Ooh.
- Well, I didn't crash.
- No, you didn't. No, what an incredible car.

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
And I've got to be honest, you drove the ass off it.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
One tiny point though, and I don't mean to be picky,

185
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,000
- but you know this whole exclusive club thing?
- Mm-hm.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,480
OK, so what you're saying is,

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,920
if you're a very, very special friend of Ferrari,

188
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,280
you might just be lucky enough to receive an invitation

189
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,600
- to give them £2 million.
- Correct.

190
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
And in return, you get a car that, yeah,

191
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,760
is very fast and very pretty, but it's essentially useless, right?

192
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,680
I mean, you can't drive it on the road,

193
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,560
you can't enter it in any race series,

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,120
you need a team of mechanics to keep it running...

195
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,360
Also correct.

196
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,160
That's good business.

197
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
LAUGHTER

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
It is if you're Ferrari.

199
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,520
Now, this is the point we usually hand the car over to Stig

200
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,200
to thrash around our test track, but today, we can't.

201
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,760
It's just too cold out there.

202
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,560
The FXXK is on racing slicks and it just won't get hot enough to work.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,600
We're sorry.

204
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
But we'll try to coax it back again for a lap later in the series

205
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,000
- when the weather warms up a bit. 
- Yes, we will. Rory.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
What a car.

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,960
And the high horsepower thrills don't end there,

208
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,120
because later this series, and I can't believe I got to do this,

209
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
but I drive the new Renault Twingo.

210
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
- Oh, yes.
- Wahey!
- Oh, yes.
- Ho, ho! APPLAUSE

211
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,600
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

212
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,280
OK. Now it is time to introduce this week's studio guest.

213
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,480
He's the star of Atonement, X-Men and Split.

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,880
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome James McAvoy.

215
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,080
WHISTLING

217
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,320
Welcome, welcome.

218
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,560
Now, James, I know you didn't get a chauffeur to drop you down today.

219
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,120
- You drove yourself, right? 
- I did, yes.
- OK, what did you drive?

220
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,960
- I drove my RS3.
- Nice, little pocket rocket.
- Little ninja, yeah.

221
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,720
- 300 plus horsepower there. 
- Uh, if you say so.

222
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
Yeah, I just know it goes fast, man. It goes fast.

223
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,920
So you have a driver's licence now,

224
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,520
but didn't you drive for years without one?

225
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,400
This is the weird thing. I played a car thief in Shameless

226
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,200
and I had to drive many beautiful cars

227
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,760
and nobody ever asked me if I had a driver's licence,

228
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,280
so I didn't, I didn't offer it up.

229
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,520
- I didn't get a driver's licence until six years later.
- Hang on.

230
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,640
You're painting quite a picture for us.

231
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,880
Any other bad behaviour you want to come clean with?

232
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,760
I do actually have a clean driver's licence, but I did have a...

233
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,640
I had a provisional driver's licence just for riding a 125 scooter

234
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,200
before I grew up and got a big bike, and, erm...

235
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,360
I got 11 points on my provisional licence.

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,920
- LAUGHTER 
- Yeah.

237
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,720
The guy, the policeman that took me aside

238
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,240
was like, "I'm probably going to let you off with it",

239
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
and his partner was like shouting from the car going, "No way!

240
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,960
"He's going down! This is unbelievable!"

241
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,760
So, yeah, they put me in the back of the car

242
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,320
and made me feel like a drug dealer.

243
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,400
All right, now, you didn't just come down here to enjoy our company,

244
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,720
because, frankly, who would do that? No, no.

245
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,520
- You came here to drive fast around our track.
- Yes.

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,520
And the first thing that everyone here should know is that

247
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,480
the original Top Gear track is back!

248
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

249
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,200
And here's the other thing you need to know, we've got a new car.

250
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,440
And after all those Lianas and Lacettis and Cee'ds...

251
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,880
- I'm still a big fan of the Cee'd. 
- That's cos you were quick in it.

252
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,040
We decided it was high time for something a bit more exciting,

253
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,760
something rear-wheel drive, something fast.

254
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,240
That's right, but not too fast,

255
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,280
cos we're talking about celebrities here,

256
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,520
not responsible adults.

257
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,840
Which meant there was only one car for the job,

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,640
and I mean literally only one car.

259
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,840
Introducing our new reasonably fast car,

260
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,960
it's the Toyota GT86.

261
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

262
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,040
Drive it well and it's so much fun, but get it wrong and you will spin.

263
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,680
- I guarantee it.
- Yeah, so do I. From experience I can guarantee it.

264
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,400
Right, so, obviously we're not going to send you out there

265
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,760
without a little bit of instruction, so...

266
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,640
Do you remember at school that one teacher

267
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,520
who really inspired you, nurtured you, believed in you?

268
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,240
Well, our instructor is exactly the opposite of that.

269
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,800
He's mad, he's tiny, his head is very shiny, it's Chris Harris.

270
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

271
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,760
Welcome to the Toyota GT86.

272
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
Your performance reflects on me.

273
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,440
- All right, mate. 
- So you've got to listen.
- What?
- OK?

274
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,400
Aim for the 50 metre board.

275
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,760
Don't try and be funny. Fourth gear.

276
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,320
When I say "brake", brake. Brake!

277
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,080
CAR SCREECHES

278
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,440
- Listen! Listen, James.
- I am.

279
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,560
Over that way. Do what you're told.

280
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,240
My hand's over there. Look, third gear. Third gear.

281
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,080
- Third gear, that's second, you... 
- BLEEP

282
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,520
- Third! Third! 
- CAR SCREECHES

283
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,600
Argh!

284
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,760
Aw!

285
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,040
- OK.
- Whoo!

286
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,440
You have to listen to the next bit,

287
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,600
otherwise we both end up being looked for through dental records.

288
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,120
Fourth gear. Fourth gear.

289
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,400
CAR SCREECHES

290
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,240
JAMES LAUGHS

291
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,040
Yes!

292
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,720
I wish they'd given me someone talented for this first episode,

293
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,480
cos it would look so good for my coaching skills.

294
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,800
Oh, my lord.

295
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,480
And over the line.

296
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
And stop.

297
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,280
And never...

298
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,320
- BLEEP 
- ..do that to me again.

299
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,800
- You loved it.
- Jesus Christ. 
- You loved it.

300
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,000
APPLAUSE

301
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,920
MATT LAUGHS

302
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, very nice, very nice.

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm beginning to see why that career as a hostage negotiator

304
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,640
never worked out for you.

305
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
OK, seriously, Harris, that is no way to speak to our guest.

306
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Absolutely not.

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,400
Do you know what? I kind of liked it.

308
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,920
I like to be treated rough sometimes.

309
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,080
- That's just... 
- LAUGHTER

310
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,920
Well, anyway, we are looking forward to seeing your timed lap

311
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,720
a little bit later. But first, here's a question...

312
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,840
£150,000, something fun for the summer, what do you buy?

313
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,480
- Er, GT3 RS.
- OK, Rory?

314
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,760
- McLaren 570?
- Mm-hm.

315
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
Yellow Ford Capri with black stripes on it.

316
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
LAUGHTER OK.

317
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
- OK, all good.
- Thanks. 
- All good. All wrong.

318
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,080
Because the most fun you can have for £150,000 is one of these.

319
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,040
GENTLE LAUGHTER

320
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,040
- That's a Hobbit caravan. 
- No. No, that's a pressure washer.

321
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,360
So it's a pressure washer for £150,000 Sterling.

322
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
What are you going to wash with that?

323
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm going to wash a melon, a shed and a Volvo. Check this out.

324
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,920
This is the Karcher Ecomaster mark three.

325
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,760
It runs at about 2,800 bar of pressure.

326
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,080
That's...about 40,611 PSI.

327
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,800
Roughly. Exactly.

328
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,880
This cleans stuff really well.

329
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,160
Watch this.

330
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,880
There you have it!

331
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,440
Clean!

332
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,040
Clean as a whistle!

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

334
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,160
Am I right? That's good. That thing's great.

335
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,800
- Your handwriting is appalling. 
- LAUGHTER

336
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,360
Don't pretend you're not jealous.

337
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,480
Right, I need to vent about something.

338
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,680
The other night I was watching Ronin, OK?

339
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,480
- Ronin, that film that came out, what? 20 years ago?
- Yeah.

340
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,120
- Always up-to-date.
- Stop that. Look,

341
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,040
one of the best on-screen car chases of all time. Agreed?

342
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,680
- FROM AUDIENCE:
- Yes. 
- OK.

343
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,040
But I've spotted something that's troubling me, vexing me.

344
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,080
Have a look at this.

345
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,960
- GUNSHOT 
- Wait there! There!

346
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,600
- How annoying is that? Did you see that?
- What?
- See what?

347
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,840
- You saw that.
- What?!
- There.

348
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,920
BMW E34 M5 1990, turbine design wheel,

349
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,360
cool for brake distance, that kind of thing.

350
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
Cut to... That's not an M5 wheel.

351
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,440
- LAUGHTER 
- That's the...

352
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,400
That's from a 535i. It's a continuity nightmare.

353
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,640
How long are you planning on being a virgin?

354
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,880
LAUGHTER

355
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,240
APPLAUSE

356
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,000
I could help you out.

357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,800
Look, you work in film, you saw that, that's a nightmare.

358
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,640
- Yeah, right?
- This has been bothering me... Can I do one more?
- Go ahead.

359
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,040
..bothering me since 1987. Withnail And I. Great film?

360
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,200
- A wonderful film.
- You must know it line by line.
- Yeah... Go on, then.

361
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,440
Continuity nightmare.

362
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Watch this.

363
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,240
Withnail, car.

364
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,600
There!

365
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,920
- Where? What?
- You saw it.

366
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,520
- Saw what?
- You saw it!

367
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,360
Withnail is set in 1969, OK?

368
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,840
It's the end of the '60s, it's apocalyptic.

369
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,600
Right in the background is a Volvo 340 DL, launched in...

370
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,840
1976! Even worse, the red smudge behind it,

371
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,600
Nissan Sunny, 1981.

372
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
- LAUGHTER 
- It's terrible.

373
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,520
Imagine, OK, Gladiator, Russell Crowe struts in,

374
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
"I'm the father of someone... got murdered,

375
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,080
"I'm generally fed up with life," toga, look down below.

376
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,120
- Air Jordans. 
- LAUGHTER

377
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,320
You're not going to suffer that. It's not good.

378
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,000
It is literally,

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,080
literally...nothing like that. OK?

380
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,040
In fairness, though, I do hate film mistakes.

381
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,720
- You know Mad Max Fury Road?
- Yeah.

382
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,680
OK, if you look really close, really, really closely,

383
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,360
don't blink, you'll miss it,

384
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,240
you'll see that they cast Tom Hardy instead of me.

385
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,880
LAUGHTER

386
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,360
Look real close. You can see it.

387
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,280
Anyway, moving on, a couple of months back the producers

388
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,080
told us to tackle a serious consumer question.

389
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
Specifically this one...

390
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,440
What is the most reliable new car on sale today?

391
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
And we said, "Well, that's a stupid question.

392
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,280
"New cars can't be reliable. They're new.

393
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,720
"You have to earn reliability over lots and lots of miles."

394
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,560
If a car's driven to, say, the moon and back, and it's still going,

395
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,040
now that's proof of reliability.

396
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,000
That's right, so our producer said, "All right, you're on."

397
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,640
They told us each to go buy a car

398
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,760
that HAD driven to the moon and back.

399
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,680
Well, the Earth equivalent.

400
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,560
480,000 miles on the clock. So we did.

401
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,520
And they shipped them off for a series of reliability challenges

402
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,280
in the middle of nowhere.

403
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,800
A little place called Kazakhstan.

404
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
So...

405
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,880
Kazakhstan.

406
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Shall we go and find our cars?

407
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,560
- Three containers, gentlemen. 
- Who wants to go first?

408
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,080
- Can I go first?
- Go for it.

409
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,920
You're going to love it.

410
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,560
What do you think he's got?

411
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,360
Some kind of mental issue.

412
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,040
RORY LAUGHS

413
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,000
- It's definitely a sports car, no? 
- Yeah, it's got to be.

414
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,520
- A high mileage Ferrari, perhaps? 
- Maserati.

415
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,400
- High mileage Maserati?
- Yeah.

416
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
Which is, you know, a horrible idea.

417
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,320
- 'But Chris surprised us both.' Oh!
- That's not Italian.

418
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,960
That's not Italian at all. RORY LAUGHS

419
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,760
A Volvo?

420
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,000
The Volvo V70.

421
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,240
You want reliability, you go to Sweden, gentlemen. You know that.

422
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,960
She's a minter.

423
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,200
I don't want to patronise you, but you know that in the Arctic Circle

424
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
a reliable car is the difference between life and death.

425
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,760
But you're not playing a housewife in this film. That's the thing.

426
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,480
Look, I know, it's not going to set any pulses racing,

427
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,160
but V70s in this generation are very, very strong.

428
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,760
Manual gearbox for a bit of fun, and there's a button in there

429
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,240
that's for heated seats,

430
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,880
and I wonder whether either of you two have that function.

431
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,440
- Shall we see your car, Matt? 
- THEY LAUGH

432
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,280
That's really sad, mate.

433
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Forget Sweden.

434
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,360
You want reliability?

435
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,560
- CHRIS LAUGHS 
- He's got it!

436
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,800
THEY LAUGH

437
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,880
- Right, here we go.
- He's got a Merc.

438
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,480
Now, he thinks he's just bought into the ultimate brand

439
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,920
- of reliability, but little does he know.
- Come on now.

440
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
- Huh?
- Explain yourself.

441
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Mercedes, the symbol,

442
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,600
the quintessential symbol of quality, right?

443
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,120
You go anywhere in the world,

444
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,720
you see these E-Classes just rattling along,

445
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,040
clicking off the miles, reliability, reliability, reliability.

446
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,640
Do you understand the significance of the colour?

447
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,480
It's like a beige, kind of like a granny's living room colour.

448
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,000
- You know why it's that colour? 
- I don't know.

449
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,080
That was a taxi cab, that was a German taxi cab,

450
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,240
- probably from the Berlin area.
- What?

451
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,200
So that's had the hardest life imaginable.

452
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,320
While Matt came to terms with his new taxi...

453
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,160
- But it's still an E-Class. 
- ..I went to fetch...mine.

454
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,960
MUSIC: London Calling by the Clash

455
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,600
Oh, my God.

456
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,280
MATT LAUGHS

457
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,960
What were you thinking?

458
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't know what to say.

459
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,360
CHRIS WHEEZES AND LAUGHS

460
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,800
Look, you want to talk reliability?

461
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
This has got to be in the conversation, OK?

462
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,480
London taxi, utterly bombproof.

463
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,840
Come the apocalypse, there will only be cockroaches and London cabs.

464
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,720
I don't know where to begin, Rory.

465
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,040
Look, first of all,

466
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,520
these vehicles are designed to cover very short distances.

467
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,920
Maybe 40, 50 miles at a stretch.

468
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,080
Beyond that, they are purgatory.

469
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,120
Well, that's neither here nor there.

470
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,280
Also, people visit London to come and see the London black cab.

471
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
No, they don't.

472
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,160
They get in that piece of crap to go see something else.

473
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,520
Tell me the best thing about this car.

474
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,960
The best thing about this car, turning circle, 7.62 metres.

475
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,400
I can run rings around your cars.

476
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,000
Right.

477
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,960
But before he could get in and show us, a man appeared in an old Lada.

478
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,680
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

479
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
Wheel bearing's gone.

480
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,760
"You and your high-milers will now undertake

481
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,040
"a series of reliability challenges as you cross Kazakhstan

482
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,240
"to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

483
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,360
"which is home to the Soviet Union's space programme.

484
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,080
"There's a rocket launch in two days. Be there."

485
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,800
- We're going to a rocket launch? 
- No, no, no.

486
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,520
Those of us that have a car that's going to make it to a rocket launch

487
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,960
are going to a rocket launch.

488
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,360
You two are going to die on the Steppe.

489
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,080
Why do you have to be like that?

490
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,840
Yes, ahead of us lay the Steppe,

491
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,840
a vast desert of unforgiving terrain and extreme temperatures,

492
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,360
certain to test our high-miler's reliability.

493
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,680
The journey would lead us to the Baikonur Cosmodrome,

494
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,040
the world's largest, oldest space launch facility.

495
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,240
And the home of the Russian space programme.

496
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,640
Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin,

497
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,880
even the first piece of the International Space Station,

498
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,400
all were launched from this 3,000 square mile

499
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,120
Russian-controlled facility...

500
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,120
..but with only two days to get there,

501
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,840
we had a lot of ground to cover.

502
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,520
I was just thinking, you see a car with 100,000 miles on it,

503
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,360
you think, right, time to get a new one, that's pretty much worn out.

504
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,480
That's not what we've done, we've gone for cars

505
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,040
that have 500,000 miles on them, and mine runs fine.

506
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,800
- How does yours run? 
- My cab hasn't aged a bit.

507
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,040
- What did you say? It was a piece of
- BLEEP?

RORY LAUGHS

509
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,680
This taxi is a bit of a shed.

510
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,480
I've just discovered that my heating doesn't work -

511
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,440
and that's a bad thing, because in Kazakhstan

512
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,000
it's currently minus 12 degrees outside.

513
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,080
First impressions, very impressive.

514
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,560
Doesn't really rattle or shake, it's remarkable.

515
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,800
Let's face it, Volvos are so reliable.

516
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,320
If this thing does break down,

517
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,120
there'd probably be a national day of mourning in Sweden.

518
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,080
Guys, I don't have any heating whatsoever in my cab.

519
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,600
The sun's out, Rory. Think positive, think warm.

520
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,640
I'm going to die of pneumonia, man!

521
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080

'and the bustle quickly dwindled.'

524
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,880
Look at it, it's just acres and acres of nothing.

525
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,600
It's like...Stoke!

526
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
'And, as the road turned to dirt,

527
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,080
'we got the feeling this might not be the way to Baikonur after all.'

528
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,240
Why are we doing this? Can't we find another road?

529

'But then...'

530
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,000
Look at that.

531
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,840
- That is huge.
- Thanks, Chris.

532
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,760
'We had stumbled across our first opportunity

535
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,720
I think I am thinking what you're thinking.

536
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,800

Three, two, one...go.

544
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,680
Oh, that's hopeless. I've just been overtaken by a bloody London taxi!

Oh, he's gaining.

Come on, baby, come on, hold it together.

OK, we're coming around the loop. Ah, the turning circle coming in.

Slow up the hill. I got him, I got him.

577
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,600
LOUD CRASH

Come on! Yes!

582

Ha-ha!

583
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,440
Not quite the end I'd expected.

584
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,960
HE LAUGHS

585
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,760
- Well, what happened? 
- What do you mean, what happened?

586
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,600
- You weren't moving.
- I lost drive.

587
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,840
Coming up the hill, the transmission kind of let go.

588
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,520
I'll tell you what happened.

589
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,080
- I just won the race in the black cab!
- Honestly, I'm disappointed.

590
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,240
I was coming past you, and you were stationary.

591
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,760
- You weren't coming past me.
- I was. I was pushing you up the hill.

592
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,440
No, I was putting the moves on you, I was blocking you.

593
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,520
So you reckon you were not being pushed up the hill?

594
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,240
I was defensive driving the hell out of you.

595
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,520
- You weren't aware you were being pushed up the hill?
- Yeah,

596
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,480
- but that was enough to stay ahead! 
- CHRIS LAUGHS

597
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,840
You would have pushed me over the finish line!

598
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,680
I'm feeling slightly guilty.

599
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,200
This car has lived for 13 years and 570,000 miles.

600
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,680
And I've had it 42 miles.

601
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,440
42 miles!

602
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,960
The last one was probably the most special.

603
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,760
- Meanwhile...
- Yeah. 
- ..pristine, good as new.

604
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,360
I can change that quite quickly for you.

605
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,080
THEY CHUCKLE

606
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,800
'Our quarry race had taken its toll -

607
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,360
'but, after a few hours, we were back on the road.'

608
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,480
Your Volvo looks like the Terminator near the end of the film.

609
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,000
I removed a quarter of the front of the car

610
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,400
and the warning system simply tells me, "Bulb failure, dipped beam".

611
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,920
That's how tough this car is. That's Nordic strength.

612
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And also, the airbox has been a bit squashed

613
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,960
which means it now sounds like a full-house Audi Quattro.

614
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,040
So, actually, I've improved the car.

Ba-a-ah!

619
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,720
'At last, we were on the road to Baikonur

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,760
It's basically the size of Western Europe.

627
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,600
Is it really?

628
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,520
On a smaller scale, this country was the origin of the apple tree,

629
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,680
so the apple was invented here.

630
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,240
Was it really?

631
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,120
The Kazakhs were also the first people to domesticate the horse,

632
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,520
the humble horse.

690

RORY GUFFAWS

691
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,720
'With one increasingly battered Volvo left in the running,

692
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,880
'it should have been easy pickings for the two remaining Ladas,

693
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,440
'but Harris doesn't give up easily.'

694
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
I'm on the blue Lada now.

695
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,160
Come on, Harris, get him, get him, get him, get him, get him!

696
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm going to tap him, I'm going to tap him.

697
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
CHEERING

698
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,160
A bit harsh, but there we go. He needed to know I was there!

699
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,400
Right, come on. This is the endgame.

700
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,160
He's chasing down the last Lada right now. I think he might do it.

701
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
I can't actually see anything. Where is he?

702
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,920
Ooh, there he is. Nudge.

703
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,520
He's got him!

704
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,600
CHEERING

CHRIS LAUGHS

706
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,680
Victory.

707
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,440
Finally, the Volvo gets something.

708
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,440
Way to go, Harris, all right!

709
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,560
Why is he always finishing races with his bonnet up?

710
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,440
Oh, I... It's an aero device, gives me a bit of extra front downforce.

711
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,480
RORY LAUGHS

712
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,920
A couple more screws in the bonnet this time, I think.

713
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,400
Yeah, I think so. We'll get there. We'll get the old girl to Baikonur.

714
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,640
I want to see a rocket go off.

715
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,120
To Baikonur!

716
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,040
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

717
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,760
You know, honestly, before that trip,

718
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,360
I had no idea that Kazakhstan was real.

719
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,480
I thought it was one of those made-up places

720
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,440
like Timbuktu or Guernsey.

721
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,800
GENTLE LAUGHTER

722
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
Those are both real places.

723
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,880
I know. GENTLE LAUGHTER

724
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,120
OK, James, to recap what happened there

725
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
for everyone's benefit and yours is that

726
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,320
the taxi won the race around the quarry. All right!

727
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,440
CHEERING

728
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,280
- Yeah, yeah?
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance!

729
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,360
I won the race around the goat sacrifice temple.

730
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,120
Yeah, and Matt's Mercedes...

731
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,320
No, no, no, don't, don't do it. Don't bad-mouth the Mercedes.

732
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,160
Don't do it, because we're in the presence

733
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,800
of another lover of classic Merc, right?

734
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,680
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- Am I right? Now, is it true

735
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,080
that you once owned Idi Amin's Mercedes SL?

736
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,040
- JAMES LAUGHS 
- Erm...

737
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,120
I was in a movie called The Last King Of Scotland,

738
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,280
and at the end of that movie, they gave me this car that I drove in,

739
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
which I didn't know at the time

740
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,760
but it had belonged to somebody

741
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,160
and Idi Amin had given it to that person.

742
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,120
So they said at the end of the movie I could have it.

743
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,240
But, again, I didn't have a driver's licence

744
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,360
and I didn't really fancy driving it back from Uganda.

745
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,440
So I left it. I just left it there.

746
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,960
I think they gave it to my driver, he was a nice guy called Fred.

747
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,360
Nice. Way to go, Fred.

748
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,160
Right, now, it's time to find out how you went around the track

749
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,800
in our new reasonably fast car. Come on. How did it go out there?

750
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,440
Well, I don't think it went that well. But it was a tonne of fun.

751
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,320
- Well, what do you think? Let's see how you did.
- OK.

752
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,960
'So, here we go, then. Soaking wet track for James.

753
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,080
'Off the line. Traction control on.'

754
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,000
Big balls. Big, big balls, that's all you need.

755
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,880
'I don't disagree with you. Coming up towards the first corner.'

756
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,440
Wetter than a waterfall in a monsoon.

757
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
'This braking's going to be tough.

758
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,800
'There's a direction change and also a surface change.

759
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,880
'The grip levels there are terrible.

760
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,960
'Best to stay on the track, I find, there!'

761
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,560
Shut it!

762
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,160
'Blending left, turning right into Chicago.

763
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,200
'The inside line is off the frame at the moment so,

764
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,120
'actually, there's grip around the outside.'

765
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,400
Come on!

766
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,120
'Now, this is the long drag toward Hammerhead.

767
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
'Big braking has triggered the warning lights,

768
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,960
'you were braking so hard, that must be good.

769
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,560
'The car's going to oversteer a bit, is it? Yeah, there it goes.'

770
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,600
Whoo!

771
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,680
'I'd like to say you caught that. It wasn't, the electronics caught it.

772
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,000
'And again! That was a mid-gear change slide.

773
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,640
'That's just showing off!

774
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,200
'Now we've got this fast right here, down towards the follow-through.'

775

TYRES SCREECH

776
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,440
Yeah! Whoo!

777
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,360
'You think you're saving that, you're not. The computer's doing it.

778
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,520
'Through the follow-through. That looks terrifying.

779
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,760
- 'Oh, my Lord. It looks...' 
- JAMES LAUGHS

780
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,480
'You're like a sort of Scottish Ari Vatanen, aren't you?

781
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,560
'Now, coming hard into second to last, does he make the apex?

782
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,960
'He does. He clips it.'

783
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,200
- That's so slippery, isn't it? 
- Yeah, it's horrible.

784
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,560
'Through Gambon. Nowhere near the racing line.

785
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,800
'And over the line.'

786
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,200
- APPLAUSE 
- Thank you.
- Good effort.

787
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,760
Honestly...

788
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,040
Can I just say, before we go anywhere,

789
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,080
it was so slippery out there today.

790
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,680
- It really was treacherous.
- Yes.

791
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,320
- But it was a lot of fun because it was.
- It was a good run.

792
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,800
OK, new car means a new lap board.

793
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,920
We've already had a test day where we sent a bunch of celebs

794
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,040
out in the GT 86 to lay down some markers.

795
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,880
You can watch how they did over on Extra Gear.

796
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,640
But the fastest time so far is one minute 39.5

797
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,560
from Olympic double gold-winning gymnast Max Whitlock.

798
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,440
Oh, I loved his pommel routine, did you ever see that?

799
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,120
GENTLE LAUGHTER Elegant... Anyway, all right.

800
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,920
James, and Chris, because, frankly, this is your fault

801
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,440
if he doesn't go straight to the top, you were his instructor. Right.

802
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,520
- Feeling confident? 
- Mm, not really. A little bit...

803
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,120
- Come on!
- Go on, show me.

804
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,840
All right. You did it in the wet, so it's a wet time.

805
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:33,200
- One minute...47.1.
- Yes...yes..

806
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,080
- Oh! That's not bad. That's not bad. 
- APPLAUSE

807
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,440
That's not bad.

808
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,960
- Thank you. That's not bad. 
- That's awesome. Not bad at all.

809
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,120
Right underneath Ore Oduba there.

810
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,120
- A fine effort.
- Congratulations. 
- I'm the only one in the wet.

811
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,840
That's good. That is good.

812
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,080
Only one in the wet.

813
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
I think you guys will have a lot of fun this season

814
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,480
with the celebrities in that car

815
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,840
because you just can't control it

816
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,640
like you could that Cee'd that we both drove.

817
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,920
- When you say "fun", do you mean death?
- Yeah!

818
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,960
LAUGHTER

819
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,880
All right, James, thank you so much for coming down and playing with us.

820
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,160
Ladies and gentlemen, James McAvoy!

821
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,600
- APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING 
- Thank you!

822
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,200
Now, time to return to our high-mile challenge.

823
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,760
Earlier on, the three of us each had bought a car

824
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,880
that had driven to the moon and back.

825
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,440
And we were crossing Kazakhstan

826
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,520
for an appointment with the big rocket.

827
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,720
We awoke to the chill of another morning in Kazakhstan.

828
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,040
And Chris noticed that overnight I had been busy.

829
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,720
Matt, what's going on with the back of your car?

830
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,040
Was it abducted last night by a band of amateur scaffolding people?

831
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,160
You know that the little thing you gave me

832
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,840
that lifted the ascent of the car up about four feet?

833
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,120
Well, that's me being cautious

834
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,840
and just trying to preserve the rear end of this Mercedes.

835
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,520
Despite the previous day's trials, all three of our high-milers

836
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,480
were still in the hunt for Baikonur.

837
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,680
But since we had the place to ourselves,

838
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,760
Rory had an idea to see whose car was holding together best.

839
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,520
How about a top speed challenge?

840
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,600
But here's the twist - this is all about reliability.

841
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,960
So I think we should find out whose car gets closest

842
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,880
to their manufacturer's claimed top speed.

843
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,520
- That sounds good. 
- Chris, you're up first.

844
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,960
And the Volvo's top speed?

845
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,440
125mph.

846
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,880
Three, two, one, go for it!

847
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,280
WHEELS SPIN

848
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,960
ENGINE ROARS

849
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,600
- It's pretty aggressive.
- Yeah.

850
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,280
That's the half a million mile clutch he's working with.

851
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,600
THEY CHUCKLE

852
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,480
Come on, Volvo!

853
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,040
Fourth, come on.

854
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,520
That's 90.

855
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,680
If Volvos are as reliable as he says they are, this should be no problem.

856
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,240
I'm not even 100.

857
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,280
Not even 100, come on!

858
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,000
- How are the kids?
- Good. Yours? 
- Yeah, not too bad.

859
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,960
- All right.
- Right.

860
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,520
- How did we do?
- I blame you for what just happened there.

861
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,480
I've got terrible aero and no power cos my airbox has moved

862
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,280
because you stopped your vehicle on the first challenge, and I hit you.

863
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,800
- That's my fault? 
- Yeah, that's your fault.

864
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,240
- Who hit who?
- Who stopped? 
- Who hit who?
- Who stopped?

865
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,000
- Who hit who?
- I couldn't have hit the thing if it hadn't stopped.

866
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,080
If there's a policeman standing there, you'd be in trouble.

867
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,120
Do they have policeman at race circuits?

868
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,200
It wasn't a race circuit, we were in a hole in the ground.

869
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,000
THEY ALL LAUGH

870
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,480
Look, the news is, 104mph,

871
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,720
which is not good enough cos this thing should do 124, 125.

872
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,840
So I'm 20mph back. So go and do your worst, I'm going to lose.

873
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,320
Next up, my European E-Class,

874
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,840
with its 180 kilometres per hour top speed.

875
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,160
Go!

876
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,600
There's 100.

877
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,680
There's 120.

878
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,600
- Did they really invent apples in Kazakhstan?
- Yeah, apparently.

879
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,880
I just think, if they invented the apple,

880
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,480
then we should try an actual Kazakhstani apple.

881
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,840
I'd love to have an apple.

882
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,320
155.

883
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,040
Russet's that sort of thick-skinned, amber-coloured apple,

884
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
delicious things. The juice from them makes a very good drink.

885
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,240
- Come on, then, what's the number? 
- Take a guess.

886
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,880
160.

887
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,080
- Wow, on the money.
- 160? 
- 160, that's about 100 miles an hour.

888
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:39,240
So, by getting within about 12mph of my top speed, I had edged Chris.

889
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,880
But I'd left the door open for Rory's 81mph taxi.

890
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,600
Go!

891
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,520
- Come on, black can. 
- Takes off like a shot.

892
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,040
40.

893
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,200
45.

894
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,120
He was hardly the figure of humility when he won last time,

895
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,960
what's he going to be like this time?

896
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,000
81mph.

897
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,040
Ahhh! Yeah!

898
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,080
Unbearable.

899
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,360
RORY LAUGHS

900
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,560
It just gets better with time.

901
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,520
Like a fine wine.

902
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,560
Right, gentlemen.

903
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,840
Give me the good news or the bad news.

904
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,320
Well, I'm afraid it's bad news for you, but good news for me.

905
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,080
I managed 84mph.

906
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,320
3mph more than the manufacturer's quoted top speed.

907
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,280
- What?
- 84mph.
- Really?

908
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,800
- Hey, come on, you got to give it up for the taxi, right?
- Yeah.

909
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,960
- I guess so, yeah.
- Jump back in your cars, see if you can keep up.

910
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,520
Nice one...

911
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,880
(A-hole.)

912
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,240
I didn't expect the taxi to go faster than it did

913
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,320
when it left the factory.

914
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,760
That's amazing.

915
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,400
With begrudging respect for the black cab, we headed on.

916
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,360
And before long, I made a discovery.

917
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,560
Hey, there's a David Hasselhoff cassette in the stereo.

918
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,920
Check it out.

919
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,120
# I've been looking for freedom

920
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,320
# But it can't be found... #

921
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,360
He's been looking for freedom, but it can't be found.

922
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,720
But as the hours dragged on...

923
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,600
I'm finding the flatness quite imposing now.

924
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,080
You wouldn't want to break down out here, would you?

925
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,880
..we were told to head to our last overnight stop...

926
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,040
So that's it, that's quite literally the end of the road.

927
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,800
..located somewhere within the vast emptiness

928
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,560
that surrounded the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

929
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,720
That's a dried up salt bed.

930
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,200
Wow!

931
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,760
That's like Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

932
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,120
Driving on into the dark, inky gloom,

933
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,040
eventually we arrived at our overnight stop

934
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,840
where our final challenge awaited.

935
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,960
- Oh, hello.
- What does it say?

936
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,200
It says, "Tomorrow you drive to Baikonur.

937
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,240
"You must reach the border gate by 2pm.

938
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,040
"At 9am tomorrow, your mileage trips will be reset.

939
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,920
"The winner is the high-miler that racks up the most miles

940
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,240
"over the subsequent five hours.

941
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,560
"Only the winning car will attend the launch.

942
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,760
"The two losing cars will be sentenced to hard labour."

943
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,160
All right, OK.

944
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,200
# I'm looking for freedom... #

945
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,440
You know what I'm going to do when I get home?

946
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,520
I'm going to dig out my Hoff collection.

947
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,960
You should go to a doctor.

948
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,400
With the rest of the night to consider our strategies...

949
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,080
..the next morning, we awoke to a tantalising sight.

950
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,760
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, yeah, look at that!

951
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,440
Yes, the Baikonur Cosmodrome was almost within reach.

952
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,440
But with our trip meters covered and reset,

953
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,400
first there was a challenge to win.

954
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,200
And Chris was late.

955
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,520
LAUGHTER

956
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,040
What have you done?

957
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,280
Mind your own business, Matthew.

958
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,440
All right, all right. Most miles when we get to Baikonur wins.

959
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,720
Three...two...

960
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
one, let's rock.

961
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,280
If he's going to roar it, why's he not moving?

962
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,520
I don't know, and maybe the taxi finally packed it in.

963
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,080
So, clearly I'm not going to beat those guys in a head-to-head race.

964
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,520
I need to be smart about this challenge,

965
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,760
and approach things with a bit more cunning.

966
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,160
A cagey start from the others,

967
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,040
but my plan was simple -

968
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,240
more speed means more miles.

969
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,480
The easy way to make your car quicker is to lose weight.

970
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,960
Seats are gone,

971
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,680
door panels gone.

972
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,520
And I figured the best place to take my new superlight racer

973
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,000
was back to Kazakhstan's Bonneville.

974
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,160
Even if that did mean...

975
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,840
another lengthy, off-road drive to reach it.

976
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,760
Meanwhile, in Harris's Volvo...

977
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,880
Ha-ha, a road!

978
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,160
..Chris was heading for a nearby town

979
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,720
with his own harebrained strategy.

980
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,520
Speed is in the mind, so to change my mind-set,

981
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,240
I've invoked Volvo's racing history here.

982
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,560
You remember?

983
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,680
The year was 1994 and British touring car legend

984
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,000
Rickard Rydell debuted the Volvo 850 Estate.

985
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,480
Surely the coolest estate car ever.

986
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,920
Add to that a...perfectly safe range-extending fuel tank

987
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,600
and you have the ultimate high-mileage maker.

988
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,320
I just needed somewhere to use it.

989
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,200
So, I did a bit of research last night.

990
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,960
There is an airfield near here, I don't quite know where,

991
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,680
but I know it's nearby.

992
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,440
The second thing I did last night was to learn a Russian phrase.

993
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,120
"Where's the airfield?"

994
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,080
Here we are, I'll ask this woman here.

995
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,440
SPEAKS RUSSIAN

996
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,720
No, she didn't want to know.

997
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,720
She didn't want to...

998
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,840
'Now, while the others wasted valuable time

999
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,480
'finding places they could up the pace...'

1000
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,960
Into gear.

1001
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,800
Now for some revs.

1002
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,200
'..I opted for a short cut.'

1003
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,080
Right, this is it.

1004
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,560
Let the high mileage begin.

1005
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,200
Woohoo!

1006
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,840
SPEAKS RUSSIAN

1007
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,640
No, that's not happening.

1008
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,800
Though I swear I heard one of them say, "Is that Rickard Rydell?"

1009
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,640
SPEAKS RUSSIAN

1010
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,040
That was it.

1011
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,120
We're on. This direction.

1012
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,840
Woohoo!

1013
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,440
Now, this is what I call easy miles.

1014
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,440
Nice and soft terrain, not too hard on the car.

1015
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,200
RUMBLING AND CLANKING

1016
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,920
What the hell was that?

1017
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,120
Something's come wildly loose,

1018
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,920
I don't know if it's that bar on the back or what.

1019
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,200
In fact, it was worse.

1020
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,000
And with no time to lose,

1021
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
the Mercedes needed the delicate touch of a professional.

1022
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,920
Saved a little more weight.

1023
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,840
After a slow start over in the Volvo...

1024
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,840
..Rickard Rydell had finally found his airfield.

1025
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,960
100 miles an hour.

1026
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,600
What a place!

1027
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,240
High banking at Daytona.

1028
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,880
I really like this car.

1029
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,520
She may be old, she may be almost worn out,

1030
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,040
but she's got heart, she really does.

1031
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,200
'After three hours of flat-out, lightweight racing though...'

1032
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,360
A fuel light just came on.

1033
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,560
'..it was time to start the long drive back.'

1034
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,560
OK, Baikonur!

1035
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,760
Now, Rory was also running low on fuel, but he had thought ahead.

1036
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,520
- Ouch!
- BLEEP!

1037
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,680
No!

1038
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,360
Oh, that is dead.

1039
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,680
That's dead, isn't it? That's definitely dead.

1040
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,880
Oh, man!

1041
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,160
Back in my range-extended Volvo, things were looking tasty.

1042
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,480
I'm averaging a lot of miles an hour here.

1043
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,280
A lot of miles an hour.

1044
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,440
And while I was piling on the miles, Matt...

1045
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,840
wasn't.

1046
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,440
All right, finally a little bit of smooth road.

1047
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,920
CLUNKING

1048
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,320
Oh, spoke too soon.

1049
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,000
But then, somehow...

1050
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,320
..the cab was back.

1051
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,800
How is this car still running? Unbelievable!

1052
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,920
I love this car.

1053
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,440
We're a team.

1054
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,720
Whatever happens, we're a team.

1055
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,080
'And at last...'

1056
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,960
This is it, this is it.

1057
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,960
'..this team reached the entrance to the Cosmodrome.'

1058
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,360
I'm the first one here,

1059
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,800
so I may as well do a few of my legendary tiny turning circles.

1060
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,120
Every mile counts. Every mile counts.

1061
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,360
And with just a few minutes left...

1062
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,680
Hey, there you are!

1063
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,480
..it was a desperate fight to add distance.

1064
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,160
I can add some miles too, man, two can play at that game.

1065
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,560
Where's Harris?

1066
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,240
- Oh,
- BLEEP!

1067
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,880
Rory, Rory, that's it. Two o'clock. Two o'clock, the party is over.

1068
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,480
How's your head? Dizzy?

1069
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,520
Dizzy.

1070
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,280
That is becoming his signature look.

1071
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,480
Maybe he can't see where he's going.

1072
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,000
- Gentlemen.
- How did you do?

1073
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,640
- Well, quietly confident, but let's see what happens.
- Who's this?

1074
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,120
He must be checking the mileage.

1075
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,440
He's got a lovely wrist action on that ratchet.

1076
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,680
- Thank you, thank you very much. 
- OK, Matt.

1077
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,320
OK, I have here the results.

1078
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,720
In third place, with 211 miles...

1079
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,360
Mr Chris Harris.

1080
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,600
- Oh!
- Congratulations.

1081
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,000
In second place, with 284 miles...

1082
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,800
- ..Mr Matt LeBlanc.
- Come on!

1083
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,680
- That's right.
- Say it, say it.

1084
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:16,400
In first place, with 329 miles, Mr Rory Reid in the black taxi.

1085
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,840
Way to go, man.

1086
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,520
Hang on, hang on, look at this.

1087
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,520
Oh, really? Is that what's happening?

1088
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,280
The losers lose their cars.

1089
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,080
'So we had our winner.

1090
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,520
'And as the others set off toward their new life of service

1091
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,320
'on the Kazakh Steppe...'

1092
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,920
I'd become rather fond of my Volvo, Matt.

1093
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,560
Yeah, I'm going to miss that old car.

1094
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,040
'The truth is, all our high-milers had proven their worth.

1095
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,600
'And now, all that remained were the last few miles

1096
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,880
'into the heart of the Cosmodrome and the launch site.

1097
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,720
'This would be the black cab's victory lap.'

1098
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,560
- Where you headed? 
- Rocket launch?
- Jump in.

1099
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,200
And it gave us a chance to consider something.

1100
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,800
You see, to most people, cars are just a tool, a runaround.

1101
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,480
You might run one for 60, 70,

1102
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,600
even 100,000 miles and think it's had its day.

1103
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,120
But the truth is, it could do so much more.'

1104
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,840
Back in the '50s, the US and Soviet Union's fierce battle

1105
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,320
for global engineering dominance propelled mankind into space.

1106
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,640
The Cold War thawed just for a moment

1107
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:43,080
as the world stood in collective wonder at what we could achieve.

1108
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,520
It was an event that marked one of the most intense periods

1109
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,520
of technological development in human history -

1110
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,200
and it brought us to today, where right now,

1111
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,080
sat on your driveway, you could have a car,

1112
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,280
a car, that's been so well engineered,

1113
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,040
it'll go the distance to the moon and back, and beyond.

1114
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,080
Wow!

1115
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,760
I still can't get that Hasselhoff song out of my head.

1116
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,920
THEY LAUGH

1117
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,160
APPLAUSE

1118
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,120
Amazing cars, indestructible. Indestructible.

1119
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,200
OK, so, Rory, we know why our cars aren't here,

1120
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,360
they're doing hard labour in Kazakhstan.

1121
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,160
But where's your little black cab,

1122
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,000
did you not want to drive it back the 3,000 miles from Baikonur?

1123
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,160
I'd have loved to have driven my taxi home,

1124
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,320
but it had a higher calling, a public duty.

1125
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,880
Check this out.

1126
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,080
See that?

1127
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,320
APPLAUSE

1128
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,480
That's been immortalised, OK? It's a symbol of hope.

1129
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,280
Yeah, you know, that was really nice.

1130
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,640
The good men and women of Baikonur,

1131
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,160
they can look up at your humble taxi,

1132
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,240
symbol of Britain, of London,

1133
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,960
and think, thank God I don't have to drive one of those.

1134
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,600
Don't hate a winner, Matt.

1135
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,080
- Don't do the dance, don't do the dance.
- No dancing.

1136
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,320
OK, next week, convertible supercars in the USA,

1137
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,920
the Alfa Romeo Giulia and one very broken windscreen.

1138
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,520
- Thanks for watching. 
- Yeah, we'll see you all next week.

1139
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,720
- ALL:
- Goodnight.
