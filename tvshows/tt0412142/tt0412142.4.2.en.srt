00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:11,568
Captain Cooper, are you okay?

10
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:13,200
What happened?
You weren't answering.

11
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:15,598
Because the damn comcord
got disconnected.

12
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,522
You spend a billion
dollars on the avionics

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,503
and don't bother to check
the comm connection?

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,120
I checked that twice before you got in.

15
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:23,614
And the next time you
ask us to test a prototype,

16
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:26,127
it'd be nice if your directional
gyro didn't spin like a top

17
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:28,185
when I'm supposed to be
500 feet off the floor.

18
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,293
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,985
I'll go review the simulation,
see if I can figure out what went wrong.

Who is this man?

24
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,335
Come on, take a shot.

25
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,403
I'm not gonna fire you every
time you get a wrong answer.

26
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,749
Neville Chamberlain.

27
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,892
You're fired.

28
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:29,085
Does this man look like he's ceding

29
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:31,716
Czechoslovakia to
a fascist dictatorship?

30
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,214
It's Buddy Ebsen,
the actor.

31
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:35,969
He's dead.

32
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,458
- Why are we...
- Buddy Ebsen

33
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:40,215
was the original tin man
in the wizard of oz,

34
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,312
for a day.

35
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,289
He was diagnosed allergic to the
aluminum dust in the makeup.

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,680
His lungs failed, nearly died.

37
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:47,991
Question is, why?

38
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,812
Didn't you just say he was allergic?

39
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:52,606
You may not have legs,
but you got ears.

40
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:55,846
I suggest you use them.
I said he was diagnosed allergic.

41
00:02:56,294 --> 00:03:00,249
Since we are currently short
exactly one interesting patient,

42
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,134
we are gonna figure out what really
happened to buddy ebsen in 1938.

43
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,354
Now, on the one hand,
he's not getting deader.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,758
On the other hand,
your jobs hang in the balance.

45
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,621
- So.
- House.

46
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:20,385
I want seven alternate
diagnoses when I get back.

47
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,245
Did you forget how to count to three?

48
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,519
I get budget for three.

49
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,019
Doesn't mean I can only hire three.

50
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:30,765
Actually, that's exactly what it means.

51
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:33,200
I cut the permanent salaries by 10%.

52
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:35,674
Over three years, that'll more
than make up for the breakage

53
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:38,052
on the 27 that I'm gonna weed
out over the next few weeks.

54
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,355
There's 40 people in there.

55
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,565
Row D, you're fired.

56
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:46,503
I didn't actually count all the resumes.

57
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:50,263
This is stupid.
You can't manage that many people.

58
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,480
You're just gonna keep
weeding them out arbitrarily.

59
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,470
Sure, and having them sitting
in my office schmoozing about

60
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:58,883
their favorite algerian surfing
movies is a much better system.

61
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,794
- Wait a sec, were you in Row D?
- Yes.

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,611
My apologies, my boss says
I'm being arbitrary and stupid.

63
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,575
Row D is not fired.
Row C is fired.

64
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,410
Great.
Thank you.

65
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:13,829
See,
that was not arbitrary.

66
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:17,426
Well, I'd love to chat,
but I've been paged.

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,334
That's interesting.
Apparently paged myself.

68
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,051
If you have a resume there,
not interested.

69
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,830
But I wouldn't mind hearing
how you got my pager number.

70
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:39,954
It's not a resume.

71
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,697
$50,000.

72
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:47,088
Does one-eyed nicky want me
to run that to Jimmy The Nose?

73
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,805
It's for my medical bills.

74
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:52,062
I need you to find out
what's wrong with me.

75
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,135
Insurance is usually cheaper than that.

76
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,881
Cash means there is something to hide.

77
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:01,893
I'm a captain in the air force
about to start a new assignment.

78
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,934
NASA's astronaut training program.

79
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:08,321
I discovered salt
and created FM radio.

80
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,744
Something is wrong,
with my eyes, my ears.

81
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,517
Well, if it's fixable,

82
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,751
the air force will do it for free.

83
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,803
If not, doesn't matter.

84
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:22,856
There are 100 applicants ready to take
my place who don't need to be fixed.

85
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,752
I need to do this off the books.

86
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,572
I did the research.
You're the best, you break rules,

87
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,975
and you don't care about
anyone except yourself.

88
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,701
Well, let's say that's true.

89
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,521
You get a new job,

90
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:41,927
hospital gets a nice wad of cash.

91
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,742
What do I get?

92
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:47,258
I crashed a flight simulator

93
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:49,944
because I started to hear

94
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:51,797
with my eyes.

95
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,723
- The aluminum, could've been tainted...
- Don't care.

96
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,828
New patient.

97
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,038
30 year old female,

98
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,357
with synesthesia.

99
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,433
New rules.

100
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,625
You generate a lab report,
you shred it.

101
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,600
X ray,
you melt it.

102
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,550
No notes, no records, nothing.

103
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:19,228
As far as you're concerned,
the patient is Osama Bin Laden.

104
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,041
And everyone not in this
room is delta force.

105
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,409
Any questions?

106
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,786
We're protecting Osama Bin Laden?

107
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,490
It's a metaphor.
Get used to it.

108
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,033
Any more questions?

109
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,965
And you're not even gonna
tell us her name?

110
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,085
You think her name might be connected
to what's wrong with her?

111
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,168
Here's Osama!

112
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,566
You all have numbers,

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,168
so we're gonna do this
alphabetically.

114
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,185
- 8, 15, and 5.
- Is the synesthesia new?

115
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:56,708
Yes.

116
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,439
Any history of similar
symptoms or psychiatric

117
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,657
No, nothing.

118
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,780
Are you on any prescription meds?

119
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,859
- Or use any other drugs?
- No.

120
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:06,209
Should we trust her answers?

121
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:09,002
You think I'd pull you off Buddy
Ebsen just for a junkie?

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,532
Can we trust your answers?

123
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,752
- Well, you gotta trust someone, right?
- No.

124
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:17,137
Has anyone close to you been sick lately
a family member, a coworker?

125
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,915
No, not that I'm aware of.

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,796
Two down.
Kitty Carlisle.

127
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,505
You spend much time above 20,000 feet?

128
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:28,317
Why would you ask that?

129
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:30,899
People who fly are immobile
for long periods.

130
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,842
Could be a leg clot that embolized
to the brain through a PFO.

131
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,357
Unusual choice.

132
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:38,712
Like you said, you wouldn't interrupt
buddy with anything that wasn't.

133
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:41,588
The patient is...

134
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,592
A frequent flier.

135
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:47,148
13, 32, 39.

136
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:50,464
Get Osama an EEG, MRI, and angiogram.

137
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:55,697
How many of you think that
oswald acted alone?

138
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:59,454
If, by alone, you mean that
he was unaware that the CIA

139
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,540
Oh, shut up.

140
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,485
Split yourself into two groups.

141
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,175
Test her blood.
Test her stool.

142
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:10,990
Who likes
the designated hitter?

143
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,911
You're wrong.
You're lucky you're not fired.

144
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,577
Two more groups.
LPS and cultures.

145
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,114
Who doesn't know what
a designated hitter is?

146
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,291
Here's her address.

147
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:26,450
I want you to break in,
find out what she's hiding.

148
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,446
Why don't we just ask
the patient for the key?

149
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,163
If you could find out what she's hiding

150
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,244
just by asking,
we'd have to redefine hiding.

151
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:41,586
You wanna live in this country,
learn the language.

152
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,841
What do you want the rest of us to do?

153
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:52,313
30 people for three openings,
and I want you to wash my car.

154
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,543
This is not why I busted
my ass in med school.

155
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,787
We spend half an hour cleaning a car,
big deal.

156
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:57,944
It's demeaning.

157
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,808
Work is demeaning?

158
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,213
We're too good for this.

159
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,343
Oh, don't give me that
honest day's labor crap.

160
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:06,765
We all went to med school so we wouldn't
have to do an honest day's labor.

161
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,554
What about an honest hour's labor?

162
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,970
In exchange, we get a shot at
learning from one of the best

163
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,646
diagnosticians in the world.

164
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:14,897
We don't.

165
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:18,624
If we did, we'd be one of the ones
drawing blood or checking for toxins.

166
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:19,875
We're done.

167
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:22,670
He's just not gonna cut
us loose until we've

168
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,445
dusted his shelves
and starched his shirt.

169
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,493
I'm outta here.
Who's with me?

170
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,068
Are we sure he wasn't joking?

171
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,080
Maybe this is just a test.

172
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,290
Everything's a joke,
and everything's a test.

173
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,812
And he wants us to do it.
Come on, get up here.

174
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,734
I could try,
but I pulled a muscle in 1987

175
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,653
I didn't waste two years
repeating medical school to be

176
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:02,019
- arrested and deported.
- Why'd they make you repeat?

177
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:03,804
Not enough gym credits?

178
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,459
According to the state of New Jersey,

179
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,370
medical schools in my country
suffer from not being from this country.

180
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:19,355
If you get it open, you're gonna
have to come down and let me in.

181
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,261
Or you could just wait out here.

182
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,687
This is a competition.

183
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,565
Change your mind?

184
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,945
- Then why are you here?
- Never intended to quit.

185
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,673
- Well, then why did you.
- Intended to get everyone else to quit.

186
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:43,812
Get off the car.

187
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,296
I need to clean it.

188
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,693
We need to clean it.

189
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,509
I stole his keys.
We'll take it to a car wash.

190
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,774
He's got people breaking
into a woman's apartment.

191
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:56,207
Obviously, respecting personal property
isn't one of the rules.

192
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,867
I told the super I was
worried about my niece.

193
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,635
She hasn't been answering the telephone.

194
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:12,978
Nice guy.

195
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:14,425
Two daughters at mount holyoke.

196
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:18,527
No evidence of clots.

197
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,087
And other than elevated
red blood cell counts,

198
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:23,701
the, uh, blood work was.

199
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:25,001
Unremarkable.

200
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,772
Got a problem with the
naked female form?

201
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,357
Not at all.

202
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,479
Maybe she's just not used
with the naked dolphin form.

203
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,245
That's not a dolphin.
It's a porpoise.

204
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,044
There is a difference, you know.

205
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:43,316
Salary, for one thing.

206
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,022
You want us to give you a minute?

207
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,190
- High red blood cell count likely means
- carbon monoxide poisoning.

208
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,894
There are a lot of
different explanations

209
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,240
for elevated red blood cells.

210
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,752
Yeah, well, which one fits best
with the damaged fluid that

211
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,501
your competitors found
in the gas fireplace in Osama's cave?

212
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:08,788
Car's clean.

213
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,844
Did you just see a blond guy with
a pretentious accent?

214
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:14,253
- Can't see an accent.
- Good point.

215
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,089
Can I have my car keys back?

216
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,057
Gimme the car keys,

217
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,974
put the patient in a hyperbaric chamber,
and no more prime numbers for you.

218
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,402
Thank you.

219
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:31,470
The high pressure and oxygen will flush
the carbon monoxide from your system.

220
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,929
This much oxygen for too long
can have some toxic effects,

221
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,609
so we'll do this in cycles.

222
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:38,684
Can I talk to you a second?

223
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:44,448
You're working that thing all the time.
Is everything alright?

224
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,075
We're supposed to be watching
her heart rate and blood pressure.

225
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,037
Yeah, I was until you
pulled me over here.

226
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:52,022
I'm sending out a consult
on another patient.

227
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,965
What? I'm not quitting my old job
until I'm sure I've got a new one.

228
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,774
- didn't say anything.
- You had a look.

229
00:12:57,953 --> 00:12:59,670
Yeah.
I did.

230
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:01,310
Sorry.

231
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,065
I think she's having a heart attack.

232
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,348
No, I just feel a little funny.

233
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:08,098
Tachyarrhythmia.

234
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:10,731
Call?

235
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,130
- Nothing.
- V-FIB,

236
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,170
where the hell is clear.

237
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,713
Are you crazy?
You can't bring those.

238
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:20,982
- We're in a!
- Clear.

239
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,307
She's on fire!

240
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:42,192
- Her heart's beating.
- And we are so fired.

241
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:49,000
We've started her on
nitro and blood thinners.

242
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:51,596
Electrolytes and post-arrest
EKG were normal.

243
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,578
The attack was not caused
by the procedure.

244
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,622
So what does cause synesthesia,

245
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,744
high red blood cell count,
and heart attack?

246
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,274
Aren't we gonna discuss what caused
the sudden appearance of burnt flesh?

247
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:06,601
He brought charged paddles
into an oxygenated room.

248
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,243
And you didn't stop him.

249
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:10,444
Means either you thought

250
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:12,953
it was a chance worth taking,
making you a hypocrite,

251
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,172
or you thought he'd fail,
making you a cutthroat little pixie.

252
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,798
- What causes?
- Takayasu's syndrome.

253
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,588
Not without a rash and a fever.

254
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,467
- It's gotta be whipple's.
- No way.

255
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,482
You ever see whipple's
without abdominal pain?

256
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:26,515
Stop it!

257
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,939
This argument is distracting
every male and lesbian here.

258
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,247
You're both right

259
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,957
in the sense that you've convinced
me that you're both wrong.

260
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:35,910
What about cardiomyopathy?

261
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:40,342
Structural abnormality causes the heart
attack and throws clots to the brain,

262
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,187
leading to synesthesia.

263
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,840
- How old are you?
- I'm 21.

264
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:46,574
Unless it's relevant.

265
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:48,875
Okay,
scooter.

266
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,408
Do a transesophageal echo.

267
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:56,097
And since the positive divisors of
26 are 2 and 13, have them assist.

268
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:59,449
Rest of you, go to the cafeteria,
document

269
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,918
ten things that can cause infection.

270
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:03,192
Each.

271
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,348
I wouldn't.

272
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:16,295
Someone named "17"

273
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,618
thinks there could be listeria
in the cream cheese.

274
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:22,176
17's a stupid number.

275
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:26,169
- What's Chase doing here?
- You saw Chase?

276
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,458
Last night,
outside my office.

277
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:30,487
That's interesting.

278
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:33,430
It's more curious than actually.

279
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:36,425
Chase took a job at the
mayo clinic in Arizona.

280
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,499
A week ago.

281
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,422
Interesting.

282
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:45,547
It wasn't Foreman or Cameron you...

283
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,013
"saw,"

284
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,994
but Chase,
the one you fired.

285
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,385
Not interesting.

286
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:54,329
Someone who looked like someone
I used to know walked by my office.

287
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,505
It's always interesting when repressed

288
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:59,313
guilt starts,
unrepressing itself.

289
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:03,400
The only thing I feel guilty for.
Is this.

290
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:12,297
We're gonna feed this endoscope
down your esophagus,

291
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,309
try to find where your heart
might be damaged.

292
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:17,458
It's gonna feel uncomfortable.

293
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,487
But just keep swallowing.

294
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:22,595
I promise
you'll be fine.

295
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:24,689
She's ready.

296
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:28,772
Go ahead.
Take a whack.

297
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,365
Right.

298
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,104
So if we don't find anything,
House blames me.

299
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,027
Or you find something
and get a gold star.

300
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:36,230
Why don't you want to do it?

301
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:40,086
House isn't gonna be impressed by a gray
hair doing his ten thousandth echo.

302
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:43,019
- She's just be interesting.
- That makes you suspicious.

303
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:44,960
Doctor?

304
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:46,856
Call me "13".

305
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,722
I'm not getting invested.

306
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:53,449
Her heart's structurally sound.

307
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,384
No clots.
No valvular defects.

308
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,059
No wall motion abnormalities.

309
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,763
Got that from "structurally sound".

310
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,680
- What did she say?
- Structurally sound.

311
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,583
I assume you're not all walking
with me to tell me you found nothing.

312
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,301
It showed a short burst in the at.

313
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:09,603
Okay.
Who's next?

314
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,183
Showed a short burst of atrial flutter.
I ran a rhythm strip

315
00:17:12,218 --> 00:17:14,070
- twice and got the same result.
- Stop.

316
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,465
Okay, here's how we diagnose in transit.
I lead, you draft.

317
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:21,573
I move, you move.
I stop, you stop. Got it?

318
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:23,436
Flutter can mean
hormone overproduction.

319
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,343
Why did you do the test?
I gave it to scooter.

320
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,176
- We didn't think it mattered?
- it doesn't.

321
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,986
It matters that you let her.

322
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:32,432
Okay.
10, 24, 39,

323
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:35,461
run a trh stimulation test
for hyperthyroidism.

324
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:37,425
That could cause another heart attack.

325
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,033
Proving her first attack
was caused by her thyroid.

326
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:43,744
Which is kinda the point, right?

327
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:50,722
I ride alone.

328
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,420
The hormones stimulate your thyroid.

329
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,655
Don't worry if you get flushed
or you start to sweat.

330
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:58,147
It means the thyroid's working.

331
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,835
And, uh, if you want,
I can remove that mole.

332
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:05,283
I'm a plastic surgeon.
You're allowed a little vanity.

333
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,408
I'm fine with the way I look.

334
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,767
Good for you.

335
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:13,219
Although, I do find it
a bit odd that someone

336
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:17,014
so self-assured doesn't want her doctors
to find out what's wrong with her.

337
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,370
What are you talking about?
Why else am I here?

338
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:20,877
You're jerking us around.

339
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,535
You're handcuffing us
with all these restrictions.

340
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,333
I'm feeling warm.

341
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,580
Her pulse is 120.
Stop pushing.

342
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:31,308
If thought this would handicap us,
he wouldn't have taken the case.

343
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:32,810
Or maybe that's why he took the case.

344
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,078
He wants to see if we can
get it out of her on our own.

345
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:36,624
What did you find in her home?

346
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:39,159
- You were in my home?
- Nothing.

347
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:41,188
Travel pictures,
yearbook,

348
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:42,943
her name on an employment slip?

349
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:44,642
We weren't checking for that stuff OK?

350
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:46,475
Obviously, House didn't want us to.

351
00:18:46,513 --> 00:18:48,963
You're gonna.
You're gonna out me, aren't you?

352
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:50,518
You're gonna ruin everything.

353
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:53,411
Nobody's trying to do anything.
Just relax.

354
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,534
This is not a normal response
to the test. Pulse and bp are too high.

355
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,168
Get away from me.

356
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,460
Get away from me.

357
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:06,962
Don't touch me.

358
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,465
Paging me during judge judy,

359
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:18,851
not the best way to win my affections.

360
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,676
She had another episode of synesthesia.

361
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:23,398
It set off a psychotic attack.
And now she ran in there and must've

362
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,575
- jammed something in the handles.
- So you call me.

363
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,764
The guy with one good
leg and zero leverage.

364
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:33,347
We break that door down, security
shows up, and her name goes in a file.

365
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:38,480
Luckily,
violence is not the last resort.

366
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,192
Extortion is.
So go ahead.

367
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:42,265
Extort her.

368
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,293
If you don't open this door,
we're going to break it down.

369
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:51,575
Clever.

370
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,863
An appeal to her deep concern
for hospital property.

371
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,437
Let's see how that works.

372
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:02,967
If you don't open this door,

373
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:04,944
<i>- you're going to die.
- Go away!</i>

374
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:09,289
- You seem to be getting to her.
- She doesn't care if she dies.

375
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,516
- You think she wants to die?
- No, but I think she only wants to live

376
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:14,266
under certain circumstances.

377
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:20,802
Open up or I blab
your secret to everyone.

378
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,848
<i>You don't know anything.</i>

379
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:24,168
I do.

380
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:42,372
- Anybody think that a sedative might...
- I'm trying.

381
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,619
Who's that?

382
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:56,645
Who is she?

383
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:01,686
Osama Bin Laden.

384
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:12,581
Who is she?

385
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,634
- Is she okay?
- She's stable.

386
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,441
Who is she?

387
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:24,728
- What did House tell you?
- That she is on the run

388
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,547
from an international crime syndicate.

389
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,975
That's what he told us.

390
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,114
House maybe your boss,
but I'm House's boss.

391
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:33,900
You want to work here, I better be okay
with it.

392
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:36,958
Honestly, he didn't tell us
anything about who she was...

393
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,592
Her name's Greta Cooper.

394
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,906
Wants to be an astronaut. Doesn't want
NASA to know her brain's getting

395
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,240
her ears confused with her eyes.

396
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:48,830
I went through her mail.

397
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,938
You're a virus, House. Now instead
of one liability, I've got 20.

398
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,651
Apparently, only 19.

399
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:59,747
- Which number was it?
- From now on, everything you do

400
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:00,868
gets charted.

401
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:05,046
With pen on paper. In a binder that says
princeton plainsboro teaching hospital

402
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:07,036
- on the cover.
- Mom!

403
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,606
If you want to run something
through the labs, I get a copy.

404
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,663
If you do scans, I get a copy.
If you think about doing scans,

405
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:14,925
I get a copy.

406
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,408
You know my current thoughts, right?
I don't have to put those on paper.

407
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:24,934
Three issues.

408
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:26,393
One,

409
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:28,684
number 10, you're fired.

410
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:31,208
- She told you?
- Well, it had to be someone

411
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,420
who went to her home.

412
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:35,242
No. 26 is half asleep.
Missed his afternoon nap.

413
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:37,983
Obviously he doesn't feel guilt.
No. 2 is here on a visa

414
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,861
- she can't jeopardize...
- you can't know.

415
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:42,978
And that chick's been pointing at you
since I walked in.

416
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:45,375
Issue two.

417
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:51,014
What causes synesthesia, high RBC,
tachyarrhythmia, and panic attacks?

418
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,538
Slight glucose elevation...
That says thyroid.

419
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,257
- Baseline thyrotropin's 1.1.
- 1.3

420
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:58,768
- Whatever. Her thyroid's working.
- What about her liver?

421
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:01,757
Original ALT levels weren't abnormal
but were near the edge.

422
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:03,740
- She has patient data on her PDA.
- I do not.

423
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:06,322
I saw the lab values. You said we
couldn't write anything down.

424
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:09,088
- I also said I wanted answers.
- Liver cancer's the most likely.

425
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,815
Paraneoplastic syndrome.
We need to do an MRI.

426
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,927
- Which brings us to issue three.
- You're saying we can write stuff down?

427
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:17,420
To you, I'm saying you're fired.
To everyone else...

428
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:19,779
- But you said specifically...
- I hate tattletales.

429
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:22,536
- She tattled on 10.
- Now you tattled twice.

430
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:24,483
Issue three...

431
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,489
Come on, let's go.

432
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,176
Issue three. How do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

433
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:34,617
Dr. Cuddy didn't say we can't do tests.
She said we have to chart.

434
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,509
If we chart, we won't get consent.
So we can't.

435
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:39,868
The patient's life may depend on her
consenting.

436
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:42,287
Her dreams depend on her not consenting.

437
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:47,004
So, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

438
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,205
You've got an hour.

439
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:57,626
How do you scan a liver
without scanning a liver?

440
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,397
And what's Cameron doing here?

441
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:02,193
Interesting.

442
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:06,219
- So you're seeing cameron now.
- No, not "interesting",

443
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,292
because not "seeing."

444
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,428
"saw."

445
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:13,267
My patient won't consent
to MRIs or ultrasounds.

446
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,964
And you've dealt with more liver cancer
than anyone else here.

447
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:19,757
So you want me to share the secret
scanning techniques I learned in Nepal?

448
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:22,456
Unfortunately, the monks
made me swear a blood oath.

449
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,747
- Where was she?
- In the lobby.

450
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:28,240
Guess we could palpate
the area around the liver.

451
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,260
Which won't work unless the tumor's
enormous, which you know.

452
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:34,776
Which means you're here because
these visions are freaking you out.

453
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:37,405
She had blonde hair.

454
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,341
- Why would I hallucinate that?
- Yes.

455
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:44,393
Yes, why are you merging
Cameron and Chase?

456
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:47,609
We should find out before the next time
you see her when she'll be black.

457
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,328
Of course, it's scientifically
impossible for a person to go back

458
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:53,025
and visit somewhere they worked.

459
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,741
No. But since she's not a dead cat,
it is scientifically impossible

460
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:58,735
for her to be in two places at once.

461
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:00,851
Physics joke.

462
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:05,144
- Don't hear enough of those.
- She just called me from Arizona.

463
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:07,653
Notice the area code. 480.

464
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,982
They put an offer
on a place in scottsdale.

465
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:12,906
Do you want to talk or should I?
I guess we could both talk.

466
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:16,780
Although they're engaged. And if you're
staying in touch, you might want to buy.

467
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,863
Maybe it's not repressed guilt.
Maybe it's just... Panic.

468
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:28,860
Right now you've got enough fellows
to build a railroad.

469
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,291
But you're gonna have to narrow
that room full of numbers

470
00:25:31,346 --> 00:25:32,349
down to three people.

471
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:36,412
Any chance you could turn this creative
brilliance towards my patient's liver?

472
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,878
I think you're gonna choose people
for reasons that have

473
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,779
nothing to do with their skills.
I think you're going to choose people

474
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:46,558
just because you can't stand them.
Because if you like them,

475
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,622
well, that's just...

476
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:50,701
Stressful.

477
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:54,033
Stress.

478
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:56,432
I like it.

479
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:04,123
- We need to stress the patient's liver.
- You mean make her sick?

480
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,258
I mean make her sick in a specific way.

481
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,401
If her liver's given to malfunctioning,
we make it malfunction.

482
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:12,709
Are we on the other side of wrong here?
Don't we have an ethics board

483
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,530
- that we should consult?
- I fired you.

484
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:19,110
- No, you didn't.
- He fired you. You're No. 6.

485
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:20,722
No, I'm not. I'm No. 9.

486
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:23,573
I approve of your shamelessness.

487
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:25,447
You're still fired.

488
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:27,636
How do we stress her liver?

489
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,275
Lying and paperwork, I get.
Shutting down organs...

490
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:33,364
We could give her intravenous vitamin D
and stick her in a tanning booth.

491
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:36,368
If she goes into a coma, we know
it's a metabolic problem.

492
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:38,076
Nice.

493
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,604
But vitamin D's metabolized
by the liver and kidneys.

494
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,486
It wouldn't tell us
which one's screwed up.

495
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,123
We could get her wasted.

496
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:49,251
Give her shots of tequila. Measure
how long it takes for her to pass out.

497
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:52,155
If it's too fast, then we know
her liver's not processing alcohol.

498
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,251
It's a shot.

499
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,399
I like you, No. 9.

500
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:06,900
- You wanted to see me?
- You a mormon?

501
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:11,479
You're wearing a ring
from Brigham young.

502
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,836
Or did your folks just do the lawns?

503
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,961
The church has a very progressive
attitude toward racial equality.

504
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,594
Don't care.
Actually, I'm thanking God.

505
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:23,372
You're the only non-drinker we got.

506
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:27,264
We need a control group to establish
whether the liver's deterioration

507
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,662
is within normal range.

508
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,098
Got a big drinker, medium drinker,
now I got a no-drinker.

509
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:33,722
Just do an MRI.

510
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:40,575
You really think the guy who created
heaven and earth cares what you put

511
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:41,894
in your digestive tract?

512
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:44,505
Her dream shouldn't outrank
my religious belief.

513
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:47,703
Why not?
Her dream might come true.

514
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,491
All life is sacred, right?

515
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,481
We're not saving her life,
we're doing a diagnostic test.

516
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:58,783
- Not even a real diagnostic test.
- Well, that fake test

517
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:00,771
might really save her life.

518
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:06,061
Would you pull an ass
out of a pit on the sabbath?

519
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:15,795
Would you or would you not pull an ass
out of a pit on the sabbath?

520
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:21,636
Fine.

521
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:23,268
I'll do it.

522
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:25,775
Good.

523
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:33,252
Why'd you have to pick tequila?

524
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:36,013
I assume a single malt
would've worked just as well.

525
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,196
Wasn't our choice.

526
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,781
Okay.

527
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,562
Two minutes, then round number five.

528
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,557
So tell me about the magic underwear.

529
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:53,221
- Is that why you're here?
- I'm the big drinker.

530
00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:56,767
Doing my part for science.
The interesting question is why your

531
00:28:56,852 --> 00:29:00,902
religious beliefs are suddenly
less important than her dreams.

532
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:03,620
- You're reversing your argument?
- I know what I believe.

533
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:05,383
I'm just not quite sure
what you believe.

534
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:08,537
Well, lds doesn't try to dictate
every detail of our lives.

535
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:12,406
When a situation isn't clear, we're
encouraged to make our own decisions.

536
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,505
But your judgment was to say no.

537
00:29:15,006 --> 00:29:17,621
- You used my judgment.
- You made a good argument.

538
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:20,775
Rational arguments don't usually work
on religious people.

539
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,237
Otherwise there would be
no religious people.

540
00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:26,118
- You're an atheist.
- Only on christmas and easter.

541
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,217
The rest of the time,
it doesn't really matter?

542
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:31,462
Where's the fun in that?
A finite, unmysterious universe...

543
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:32,921
It's not about fun.

544
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:36,356
- It's about the truth.
- The truth is, we're having this debate

545
00:29:36,454 --> 00:29:38,583
because you want to figure
something out about me.

546
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,217
What do you got so far?

547
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,700
She can't breathe. We need to intubate.

548
00:29:46,822 --> 00:29:48,927
- No.
- At least oxygen.

549
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:51,618
NASA will need to know why.

550
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:04,973
I checked the tests you ordered.

551
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:08,773
- Did you just see Foreman?
- You measured the density of her teeth.

552
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:11,648
It's a shortcut test for hypercalcemia.

553
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,887
- You had to have just passed him.
- So you suspected hypercalcemia

554
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:17,219
from her complete lack of broken bones.

555
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,801
Is that why you also
ran three tox screens.

556
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,030
Patient might've been sneaking uppers.

557
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,003
He was in a white coat.
Did you hire him back?

558
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:27,084
Foreman is running the diagnostic
department at New York Mercy.

559
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:35,619
Have you been drinking?

560
00:30:56,973 --> 00:31:00,395
She was having trouble breathing.
Refused oxygen and intubation.

561
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:03,741
- So you put her on a treadmill.
- Records will show

562
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,346
that we gave her oxygen as a part of
a routine cardio stress test.

563
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,141
She gets to breathe.
Your boss gets her paperwork.

564
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:12,877
Who's idea was that?

565
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,709
It was a joint decision.

566
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:17,608
It never is.

567
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,388
So how old were you
when your brother left home?

568
00:31:22,455 --> 00:31:24,976
- Why do you think...
- Why aren't you answering?

569
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:28,818
- Did your mother initiate the divorce?
- We should probably focus

570
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:31,277
- on what's wrong with her lungs.
- Are you a wiccan?

571
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:32,934
She really can't breathe.

572
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,611
Hold still.

573
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:42,712
- What are you doing?
- Auscultatory percussion.

574
00:31:42,937 --> 00:31:45,232
If you have a good ear, you can...

575
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:49,964
You didn't have
a lot of friends because you...

576
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,091
You can hear while you're talking?

577
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:58,137
You can detect not only structural
details, but small, deep masses.

578
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:04,920
Game's over.

579
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:09,567
You either have lung cancer
or tuberous sclerosis.

580
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:13,312
We need to cut you open and biopsy.

581
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:15,284
That'll...

582
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:21,123
Leave a scar. NASA doctors will see.
They'll know.

583
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:24,789
I never opened for springsteen
or slept with Barbara Feldon.

584
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:28,204
You can live for years without dreams.
Without lungs...

585
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:29,933
Find a way.

586
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:38,014
As long you keep saying it strongly,
you won't die.

587
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:41,409
Find...

588
00:32:42,064 --> 00:32:43,068
A way.

589
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:49,021
How do we force a patient into surgery?

590
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:51,079
Texas bag scam?

591
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:52,806
Saratoga wire?

592
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:56,389
- Paris exposition trip?
- The problem's not the surgery.

593
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:57,539
It's the scars.

594
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,945
And we have a plastic surgeon
here who can hide 'em.

595
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:01,055
Not that well.

596
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:04,954
- NASA's gonna check every cranny.
- I say we just put ether in her oxygen

597
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:07,030
- and do what we have to do.
- She'll sue.

598
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:08,130
For what?

599
00:33:08,178 --> 00:33:10,539
Making it harder for her
to lie to the government?

600
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:12,657
We don't need to hide them.

601
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,525
We give her elective cosmetic surgery.

602
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:19,222
The incisions will give us access
to her lungs and she's got an innocent

603
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:20,418
explanation for the scars.

604
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:24,360
- You mean like liposuction.
- No, no. Those incisions

605
00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:27,118
are too far from the lungs.
We don't subtract,

606
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,530
we add.

607
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,185
Turn her "b"s into "c"s.

608
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,966
It's a myth that fake hooters blow up
at high altitude. She'll be fine.

609
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,997
Just think of it
as one giant rack for mankind.

610
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,943
I fought for years
to be taken seriously.

611
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,895
Trust me, you'll be taken
more seriously. Just sign the form.

612
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:52,207
This'll make me a joke.

613
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:54,961
There's got to be another way.

614
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:01,245
I've, known a few people who had dreams.

615
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:05,555
One thing they all had in common was
they got laughed at

616
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,642
and they didn't care.

617
00:34:20,312 --> 00:34:22,569
You bumped a splenectomy
for a boob job?

618
00:34:22,632 --> 00:34:25,724
Would you condemn this woman to a life
where people look at her face

619
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:28,140
- when they talk to her?
- You don't explain this,

620
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,820
- I'll cancel the surgery.
- Can I explain why you're here?

621
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,411
Think I just told you why I...

622
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,422
I scheduled a diagnostic patient
for a boob job,

623
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:39,737
which is ridiculous. So obviously
you had to confront me.

624
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:42,299
- With you so far.
But I'm gonna give you a reason.

625
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:45,777
- Not a good one.
- No. Not even close to a good one.

626
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,136
But here's the drag
from your point of view.

627
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:51,301
My explanation will make sense.

628
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:55,676
Not to the board. Not to a judge.
But to you. So you'll let me do it.

629
00:34:57,123 --> 00:35:00,757
Then you're gonna have to sit next to me
at the administrative hearing.

630
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,939
Don't you have better things to do?

631
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,091
It's in the best interests
of the patient.

632
00:35:21,341 --> 00:35:23,540
Trocar's in. You're good to go.

633
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:31,985
Deflate the lung.

634
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:35,043
There. A cyst.

635
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:38,016
Cysts.
I count three of them.

636
00:35:38,073 --> 00:35:40,859
Probably the same
if not more on the left lung.

637
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:45,904
So what's been working overtime to kill
"miss Bin Laden"?

638
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:49,487
- We know her name now.
- Yeah, but I forgot it.

639
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:53,106
Say the magic word and get immunity
from the next challenge.

640
00:35:53,178 --> 00:35:55,836
Alveolar hydatid disease.
Hits all the organs.

641
00:35:55,927 --> 00:35:57,828
She would've have multiple
seizures by now.

642
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:01,181
- Pulmonary langerhans'.
- Doesn't explain the red blood cells.

643
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:05,820
Come on. Cysts.
Synesthesia. Heart attack.

644
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:08,861
<i>- You guys have gotten...
- Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.</i>

645
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,032
<i>Raises red blood cell count.</i>

646
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:13,827
<i>Causes masses on the organs.</i>

647
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:17,370
<i>One of the masses is a pheochromocytoma.
It'd cause neurologic</i>

648
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:19,001
<i>episodes and a heart attack.</i>

649
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:28,152
Do you see a blond guy who still has
peach fuzz standing up there?

650
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:35,013
- This is a closed procedure.
- Gallery's off limits.

651
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:37,385
<i>Not to the surgical staff.</i>

652
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,306
You gonna hire that guy instead of us?

653
00:36:50,322 --> 00:36:52,709
Not a chance. I love you guys.

654
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,298
Dig out the cysts, histology to confirm
Von Hippel-Lindau.

655
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:59,598
Don't forget her chesticles.

656
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:11,156
Calling Arizona.

657
00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:13,829
- It was a very nice touch.
- You do have residual...

658
00:37:13,877 --> 00:37:16,913
Not only do I not have
residual feelings, I didn't even have

659
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,439
- primary feelings.
- You freaked...

660
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,802
- You lied.
- Because you knew it meant...

661
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,645
It meant nothing!
I saw him 'cause he was there.

662
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:27,728
Cameron follow herbeshert
to the surgery department?

663
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:29,227
I think chase followed her.

664
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,881
She's been a senior attending
in the ER, the last three weeks.

665
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:34,315
A blonde senior attending,
to be accurate.

666
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,609
Foreman.
Is he back in neurology?

667
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:39,070
He's at New York Mercy.
He's been there a month.

668
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,535
- Did you "see" Foreman?
- No.

669
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:48,572
So...

670
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:50,127
I'm cured.

671
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:51,946
You're fine for now.
But Von Hippel-Lindau

672
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:54,142
is a genetic disease. There's no cure.

673
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,686
Greta, you need to come clean to NASA.

674
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:02,603
- You said you got all the cysts.
- They could reemerge.

675
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:07,099
I'll go to radiology clinics.
I'll get regular screenings.

676
00:38:07,147 --> 00:38:09,315
If something happened
while you're up there,

677
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:11,172
you'd be playing
Russian roulette with...

678
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:12,214
Relax.

679
00:38:13,545 --> 00:38:15,840
She doesn't have to ither do you.

680
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:19,858
Turns out that NASA doctors
even know where the hyphen

681
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,540
in Von Hippel-Lindau goes.

682
00:38:23,272 --> 00:38:24,441
You called them?

683
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:29,595
I'm not an idiot.
Those shuttles fly over New Jersey.

684
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:42,841
<i>So here we are.</i>

685
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,433
<i>The big moment.</i>

686
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:47,596
Which of you gets to live
to be abused another day.

687
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,119
And which of you goes home
and rationalizes being fired

688
00:38:51,173 --> 00:38:53,314
as character building?

689
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:03,589
Following numbers, thanks for playing.
21, 19, 8,

690
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:07,081
34, 17,

691
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,132
29, 5,

692
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:12,751
36, 2.

693
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:16,001
Rest of you, 8:00 AM Sharp.

694
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,930
I'll be in sometime between
10:00 and 3:00.

695
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:21,662
But 26, stick around awhile.

696
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,911
I did nothing wrong.

697
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:32,019
- Lots of people did nothing wrong.
- Other people screwed up.

698
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:34,676
- I never even...
- Other people took chances.

699
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,399
26.

700
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,384
Buddy Ebsen
actually wasn't allergic to...

701
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:45,605
- Yeah, I know. How old are you?
- 21

702
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:49,332
- You don't think it's relevant.
- I'll likely have less time

703
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:52,694
to use the skills you teach us, but
I don't think that's significant to you.

704
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,668
How about the fact that you
never went to medical school,

705
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,260
which is why you let the unlucky number
do the trans echo?

706
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,997
At least you're ethically unethical.

707
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,134
30 years I worked in the
Columbia med school admissions office.

708
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,632
Audited all the classes.
Most of them more than once.

709
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,655
I just never got a diploma.

710
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:21,486
You had to know
I'd find out sooner or later.

711
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:24,683
I know you break rules.

712
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:27,679
I thought maybe you'd break one for me.

713
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,905
I can't hire you as a doctor,

714
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:34,872
but you can still tell me
what you think.

715
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:37,754
You can also fetch me coffee,
pick up my dry-cleaning,

716
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:40,111
until I can decide
whether or not to keep you.

717
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:42,533
So I'm playing this whole game
to be like...

718
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:44,317
Your secretary?

719
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:46,947
Assistant sounds
marginally less demeaning.

720
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:49,476
It's not my dream job.

721
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:53,269
Actually, it is.
It's just not your dream title.

722
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:22,948
Three weeks. For someone who never
misses something small,

723
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,398
you missed something big.

724
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,009
You're an idiot.

725
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:33,296
- The hair, where I'm working, or both?
- The hair makes you look like a hooker.

726
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:34,977
I like it.

727
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:38,969
Pulling pieces of windshield
out of car accident victims.

728
00:41:39,024 --> 00:41:42,622
Reattaching fingertips
sliced off cutting bagels.

729
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:46,131
At least chase's move
is only one step down.

730
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:49,389
I can do good here.
Get it out of my system.

731
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,779
Why'd you rat your patient out to NASA?

732
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:58,958
I don't know who's been gossiping
about ethics instead of sex, but I hope

733
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:00,554
they've already been fired.

734
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:03,056
- Which number was it?
- Greta.

735
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:05,526
- Number.
- No number. The patient.

736
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,370
How do you think she got
your pager number?

737
00:42:07,385 --> 00:42:09,272
She came into the ER,
didn't want to talk.

738
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:11,779
- I didn't rat her out.
- You lied?

739
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:15,464
Suppose I should tell her that
before she keys my car.

740
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:19,511
- Why lie?
- Had to stop some leaking faucets.

741
00:42:20,478 --> 00:42:21,877
What did it matter?

742
00:42:23,013 --> 00:42:24,703
It was no one's business.

743
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:26,676
Right.

744
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:29,332
She's gonna be
the safest astronaut up there.

745
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,600
Certainly more vigilant than
the guy next to her who's got no clue

746
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:34,713
about the aneurysm in his head
ready to pop.

747
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:35,816
Right.

748
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:38,966
You got a better reason?

749
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,065
You couldn't kill her dream.

750
00:42:45,305 --> 00:43:45,512
