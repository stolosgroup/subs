1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,560
Put that badminton set...

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,126
with the sporting goods, will you?

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,799
Okay. Ed, I'm going
to get my haircut now.

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:08,932
All right.

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,710
Last time I had a trim,
Denise said that I should...

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,372
consider having some
highlights. What do you think?

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,114
I like it the way it is.

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,706
Really? Oh, yes.

9
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,009
Okay.

10
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,111
Oh.

11
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,849
When you have a moment, would you go
downstairs and bring up more fax paper?

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,088
It's next to the birdseed.

13
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:29,987
Hello, Ed.

14
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,721
Ed? Ed?

15
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,858
I'm sorry, Ruth-Anne, what?

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,369
I promised Maurice
I'd have it waiting for him.

17
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,303
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

18
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,431
Thank you.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,004
One Who Waits.

20
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,477
You're looking well, Ed.

21
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,838
Thank you.

22
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,308
I see you've found a new vocation.

23
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,351
Vocation? Oh, yeah.

24
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,019
This is just until my
directing career takes off.

25
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,818
It's always good to have
something to fall back on.

26
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,821
Can I offer you a Musketeers Bar?

27
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,692
No, thanks, Ed. I'm a ghost,
remember? We don't eat.

28
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,492
Oh, right. Sorry.

29
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,059
No need to feel so.

30
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,125
I must admit, I like to take a whiff
of food every once in a while...

31
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,397
for old times sake.

32
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,664
You know how it is.

33
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,570
What brings you here?

34
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,267
Remember the last time
I was here in Cicely...

35
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,937
and how bad you felt when we
couldn't find your parents?

36
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,878
Uh-huh. I felt bad, too...

37
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,279
so I kept on looking.

38
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,646
I looked everywhere.

39
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,480
This world, the next.

40
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,647
I never walked so hard
when I was alive.

41
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,718
I thought I'd have to change
my name to One Who Walks.

42
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,454
My dogs were taking a beating.

43
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,155
Anyway, the bad news is...

44
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,761
I went through five pairs of moccasins.

45
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,929
The good news is, I found your father.

46
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:45,930
Mmm-hmm.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

48
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,082
Buenos días, Cicely and mi jefes.

49
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,786
This is Chris in the Morning
with a couple of quick notes.

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,693
And under our Cosmology
and Astronomy department...

51
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,697
an eye-opener for you stargazers.

52
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,492
HD 1545, once thought to be...

53
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,698
a single star with a weird
little wiggle in its orbit...

54
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,797
is actually two. Twins, binaries...

55
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,138
two stars orbiting
around each other, so...

56
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,645
congrats to our tiny
little celestial dancer...

57
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,374
and your new partner HD 1545-B.

58
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,383
Talk about cosmic couples, it seems our
own Milky Way has a significant other.

59
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,184
That's right, we're being
slowly tugged along...

60
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,282
by a sister galaxy, Andromeda...

61
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,420
and even beyond that
there's a great attractor.

62
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,361
A super cluster of galaxies that's...

63
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,461
slowly drifting towards
our own super-cluster...

64
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,664
in a warm gravitational embrace.

65
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,665
Always remember, it takes two to tango.

66
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,042
I appreciate you coming,
One Who Waits...

67
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,103
but, you know, I already saw my father.

68
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,546
You did? When?

69
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,084
Well, it was the last time you
were here, right after you left...

70
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,347
and I found him changing
his truck tire...

71
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,452
and he had the same jacket on as me.

72
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,014
Oh, that guy. That's not him.

73
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,584
No?

74
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,220
No, it was an honest mistake, Ed.

75
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,431
Because you don't see that
jacket on Indians everywhere.

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,234
But, One Who Waits, a raven flew by...

77
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,667
the wind came up and Nat
King Cole was on the radio.

78
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,500
Coincidence.

79
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,140
I have my information
on good authority...

80
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,802
from Donald Napakiak...

81
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,476
a respected elder.

82
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,445
I met him just after he died...

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,548
and he told me specifically
who your father is.

84
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,581
He did? Really?

85
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,747
That's right.

86
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,981
Hi, Ed.

87
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,817
Hi, Shelly.

88
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,723
Who's that you're gabbing with?

89
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,988
One Who Waits.

90
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,959
One who whats? Waits.

91
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,522
Oh, you know, my invisible friend.

92
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,226
Oh, the ghost dude.

93
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,996
Where is he?

94
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,564
About here?

95
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,266
Oh, almost. Just over a
little to the left, and up.

96
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,411
So, what's it going to be?

97
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,771
Hmm.

98
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,014
Well, he's not sure yet.

99
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,482
Last time you had hamburger
and fries, remember?

100
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,245
You got off sniffing the ketchup.

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,754
But you hated the smell of
the gherkins on the side.

102
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,790
Good memory. I like that in a girl.

103
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,619
I'll have the same. Okay.

104
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,990
Two burger specials, please.

105
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,693
And hold the gherkins.

106
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,420
Right.

107
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,265
Are you still making movies?

108
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,132
Oh, sure.

109
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,436
I was thinking about making
my next project a documentary.

110
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,367
Documentary?

111
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,637
Yeah. That's a true-to-life
account of something.

112
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,408
See, they're repaving this
4-mile stretch of highway...

113
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,278
between Cicely and Klukwan.

114
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,350
And I was thinking, it would
be very, very dramatic...

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,917
man, machine, battling the permafrost.

116
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,248
Ed?

117
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,883
Dr. Fleischman.

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,154
What are you doing?

119
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,060
I'm talking to my friend,
One Who Waits. My guide.

120
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,157
Oh, right. Of course, the spirit pal.

121
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,225
He's 250 years old...

122
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,238
and sniffs his food, tracks relatives.

123
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,600
Right!

124
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,673
You can't answer right
to a question like that.

125
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,581
Seeing invisible people and
having conversations with them...

126
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,549
I mean, we went through this.

127
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,109
This is a manifestation
of psychotic behavior.

128
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,645
Oh.

129
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,920
Look, I don't want to alarm you,
but I think that if this continues...

130
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,791
we should really
consider psychotherapy.

131
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,828
Okay, Dr. Fleischman.

132
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,162
And, listen if this...

133
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,135
friend suggests that you climb
up on a roof and take a leap...

134
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,867
I really hope that you'll
give me a call first, okay?

135
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,233
You've got it, Dr. Fleischman.

136
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,069
All right.

137
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,308
I don't understand, Mike.

138
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,684
The whole coast
of Alaska is vulnerable.

139
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,256
See this dot here? Uh-huh.

140
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,655
That's an iceberg...

141
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,216
calved off from an ice sheet
in the Chukchi Sea...

142
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,784
about three weeks ago.

143
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,461
Now, it's drifting southeast...

144
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,591
with an abandoned Soviet
research station on it...

145
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,203
and dozens of 50-gallon drums
scattered all over the place.

146
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,298
Yeah? Yeah.

147
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,609
The thing is, nobody seems
to know what's in them.

148
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,941
The Russians,
they don't have any records.

149
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,175
We can't tell.

150
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,581
It could be an ecological time bomb.

151
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,814
That's awful. Exactly. Look.

152
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,486
The iceberg's come 30 miles
already. It's just off Enurmimo.

153
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,891
If it hits the right current...

154
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,725
it could be right here in our
own backyards in a matter of days.

155
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,158
God.

156
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,868
Luckily, I'm in good shape.

157
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,472
I've been monitoring every
reactive index in my body.

158
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,606
Toxin absorption, anti-oxidants,
selenium, zinc, copper...

159
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,749
I'm at median levels
all the way around.

160
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,645
What are you talking about?

161
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,118
We're going to find out
what's in those drums.

162
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,247
We?

163
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,018
I need you to fly me
to the llivit Mountains.

164
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,926
The llivit Mountains? Yes.

165
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,999
From up there, I'll be
able to get a clear reading.

166
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,860
If there's paint in the drums,
I'll have an olfactory reaction.

167
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,833
Rhinitis, sinusitis.

168
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,931
If it's formaldehyde,
excessive lacrimation.

169
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,568
Sulfites, paroxysmal sneezing.

170
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,373
And if it's petrochemicals...

171
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,006
any kind of epidermal response...

172
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,449
from rashes and hives to canker sores.

173
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,249
What if it is toxic, and you
have some sort of reaction?

174
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,813
Then, we'll have good,
hard data for the EPA.

175
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,228
Good evening. Where's the owner?

176
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,891
I'm your man. What can I do for you?

177
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,526
Got a piano here? Yeah.

178
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,696
Well, I'm the tuner. The tuner?

179
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,102
Are you going to take me to it...

180
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,232
or am I going to stumble
around here like a blind man?

181
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,434
I'll take you.

182
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,054
You know, I had a friend,
Bert Nystrom. He...

183
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,060
He was unsighted, too.

184
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,392
He used a dog to help him get around.

185
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,863
I had a dog once.

186
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,560
But then business
got real slow, so I ate him.

187
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,560
Man's best friend tastes
surprisingly like chicken.

188
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,196
51-inch Sterling.

189
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,772
Oh.

190
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,278
This is a mess.

191
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,746
The key bushings are worn
out, missing dampers...

192
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,407
someone's sprung the trapwork.

193
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,011
Well, we get pretty large
temperature extremes around here.

194
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,315
That could account for it.

195
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,686
$150.

196
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:18,781
I'm sorry?

197
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,827
I'll tune this piano for $150.

198
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:26,058
I don't know, that's an awful lot
of money to spend on this old thing.

199
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:30,296
This "old thing" has
copper-wound bass strings...

200
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,661
and nickel-plated tuning pins.

201
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,707
Holling, customer at number four
says the fish cakes are rank.

202
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,901
What do you think?

203
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,404
What are you trying to do,
poison people here?

204
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,604
Who's he?

205
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,408
This is a piano tuner, Shelly.

206
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,715
You're blind, huh?

207
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,245
Good call.

208
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,221
You know, that was such
a bummer on Little House...

209
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,258
when Mary Ingalls got scarlet
fever and couldn't see any more.

210
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,289
Nice meeting you.

211
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,059
Shelly, ask him if he
wouldn't like a Moose-burger.

212
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,568
That's the way I like 'em,
blonde and stacked.

213
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,661
How would you know that?

214
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,502
I may be blind, Sherlock,
but I'm not stupid.

215
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,439
Hey, Fleischman,
I need to ask you something.

216
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,140
Are you hemorrhaging, O'Connell?

217
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,239
No.

218
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,509
Acute abdominal pain? No.

219
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,813
Life-threatening situation? No.

220
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,218
Well, I'm busy. Please.

221
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,916
I need some information, Fleischman.

222
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,050
Mike and I are going away
for a couple of days.

223
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,218
Mike? Yes.

224
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,091
I need to know if there's
any medicine he might need...

225
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,721
or anything I should watch out for.

226
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,823
'Cause you and Mike are
going away for a few days?

227
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,231
A couple of days, Fleischman.

228
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,362
A couple, meaning two,
not a few, meaning several.

229
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,596
What?

230
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,465
Fleischman, I don't know
what kind of scenario...

231
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,669
your juvenile imagination
is concocting...

232
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,737
but Mike and I happen to be doing
some very important research.

233
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,803
No doubt.

234
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,645
I am flying him
to the llivit Mountains...

235
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,118
so he can read what's in some
50-gallon drums floating on an iceberg.

236
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,880
Mike is going to the top
of a mountain so he can...

237
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,985
take a sniff of a drum,
what, 500 miles away?

238
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,120
That's right.

239
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:08,522
O'Connell, let me give you a little
gloss on the old olfactory system, okay?

240
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,497
High up in the nasal passage
is a tract of mucous membrane...

241
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,300
which contains the cell
endings of the olfactory nerve.

242
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,666
This is how we human beings
acquire our sense of smell.

243
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,073
Mike would need...

244
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,341
an olfactory nerve
the size of Yankee Stadium...

245
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,439
to do what you're talking about.

246
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,242
Forget it.

247
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,382
Wait. No, no, no, no.
I get it. I get it.

248
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,116
It's like The Princess and
the Pea thing, right? Yeah.

249
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,182
If a woman can sense a pea
50 mattresses below her...

250
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,991
certainly a man can smell some schmutz
in a drum hundreds of miles away.

251
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,698
What made me think
you were going to help me?

252
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,731
Wait! We're missing
a golden opportunity here.

253
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,738
I'll bet even as we speak, there's
some miscreant up in Yokohama...

254
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,501
illegally firing up his hibachi.

255
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,634
You can get Mike to the top of Mount
McKinley and bust the sucker in a flash.

256
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,042
Drop dead!

257
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,305
See that guy over there?

258
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,472
That's him.

259
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,843
You mean the short one
with the ponytail?

260
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,978
No, the tall one.

261
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,182
Are you sure? Absolutely.

262
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,952
Look at that chin. Look at those eyes.

263
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,487
My eyes are blue.

264
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,652
Whatever.

265
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,390
That man is your father.

266
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,365
What are you waiting for?

267
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,162
Go on over and talk to him.

268
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,997
I don't think now is such a good time.

269
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,903
You know, I promised Ruth-Anne
I'd defrost her freezer.

270
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,965
Ed, that man is your father. You've
been waiting all your life to meet him.

271
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,039
I know, but...

272
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,544
I think tomorrow would be
a better day, you know.

273
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,607
I've the whole afternoon off tomorrow.

274
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,583
I could have spent the
last two years relaxing...

275
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,290
reminiscing with friends,
carving totems.

276
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,017
But no, I spent the time
looking for your father.

277
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,959
Why? Because I couldn't get
your face out of my mind.

278
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,523
An orphan boy, longing for
some knowledge of his father.

279
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,767
Now go on over there.

280
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,375
Excuse me, Sir.

281
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,811
Oh, good. You're here.

282
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,576
I need you up there right away.

283
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,977
You're the skip sheeter, right?

284
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,210
Uh...

285
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,548
After you finish the sheeting...

286
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,851
I want you to move on
to laying the felt.

287
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,154
But don't go on to the starter
course until I check the shake, okay?

288
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,969
Hey, Ed, come here.

289
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,564
There's a seat right here.

290
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,177
After you get finished
laying the felt...

291
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,108
I want you to hold off
on the first row of shake.

292
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,808
I may need you inside to help the
finish guys with the tape and float.

293
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,145
Okay.

294
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,025
Can I ask you something?

295
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,819
Sure.

296
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,156
What's your name?

297
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,296
Pete. Pete Jarvis.

298
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,793
I'm Ed.

299
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,764
You're right.

300
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,265
Ed Chigliak.

301
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,267
I just thought you should know.

302
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,339
Know what, Ed?

303
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,975
That's my name.

304
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,478
See, the thing is...

305
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,419
I know what this is all about, Ed.

306
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,616
You do?

307
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,161
It's as plain as that
mustard on your face.

308
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,890
I was watching you work. It's obvious.

309
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,431
You don't know your way
around laying paper.

310
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,030
Oh.

311
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,674
You're right, Pete. Paper keeps sticking
out from underneath the shingles.

312
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,677
We'll fix that.

313
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,540
Right after lunch,
I'll come up there...

314
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,914
and show you how
to do the overlap, okay?

315
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,985
Oh, yeah. Okay.

316
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,549
Great.

317
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,258
That's funny.

318
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,288
The way you eat your sandwich.

319
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,090
I like to work my way in.

320
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,968
My son does that. I always get
such a kick out of watching him.

321
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,600
You have a son?

322
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,499
Two. And a girl.

323
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,411
We live over in Chickaloon.

324
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,510
I wish work didn't
take me away so much.

325
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,907
I get home and they're all
a foot taller.

326
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:25,983
The little one, Freddie, he likes
to eat around the edges first.

327
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,257
I don't know where he gets it from.

328
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,887
Must have been something he saw on TV.

329
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,358
Oh.

330
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,366
Pete, I think I'll just wait for
you on the roof, if that's all right?

331
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,334
I'll be there as soon as I finish
the rest of this turkey loaf.

332
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,467
All right.

333
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,247
Can I sweeten your coffee for you?

334
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,343
I've had all of that sludge
I can stand.

335
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,782
Hold on, come back here.

336
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,049
Do you know what these are?

337
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,449
Thumb tacks.

338
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,826
Which some cretin stuck
into the piano hammers...

339
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,330
to get a honky-tonk sound.

340
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,429
Now the striking points are dead.

341
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,465
Get a pencil. A pencil?

342
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,069
You're going to be
writing something down.

343
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,074
I would do it for you, but I'm
told my penmanship is lacking.

344
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,634
All right.

345
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,472
Sleetmute, Pollard's Music. Get me
a carton of treble piano hammers.

346
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,073
That's treble piano hammers.

347
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,242
Sleetmute?

348
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,615
S- L-E-E-T-

349
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,280
Sleetmute is over 200 miles from here.

350
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,382
Well, then you'd better get going,
I need those hammers by tomorrow.

351
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,121
You expect me to drop everything
just to fetch your hammers?

352
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,992
Read my lips, Einstein.

353
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,623
Yes.

354
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,306
Who does he think he is?

355
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,905
I'm paying that man.

356
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,910
He works for me, I don't work for him.

357
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,610
Whoa, chill, babe.

358
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,580
Where does he get off
insulting me like that?

359
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,014
Treating me like
some kind of errand boy.

360
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,945
Cut him some slack, H.

361
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,352
You got to remember he's
like Mr. Magoo, only worse.

362
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,721
Yeah, this is good.

363
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,156
This is very good.

364
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,622
The high pressure area
has moved inland.

365
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,134
The wind's coming from the
north by northeast, 15 degrees.

366
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,567
12 knots, yeah, this is perfect.

367
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,899
Mike, Mike.

368
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,964
Really, shouldn't you be wearing a
respirator or at least a pair of gloves?

369
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,270
No, no, no. I'm fine.

370
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,842
Smell the alders.

371
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,676
Aw, would you look at that?

372
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,847
How did that piece of junk get out here?

373
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,782
You ever hear of Surtsey Island?

374
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,652
It's this tiny speck
in the North Atlantic.

375
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,918
It's some rocks
and a whole lot of nothing.

376
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,185
But you know what people found...

377
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,196
when they first set foot on the beach?

378
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,460
Candy wrappers, plastic bags,
and a vinyl sofa cushion.

379
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,298
What are we doing to this planet?

380
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,932
Whoa.

381
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,707
Wait a minute. What?

382
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,608
Ketones.

383
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,308
Phenols.

384
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,450
No. No cramping...

385
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,582
no ocular migraine.

386
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,887
We can forget about
sulfites and paints.

387
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,386
The drums.

388
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,830
I'm starting to get some rash
patterns, a little hiving.

389
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,636
Some sensitivity down in my pharynx.

390
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,871
It's got to be tars,
it's all petrochemicals.

391
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,501
Lubricants.

392
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,709
Must be from that machinery
used by the Russians...

393
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,976
out on that research station.

394
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,576
Mike?

395
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,617
Chance of anaphylactic shock.

396
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,714
Epinephrine.

397
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,791
Oh. Not to worry.

398
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,017
Just a precaution.

399
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,757
Good job, Ed. Thanks.

400
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,430
So, Ed, how did it go?

401
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,906
Really good. We got all
the skip sheeting done...

402
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,500
laid all the paper,
started on the shingles.

403
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,807
You accomplished a lot. I'll say.

404
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,474
What happened when you told
your father who you are?

405
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,880
I didn't tell him.

406
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,615
You didn't tell him?

407
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,646
I was going to...

408
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,947
and then my mouth got really dry...

409
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,718
and it felt like
my tongue was swelling up.

410
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,090
And then, every time I
tried to get the words out...

411
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,131
it was like these great big hands...

412
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,190
just encircling my throat
and choking me.

413
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,958
How very peculiar.

414
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,361
Not really.

415
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,129
'Cause, you see, when
you left the last time...

416
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,103
and we couldn't find my father...

417
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,276
well, at first I was upset.

418
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,842
And then of course, I saw
him, or I thought I did...

419
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,209
but it was okay.

420
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,175
You know, even if all we did
was change a tire...

421
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,947
it felt better.

422
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,856
'Cause I didn't have to
think about him any more.

423
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,117
Even if I thought
I'd never see him again.

424
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,494
It was like Luke Skywalker.

425
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,895
Skywalker? Joe Skywalker's boy.

426
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,256
No.

427
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,857
Luke Skywalker is this
character in Star Wars.

428
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,896
His father is a Jedi warrior...

429
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,131
and everybody thinks
his father is dead.

430
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,141
But your father is alive
and we know who he is.

431
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,011
Luke's father turned out
to be alive, too.

432
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,079
And they got in this terrible fight.

433
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,011
And he cut off Luke's hand...

434
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,177
and, well...

435
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,120
that's the kind of thing that
would make a person nervous.

436
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,119
You're disappointed in me.

437
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,953
Puzzled.

438
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,787
I thought you'd be happy
to see your father.

439
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,063
I... It would be a great
moment in your life.

440
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,729
I did, too.

441
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,863
Now I find out you're afraid
to tell him who you are.

442
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,175
I'll tell him, I will.

443
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,970
I promise.

444
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,550
Hi, Ed. How's it going?

445
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,286
Well, I...

446
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,649
Have you told him yet?

447
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,918
I came really, really close
this morning.

448
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,896
You know, I have an idea
that might help.

449
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,759
Ask him to dinner.

450
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,599
Why ask him to dinner?

451
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,932
Because good food ends with good talk.

452
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,666
Since the beginning of time, it's
always been that way with human beings.

453
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,231
Ancient legends are told...

454
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,037
marriage is proposed,
hunts are planned.

455
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,012
Ed, take my word for it...

456
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,909
once you share a meal, it'll be
easy to tell your father who you are.

457
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,115
Go ahead, go on. Ask him.

458
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,215
Pete?

459
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:35,918
Yeah, Ed?

460
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,487
I was wondering if you'd like
to come to dinner at my place?

461
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,588
Dinner?

462
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,102
Yeah, you were so nice about helping
me lay the felt and everything...

463
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,262
I just thought
maybe you'd like a steak.

464
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,731
Or a fish or chicken.

465
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,634
You know, whatever you want.

466
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,604
Takeout, KFC, Chinese.

467
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,012
I mean, well, you have to eat, right?

468
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,247
So you'll come?

469
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,989
Sure. Good.

470
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,289
All right!

471
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,389
One Who Waits, he's coming over.

472
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,019
And we're going to have steak.

473
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,261
Or we might have chicken or fish...

474
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,660
but he's coming over.

475
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,867
I brought your hammers.

476
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,061
Just leave them.

477
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,070
You said you needed
these things right away.

478
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,106
Listen, Jughead, I have
to repair the shanks...

479
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,869
before I can put the hammers in.

480
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,906
Incidentally,
it's going to cost you $250.

481
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,670
What is? This job.

482
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,145
You said $150.

483
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,249
That is before I found out
the extent of the damage.

484
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,016
You've got loose bass-strings
windings, broken brass butt flanges.

485
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:42,822
Mister, we set a price
and we shook hands on it.

486
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,954
Excuse me, I shook hands with someone.

487
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,865
How do I know
that clammy paw was yours?

488
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,959
Are you saying I'm trying to cheat a-

489
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,300
Perceptually impaired individual?

490
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,106
Someone who's visually challenged?

491
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,100
Who knows?

492
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,110
You may be trying to rob me blind.

493
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,010
Listen, I'm not the one who's
trying to break this agreement.

494
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,515
Ooh, we're getting upset now,
aren't we?

495
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,451
I can feel the heat
radiating off your prostate.

496
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,283
You want to sock me, don't you?

497
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,450
Admit it. If I had 'em,
you'd punch my lights out.

498
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,685
Come on.

499
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,658
Go ahead, what are you waiting for?

500
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,531
Go ahead, clean my clock.

501
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,036
Wherever you are.

502
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,606
What are you waiting for?

503
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,503
Come on! Belt me one, hero.

504
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,800
Let's slug it out, mano a mano.

505
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,175
Yeah.

506
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,846
Just what I figured.

507
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,345
A wuss.

508
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,414
A wimp.

509
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,559
I like the way you fixed
these little carrots.

510
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,755
Yeah?

511
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,320
With lemon and honey.

512
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,957
There's a diner on the Alcan...

513
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,599
just outside of Dot Lake.

514
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,837
They make 'em like this.

515
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,467
Sweet potatoes, too.

516
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,301
Pete?

517
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,503
Yeah, Ed?

518
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,769
Well...

519
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,871
I just thought
you ought to know that...

520
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,107
That what, Ed?

521
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,151
I have more brisket on the stove.

522
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,314
No, I'm fine.

523
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,050
Oh, okay.

524
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,423
With my work, Ed,
I have to travel a lot.

525
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,154
I don't get very many
home-cooked meals.

526
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,529
Usually it's chicken pot pie
in a microwave.

527
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,496
Pete?

528
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,697
What?

529
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,368
I think you should know
that I'm... I'm...

530
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,368
I'm... I'm... I'm...

531
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,879
You're what, Ed?

532
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,776
Kind of thirsty.

533
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,816
Would you like some tea?

534
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,917
Any coffee? Sure.

535
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,084
I've got Bavarian Chocolate
Mint or Café Mocha.

536
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,858
Café Mocha would be good.

537
00:24:58,697 --> 00:24:59,686
That your mom?

538
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:00,955
Her?

539
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,131
No, that's my Aunt Sylvia.

540
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,333
Of course, she's not really my aunt.

541
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,664
She helped raise me.

542
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,169
And who's this?

543
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,738
That's Carl Graybuck.

544
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,666
He's someone else from the
tribe. He makes furniture.

545
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:17,247
Say, Pete, you know, I've got quite an
extensive video collection over here.

546
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,942
Maybe you'd like to watch something.

547
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,541
This is my Native American section.

548
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,918
Pow Wow Highway, Black
Robe, Broken Arrow.

549
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,486
That is one of my favorite films.

550
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,593
You know, excellent casting, they've got
a lot of good action sequences in it.

551
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,890
Jimmy Stewart, Jay Silverheels.

552
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,493
I'm an orphan.

553
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,427
Excuse me?

554
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,498
I'm an orphan.

555
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,937
I'll check the water.

556
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,445
Hi.

557
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,116
Hi, come on in.

558
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,816
I didn't see you
at The Brick last night.

559
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,245
I thought maybe with everything you
inhaled, you weren't feeling well.

560
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,687
No, no, no. It's just... Very busy.

561
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,284
Come here, I'll show
you something. Okay.

562
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,363
This is a satellite infrared
taken two days ago.

563
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,864
Here's the iceberg.

564
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,060
Now, look at it in comparison...

565
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,296
with this taken last week.

566
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,667
See, it's...

567
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,565
It's obviously slowed.

568
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,369
Great.

569
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,205
I'll be monitoring it for a while...

570
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,614
to make sure it hasn't
picked up any speed.

571
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:31,619
It depends on the Chukchi
currents, that are right along here.

572
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,018
And if...

573
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,853
they don't surprise us, we'll be fine.

574
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,591
That's wonderful.

575
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,723
Of course, I'll have to
keep the EPA informed.

576
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,630
Of course.

577
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,230
Maggie...

578
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,867
Mmm-hmm?

579
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,939
...you're standing on my foot.

580
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,042
Sorry. It's okay.

581
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,175
It's okay.

582
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,397
Whoa.

583
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,932
Let's do that again.

584
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,569
Wait.

585
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,080
What? I can't do this.

586
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,340
What?

587
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,813
This, I can't. I can't do this.

588
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,748
Is it Joel?

589
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,346
Fleischman? No, no,
of course not. It's...

590
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,825
I've got to go. Why?

591
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,658
Mike, you don't want to
get involved with me.

592
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,664
I don't want you
to get involved with me.

593
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,428
I'm like toxic sludge.

594
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,063
I'm the global warming and the
greenhouse effect all rolled into one.

595
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,936
Maggie, what are you talking about?

596
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,970
The kiss was great, it's just...

597
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,470
I kill men.

598
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,756
Hey, One Who Waits.

599
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,821
Ed, I've come to say goodbye.

600
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,489
Oh.

601
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,926
You're going.

602
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,729
There's really nothing left
for me to do here now.

603
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,302
I'm sorry I couldn't tell Pete
he was my father.

604
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,136
A man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

605
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,934
Even if you can't explain why.

606
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,768
I just never seem to be able
to find the right time.

607
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,708
There are those who believe that
time is a wheel turning forever.

608
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,314
Which would mean that your
moment will surely come.

609
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,590
Then, there are those who
believe that time is a river.

610
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,260
Which, if that's true...

611
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,892
it's possible your moment
has already flowed by.

612
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,361
Which one do you think it is?

613
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,196
I think that time is just time.

614
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,667
Goodbye, Ed.

615
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,085
Ruth-Anne?

616
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,216
Yes, Ed?

617
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,920
I've been wondering
why a mother or father...

618
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,327
would decide to leave his or her child.

619
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,528
Is this about a TV movie?

620
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,464
No. I was just thinking.

621
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,095
There's this tiny baby,
eight or nine weeks old.

622
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,104
Somebody bundles him up
in a blanket and...

623
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,502
sticks him in a basket down by
the river in the rushes, and...

624
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,437
Well, why would they do that?

625
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,876
There was a very good reason
for that, Ed.

626
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,051
Pharaoh's soldiers would have
killed that little baby Moses.

627
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,048
No, I wasn't thinking of
Charlton Heston, Ruth-Anne.

628
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,957
I was thinking more like real-life. Oh.

629
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,261
In my experience, it's
generally just a matter of youth.

630
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,689
Of not being able to see the
consequences of your actions.

631
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,963
When my husband's youngest
brother Clayton was 17...

632
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,266
his girlfriend dumped him
for a college man.

633
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,766
And they were having
a clog dancing contest...

634
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,672
down at the Odd Fellows Hall...

635
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,802
that Clayton was determined to win.

636
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,806
Really? Oh, yeah.

637
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,842
He wanted to show up his
old girlfriend and her beau.

638
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,750
And sure enough, he and his
new partner did indeed win.

639
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,387
The trouble was,
they decided to celebrate...

640
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,790
in the back seat of his Hudson Hornet.

641
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,590
Get the picture?

642
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,657
Later, when the girl told Clayton she
was pregnant, he just couldn't cope.

643
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,398
He didn't have any earnings except
part-timing it down at the granary.

644
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,335
And the only reason
he'd asked her out...

645
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,465
was he needed a dancing partner.

646
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,839
He didn't even know her folks.

647
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,002
It was a mess.

648
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,604
What happened?

649
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,445
He shipped out
with the Merchant Marine...

650
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,609
for three weeks
after she had young Dale.

651
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,313
The point I'm trying
to make, Ed, is this:

652
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,580
It isn't that he was a bad boy.

653
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,957
It was just that he was a boy.

654
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,031
Still, they could have
celebrated a lot smarter...

655
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,295
by having a couple of hot
fudge sundaes down at Carvel's.

656
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,102
Okay, softer on the repeats.

657
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,512
Right. Keep it moving, but don't rush.

658
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,188
Better.

659
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,291
Arlen?

660
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,258
Yes?

661
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,999
The D above the middle C...

662
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,164
Yeah?

663
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,433
It's flat.

664
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,240
It's the way I want it.

665
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,069
Why?

666
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,947
You know anything about Persian rugs?

667
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,572
Isfahans, Tabrizes.

668
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:00,908
Sarouks?

669
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,384
Yes. No.

670
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,678
No, what?

671
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,585
I don't know anything about them.

672
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,722
The men who wove those rugs...

673
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,688
great craftsmen.

674
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,523
Shah Abbas, Seirafian.

675
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,798
It took years to complete each rug.

676
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,030
They tied thousands of knots...

677
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,301
but they always left one
that was tied wrong.

678
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,369
One flawed knot.

679
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,135
You know why?

680
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,138
Otherwise the rug would be perfect?

681
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,478
That's right.

682
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,322
Okay, that's...

683
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,628
two and a half hours
overtime, Tuesday...

684
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,363
full day Wednesday,
full day Thursday...

685
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,063
and half a day this morning.

686
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,198
Thanks, Pete.

687
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,299
Thank you, Ed.

688
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,105
You're a good worker. Right.

689
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,840
Well, goodbye.

690
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,043
Pete?

691
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
Yeah?

692
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,620
Have a good trip home.

693
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,781
Thanks.

694
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,091
What's the matter, door stuck?

695
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,454
No.

696
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,656
Yes.

697
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,401
Come on, One Who Waits.

698
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:26,827
Come on.

699
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,269
What's the problem, Ed?

700
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,068
I'm your son.

701
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,170
What?

702
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,143
I'm your son.

703
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:38,773
My son?

704
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:43,219
About 20 years ago, you had a baby.

705
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,721
Only you didn't want him...

706
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,058
so you kind of left him...

707
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,421
and that baby grew up to be me.

708
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,327
How do you know?

709
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,399
A friend told me, but he
wants to remain anonymous.

710
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,770
See, it was the spring of 1972.

711
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,400
May...

712
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,269
and Fast Cloud...

713
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,276
found a baby down by the Tuka River...

714
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,347
where the tribe goes to fish every day.

715
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,683
And that baby was wrapped
in a sealskin coat...

716
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,685
and about eight weeks old.

717
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,154
I don't know what to say.

718
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,788
Oh. You don't have to say anything.

719
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,524
You don't have to explain.

720
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,955
I know what happened.

721
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,957
See, you were young...

722
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,995
and you were feeling awful bad because
your girlfriend broke up with you.

723
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,002
And you needed a partner...

724
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,730
for the dance contest down
at the Odd Fellows Hall...

725
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,203
so you took this other girl,
and you won.

726
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,367
And you were feeling great...

727
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,169
so you celebrated in the back
of your brother's car.

728
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,681
And she got pregnant...

729
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,178
and you got scared.

730
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,921
After all, you only had a
part-time job down at the granary.

731
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,417
And you didn't even know her family.

732
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,582
Shoot, you didn't know her.

733
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,991
What else could you do?

734
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,895
You want a glass of water?

735
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,323
Yeah, please.

736
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,231
I hardly knew your mother, Ed.

737
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,569
Like you said,
it just kind of happened.

738
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,968
I wish I could tell you where she is...

739
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,209
but I lost track of her
a long time ago.

740
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,410
Always wondered what happened to you.

741
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,223
Where you were, who was raising you?

742
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,225
I'd see a kid in the school yard...

743
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:32,988
or a park...

744
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,624
and I'd think...

745
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,160
he's about the right age,
maybe that's him.

746
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,905
I just hoped you were okay.

747
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,100
Oh, I'm fine.

748
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:49,177
Really, I've got
all the people in the tribe.

749
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,243
Gosh, I got a lot of friends.

750
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,580
And I got a good job at Maurice's
and another at Ruth-Anne's.

751
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,083
And, well, I've got my films.

752
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,021
I'm really doing very well.

753
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,520
Are you?

754
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,724
I sure am.

755
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,592
I'm fine.

756
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,838
You know, listening to you
play the piano...

757
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,138
reminds me of something
I remember, many years ago.

758
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,813
I was living up on the north
shore of Lake Crosswind.

759
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,415
That's where I heard it.

760
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,915
Music spilling out of a piano.

761
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,617
Coming from somewhere across the water.

762
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:43,156
Three times I made my way around
to the other side of the lake...

763
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,225
but I could never locate where
that sweet sound was coming from.

764
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,664
It was as if the music were
flowing out of the lake itself.

765
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,499
Gee, what an enchanting story.

766
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,868
Arlen, you are a thorough-going S.O.B.

767
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,472
Yes, I am.

768
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,972
I'm pouring whiskey.

769
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,110
You care to join me?

770
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,750
If it's on the house,
the answer is yes.

771
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,557
You know, there was a time...

772
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,552
when I drank a lot.

773
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,686
Too much.

774
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,162
Self pity, perhaps.

775
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,494
But I had the perfect cover.

776
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:27,734
You see, no one gives a second thought
to blind men walking into walls.

777
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:33,736
You know...

778
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,277
the other day, I really
thought you might hit me.

779
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,607
Was I right?

780
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,844
No. But I had something else in mind.

781
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:41,976
Which was?

782
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,180
I was going to help you
across the street.

783
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,287
Right in front of a logger's truck.

784
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,618
Not bad.

785
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,925
You know, I've torn apart
a Bösendorfer up in Nome...

786
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,768
I've blowtorched frost off
the church organ up in Barrow.

787
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,505
I've even tuned a Yamaha aboard
a submarine at Adak Naval Base...

788
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,373
and everywhere I go,
people want to say...

789
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,604
look at that nice blind man.

790
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,410
Look how nicely
he handles his disability.

791
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,711
Isn't that nice?

792
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,075
That's what people want.

793
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,749
But a man has to be true to his nature.

794
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,253
And my nature...

795
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,588
Well, you know.

796
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,529
Pretty hard to make friends that way.

797
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,999
Making friends has never been
very high on my list of priorities.

798
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,071
Of course...

799
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,472
if you were to set me up
with a new pair of eyes...

800
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,412
I'd be your pal for life.

801
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,777
Hey, you shorted me.

802
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,816
Don't be so stingy this time.

803
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,480
Hi.

804
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,580
Hi.

805
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,927
Maggie, this is ridiculous.

806
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,621
You can't just say to me,
"I kill men"...

807
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,723
and then walk away, end of discussion.

808
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,858
It's true.

809
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,893
Come on, Maggie, you don't kill men.

810
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,663
Mike, yes, I do.

811
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,339
Ever since I was 21...

812
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,377
every man I've been
romantically involved with...

813
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,878
has died an untimely, unnatural death.

814
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,439
You talking about Rick,
who got hit by a satellite...

815
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,313
and that other guy on the glacier?

816
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,610
Yeah, like Rick and David.

817
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,914
But there's also Bruce
and Glen and Steve.

818
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,654
Five men.

819
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,656
Five healthy men
in the prime of their lives.

820
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,388
Five?

821
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,691
Yeah, five.

822
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,265
Well, okay.

823
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,800
Five guys.

824
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,697
That's strange, I admit.

825
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,299
But there is no cause and effect here.

826
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,639
Yes, there is.

827
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,973
I'm the cause, death is the effect.

828
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,412
Come on, Maggie. Look at me.

829
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,182
People think I'm nuts
because of my illness...

830
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:59,279
but you and I both know that there's
a rational, scientific explanation.

831
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,687
It's the same with you.

832
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,589
Maybe there is a scientific,
rational explanation.

833
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,628
Maybe I effect men's molecular levels.

834
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,028
Maybe I disturb their negative ions.

835
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,690
Maggie- Science is based on...

836
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,200
observable phenomena.

837
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,895
You throw a ball into the air...

838
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,961
if it comes back
down to earth every time...

839
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,267
you have gravity.

840
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,274
Well, I'm five for five.

841
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,275
I'm a scientific phenomenon.

842
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,105
Okay...

843
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,178
even if I believed that,
which I don't...

844
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,109
remember who you're dealing with here.

845
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,381
There's not a man on the planet
who lives more safely than I do.

846
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,649
My home is
a hermetically sealed bubble.

847
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,454
I grow all my own vegetables...

848
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,325
I breathe filtered air...

849
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,122
I drink filtered water.

850
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,825
I don't smoke, I don't drive.

851
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,963
No matter how many
negative ions you disturb...

852
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,697
nothing bad can happen to me.

853
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,501
Nothing.

854
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,639
What?

855
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,582
When I first met you I thought you
were the bravest man in the world.

856
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,316
And now?

857
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,525
Now I think you're braver than
the bravest man in the world.

858
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,919
Well?

859
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,527
I'll think about it.

860
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:18,895
Okay.

861
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,241
You're stronger than you look, Ed.

862
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,750
I had a hard time
holding that door shut.

863
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,078
Sorry.

864
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,153
Not too tight, not too tight.

865
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,383
Okay, sorry.

866
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,281
I'd send you to Dr. Fleischman...

867
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,190
but he doesn't believe you exist.

868
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,653
This should heal up fine...

869
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,559
and thanks.

870
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,493
My pleasure, Ed.

871
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,199
So, are you and your father
going to keep in touch?

872
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh, yes. We're going to
write each other and call...

873
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,942
and he's invited me up to
see his family in Chickaloon.

874
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,169
Good.

875
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,008
I don't know if I'll go or not.

876
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,542
I mean, he has his life now...

877
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,478
and I have mine.

878
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,780
But it's okay.

879
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,418
You know, I got to meet him,
and that's a really big thing.

880
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,756
I feel better.

881
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,828
Mmm. Buttered popcorn.

882
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,395
Yup.

883
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,028
And I've got the perfect movie.

884
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,537
What are we going to watch?

885
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,868
Wild Strawberries.

886
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,433
Oh.

887
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,500
1957.

888
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,602
Probably Ingmar Bergman's
greatest film.

889
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,579
Really? What's it about?

890
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:40,845
It's about this old man
who takes a trip...

891
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,011
and reviews his life as he travels.

892
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,382
I think I'll like that one.

893
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,190
I've been thinking about
that old Zen conundrum:

894
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,495
"What's the sound
of one hand clapping?"

895
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,068
My personal opinion, nothing.

896
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,800
You don't have two hands, you don't have
any clapping. It's as simple as that.

897
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,143
Stars, galaxies, clapping
hands, what's the point?

898
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,238
The point is that we all need somebody.

899
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:16,146
Whether you're a super
cluster or a little proton...

900
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,514
or a yin or a yang.

901
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,056
Everybody is hooked
into everybody else.

902
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,448
Like Romeo and Juliet...

903
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:26,794
fish and chips, Ben and Jerry...

904
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,488
Gilbert and Sullivan...

905
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,862
Mutt and Jeff...

906
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,457
Lunt and Fontanne...

907
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,568
Bert and Ernie, Wilbur and Orville...

908
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:38,005
bubble and cheese, E. And 'Scilla...

909
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,565
Bogie and Bacall...

910
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,335
Anthony and Cleopatra...

911
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:44,341
