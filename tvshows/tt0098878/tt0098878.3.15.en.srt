1
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:05,110
<i>Ed, it was three on his right
and two on his left.</i>

2
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:09,815
No, Chris, it was definitely
one on his left.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,259
Holling, how many toes did Marty
Sorenson lose that time he got frostbite?

4
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:17,957
Well, let's see. It was one on his
left and two on his right, wasn't it?

5
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,829
Well, I don't believe it.

6
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,835
- Hello, Edna.
- Holling.

7
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:24,871
<i>Been a while.
Yes, it has.</i>

8
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:27,702
Fellas, you know Edna Hancock.

9
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,299
<i>Lives over next to Maurice.</i>

10
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:32,311
Hi.
Well, almost next to him.

11
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:35,542
What is it, four miles
from door to door?

12
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,641
<i>Five.
Maurice has his 15,000 acres,</i>

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,415
- and you have what, Edna, 10?
- Twelve.

14
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:43,649
<i>12,000 acres. My gosh.</i>

15
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:45,749
It's good to see ya.

16
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:50,126
I think I still have
some of that single malt you like.

17
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,358
Nobody calls for this very often.

18
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:54,923
Make it a double?
Too late for that.

19
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,562
I beg your pardon?
Too late for single malt, Holling.

20
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:00,572
Too late for a lot of things.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,009
l-I don't follow you. I'm running
for mayor, Holling, against you.

22
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:06,909
Why?
Why?

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,416
Five years ago, you could
have given me a stop sign.

24
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,418
Now it's too late
for that too.

25
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:16,445
Five years ago? I was sitting right
here. You said you'd look into it.

26
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,787
But you didn't now,
did you?

27
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,589
Well, l-I must have
forgotten is all, Edna.

28
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,129
Well, it won't happen again.

29
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:26,131
See you on election day.

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,750
<i>Friends, Romans, registered voters,
lend me your ears.</i>

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,250
<i>Holling Vincoeur has picked up the gauntlet
thrown down by Edna Hancock.</i>

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,550
<i>We have a mayoralty race, folks.</i>

34
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,080
<i>To which I can only add,
alea jacta est.</i>

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,520
<i>The die is cast,
the battle is joined.</i>

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,830
Hold on to your hats, Cicely. We're
about to bear witness to that sacred rite,

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,890
when each and every one of us
become acolytes...

38
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,500
before the altar of the ballot box,
our secular shrine.

39
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,560
Fellow Cicelians,
my heart is pounding,

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,870
dancing to the drum
of a free people,

41
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,470
<i>a city on a hill,
e pluribus unum.</i>

42
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,510
I feel at one with Whitman,
shepherd of the great unwashed:

43
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,950
<i>"O democracy,
near at hand to you...</i>

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,050
a throat is now inflating itself
and joyfully singing."

45
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,150
What exactly am I supposed
to be looking for?

46
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,990
It's not jumping up and down?

47
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,560
Not presently.

48
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,070
Well, this morning when I woke up
and looked in the mirror,

49
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,730
it was like I just killed this deerfly,
you know, but it wasn't dead yet,

50
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,740
and its wings were
still flapping around.

51
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,800
l-I believe what you've just described
is a facial tic. Watch my finger.

52
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,520
Okay, a facial tic is a brief,
involuntary contraction of a muscle group.

53
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,740
You ever have one before?
Never.

54
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,750
It's usually the result
of nervous tension.

55
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,190
Have you been experiencing
any unusual stress lately?

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,220
A lot.
Yeah?

57
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,660
The stress is related to?
Oh, the election.

58
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,700
The election?
Yep.

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,290
This election? Yeah. You see, I've never
had a chance to vote before, Dr. Fleischman.

60
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,360
It's a pretty big responsibility.

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,370
Well, normally I'd agree
with you, Ed,

62
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,640
but in this case, I mean, it's nothing
more than a grudge match over a stop sign.

63
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,640
Two stop signs.
Two?

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,340
Yeah, you see, Edna wants a stop sign
to slow down those lumber trucks...

65
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,580
as they come around the curve
near her house.

66
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,920
See, they hit the brakes,
then they work through all the gears.

67
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,010
It's noisy and keeps her awake.
Wait a minute.

68
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,220
There's no intersection? She wants a
stop sign where there's no intersection?

69
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,230
Yeah, but she needs two.

70
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,890
<i>You see, last night I was thinking-
a "Prepare To Stop" and then a "Stop."</i>

71
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,900
I couldn't get back to sleep.

72
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,940
I can see where
that might keep a person awake.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,900
Oh, yeah.
Look, Ed.

74
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,810
Until yesterday, I didn't know Holling was
mayor. I didn't even know there was a mayor.

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,000
How important can a job be
if no one knows it exists?

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,010
Well, there's
a special parking place.

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,140
A what? You know, the reserved sign
out in front of Ruth-Anne's store.

78
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,150
Oh, that's what that's for?
Yeah, it's for the mayor.

79
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,850
But everyone parks there. Well, yeah,
but they all know it's for the mayor.

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,620
And that doesn't even include
all the other special perks.

81
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,360
Like what? Well, like
the annual date book,

82
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,830
the stamp,
the official stationery.

83
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,390
Oh, it's pretty
intoxicating stuff.

84
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,270
Yeah. Holling has been the mayor of
Cicely, well, ever since I was born.

85
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,310
Well, look, I appreciate
the history involved here,

86
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,940
but, um, it's not like an election
is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

87
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,010
Well, there's never been
one here before.

88
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,350
What do you mean?

89
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,390
Well, everyone's just always
wanted Holling to be mayor,

90
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,550
so, well, Holling's
always just been mayor.

91
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,560
You mean there's never
been a vote? Uh-uh.

92
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,430
Ever?
Nope.

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,900
Unbelievable. I've discovered the
Brigadoon of electoral politics.

94
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,400
So what am I gonna do now,
Dr. Fleischman?

95
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,200
About what?
My tic.

96
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,040
Well, vote. It should
clear up Tuesday. Oh.

97
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,840
Hell, I never asked for the job.

98
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,910
I never asked to be mayor. I know.

99
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,480
People asked me. I wasn't
looking for power and glory.

100
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,490
I couldn't have cared less. But still, all
in all, I think I did a pretty decent job.

101
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,320
You've done a dynamite job, babe.

102
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,360
Did I ask Edna Hancock to build
her house near a major thoroughfare?

103
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,340
I've known the woman since the first
day she set foot here 25 years ago.

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,740
Never in all of that time has
an unkind word passed between us.

105
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,440
But let me forget one thing,
she turns on me,

106
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,780
like a grizzly smelling blood
on the wind.

107
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,810
<i>Holling?
What?</i>

108
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,680
I know you've got power and greed and
ambition on your mind, and that's cool.

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,190
It's more than cool.
It's a total turn-on.

110
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,820
But see if you can't fit some time
for you and me to slide around.

111
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,460
All this wheeling and dealing
is making my knees likeJell-O.

112
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,020
One-eyed jack.
Excuse me, Shelly.

113
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,600
May I ask you something, Maggie?
Fire away, Ed.

114
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,770
Okay. In an election, how
do you know who to vote for?

115
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,870
Hmm. Well, it's
kind of complicated.

116
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,140
First, read the literature.
Then listen to the speeches.

117
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,150
But eventually,
you just have to go with your gut.

118
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,780
My gut.
Yeah.

119
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,380
Look each candidate
in the eye, you know,

120
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,450
and try to figure out which one is least
likely to become an unprincipled sleaze bucket.

121
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,520
<i>That's totally ridiculous, O'Connell.
You vote for a strong leader,</i>

122
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,830
someone who represents your views. Oh.

123
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,230
Excuse me?
I don't have any views.

124
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Well, in that case, you fall back
on your candidate's party affiliations.

125
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.
What are they?

126
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,010
Well, are you a Democrat
or a Republican, Ed?

127
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,670
I don't know.
What are you, Dr. Fleischman?

128
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,340
Well, I like to think of myself as a guilt-free
thinker, but, in fact, I mostly vote Republican.

129
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,510
- Figures.
- What is that supposed to mean?

130
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,890
Oh, nothing. Just another in a long
line of disappointments, I suppose.

131
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,520
But I guess it goes along
with argyle socks and the golf clubs.

132
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,890
Oh, great. Nothing like getting
beneath the surface, O'Connell.

133
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,160
You sound a little defensive, Fleischman.
What's the problem? I touched a nerve?

134
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,830
I'm not defensive. I happen to be
very proud of my political position.

135
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,230
I think it takes a lot of guts
to voice the unfashionable,

136
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,600
to go against the tide
of one's peers.

137
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,540
Do you realize how many Republicans live on the
Upper West Side? Yeah, you're lookin' at him.

138
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,270
Yeah, well, it takes a lot of guts to cut programs
for the poor and give tax breaks to the rich.

139
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,780
Oh, spare me the bleeding heart. At least I don't vote out
of some misplaced sense of guilt over growing up with money.

140
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,480
Fleischman, you don't even know what you're
talking about. My parents are Democrats.

141
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,180
We are very pro-labor. Right. I'm
sure you spent your weekends...

142
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,560
at the Grosse Point Country Club
discussing minimum wage.

143
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,860
Well, you know, it's obvious you're running
from your- your working-class background...

144
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,860
and trying to pass yourself off
as something you're not.

145
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm not running from anything. But I got news
for you and your liberal suburban friends.

146
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,730
There's nothing special or particularly
ennobling about not having money.

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,430
Me, me, me. My, my, my. Self-interest
isn't a crime, O'Connell.

148
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,480
I worked my butt off
to be a doctor.

149
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,240
I didn't spend four years in medical school, one
year in internship and two years in residency...

150
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,440
just to be plugged into some system of socialized
medicine that tells me what I can and cannot charge.

151
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,180
Yeah, when my sentence is up, I plan to go
home and charge whatever the market will bear.

152
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,950
Yeah, I want my piece of
the pie. I want my money.

153
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,390
Yeah, a self-serving,
materialistic pig.

154
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,490
Self-serving Republican pig.

155
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,550
Thank you very much.

156
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,470
Edna?

157
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,870
Edna, I'd like to speak with you
a minute if you don't mind.

158
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,410
What is it?

159
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,450
You and I have known each other
a long time, Edna.

160
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,380
I think it'd be a shame
to let a friendship fall apart...

161
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,150
over a silly thing
like a stop sign.

162
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,480
There's a principle involved.
I know that.

163
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,920
But don't you think you're
taking it a little too far? Nope.

164
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,550
What, you think I haven't been
a good mayor then?

165
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,720
Generally I'd say the town is no better
or worse off than the day I arrived.

166
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,890
What do you want then?
You lied to me, Holling.

167
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,600
I did not lie, Edna.
I forgot.

168
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,800
When your freezer broke, and you needed
an emergency generator, did I forget?

169
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,640
Worst rainstorm 1976,

170
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,770
roads washed out,
did I forget?

171
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,180
Edna, that was 16 years ago.

172
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,480
That's right, it was,
and I still remember.

173
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
I remember.
All right, all right.

174
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,750
I admit I may have exhibited
a lapse in character-

175
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,960
a minor, temporary lapse-
but a lapse.

176
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,300
And although your request for a stop
sign is peculiar without a question,

177
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,740
I'm willing to face up to my mistake
and make amends.

178
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,040
I apologize, Edna, and I promise
you I'll get you that stop sign.

179
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,480
Too late.
I said I was sorry.

180
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,310
<i>You had your chance.
Well, now, Edna, hold on.</i>

181
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,820
Now, Holling, if you've finished
your whelping, I've got a race to run.

182
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,980
I'm the mayor, Edna.
Me, not you.

183
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,360
People like me.
They trust me.

184
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,260
I guess we'll find out
on Tuesday, won't we?

185
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,570
<i>This is Chris in the Morning, continuing the K-Bear
Election Countdown to Mayor with some special announcements.</i>

186
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,600
<i>Bea Gormley is holding a candidate's tea for
Edna Hancock this afternoon at her house at 2:00.</i>

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,950
<i>The public is welcome. And Holling
Vincoeur will be special guest...</i>

188
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,980
<i>of the Vikings'Eating Club tonight
at 8:00 p.m. over at the Moose Hall.</i>

189
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,620
<i>There's a change in the scheduled program,
so call Dennis Lundgren for more info.</i>

190
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,560
<i>And keep that radio tuned right where
it is on K-Bear 570 on your A.M. dial.</i>

191
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,690
The radio station of the people,
by the people and for the people.

192
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,460
You know, Chris does have a tendency
to wrap himself in the flag.

193
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,230
I think he's overcompensating
for his criminal past.

194
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,240
Well, it's not just Chris, Ruth-Anne.
It's everyone.

195
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,070
I can't believe the amount of time and
energy being wasted on a two-bit election...

196
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,510
over a two-bit issue
in a two-bit town.

197
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,520
How many bits is that?

198
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,210
Uh, it's all relative, Joel.
I'm sure that this pales...

199
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,590
compared with the Tammany Hall antics that
you're accustomed to, but it's all we've got.

200
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,590
Boss Tweed was a little
before my time, Ruth-Anne.

201
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,390
Al D'Amato's more like it.
In fact, I, uh- I worked on his campaign.

202
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,960
Oh, you did? I certainly
did. Yeah, it was a blast.

203
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,930
Someone got a hold
of the Democratic election schedule, right?

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,470
We'd go around, rip down their
stuff, put up ours, killed them.

205
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,300
Totally destroyed 'em.

206
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:44,070
Um, Joel, after careful consideration,
I'm naming you election commissioner.

207
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,670
What? As town clerk, one of my jobs...

208
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,680
is to appoint election officials,

209
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,950
so I've just made you
election commissioner.

210
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,680
I don't wanna be election commissioner.
What does election commissioner do?

211
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,420
You make sure that everything
is done properly and above board.

212
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,650
- Thanks. I decline.
- You can't.

213
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,100
- What do you mean? I just did.
- You can't. It's your civic duty.

214
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,430
Ruth-Anne, I'm busy.
I happen to be very, very busy.

215
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,130
Okay, fine.
That'll be $243.52.

216
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,270
For a package of dental floss? That and
the balance on your account comes to...

217
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,280
$243.52.

218
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,650
Cash on the barrelhead.

219
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,910
What happened to my credit line?
It just ran out.

220
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,440
You're joking.
Ruth-Anne, this is extortion.

221
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
All right, all right, fine, look.
Okay, Ruth-Anne, look.

222
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,290
Yes, all right, I will be election
whatchmacallit if it means that much to you.

223
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,660
Only if I can do
the minimum possible.

224
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,290
I knew you'd come around.

225
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,340
Ruth-Anne, I don't understand
this campaign bylaw, do you?

226
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,130
<i>Excuse me?
Oh, you.</i>

227
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,830
If you have any questions
about protocol, Maggie, askJoel.

228
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,140
- Why him?
- He's our new election commissioner.

229
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,080
You're kidding. That's what I said,
and she took away my credit line.

230
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,880
Maggie is the chairman
of the election committee.

231
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,220
Wh-What's the difference between election
commissioner and chairman of the election committee?

232
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,420
<i>The charter's a little obscure
on that point.</i>

233
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,760
But as far as I can make out,
the chairman makes the arrangements,

234
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,660
and the commissioner
oversees those arrangements.

235
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,600
You mean I have to submit
everything for his approval?

236
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,660
Absolutely not.

237
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,760
- Why not?
- She wouldn't stand for it, and neither would I.

238
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,210
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad to see we're
going by the book here. That's right.</i>

239
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,980
<i>So, I go over there. She's
the one who owes me an apology.</i>

240
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,150
But I extend the olive branch,
tell her she can have her stop sign.

241
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,090
What does she do? Throws the
whole thing back in my face.

242
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,020
Yeah, that sounds like Edna.

243
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,650
You can laugh, George, but the
woman is assassinating my character.

244
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,660
Oh, come on, Holling.

245
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,900
Everyone knows that Edna
just sets her jaw now and again.

246
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,170
No one takes her too serious.

247
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,540
You don't think so?
Hell no. You're a shoo-in.

248
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,440
You think?
You got everyone's vote.

249
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,310
Not mine,
but everyone else's I'm sure.

250
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,650
Why not yours?
I think I'll go for the little lady.

251
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,650
But why?

252
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,350
I just can't get worked up
about voting for you.

253
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,260
Worked up? What's getting into a
lather got to do with you voting for me?

254
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,200
Well, you remember that Dodge I used
to drive with the simulated-wood trim?

255
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,200
Yeah. I loved that car.
Had it for 17 years.

256
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,540
<i>When it finally gave up the ghost,
I said, "I'm gonna get me another Dodge."</i>

257
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,740
I went to the dealer, had an
almost-good-as-new one all picked out.

258
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,480
But somehow I just couldn't
get excited about it.

259
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,920
So I went with a Chevy.

260
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,050
Well, that's how it is with me,
with you and Edna.

261
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,250
You got the wife's vote though.

262
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,390
How come?

263
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,120
She says you can't trust women.

264
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,910
Look, Fleischman, you don't wanna
do this. I don't wanna do this.

265
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,440
So let's just do it, okay?
Fine with me.

266
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,500
I am amazed at the bureaucratic
machinery required to stage...

267
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,640
such a totally meaningless event.

268
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,010
<i>It's a joke. You don't think
who's mayor is important?</i>

269
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,050
No, I don't. The town charter clearly
gives the city council all the power.

270
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,490
And from what I can determine, all they do is
argue over taxes once a year, get drunk and go home.

271
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,020
Great. You're the election commissioner,
and you think the whole thing is pointless.

272
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,790
<i>The election is pointless.
I mean, the outcome anyway.</i>

273
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,330
The election itself
may actually be quite fascinating.

274
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,460
What are you talking about?

275
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,800
Demographics.
What?

276
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,430
Gender, race, age,
income, religious beliefs,

277
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,380
all those little hash marks
on the game board of society.

278
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,850
Look, the person who panders to the right cross
section of voters walks away with the pork barrel.

279
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,550
What? You know, elections
have always fascinated me.

280
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,790
As a kid, I used to memorize election results
the way other kids memorized batting averages.

281
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,490
Ask me about any presidential election
in the last 50 years. Go ahead.

282
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,500
Don't be ridiculous.
Come on.

283
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,500
Don't be childish.
Fifty bucks.

284
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,440
Kennedy versus Nixon.
Uh, let's see.

285
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,560
Kennedy, 303 electoral votes,
Nixon, 219.

286
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,170
Popular vote?
Kennedy, 49.9%, Nixon, 49.6.

287
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,180
Bravo.
Thank you.

288
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,840
For your information, Fleischman,
elections are more than just statistics.

289
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,850
It's- It's emotions,
people, ceremony.

290
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,750
You make it sound like a wedding.
Well, it is like a wedding.

291
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,560
Sort of. Well, look, we come together in the
sight of God to commemorate an important event.

292
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,290
And in that respect it's like a wedding. And
like a wedding, there should be a certain decorum.

293
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,960
I mean, Mother said the appearance
should always be memorable.

294
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,900
Let me guess. Mother was very
big in the League of Women Voters.

295
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,570
I don't have to take abuse from someone who spent
his entire childhood memorizing the electoral college.

296
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,470
No, it was not my entire childhood.

297
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,610
The way a polling place looks is important,
whether you think so or not.

298
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,140
- Why do you wear a tie, smart guy?
- I happen to like ties.

299
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,650
It's a symbol, Fleischman.
Your glasses, your tie.

300
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,810
It's all to promote
a certain image,

301
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,550
that of someone who's serious,
mature, professional...

302
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,430
so that people don't see the immature,
spoiled creep lurking inside the outer garment.

303
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,960
Another deep thought from a woman who thinks an
election should be conducted like a fashion layout.

304
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,300
I am not a shallow, insubstantial person just
because I think appearances matter. They do matter.

305
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,070
Fine. You order the dinner napkins,
and I'll handle the ballots.

306
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,300
<i>Fine.
Good.</i>

307
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,500
Good.
Fine.

308
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,780
<i>Don't forget the lace doilies.</i>

309
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,780
Hello, Maggie.
Holling.

310
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,820
Hey, Holling, what's up?

311
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,820
Just came to talk
a little politics, Joel.

312
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,480
Oh, look. Um, I understand
your need to lobby for my vote.

313
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,920
After all, the town doctor
is an influential figure.

314
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,830
But, um, being election commissioner,
I'm afraid I have to remain above the fray.

315
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,630
Actually, Joel, I was hoping
to talk with Marilyn.

316
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,100
Oh.

317
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,360
In private, if you don't mind.

318
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,400
Yeah, no problem.

319
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,670
Thank you, Joel.
I'll only be a minute.

320
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,420
<i>Marilyn?
Yes.</i>

321
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,980
I have been doing
some unofficial polling,

322
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,960
and it appears that a considerable number
of people are thinking of voting for Edna.

323
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,020
I know.
You do?

324
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,860
Well, it has crossed my mind
that this election actually may be closer...

325
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,460
than one might have
reasonably expected.

326
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,630
I know.

327
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,800
Marilyn, I have always considered myself
to be a friend of the Indian people.

328
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,250
Now, what I was wondering
was whether the, uh, Indian people...

329
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,510
consider themselves
to be friends to me.

330
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,520
Uh, what I mean is-
Will we vote for you?

331
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,060
Yes.
Some of us.

332
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,060
Maybe.

333
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,190
Could you be a bit more specific?

334
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,960
Well, is there anything that the, uh
- the tribes would like to discuss with me?

335
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,970
I mean, some sort of problem
or other?

336
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,980
I'll think about it.

337
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,140
Well, um,
let me just ask, Marilyn.

338
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,310
Um, as far as you yourself
are concerned,

339
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,220
have you made up your mind
as to how you are going to vote?

340
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,480
Yes.

341
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,490
And?

342
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,490
It's personal.

343
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,890
<i>My friends, today
when I look out over Cicely,</i>

344
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,430
I see not a town, but a nation's
history written in miniature.

345
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,240
Inscribed in the cracked pavement,
reverberating from every passing flatbed.

346
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,940
<i>Today, every runny nose I see
says "America" to me.</i>

347
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,980
We were outcasts, scum,

348
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,780
the wretched debris
of a hostile, aging world.

349
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,220
But we came here,
we paved roads, we built industries,

350
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,760
powerful institutions.

351
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,920
Of course, along the way, we
exterminated untold indigenous cultures...

352
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,730
and enslaved generations of Africans.

353
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,290
We basically stained
our star-spangled banner...

354
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,100
with a host of sins
that can never be washed clean.

355
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:05,010
But today, we're here to celebrate
the glorious aspects of our past.

356
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,410
A tribute to a nation
of free people,

357
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,540
the country
that Whitman exalted.

358
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,720
<i>"The genius of the United States...</i>

359
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,190
<i>"is not best or most
in its executives or legislators,</i>

360
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,790
<i>"nor in its ambassadors
or authors...</i>

361
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,300
<i>"or colleges or churches
or parlors,</i>

362
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,570
<i>"nor even in its newspapers
or inventors,</i>

363
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,200
but always most
in the common people."

364
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,010
I've never been so proud
to be a Cicelian.

365
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,780
I must go out now and fill my lungs
with the deep clean air of democracy.

366
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,690
Eduardo, my friend.

367
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,000
Hello, Chris.
Something wrong?

368
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,560
Well, I'm a little troubled.
I've been reading up.

369
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,970
And you know, like,
the Declaration of Independence, okay?

370
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,880
<i>It says, "The government shall derive its
just powers from the consent of the governed."</i>

371
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,380
That's a pretty basic concept,
uh, majority rules.

372
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,390
Okay, okay, now.

373
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,550
De Tocqueville says,

374
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,430
<i>"The greatest danger to the American republic
comes from the omnipotence of the majority."</i>

375
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,900
Yeah, pretty interesting Frog,
that Alexis, huh?

376
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,800
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.
Thoreau-

377
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,500
<i>Now Thoreau says, "Any man
more right than his neighbors...</i>

378
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,510
constitutes a majority of one."

379
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,340
Civil disobedience. Man's
last refuge against the state.

380
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,740
So, who's right?

381
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,540
Well, they all are.
Really?

382
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,020
Yeah.
Oh.

383
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,180
So who are you gonna vote for?

384
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,990
Well, as an on-air personality,
I've pledged neutrality.

385
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,690
<i>You know, but an election's more of an
abstract, noncompetitive thing for me anyway.</i>

386
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
Oh. Why?

387
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,500
Well, Ed, the idea of an election is much more
interesting to me than the election itself.

388
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,870
You see, the act of voting...

389
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,640
is in itself
the defining moment.

390
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,300
You know what I mean, Ed?

391
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,400
But to answer your question,
I'm not gonna vote. I can't.

392
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,420
You can't vote?
No.

393
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,540
Why?
I'm a convicted felon, Ed.

394
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,990
I jumped parole in '87, so they
kind of closed the book on me.

395
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,890
Oh, I'm sorry, Chris.
That's all right.

396
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,740
<i>Free beer, fellas.</i>

397
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,000
On the house.
Step right up.

398
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,710
Just don't forget
where you got it on Tuesday.

399
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,510
Holling, I can't stand it anymore.
You gotta take me.

400
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,070
Take you where?
Upstairs.

401
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,250
<i>Here, on the bar, anywhere.
I don't care.</i>

402
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,220
Just take me.
Shelly, pull yourself together.

403
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,750
I can't think about sex
with a bar full of registered voters.

404
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,890
Oh, I'm dying, babe. Shelly, this
is the political fight of my life.

405
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,270
l-There is no way that I can think
about hanky-panky at this point in time.

406
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,430
Oh, hello, Ruth-Anne. How about
a free beer? It's on the house.

407
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,910
No, no, no more, Holling.

408
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,950
- There's been a complaint.
- Complaint? By who?

409
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,810
Me. You can't give away
free beer.

410
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,780
- Oh, hang on.
- Look at the charter, Holling.

411
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:37,050
Of course, the word of law doesn't mean much
to a man who's evaded taxes for 32 years.

412
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,890
Now just slow down a minute, Edna.
Nobody is evading anything.

413
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,450
It was- It was just a misunderstanding
between me and the I.R.S. is all.

414
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,800
Which, by the way, will
be paid in full. Yeah.

415
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,640
Naturally, I respect the law
like everybody else.

416
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,670
Just didn't know there was some stupid rule about
not letting people have a good time at elections.

417
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,510
Thank you for enlightening me.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

418
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,980
I've got a business to run.

419
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,390
Here you go.
Tell me something.

420
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,650
I'm not a vengeful person,
am I, Maurice?

421
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,190
You have your bellicose moments,
Holling, but, uh, on the whole,

422
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,530
I'd say you exhibit
a mild-mannered demeanor.

423
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,900
Why?
Maurice.

424
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:30,540
Two days ago, if Edna Hancock
had been elected mayor,

425
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,810
I might have been able
to live with it.

426
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,010
Today, I'd rather
be treed by hounds.

427
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,150
I don't just want to
beat Edna Hancock,

428
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,390
I want to destroy her.

429
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,400
I want to fold her in two.

430
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,800
I want to make her suffer.

431
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,940
Can I get you anything else?

432
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,900
No.

433
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,450
<i>Okay, uh, move it to the right.
What?</i>

434
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,450
<i>Left.
All right.</i>

435
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,450
Uh, too much.

436
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,680
Okay, up.
Up? More up?

437
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,920
Yeah, over a little.
Where?

438
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,650
Um, down.
It was down.

439
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,630
Okay, okay, hold it there.
Let me look.

440
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,630
O'Connell, my arms
are killing me!

441
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,100
All right, move it over a little.
Look.

442
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,930
Over is a preposition.
It is not a direction.

443
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,940
<i>Hey, what are you doing?
It's done. I'm finished.</i>

444
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,530
<i>It's not level. It's not supposed
to be level. It's bunting.</i>

445
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,540
It's supposed to drape. It's
bunting drapes. All right, all right.

446
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,780
Okay, what do you think for the
podium, huh? Royal blue or aquamarine?

447
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,080
You know, I think you've lost your mind.
It's a debate, not a cotillion.

448
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,880
Fleischman, for once in your life,
can you just pretend to be a human being?

449
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,950
Do you think anyone actually cares
what color crepe paper you use?

450
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,650
Yes. They may not realize it,
but color creates a mood, a feeling.

451
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,660
Oh, well, maybe
we should have piped in music.

452
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,220
<i>Maybe we should. What's
color anyway, huh, Fleischman?</i>

453
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,260
Look. Are we seriously gonna have an argument
over the nature of the color spectrum?

454
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,860
<i>Light. Color is light.
I'll take your word for it.</i>

455
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,210
And light is energy. Different colors are
light traveling at different frequencies.

456
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,340
You change the color of the room,
you change the mood.

457
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,250
Wait, I'll go and get my crystals.

458
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,810
<i>You can't admit I'm right just
because I'm a woman. Right about what?</i>

459
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,080
It's not like everything can be reduced
to a question of glands, O'Connell.

460
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,490
<i>No?
No.</i>

461
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,690
Let me tell you something. If a man had asked for that
stop sign, it would have been done a long time ago.

462
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,920
<i>What? Why do you think
we're here, Fleischman?</i>

463
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,330
What do you think this is all about?
Empowerment.

464
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,700
<i>Empowerment? And the more
Edna Hancocks we have,</i>

465
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,760
the fewerJoel Fleischmans
we have to listen to.

466
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,810
Oh.

467
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,310
<i>"Fellow citizens,
we cannot escape history.</i>

468
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,400
<i>"The fiery trial
through which we pass...</i>

469
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,580
will light us down, in honor
or dishonor, to the last generation."

470
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,580
Abe Lincoln,
ladies and gentlemen.

471
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,820
But the sentiment goes ditto
for your K-Bear correspondent.

472
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,580
Democracy is not
a spectator sport.

473
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,690
That means your presence is gonna be
required tonight at the candidates' debate.

474
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,320
Be worthy of your heritage.
It's likeJustice Holmes said,

475
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,590
<i>"It is required that a man...</i>

476
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,970
<i>"shall share in the passion
and action of his time,</i>

477
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,570
at peril of being judged
not to have lived."

478
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,370
Enough said.
Debate, 7:30. Be there.

479
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,470
<i>We have heard opening statements
from both candidates.</i>

480
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,280
Now we turn
to questions and answers.

481
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,940
The chair will recognize
questions from the floor.

482
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,490
Dorothy?

483
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,950
I've lived here 10 years, Edna.

484
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,480
You've never given me the time
of day. Why should I vote for you?

485
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,160
You have one minute
to respond, Edna.

486
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,830
I'm a private person
by nature, Dorothy.

487
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,840
And by choice.

488
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,670
People bore me as a rule.

489
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,300
To tell you the truth, the thought of having to make
small talk with most of the people in this room...

490
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,040
nauseates me,
and that includes you, Dorothy.

491
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:56,680
About the last place any of us thought I'd
end up is here tonight asking for your vote.

492
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,950
But we can all thank
Holling Vincoeur for that.

493
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,580
Given my generally dim view
of civilization,

494
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,030
it took an unusual,
powerful display of incompetence...

495
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,900
for me to be forced to seek
public office. Now hold on.

496
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,960
You're out of order, Holling.
She keeps taking cheap shots.

497
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,800
<i>We all know that if you want something
in this society, you have to go after it.</i>

498
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,400
I want a stop sign. I don't know
what the hell all you people want,

499
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,420
but if you make me mayor
and let me know your heart's desire,

500
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,510
I guarantee it won't take me
five years to get my yea or nay on it.

501
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,580
But once you do, you can be
damn sure I'll abide by my word.

502
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,320
Holling, you have 30 seconds
to respond.

503
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,130
I say just because one person
has a bee in her bonnet...

504
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,570
is no reason to make a sudden
change in the way things run.

505
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,270
<i>I was married
for 12 years, Holling.</i>

506
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,670
That was a lifetime.

507
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,840
You don't think
23 years in office is enough?

508
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,110
I think it shows the people know
a good thing when they've got one.

509
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,620
The mayor has to consider everyone, not
just a few cranks looking for special favors.

510
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,780
<i>Time's up.
Next question.</i>

511
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,850
You there in the back.

512
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,660
Uh, I was wondering
if the candidates saw the stop sign...

513
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,360
as a Jeffersonian or Hamiltonian
expression of democracy in action?

514
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,300
What kind of
a stupid question is that? Sit!

515
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,140
Chris.
Well, I just wanna applaud y'all...

516
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,870
for plunging headfirst
into the great river of democracy.

517
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,750
I mean, our election
is just a small tributary.

518
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,590
You know, a singular thread in the greater
fabric, linked by tradition, love and honor...

519
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,120
to the swift, clear bracing waters
from which our traditions are founded.

520
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,150
<i>But I'm just saying, let's take a little
time out here to slap ourselves on the back,</i>

521
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,030
<i>give a kiss on the cheek,
a hale and hearty fare-thee-well...</i>

522
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,100
to all our fine noble Cicelian citizens.

523
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,040
Ruth-Anne, candidates,
you're happening.

524
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,910
<i>Thank you, Chris.
Did you have a question?</i>

525
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,710
Well, actually, Edna, what I had
in mind were some lines from Basho:

526
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,910
<i>"On a withered branch,
a crow has alighted:</i>

527
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,010
Nightfall in autumn."

528
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,090
Uh, Holling, you have 60 seconds
to respond to that.

529
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,370
Uh, for the life of me, Chris, I
haven't a clue what you're talking about.

530
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,460
<i>Hold it.!</i>

531
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,870
There's something wrong here.

532
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,840
Something terribly, terribly wrong.

533
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,850
It's getting away from us.

534
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,680
Maurice, do you have a question?

535
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,350
I have to go now.

536
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:53,250
<i>If my stop sign's such a bad idea, Holling, how come
you offered to give me one if I'd pull out of the race?</i>

537
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:57,420
I did no such thing. I merely
suggested that we call off the election,

538
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,400
save everybody
a lot of time and trouble.

539
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,430
- You said you'd give me a stop sign.
- For crying out loud, Edna.

540
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,940
That was a peace offering,
not a bribe.

541
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,650
<i>Maurice.
Good evening, Edna.</i>

542
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,990
You people put on
quite a show tonight.

543
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,460
Hmm. You left early.

544
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,470
Yeah, I kinda lost
my bearings.

545
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,300
You know, Edna, I remember when
there was just you and me out here.

546
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:41,000
You on your 12,000 acres,
me on my 15,000...

547
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,410
and just that rickety old fence
over there between us.

548
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,810
There wasn't any fence
till I made you put one in.

549
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,820
That's true.

550
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,820
But I wasn't aware
you were my neighbor...

551
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,480
until you drew my attention
to that fact.

552
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,190
I remember when you shot at me with
that beautiful Remington Over-And-Under.

553
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,320
I knew we were gonna
get along just fine.

554
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,100
And when I heard
you laid bare the tundra...

555
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,130
with your drilling
and logging operation,

556
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,770
I knew I'd found a kindred spirit.

557
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,470
It takes big people
to tame a big land.

558
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,140
No one seems to understand
that anymore. That's right.

559
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,850
We came here with nothing
but our dreams and investment capital.

560
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,860
And now look at it.

561
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,660
We've got free enterprise blooming...

562
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,290
where there was nothing
but virgin wilderness.

563
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,130
We came here to live large,

564
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,040
to breathe free.

565
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,040
And, by God, we did it.

566
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,570
But our dream was flawed, Edna.

567
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,580
How's that?

568
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,610
Two trappers, arguing about
beaver pelts in St. Botolph's Town.

569
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,090
The next day,
there's busing in Boston.

570
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,590
You lost me.

571
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,420
I looked to the future,

572
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:10,360
and I saw tract housing,

573
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,700
shopping malls,
a covered sports arena.

574
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,000
But what I failed to see
was the baggage that goes with it.

575
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,070
<i>I had a vision
of the future tonight, Edna.</i>

576
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,810
With bureaucrats,

577
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,180
planning commissions,
zoning boards,

578
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,690
<i>special interest groups, people
telling us what we can and cannot do.</i>

579
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,630
And it all starts
with one single stop sign.

580
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,790
You want me
to pull out of the race?

581
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:48,200
No. I thought I did,
but I don't.

582
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,300
No. If it's not you today,
it'll be somebody else tomorrow.

583
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,280
Once I get my stop sign, this whole thing
ends as far as I'm concerned, Maurice.

584
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,050
You let the genie
out of the bottle, Edna.

585
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,460
You can't put him back in.

586
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,360
<i>Come on, O'Connell.
They're all out there waiting.</i>

587
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,430
<i>Ready?</i>

588
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,500
Not yet.
Not yet?

589
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,510
Not yet.

590
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,780
Something's missing.
What's missing?

591
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,780
O'Connell, these people
have six hours to vote.

592
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,940
Flowers.
What?

593
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,780
<i>Flowers.
Go get some, will you?</i>

594
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,720
Not formal. Some daisies maybe. A
splash of something. I'll get a vase.

595
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,850
Where am I gonna get flowers?
It's 20 degrees out.

596
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,490
<i>In a minute!</i>

597
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,090
Okay. How do I look?
How do you look?

598
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,130
Mm-hmm.
You look beautiful.

599
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,790
Just like you always do.
Really?

600
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:59,670
Yes. Can I let them in now?
Yes. No. No, wait, wait, wait.

601
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,940
There.
You look handsome.

602
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,170
I do?
Mm-hmm.

603
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,510
Thanks. Let's go ahead. Open the door.

604
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,490
It's cold outside.
Hi. Sorry.

605
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,750
<i>When I was nine,
I was fishing with my Uncle Roy Bower,</i>

606
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,290
<i>when he suddenly
smacked his forehead.</i>

607
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,330
<i>Told me to cut my line.</i>

608
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,560
<i>Hejust remembered
it was election day.</i>

609
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,530
<i>That was '72,
Nixon versus McGovern.</i>

610
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,300
<i>No contest, really, but Roy had
been to Vietnam. He hated Nixon.</i>

611
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,070
<i>After he voted,
he put his arm around my shoulder.</i>

612
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,140
<i>"Well, '"he said,
"guess I showed him. '"</i>

613
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,240
Chris.

614
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:50,250
<i>"Rejoice with me, for I have
found my sheep which was lost."</i>

615
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,790
Oh, I wish I could
give you a ballot.

616
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,850
I can only gaze upon the promised
land, Ruth-Anne, never enter.

617
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,860
<i>Anyway, I was wondering
if I could hang out a while...</i>

618
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,120
and catch the vibes of democracy
doing its thing?

619
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,160
Feel free to graze.

620
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,260
And then come sit by me.
Okay.

621
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,710
What is that all about?

622
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,540
Luke, chapter 15:

623
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,810
<i>"For this my son was dead,
and he is alive again;</i>

624
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,810
he was lost, and he is found." Hmm.

625
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,290
<i>The return of the prodigal voter.</i>

626
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,620
<i>I'm wasted, people.
I'm drained.</i>

627
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:35,360
<i>A good drain though, you know. Like a wedding
that's boogied on till the early morning light.</i>

628
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,690
Whew!

629
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,630
Well, I guess it's time
for the official results, huh?

630
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,400
In-studio guest, special courier
Ed Chigliak, ladies and gentlemen.

631
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,470
The moment
we've all been waiting for.

632
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,710
For Holling Vincoeur, 247 votes.

633
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,410
For Edna Hancock, 255 votes.

634
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,480
The winner by eight votes,
Edna Hancock.

635
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,920
<i>Pax vobiscum.
Congratulations, Edna.</i>

636
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,830
<i>We did it, Ed.</i>

637
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,990
It worked.
We did?

638
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,430
Absolutely.
What worked?

639
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,130
The grand idea, buddy.
The process.

640
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,930
Huh.

641
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,340
Ed, we've just witnessed
a peaceful transition in government.

642
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,940
Do you realize
how miraculous that is?

643
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,610
I think so.
You think so?

644
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,150
Listen to me.

645
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,210
Despite Russia,
despite Germany,

646
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,590
the mass of people on this planet
still live under the yoke...

647
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,920
of some autocratic
or totalitarian regime.

648
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,450
Do you hear me?
Today, tiny Cicely, Alaska stood up...

649
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,970
<i>and put another "W"
in the win category for democracy.</i>

650
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,730
Well, all right! Hey!
Well, all right.

651
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,240
Let me take that, Holling.
I can manage it, Dave.

652
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,820
Okay.

653
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,960
Thanks, Holling.

654
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,070
All right,
listen to me, everybody.

655
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,300
<i>I've hadjust about enough
of this moping and carrying on.</i>

656
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,000
Nobody died.
It was an election.

657
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,640
I lost.

658
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,580
Now let's hear some music
out of that jukebox.

659
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,150
I'm so proud of you, babe.

660
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,590
Folks over there
need a pitcher, Shelly.

661
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,750
Don't hold it in, Holling. You
don't have to be brave for me.

662
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,920
Shelly, I'm fine.

663
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,130
Cross your heart? American
eagle over and out?

664
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,640
Uh-huh. Well, at least my
hormones are no longer raging.

665
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,370
<i>For a while there,
my work was really suffering.</i>

666
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,780
<i>Here you go, Jake. Enjoy.</i>

667
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,680
Well, I took one on the chin
today, Maurice.

668
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,380
But don't salt your scotch
with tears on my account.

669
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,790
Truth is, I'm kind of relieved.

670
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,090
The burdens of office
can get awful heavy after 23 years.

671
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,530
Doesn't it bother you at all that 255 of your
countrymen elected to stab you in the back today?

672
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,930
I never thought about it like that.

673
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,400
87% turnout.

674
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,030
What is happening to us?
Why didn't they stay home?

675
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,510
People want change, I guess.

676
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,510
Why?

677
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,710
This town, as we've known it,
is fading away.

678
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,380
It's only a matter of time
till you and I are memories.

679
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,350
Maurice, why haven't you
ever run for office?

680
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,950
Well, I like to be
behind the scenes,

681
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,720
pushing buttons,
pulling strings.

682
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,900
Truth of the matter is
people don't like me.

683
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,200
Oh, they respect me.

684
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,830
Some even fear me.

685
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,070
But they don't like me.

686
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,870
Excuse me, Maurice.

687
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,370
Congratulations, Edna.

688
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:17,180
Can I buy you a drink?
All right.

689
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,210
Another week and I'd have wiped
the floor with you. Like hell.

690
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,330
You haven't said anything
for quite a while, Ed.

691
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,210
Ruth-Anne, do you realize
that the mass of people...

692
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,270
still live under some autocratic
or totalitarian type of regime?

693
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,280
Well, I suppose that's true.

694
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,280
It'll make you think.

695
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,350
Ed, are you all right?

696
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,330
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?

697
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,090
Yeah. I feel-

698
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,600
What?
Well,

699
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,940
manly.

700
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,980
Like a man.

701
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,070
Ruth-Anne, do you realize
I did something today,

702
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,050
well, that I've never done before.

703
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,960
And it was kinda like
the first time I was with Lightfeather.

704
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,090
Well, only that was
just between me and her.

705
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,070
But afterwards I felt,
well, light.

706
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:43,730
And this, well,
this was between me and Cicely.

707
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,740
But I don't feel light at all.

708
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,170
I feel... bigger.

709
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,620
So, I'd say we did
pretty well tonight.

710
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,250
Yeah?
Yeah.

711
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,790
You all right?
Yeah.

712
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,850
I just always worry about things
when they're over, you know?

713
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,060
Was everything all right?
Did people have a good time?

714
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,070
I guess it's just a female thing.

715
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,230
Hey, 87% turnout.
No, uh, late precinct returns.

716
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,400
No disputed ballots.

717
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,380
Yeah, I'd say
we did pretty well.

718
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,910
Good.

719
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,850
Hey, how about
if I buy you dinner?

720
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,010
Uh, well, I'm kind of tired.
Come on.

721
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,890
Mm, really?
Your treat?

722
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,890
My treat.

723
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,330
Well, I can't pass that up.

724
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,570
<i>"We are not enemies, but friends.</i>

725
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,700
<i>"We must not be enemies.</i>

726
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:55,510
Though passion may have strained, it must
not break the bonds of our affection."

727
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,570
Lincoln's words
to a divided nation.

728
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:01,810
My counsel to a divided Cicely.

729
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,910
Holling Vincoeur, you know you're still
first in the hearts of your fellow Cicelians.

730
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:11,080
Today, people simply said they just
want Edna to run things for a while.

731
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,920
Hey, that's cool.
I mean, if it doesn't work out,

732
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,490
we'll have another election, right?

733
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,500
It's not perfect, but it's the
best system anybody's come up with.

734
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,500
It's likeJustice Holmes said,

735
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:27,060
<i>"The Constitution's an experiment
like life's an experiment."</i>

736
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,540
<i>Apropos of that, the final words tonight
belong to Thomas Jefferson,</i>

737
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:35,450
<i>third president of these United States,
