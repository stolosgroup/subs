1
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:10,122
Tulips?
Crocuses.

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,658
I thought it might be nice
to watch 'em bloom.

3
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:16,389
Excellent breakfast, Holling.
Fresh eggs.

4
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:19,626
You know, there's nothing
quite so satisfying as fresh eggs.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,965
You can poach 'em, you can scramble
'em, you can fry 'em, you can devil 'em.

6
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:25,027
And you can't go wrong
with a pickled egg.

7
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:28,074
I suppose not.
What do I owe here?

8
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,508
<i>No, no. Didn't you see our sign?
"Free breakfast any hour."</i>

9
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:34,376
It's our spring starter- eggs all day.

10
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:37,815
It's hard to believe
that another year has gone by.

11
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:41,411
I'm gonna have to change my wardrobe
- get out some pastels.

12
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,082
Hey, that's the spirit.
Thanks for the freebie, Holling.

13
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:47,684
Now, you come back and get a free
fried egg sandwich for lunch. Okay.

14
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,730
Give me that java there.
Thank you, Dave.

15
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:53,561
You're welcome.
Can I sweeten this up for you, Maurice?

16
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:56,431
I couldn't drink the first cup. Why
the hell would I want another one?

17
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,869
Something wrong with it?
No, it's just the same.

18
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:03,433
The same old dishwater swill you've been
serving up day in and day out for 25 years.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,444
Some people are partial to it.

20
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:08,003
Well, it's the last cup of it I'll drink.

21
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:11,244
There's a whole world of coffee
out there, Holling.

22
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:15,448
There's French roast. There's vanilla
bean. There's Jamaican blue mountain.

23
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:17,820
Open your eyes, for heaven's sake.

24
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:20,758
<i>Order up.</i>

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

26
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:15,008
<i>Greetings, Cicely, on this most exceedingly
beautiful spring morning.</i>

27
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:18,141
A morning swollen with new life.

28
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:22,587
A morning on which, if I had the
voice, I would let loose with song.

29
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:25,181
Ah!

30
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:28,921
It's hard to believe just a few
short weeks ago at this hour,

31
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:33,989
we were eating our cornflakes
in the wintery dark, and now-

32
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,468
Well, it's still kind of dim out there.

33
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:40,097
But I can see the golden glow
of Apollo's chariot,

34
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,368
waiting in the wings,
about to make its entrance.

35
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:45,775
Winter's on the lam.
Ain't no doubt about it.

36
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,679
Like my late Uncle Roy Bower,

37
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:51,615
whose arthritic knee unfailingly
predicted the onset of rain,

38
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,620
yours truly, Chris in the Morning,
is blessed with allergies...

39
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:58,021
that herald the vernal equinox.

40
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:05,195
Yes indeedy. The marsh
marigolds are definitely abloom.

41
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,132
Got a little P.S.A. here.

42
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,329
Last night a brown bear
scavenging for a midnight snack...

43
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:13,770
was spotted at the corner
of Spruce and Main.

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,809
The mighty ursus is hungry
after his long siesta,

45
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,936
and no one needs a confrontation.

46
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,344
So keep those trash cans covered.

47
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,644
I'm gonna play this one for me.

48
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,583
Hey.
That's repugnant.

49
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,987
What's that? Slobbering
over the airwaves like that.

50
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,082
Do you think people like
listening to your phlegm?

51
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,095
- It's spring, Maurice.
- I don't give a damn. Take an antihistamine.

52
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,064
<i>And play something else.
I'm sick of that.</i>

53
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,625
- Well, I just got that.
- Well, it sounds like everything else you play.

54
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:45,864
<i>Get rid of it.
Okay.</i>

55
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:51,544
Now, when did you
first notice this?

56
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,307
Couple days ago. Holling was
gonna drive us over to Kipnuk.

57
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,315
They got a new band
at the Bali Hai.

58
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,977
So I decided to do my nails
French style.

59
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,748
It's kind of a hassle, you know.
Not like a regular manicure.

60
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,812
So it's two days ago?

61
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,553
You gotta put on a base coat, then the
white tips, and after that the clear pink.

62
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,653
<i>Now, is the rash anywhere else?
Mm-mmm.</i>

63
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,097
The band sucked canal water.
Retread Guns N' Roses.

64
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,101
And who wants to be them?

65
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,194
I mean, can you believe Slash?

66
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:21,640
Wh-What? Slash?

67
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,575
Playing for MichaelJackson.

68
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:27,636
Shelly, how about we just stick to
the business at hand?

69
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,239
Um, now, did you ever
put anything on it?

70
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,308
On what?
On the rash.

71
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,319
No.

72
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:37,982
Are you mad, Dr. Fleischman?
Mad? No. Why?

73
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:40,549
I don't know.
You seem kind of ticked off.

74
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:44,461
Shelly, what you're observing in my
behavior is my professional detachment.

75
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:46,465
I'm trying to conduct
a medical examination.

76
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:49,832
You come to me, your physician, with a
problem. I'm doing my best to diagnose it.

77
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:53,669
Oh. You have what's
called contact dermatitis.

78
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,970
Oh. Sounds crummy.

79
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,476
No, not really.
It's also known as dishpan hands.

80
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:02,208
You work in a restaurant. You wash
dishes. You irritate your skin.

81
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,944
It's very common,
easily treatable.

82
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:06,952
I never got it before.

83
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,979
Well, just put a little cream on it, wear
gloves, and it should clear up right away.

84
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,025
Okay.
Okay.

85
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,084
Bye, Dr. Fleischman.
Bye, Shelly.

86
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:21,097
<i>Bye-bye, Marilyn.
See you, Shel.</i>

87
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,931
Hey, Maggie.

88
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,770
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

89
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,779
Six pounds, eight ounces.

90
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,907
I just can't believe it.

91
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,851
What's that?

92
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,049
A girl I went to high school with, Elizabeth
Schroeder. She used to be Elizabeth Kerry.

93
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:47,287
She just had a baby.
Nice.

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,157
I didn't even know she was married.

95
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,096
Boy or girl?
What?

96
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,328
The baby. Was it a boy or a girl?
Oh, I don't even know. Let's see.

97
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,700
It's a boy.
All right.

98
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,172
Hmm.
I wonder how she met him.

99
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:06,370
It was probably in the delivery room.
Of course, unless she had it at home.

100
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,676
No, I mean her husband.

101
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:10,909
<i>Oh.
I never meet anybody.</i>

102
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:15,080
And even if I do, it's never someone I
even conceive of having a relationship with.

103
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,080
Why is it all the good guys
are taken, Ed?

104
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:20,126
Well-

105
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:23,526
<i>It's 'cause I missed the first round.
That's it.</i>

106
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,530
I mean, these things are cyclical.

107
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:28,533
<i>All the men I'd ever be interested in
are already married.</i>

108
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,161
So I guess I'll just have to be patient.

109
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,171
Wait for the divorces.

110
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,279
<i>Okay, see you next week.</i>

111
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,551
Uh, hello.
Ah. Dr. Fleischman.

112
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:49,452
I'm Leonard Quinhagak.
Oh, how do you do?

113
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,854
Marilyn's cousin.
Oh.

114
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,018
The healer.
Oh. Healer.

115
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,528
You mean like medicine man?
Right.

116
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:59,030
Huh. Well, uh, have a seat,
Mr. Quinhagak.

117
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,033
Uh-huh. Please. Leonard.

118
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,968
All right.
Uh, what seems to be the problem?

119
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:08,303
I, uh, wouldn't really
call it a problem.

120
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,740
Joel- May I call you Joel?

121
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,744
Okay.

122
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:16,748
Uh, I've been practicing medicine
since I was 12.

123
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,750
Almost 30 years.

124
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:22,481
My training has been very orthodox-
uh, very traditional.

125
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,080
But, you know, lately,
I've begun to think that...

126
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,353
my approach has been
too narrow-

127
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:30,828
that I should open myself up to
alternative forms, less holistic.

128
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:35,732
Huh. Maybe it's biologic, but
at my age, you begin to, uh,

129
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,794
question things,
reevaluate your life.

130
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:41,739
Not just professionally,
but, uh, everything.

131
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,299
<i>Even my marriage.</i>

132
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:46,607
<i>It's as if once the kids
had left the house,</i>

133
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,011
my wife and I had nothing
to say to each other.

134
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,073
Uh,

135
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:54,086
Leonard, is there something specific
that you might have wanted?

136
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,679
I'd like to work on
my suturing technique.

137
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,850
But, uh, other than that, no.

138
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:04,863
I want to observe- uh, get an overview of,
uh, so-called, uh, conventional medicine.

139
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,764
Uh, don't worry.
I won't get in your way.

140
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,166
Just forget I'm here.
Um, Leonard,

141
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:14,502
I'm afraid that you wouldn't learn
a lot about conventional medicine here.

142
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:18,635
I have a very uninteresting practice.
It's boring actually. It's mind-numbing.

143
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:22,374
Uh, forgive me, Joel.
l-I seem to be at a loss.

144
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:24,848
How's that?
I thought this was all arranged.

145
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:28,183
Arranged? Marilyn said you
were delighted to have me come.

146
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:30,518
Oh, Marilyn said that? Huh.

147
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,115
Um, yeah, right.

148
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:35,991
Um, would you excuse me
for just one minute?

149
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,553
Of course.

150
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,158
Marilyn, your cousin-
Leonard.

151
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:45,227
Yeah. I don't recall saying
he could observe me. You did.

152
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,034
When? When did I say that?

153
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,870
Last week I asked you
when you were playing Game Boy.

154
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,810
You asked me when I was
playing Game Boy? You said yes.

155
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,006
I was playing Game Boy.
I wasn't listening.

156
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,345
I would have said yes to anything-
to gum surgery.

157
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,318
You said yes.

158
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:03,184
Great.

159
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,325
Hon, you coming to bed soon?

160
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:10,851
<i>I'll be out in a jiffy. You lock the
Dumpster so the bears don't get in?</i>

161
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,898
I did indeed.

162
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,833
There's my big bear.

163
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:19,360
Shel, I thinkJoel meant you only
need gloves when you wash dishes.

164
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:22,840
I know. It's just that
my hands look so icky.

165
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,843
Here I come.

166
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:28,176
Oh. Ooh.
These sheets are so scratchy.

167
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,239
You been scarfing
saltines in bed again?

168
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:33,410
No, ma'am.
Oh. Hey. Easy does it.

169
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,080
I'm- I'm sorry.
Ow.

170
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,919
What is it?
Don't be so rough.

171
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,926
l-I barely touched you.

172
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:44,020
Holling.
l-I brushed my teeth.

173
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:48,090
It's not that. You smell
normal. It just hurts.

174
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,897
Hurts? My breath hurts?

175
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,202
It's hot and windy. It feels like I'm
standing in front of a blast furnace.

176
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,835
Shelly, what's going on?

177
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,879
I don't know.

178
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,210
Can't you just kiss me
without breathing on me?

179
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,274
I can try.

180
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:09,578
No, I can't.

181
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,886
It feels like a zillion
pins and needles.

182
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,722
Shelly-
Ooh. No.

183
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,728
I'm sorry, Holling.

184
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:19,026
I don't know what's the matter.

185
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:22,590
Everything feels so-
What?

186
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,570
So much more.

187
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:22,152
<i>Bears.</i>

188
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:45,215
Damn.

189
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:56,584
<i>Listen, Cicely. Can you hear it?
Spring's sweet cantata.</i>

190
00:11:57,597 --> 00:12:00,157
<i>The stains of grass
pushing through the snow.</i>

191
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:03,259
<i>The song ofbuds
swelling on the vine.</i>

192
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:06,271
<i>The tender timpani
of a baby robin's heart.</i>

193
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,574
Hey. Continuing our bear watch,

194
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:14,136
Maggie O'Connell has spotted
an ursine prowler in her front yard.

195
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:16,909
Spring. Spring, spring, spring.

196
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:20,544
Naturally, this young man's fancy
turns to thoughts of death.

197
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,453
<i>Not death in the "That's all, folks"
kind of death,</i>

198
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:26,151
but death in the cyclical sense, like...

199
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,659
high tide, low tide,
sunrise, sunset.

200
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:31,492
You know, that kind of thing.

201
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:34,556
Bears, which we've all had
on our minds lately-

202
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:37,432
They really say it all, you know.
Their-

203
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,372
Their deathlike sleep in the sepulchre of
the cave, followed by their awakening rebirth.

204
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,876
<i>Excuse moi.</i>

205
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,412
Ahhh.

206
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,383
Death and resurrection
- something bears and deities have in common.

207
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:57,389
Point of fact: In many cultures,
bears themselves were considered gods.

208
00:12:57,457 --> 00:13:00,517
You know, 60-
60,000 years ago,

209
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:04,723
way before Mithra,
before the burning bush,

210
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,731
Christ, Buddha,

211
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,996
what do you think our Neolithic
brothers lied prostrate to?

212
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,003
Hmm?

213
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,266
Bears.

214
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,400
Keep it covered, guys.
They're out there.

215
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,115
<i>Shelly?</i>

216
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,117
<i>Holling.
What is it?</i>

217
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:28,153
<i>Are you all right?
No.!</i>

218
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:30,155
I've been nuked.
My.

219
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:33,624
Have you been under
that sunlamp again?

220
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:36,856
Look at me.
This is not a sunburn.

221
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:39,762
Holling, I know sunburn,
and this is definitely not.

222
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:42,824
Now, just take it easy, honey.
M-Maybe-Your skin's just a little dry.

223
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:46,463
A little dry?
I'm disintegrating.

224
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,305
God! What's happening to me?

225
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:53,311
I look like Swamp Thing!

226
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,871
Look. It's all over my arms
and my face.

227
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,076
Check my back.
Is it on my back?

228
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:02,878
Oh, Lord.

229
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:05,150
Oh.

230
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:08,057
Holling.

231
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:20,665
Great.

232
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,543
I can't believe it.

233
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:47,562
- Hi.
- Need any help?

234
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:50,363
Well, uh,

235
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,370
yes.

236
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,736
Yeah. Yes, I do, actually.

237
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,173
Well, you better get in.

238
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,404
Sorry?
I'll push.

239
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:02,208
Thanks.

240
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,226
Okay.

241
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,237
Hey, listen. Thanks.

242
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:27,966
<i>I really appreciate it.
Be careful.</i>

243
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,974
<i>I will.</i>

244
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,203
Bye.

245
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:56,494
See, it's often difficult to make the correct
diagnosis until a condition fully manifests itself.

246
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,764
You ever have measles?
Uh-huh.

247
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,305
<i>Yeah?</i>

248
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:02,307
Yeah?

249
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:05,843
Morning.
Hi.

250
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:09,176
Hi. Uh, Shelly, this is Leonard.
He's observing me for a few days.

251
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,944
However, if you prefer
he weren't present, it's okay.

252
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:14,282
Are you a doctor?
Healer.

253
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:17,117
How about you?
I'm a waitress.

254
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:20,522
Oh, really? My sister's a
waitress over in King Salmon.

255
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:24,359
<i>Boy, she's on her feet all day.
Never stops. It's hard work.</i>

256
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,490
Tell me about it.
Lots of stress too.

257
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:30,729
People never let you know
when they like something.

258
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:33,533
They only complain.
Oh, yeah.

259
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,540
<i>Rag, rag, rag.
Excuse me.</i>

260
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:38,975
<i>Um, have you been eating
differently? Any new foods?</i>

261
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:44,672
Same old, same old. Well, sometimes I
sneak a pack of Sour Patch Kids, but-

262
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,048
Different soap?
Detergent? Perfume?

263
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:50,020
I got new boots.
Hey, those are nice.

264
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,320
<i>- Thanks.
- My older daughter's got a birthday coming up.</i>

265
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:57,385
She'd love a pair of boots like that.
Forty-six bucks, plus shipping and handling.

266
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,829
<i>And they also come
in burgundy and black.</i>

267
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,959
Drop by The Brick. I'll give you
the catalog. Thank you. I'll do that.

268
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,367
May I finish, please?

269
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:07,565
Thank you.

270
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,234
I believe it's nothing more
than an allergic reaction.

271
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,972
Nothing to worry about,
but I'm gonna give you some cortisone.

272
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,571
I want you to rub it
on the affected areas twice a day.

273
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,810
Okay.
Okay.

274
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:20,943
Nice meeting you.
Yeah. You too.

275
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,921
And, uh, thanks for
the tip on the boots.

276
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,549
Sure.

277
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,593
Shelly seems pretty well adjusted.

278
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,357
She makes good eye contact.

279
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,864
How does she get on with animals?

280
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,867
With animals?

281
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:38,335
I have no idea.
What, you don't ask?

282
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,168
No.
Oh, I see.

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,142
Does, uh-
Does she garden?

284
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,645
Look, Leonard.
l- I don't mind you sitting in, really.

285
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:51,877
But if we could just stick to medicine,
okay? I'm on a schedule here. Yeah?

286
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:54,283
Yeah, okay.
Next.

287
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:56,287
See, I like that.

288
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:59,791
It's wonderful how quickly
you can make a diagnosis.

289
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:02,760
I, on the other hand,
spend hours with patients.

290
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:05,697
Sometimes days.

291
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:08,325
I go fishing with them.
I eat with them.

292
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,562
I spend the night in their homes.

293
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,970
It's not just time-consuming.
It's taxing.

294
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,531
Yes, I can imagine.
Thank you. Next.

295
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,703
Next!
Come on, Marilyn.

296
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,940
There is no next.

297
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:23,948
Oh.

298
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:25,916
<i>Ah. Okay.</i>

299
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:35,893
Can I help you, Maurice?
I'm looking for some aftershave lotion.

300
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:39,624
You just bought a case of Old Spice.
I know that, Ruth-Anne.

301
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:44,931
I was slapping some on my face this morning,
just like I've done every day for 30 years,

302
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:47,097
and it seemed wrong.

303
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:50,572
<i>What's this "Bowling Green"
stuff here?</i>

304
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,770
Oh, Geoffrey Beene.

305
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:56,008
All the big designers are making
aftershave lotion now.

306
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,675
Yeah. I don't know.

307
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,481
I don't know what I'm looking for.
There's-

308
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,988
Everything's the same.
There's no surprises.

309
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:07,753
I only have so much
shelf space, Maurice.

310
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:12,288
<i>All right. I'll take it.
Don't do it on my account.</i>

311
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,395
You know,

312
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,166
I loved boot camp.

313
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,207
Boot camp?
Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:19:22,274 --> 00:19:24,242
U.S.M.C., Parris Island.

315
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,212
Everybody else bitched and moaned,
but I loved it.

316
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,214
You know why?

317
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:32,273
I haven't the faintest idea.

318
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,717
Because you got to start over.

319
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:38,188
The corps divested you
of your civilian self.

320
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:41,715
It shaved your head,
took away your clothes.

321
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:45,252
Tore you down
and then built you up again.

322
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:50,030
You walked in one man,
and you walked out another.

323
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:53,469
Everybody should do that
once in a while, Ruth-Anne.

324
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,666
Or they get stagnant.

325
00:19:56,675 --> 00:20:00,805
Trouble is...
I'm too old for boot camp.

326
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,814
Mm-hmm.

327
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:10,146
I don't know.
What is it?

328
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:40,451
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

329
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,079
I was passing by,
and I saw your truck.

330
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,249
<i>Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

331
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:48,987
l-I don't normally
greet visitors with this gun.

332
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,529
It's just that bear
has been hanging around.

333
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:53,531
l-I thought you were the bear.

334
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,592
<i>Well, there's been a bear hanging
around, digging through garbage cans.</i>

335
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,604
Looking for food, huh?

336
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:03,733
Yeah. I know bears. Might
not be food he's looking for.

337
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,300
No? What would he be looking for?

338
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,369
It might be you.
Me?

339
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,415
Stranger things have happened.

340
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:13,076
Bears have big hearts.
They fall in love.

341
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,552
And sometimes they fall in love
with human beings.

342
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,589
Get outta here.

343
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:20,750
What? You're saying
this bear has a crush on me?

344
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:23,021
I certainly wouldn't
fault him if he did.

345
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:25,086
Mmm.

346
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:29,663
I don't think we've actually, uh,
introduced ourselves, have we?

347
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:32,829
I'm Maggie. Maggie O'Connell. Arthur.

348
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:34,896
Arthur.

349
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:40,067
It's cold out here. Would you like to come
in and have something to drink? I should go.

350
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:42,943
Are you hungry?
I just opened a can of soup.

351
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:45,006
I'd like to stay, but I can't.

352
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:50,015
Your eyes-
Are they brown?

353
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,080
My eyes?
Yes.

354
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:57,455
Uh
- Actually, I think they're a little more hazel.

355
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,292
They're very beautiful.

356
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,829
Well, good night.

357
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,835
Good night.

358
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,358
<i>Hello. Anybody here?</i>

359
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:39,863
Hi, Leonard.
Is Dr. Fleischman in?

360
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:42,736
No. He had to make a house call
over near Little Sitkin.

361
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:45,971
- Oh.
- No better, huh?

362
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,673
It's so gross.

363
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:50,874
The customers
are all freaked out.

364
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:53,417
They don't even want
to get near me.

365
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:57,046
Even old Kyle Butler.
He always gives me a kiss on the cheek.

366
00:22:57,122 --> 00:22:59,989
Today he pretended like
he didn't even see me.

367
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:05,427
And his skin is even worse than mine
with all those liver spots.

368
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:08,193
Have a seat. Please.

369
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,792
Thanks.

370
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,337
Try some banana bread.
I made it this morning.

371
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:16,101
Okay. It looks good.

372
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:19,872
You cook?
Not much.

373
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:22,436
I make tuna salad, sloppy joes,

374
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:25,210
cinnamon toast,
creamy corn casserole.

375
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,582
Stuff like that.

376
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:30,144
This is yummy.
Oh, thanks.

377
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:33,089
Holling- that's my guy-
he cooks.

378
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:35,126
But right now
he's just into eggs.

379
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:39,130
To tell the truth,
I'm not wild about eggs.

380
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:43,032
Would you pass me the
butter, please? Sure.

381
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:46,470
I had an egg once.
Mm-hmm.

382
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,699
Not to eat.
To, you know, grow.

383
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:52,437
My Aunt Marge gave it to me.
She said if I kept it warm, it would hatch.

384
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,741
My dad said Marge was a wacko.

385
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,373
It was just a plain old supermarket egg.

386
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:59,576
But I believed her.
Mm-hmm.

387
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:02,620
At night, I kept it nice and cozy
under a lamp.

388
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:07,125
And during the daytime, I carried it around
in a sock under my sweater.

389
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:09,057
What happened?
Nothing.

390
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:13,792
Zippo. After six months, my dad said
he didn't want a rotten egg in the house...

391
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:17,233
'cause it might break
and stink up the place.

392
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:21,796
But... I couldn't just
dump it in the trash.

393
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:24,707
I had to see what was inside, you know.

394
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,075
So I cracked it open.

395
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:30,377
Inside there was
this little bitty chick.

396
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,440
He'd been dead a long time.

397
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:35,487
I mean a long, long time.

398
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,683
I was real bummed.

399
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:42,420
But... at least
my Aunt Marge wasn't crazy.

400
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:46,754
That's a very interesting story.

401
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,096
<i>Mm-hmm.
You know, it sets me to thinking.</i>

402
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:52,433
- Yeah?
- Well,

403
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,768
springtime,

404
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,400
snow melts,
grass grows,

405
00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:00,138
animals are born.

406
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,180
Little chicks come out of their shells.

407
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,044
I think that's
what's happening to you.

408
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,516
You're a chick
coming out of your shell.

409
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:09,816
I am?
You're shedding your skin.

410
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,722
You mean like a snake?
Exactly.

411
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:17,626
You're shedding your skin
to be reborn- to be new.

412
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,391
Really?

413
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,557
Mm-hmm.

414
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,502
Wow.

415
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,300
Yeah. Wow.

416
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,404
Hey.

417
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:03,498
<i>How'd you do that?
That was great.</i>

418
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:06,066
Very nice.

419
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:09,579
That was incredible.

420
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:13,448
Amazing. I've never seen anybody
catch a fish like that before.

421
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:15,543
My mother taught me.
Your mother?

422
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:17,555
We all fish.

423
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:20,649
All?
My family.

424
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,891
Oh. Family. Mmm.

425
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:26,897
Uh, wife?

426
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:29,263
Brothers and sisters.

427
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:31,268
Oh.

428
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:33,566
So, who walks the dog?

429
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:37,302
The dog?
Oh, it's-it's just an expression.

430
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:40,641
I live alone.
Would you like to see my home?

431
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:45,647
Sure. Yeah. Why not?

432
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,653
Whoo! What are you doing?

433
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:53,657
We have to cross the water.
Well, you're crazy. The water's freezing!

434
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:57,354
I'm used to it.
No. You'll get frostbite.

435
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:01,627
Oh, my God.
I'm fine, really. It's not far.

436
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:07,261
Hey, Maurice.
How about this?

437
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,264
Toss it.

438
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:14,702
What about this?

439
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,771
Yeah. That too.

440
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:26,882
How do they get these in there?

441
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:30,622
Oh, well, first they build the ship,
and then they collapse it and put it-

442
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,798
Never mind.
Take it if you want it.

443
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:37,733
Thank you. I can use this.

444
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:41,164
You know, every spring,

445
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:45,175
my mother would clean house
from top to bottom.

446
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:48,474
<i>She'd get the whole family involved.</i>

447
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,515
<i>We'd all have to pitch in.</i>

448
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:52,846
We'd take down the curtains
and wash 'em.

449
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:55,785
And we'd beat the rugs.

450
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,788
We'd, uh, scrub everything...

451
00:27:57,856 --> 00:28:02,816
<i>until it was absolutely
pristinely clean.</i>

452
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:06,193
It was like she was driven.
She was obsessed.

453
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:10,564
She wouldn't give up until everything
was so clean it looked brand-new.

454
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:14,029
I never understood that obsession.

455
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:17,007
<i>Until now.
Maurice!</i>

456
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,978
<i>A kilt, just like in Tunes of Glory.</i>

457
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:25,248
These belonged to my grandfather.

458
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:28,184
We were MacAllisters
on the distaff side of the family.

459
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:30,517
He was a Royal Highlander.

460
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:34,184
Forty-second Regiment.
Black Watch.

461
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,227
What have you got there?

462
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:40,389
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

463
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:46,133
Ahhh.
I can still smell his tobacco.

464
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:48,138
Cherry blend.

465
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:54,200
After the war, Granddad moved
to the United States...

466
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,247
and bought a farm
in northern Oklahoma.

467
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,511
I used to spend my summers there.

468
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,284
They were the best times of my life.

469
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:08,952
At night he'd stand on the porch...

470
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:11,018
and play these.

471
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:15,360
The sound of the pipes,

472
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:18,198
filling the heavy, still night air.

473
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:21,968
Toss 'em?

474
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:32,576
Leonard, did you tell Shelly she was shedding her skin
- she was being reborn?

475
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:36,087
It's a wonder this thing didn't start
a fire. Did you? Did you tell her that?

476
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:38,088
Uh-huh.
Okay, look.

477
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:41,717
First of all, you had no right to
intervene medically with one of my patients.

478
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:44,990
Second of all, how could you?
How could you in good conscience...

479
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:47,395
tell a person they're sloughing
their skin like a boa constrictor?

480
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:50,299
I could be wrong. You could
be? You could be wrong?

481
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,893
Well, let me ask you this, Joel.

482
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:57,340
You diagnosed Shelly as having an allergic
reaction. Are you positive about that?

483
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,343
Positive? No, I am not positive.

484
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:02,847
I don't know of a responsible physician
who would say he was 100% positive.

485
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:04,848
There's always a margin of doubt.

486
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,850
Hmm. Right.

487
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:08,442
Wait, wait, wait.

488
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,455
If you're comparing
an empirical scientific diagnosis...

489
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:14,390
with some kind of metaphysical
New Age nonsense-

490
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,791
Joel, let's not kid ourselves.

491
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:20,628
Whatever we diagnose, most patients, if
they don't die, get well by themselves.

492
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:23,827
Our job is mainly
to try to make them feel better.

493
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:26,632
Do no harm.
If you're asking my advice-

494
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:29,333
Asking your advice?
I am not asking your advice.

495
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:32,467
You're bored with your practice,
right? What are you talking about?

496
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:35,240
Well, you said your
practice was boring. So?

497
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:38,612
Ever read Stanislavsky?
Cardiologist?

498
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:43,382
<i>Acting teacher. He said, "There are
no small parts, only small actors."</i>

499
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:45,685
Would you tell me
what this has to do with anything?

500
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:48,851
Well, you're bored because
you're boring. I'm what?

501
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,724
Boring.
I'm boring?

502
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:53,389
One of the most boring people
I ever met.

503
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:57,663
I can't believe you just said that. Do you have
any idea how insulting that is, what you just said?

504
00:30:57,736 --> 00:31:01,194
I open my office, I extend to you
this courtesy, and you insult me?

505
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:04,003
Now you're angry.
Yeah! Yeah! I'm angry!

506
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:08,512
Well, good.
See, that's not boring.

507
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,913
<i>Bye, Joel.</i>

508
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,008
Look at this.

509
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:16,019
A cave.

510
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:18,385
Wow.

511
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:20,481
Huh.

512
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,323
Are you cold?
Uh, no. I'm fine.

513
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:30,365
You may not find this comfortable,
but... for me it's home.

514
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:35,362
Would you like something to eat?

515
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,772
Were you expecting someone?

516
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:40,367
- You.
- Me?

517
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:43,676
Well, I was hoping you'd come.

518
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:46,216
Please, sit down.

519
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,923
Ah. What's that?

520
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,958
Mead.
Mead?

521
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:56,789
Uh-huh.
It's made from honey.

522
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:59,787
Mmm.
To you.

523
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:04,402
Mmm. Delicious.
Sweet.

524
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,828
We make it ourselves.

525
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,840
We?

526
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:11,899
Oh. Your family.

527
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:14,502
Right.

528
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,706
Did you grow up around here?

529
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:19,614
Yes. Crowberries?

530
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:23,381
Oh, thanks.
Just a few.

531
00:32:23,455 --> 00:32:26,447
Uh, your parents still-
still live around here?

532
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:29,516
Well, my father lives
in the mountains,

533
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:32,154
but my mother was killed.

534
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,221
Killed?
Mmm. Shot.

535
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:36,233
Wow. I'm sorry.

536
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:39,998
Oh, I was young.
It was such a long time ago.

537
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,005
Where's your family?

538
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,974
Well, my folks still live
in Grosse Pointe.

539
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:47,841
And, uh, my brother,
he just moved to Coeur d'Alene.

540
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:50,642
But you have no man?
No man?

541
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:53,843
Mate.
Uh,

542
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:57,649
well, I had a boyfriend,
but, uh, he- he died.

543
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:00,623
Um, well, he got hit by-

544
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:02,626
Well, never mind.

545
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:07,461
Uh, and then I had a boyfriend before him, and
- and, uh, he froze to death.

546
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:09,261
Um-

547
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,461
So on and so forth, you know.

548
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:15,337
You're alone.

549
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,432
I'm alone too.

550
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:21,504
Would you like to dance?

551
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:25,615
- Dance?
- Uh-huh.

552
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,982
Here? I mean-
I mean, right now?

553
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:31,188
Please.

554
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,516
Okay.

555
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,652
I never danced in a cave before.

556
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,978
You're very graceful.

557
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,879
Well, l- I mean, for someone
who's so tall.

558
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:00,816
Thank you.

559
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:35,178
One day in the forest
I looked up, and I saw you.

560
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:41,019
That day, um, when I was stuck
with my truck?

561
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:44,551
Before that.

562
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:46,722
You were in the sky.

563
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,391
My plane?

564
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:54,200
You saw me when I was
in my airplane? Mm-hmm.

565
00:34:56,975 --> 00:35:00,638
I've felt for a long time that there
was something missing from my life.

566
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,883
And when I saw you,

567
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,885
I knew what it was.

568
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:57,797
Hey, good news, Cicely. After the first
shock of spring, my allergies are waning.

569
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:02,169
Just a little postnasal drip remains.

570
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,835
Oh, other good news-
uh, no new bear sightings lately.

571
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,710
I guess our fat furry friends have headed
to the hills to make new little bears.

572
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,908
Before we say good-bye, let's...

573
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:14,577
take a look back
at those great cave bears of old...

574
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:17,985
and talk about a very special birth.

575
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:22,425
About the same time our Cro-Magnon
ancestors started burying themselves,

576
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,689
they started doing
the same thing with bears.

577
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:28,596
What's that mean? What are you-
What are you saying here, Stevens?

578
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:33,103
Well, I'm talking about the big bang
of the human psyche:

579
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:35,605
the recognition of death.

580
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:40,770
We saw death, and we did
what no other animal had done before.

581
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:45,214
We dealt with it. We hit on the
idea that death wasn't an end.

582
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:47,808
It was a- a passage.

583
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:52,186
That's why we gave Mr. Bear a proper burial
- so he wouldn't come back mad.

584
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:54,191
Trying to make sense of the unknowable-

585
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:58,696
<i>whatJoseph Campbell calls
the "awakening of awe."</i>

586
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:02,324
<i>"That awakening to the mystery
of death, and therewith of life,</i>

587
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,166
<i>"which, more than
physical transformation,</i>

588
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:09,001
elevated man
above the level of beasts."

589
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:14,643
That blessed event
that I talked about?

590
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:18,272
Birth of the human spirit.

591
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:25,146
Hey, Fleischman. How
you doing? Hey. I'm fine.

592
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:27,953
Good. Glad to hear it.
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

593
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,153
I don't know.
Why-Why not?

594
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:32,196
Feeling all right, O'Connell?
Yeah, you bet.

595
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:34,197
Anything in your cabin
need fixin'?

596
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:36,096
My cabin?
Uh-huh.

597
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,931
You're offering to fix my cabin?
Mm-hmm.

598
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:42,529
Well, um, actually, there's
a loose board on the porch.

599
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,973
Okay. Got it. I'll fix it.

600
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:47,568
Today.
You're gonna fix it today?

601
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,110
<i>See you, Joel.</i>

602
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,479
Sunny-side up.

603
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,851
Denver omelet.
Thank you.

604
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:04,019
Two poached, little runny.
Yep.

605
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:06,120
Top of the morning, Joel.
Hey. Where's Shelly?

606
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:09,689
Initially I ruled out psoriasis
- I mean, there were no psoriatic plaques in evidence.

607
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,964
However, it turns out this is consistent
with an acute generalized flare-up.

608
00:38:13,037 --> 00:38:15,232
Well, Shelly's fine, Joel.
She is?

609
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,900
Yeah. See for yourself.

610
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:20,137
Excuse me.
Shelly.

611
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:23,476
Hi, Dr. Fleischman.
What's up?

612
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:27,109
Wow. Shelly.
How do you like my new skin?

613
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:29,278
It's radiant.
Uh-huh.

614
00:38:29,354 --> 00:38:31,413
Just like Leonard said, huh?

615
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,514
Yeah.

616
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:36,025
Don't get down on yourself,
Dr. Fleischman.

617
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:38,028
I mean, 'cause you didn't guess right.

618
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,826
<i>You never heard the egg story.
The egg story?</i>

619
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:43,924
Yeah. See, Leonard and I had this
heart-to-heart.

620
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,630
That's when I told him the egg story.
That's how come he knew.

621
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:48,638
<i>Two over easy up.</i>

622
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:50,697
Thanks, Shelly.

623
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:00,548
Hey, Marilyn.
Is, uh, Leonard still here?

624
00:39:00,618 --> 00:39:02,677
Inside.
Thanks.

625
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:06,282
<i>Hello there, Joel.</i>

626
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:09,793
Hi. Let me give you a hand.

627
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:12,523
Taking off, huh?
Yeah. I gotta get back.

628
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:15,930
You know what it's like when you
leave town. All your patients get sick.

629
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,436
Yeah. Hey, um,
Shelly looks great.

630
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:21,734
Yeah. She does, doesn't she?

631
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:25,003
You know, Leonard, when you're
in your third year of medical school,

632
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:27,010
you start making rounds, and-

633
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:29,512
Well, l-I was terrible with patients.

634
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,983
I was stiff, unnatural. I didn't know how to
talk to 'em. My palms would literally sweat.

635
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:39,183
My upper lip would twitch. I just
- I dreaded going up on the wards.

636
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:44,456
Actually, l- I started to seriously think
about specializing in pathology.

637
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:48,397
See, uh, that way I wouldn't have to deal with people
- just pieces of'em.

638
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,434
That makes sense, I guess.

639
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,061
Yeah. But there was this one patient,

640
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,435
and he'd been in the hospital,
I guess about two weeks.

641
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:59,272
Abdominal pain, weight loss, low-grade
fever. Nobody could diagnose him.

642
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:04,110
And I'm talking to the guy one day
- you know, not as a doctor, just shooting the breeze.

643
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,116
It turns out he was a fisherman.

644
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:09,745
<i>And he'd been down to the Sea
of Cortez about a month before.</i>

645
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:13,757
<i>And I said,
"Whoa. The Sea of Cortez. Mexico."</i>

646
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,452
Amoebic infection.

647
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:17,517
Exactly.
Yeah. How'd you know?

648
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,458
Well, we have something
similar up here. From walrus.

649
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:24,501
<i>Oh. Well, a week later,
he's out of the hospital,</i>

650
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:27,732
and- and when he left,
he shook my hand.

651
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:31,866
<i>And he said,
"Dr. Fleischman, you saved my life."</i>

652
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:36,845
And, uh, that was it for pathology.

653
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,708
I haven't thought about that
in a long time.

654
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:52,085
<i>Hey. Nice flowers. Don't
forget to water 'em. Okay.</i>

655
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:05,476
Take care.

656
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,824
Hello?

657
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:37,907
Arthur?

658
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:41,837
Anybody here?

659
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:46,044
Arthur?

660
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,538
Arthur?

661
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:42,929
You know that
birth of the human spirit?

662
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,774
It's reflected in
each and every one of us.

663
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:52,505
<i>Case in point, a second story.
A man I knew in stir named Chuck.</i>

664
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:58,049
Chuck spent about a month in the
infirmary after being stabbed in the lung.

665
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:02,992
When they brought him back to the
prison laundry where we both worked,

666
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,994
<i>he said to me, "Chris,</i>

667
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,488
live every day
like it might be your last."

668
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:12,127
That's a tired old chestnut,
I know, but...

669
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,228
try roasting it like this.

670
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:16,296
It ought to be spring every day.

671
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:19,969
Every day we ought to wake up
brand-new.

672
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:29,810
<i>"Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I
and hailed the earth with such a cry...</i>

673
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:34,324
<i>"as not heard save from a man,
who has been dead, and lives again.</i>

674
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:36,553
<i>"About the trees my arms I wound;</i>

675
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:39,619
<i>"Like one gone mad
I hugged the ground;</i>

676
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:42,461
<i>"I raised my quivering arms on high;</i>

677
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:46,834
I laughed and laughed into the sky."

677
00:43:47,305 --> 00:44:47,891
