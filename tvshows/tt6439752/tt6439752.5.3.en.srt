(Khadijah gasps)

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,774
- My baby! No! No!
- SKULLY: You gonna have to get

3
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,276
that hate out your heart.

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,743
If it was me that got killed...

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,912
...would you forgive?

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,681
(gunshot)

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:14,748
LOUIE:
If you kill us now...

8
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,751
...it ain't gonna never end.

9
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,754
Our people gonna come after you

10
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,090
till there ain't nobody left.

11
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:26,194
Thought we'd start off
with ten keys a week.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,262
You say you wanted to focus
on real estate.

13
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,597
Y'all can't do what I do.

14
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,299
We the ones that made it right
with Skully.

15
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:35,269
Now we want to run
what's ours our way.

16
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:36,937
BUCKLEY:
Well, unless you want to go bak

17
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,207
to not having my protection,
I suggest you find

18
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,341
somebody to serve up.

19
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,544
My time now is being
in real estate with you.

20
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,113
Grady's on our side,

21
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:47,148
in legit business with us.

22
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,117
He don't want anything bad
to happen to us.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,984
You sure you can work
with the asset?

24
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,286
TEDDY: What,
you mean that I saved his ass

25
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,887
with that reporter?

26
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,556
See, I was thinking more
about what you did

27
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:56,990
to his father in Cuba.

28
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,792
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,962
HAVEMEYER:
Get Grady in line,
but do it quietly.

30
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,897
FRANKLIN:
Hey, Reed, Grady had agreed
to cut the prices down.

31
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,799
$9,000 a kilo.

32
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,335
I'm hoping you can honor that.

33
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,069
Let's keep it at ten for now.

34
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,971
Also, Reed's gone.

35
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,806
From here on,
you can call me Teddy.

- JEROME: Just like that?
- FRANKLIN: Just like that.

38
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,187
LOUIE:
He say why?

39
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,324
Said Grady was
reckless and wasteful

40
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:33,161
and putting us all in jeopardy.

41
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,695
And you believe him?

42
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,697
Can't say Grady ran
the tightest ship.

43
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,167
(takes deep breath)

44
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,602
It was bound to hit the rocks
sooner or later.

45
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,172
- What did Grady say?
- I don't know.

46
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:47,007
His house is empty, and he
ain't answering my pages, so...

47
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,009
JEROME:
So what you saying, nephew?

48
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,213
- You think that Reed killed him?
- Teddy.

49
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,382
- What?
- Said to call him Teddy
from here on out.

50
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:57,017
And I don't know that, either.

51
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,519
LOUIE:
You think Grady
just walked away

52
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,621
from everything,
all y'all's business,

53
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,856
without so much as a phone call?

54
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,526
I think if the CIA shows up,
tells you it's over

55
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,028
and you got to move on,
then that's exactly what you do.

56
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,464
But yeah,
he could have killed him.

57
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,300
Lions sometimes eat their young.

58
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,967
I just can't think
of a lot of reasons

59
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,369
why Teddy would've had to.

60
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,371
I can. Saw you and Grady
was like Bert and Ernie

61
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,373
- up in this motherfucker.
- (chuckles)

62
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,974
Wanted to send a message
they knew you would hear.

63
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,710
LOUIE:
You mean, in addition

64
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,578
to disappearing his father?

65
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,914
That come up
in your little chat?

66
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,817
Whatever happened to Alton,
he did to himself.

67
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,652
Bottom line is,
whoever the CIA sends,

68
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,221
we got to do business with them.

69
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:35,055
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

70
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,258
Well, we can't do nothin'
without that price cut.

71
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,093
- We still good on that?
- FRANKLIN: (sighs) No.

72
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,229
Teddy's not gonna honor
Grady's word.

73
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,563
Prices stay the same.

74
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:45,566
I made promises.

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,167
Well, you're gonna have
to break 'em.

76
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,902
LOUIE: How about I take Teddy
on a little ride-along?

77
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,839
Let him see how the Colombians
got the game sewed up.

78
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,407
(chuckles)
Yeah, that'll do it.

79
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,675
Me and him,
we did business for months

80
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,076
when you was laid up.

81
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,478
- Let me try and talk to him.
- I'll talk to him.

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,349
Till then, y'all
just keep moving these keys.

83
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,452
Now's not the time to tell Teddy
business is falling off.

84
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,321
I'll let you all know more
when I do.

What up with you, Mello?

96
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:01,241
Shit, trying to get like y'all.

97

You got it, boss.

LOUIE:
Heads up.

99
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,247
Couldn't get that price cut.

100
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,583
It's not a call I could make.

101
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,485
And for that I apologize.

102
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,822
Well, see, now you put me--

103

us--

Hey, ease the fuck off

MELLO:
You see...

107
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,267
I like this,

108
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,603
but I'm not in charge.

109
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,841
You know, just like you,
this is not a call I can make.

110
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,846
And now I got to tell the man
who's in charge

111
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,015
that things aren't as you said.

112
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,453
Nah, fuck all that.
They can tell him.

Ten grand? Yeah, all right.

124
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,260
No, go ahead and do it.

125
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,497
Send the invoice
to the business.

Thanks.

- For the plane.

Right.

Mm-mm.

131
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,080
Looking at me
like I owe you money.

132
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,916
- (chuckles)
- I could you right now
I ain't got it.

133
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,351
What I do got is paperwork.

134
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,421
Your go-ahead for the bid.

135
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:55,155
Less than 48 hours
to submit, huh?

136
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,691
Yeah.

137
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,693
All right,
I'll go through this tonight.

138
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,430
- Mm-hmm.
- Finish it up tomorrow.

139
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,132
In the meantime, I need you
to do something else for me.

140
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,368
- What you need?
- Uh, we got to put Grady's house
on the market.

00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,438
(chuckles)

142
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,205
I'm not surprised.

143
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,207
He's got "rolling stone" written
all over him,

144
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,976
and, you know,
they don't gather no moss.

145
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,479
Grady's left town, V.

146
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,815
- He's out.
- Mm.

147
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,784
- (takes deep breath)
- Teddy's back in.

148
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,385
Teddy?

149
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,787
Reed.

150
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,325
When'd this happen?

151
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,127
Last night.

152
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,799
You thought
he wasn't coming back.

153
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,834
I was wrong.

154
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,072
Okay.

155
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,074
Well, did you ask him
about your dad,

156
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,076
if he had anything to do
with it?

157
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,978
Caught me a little off guard.

158
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,813
That definitely wasn't
an accident.

159
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,422
I'm not a mind reader,
so I'm gonna need you to tell me

160
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,159
- how you're feeling, Franklin.
- (sighs)

161
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,328
I think as long
as I've done right by Teddy,

162
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,830
he's had my back.

163
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,866
I asked how you felt,
not what you think.

164
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:18,338
I don't know right now, babe.

165
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,008
All I know is that he needs me.

166
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,077
As long as I make him money,
we all good.

167
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,848
That's all I got for now,
all right?

168
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,922
(sighs)

169
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,191
Truck outside.
I figured I'd bring it in.

170
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,529
Aw, thank you, baby.
You didn't have to do that.

171
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,797
I know, it's fine.

172
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,900
- I had the time.
- (beeping)

173
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,705
(sighs)

174
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,908
Proverbs 25:14.

175
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,146
A man that promises a gift

176
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,749
and doesn't give
is like clouds...

177
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,651
I'm guessing y'all ain't pray
for that good day.

178
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,218
How bad?

179
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,320
Tianna's-birthday-tomorrow bad.

180
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,256
SKULLY:
Niggas need to see

181
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,561
they consequences in action.

182
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,162
He'd like to see you.

183
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,964
- Now.
- (line clicks off)

184
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,570
How much you hear?

185
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:26,774
- Sounded like Old Testament
this time.
- Fuck.

186
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,815

MAN:
Yo!

You think this is a fucking
joke? This shit is for real.

190
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,100
You don't fuck with the Bible,

It's over.
Listen close next time.

212
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,095
Get this nigga out of here.

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,539
Thought we was on another plane.

216
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,843
Thought we transcended
this bullshit.

217
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,180
Now y'all want to sell me
wolf tickets again?

218
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,848
What happened to the honor?

219
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,850
Our business with you is
our honor.

Our loyalty.

221
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,520
Lying to me
ain't no motherfucking loyalty.

222
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,222
LOUIE:
We didn't lie to you.

223
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,859
We were told one thing,
then we were told another.

224
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,195
- It's out of our hands.
- SKULLY: You know,

225
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,963
Titi is in here.

226
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,366
I ain't even supposed
to be carrying on like this.

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,635
Ten a key--
that's what you said,

228
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:39,239
- and that's what it's gonna be.
- Skully, we can't do that.

229
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,874
SKULLY:
Man, you can do that!

230
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,242
'Cause you said and you owe me.

231
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,544
- You already know that.
- LOUIE: Okay.

232
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,213
We'll do it.

233
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,215
Daddy's sorry, baby.

234
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,050
I don't mean to get loud.

235
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,587
Hit y'all up later
to reschedule the drop

236
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,556
after I deal with this shit.

237
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,230
SKULLY: You know,
possums smell like shit

238
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,399
when they tricking predators
into thinking they dead.

239
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,168
But the smart ones

240
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,604
don't play with
the same predator over and over,

241
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,274
because they afraid he
might become wise to the smell.

242
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,410
Did you smell anything on them?

243
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,579
As in possum shit?

244
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:23,616
As in, do what you say
and say what you mean,

245
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,253
or you can't be trusted.

246
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,521
- He comin' apart.
- With expenses,

247
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,623
we out at least a few hundo
every bird we sell to him.

248
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,093
We in business with a madman,

249
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,095
and we ain't even making money
doing it.

250
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,766
Way he goin',
ain't gonna be long.

251
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,768
We can wait him out,
let him implode,

252
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,970
wait for the next man to rise.

253
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,438
I see your wheels turning.

254
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,107
You notice Mello?

255
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,276
- Itching.
- Uh-huh.

256
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,811
We can use that.

257
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,807
(traffic passing)

258
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,195
(children chattering, laughing)

259
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,897
Come on.

260
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,000
- (school bell ringing)
- Come on, come on. We late.

261
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,042
(car door closes)

262
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,878
Come on.

263
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,181
Wrong place to start some drama.

264
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,350
Girl, ain't no drama.

265
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,054
Y'all know Mello?

266
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,856
Skully's boy.

267
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,458
- Hey.
- Who don't?
He stay in the streets.

268
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,460
Saw him yesterday buying
some Jordans at the Fox Hills.

269
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,963
I heard he hang tough
over where y'all used to dance.

270
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,231
- First Kings.
- BLACK DIAMOND: Used to?

271
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,200
Nah. We can't gamble
feeding these babies

272
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,070
- on no damn dope money.
- Might not always be sufficient.

273
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,238
Well, we need somebody
to slide in his ear,

274
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:29,042
- remind him of his potential.
- Y'all steady playing us
to the left.

275
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,078
Maybe we just shoot you
in the stomach.

276
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,546
- Play a game of spades after.
- BLACK DIAMOND: Look, I thought
we was past that

277
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,648
- when y'all brought us on.
- You think I brought you on?

278
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,650
If it was up to me...

279
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,586
- We'd be dead. Right?
- DALLAS: Man, come on.

280
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,222
why you bringing up old shit?

281
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,257
We've been hospitable
as fuck since.

282
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,059
- You stay trippin'.
- LOUIE: Call us past it

283
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,660
if you help us out.

284
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,729
You know somebody to do it?

285
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,833
Puff The Magic Dragon.

286
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,635
- JEROME: Who?
- We'll set it up.

287
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,471
Come on, baby.

288
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,277
(sighs)
Little late for this, but...

289
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,579
I'm sorry for...

290
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,748
shooting you and all.

291
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,252
I'm glad you didn't not make it.

292
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,458
I did it again.

293
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,093
- (school bell ringing)
- BLACK DIAMOND: You gonna
be a good boy?

294
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,941
Morning. Listen, um...

295
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,114
FRANKLIN:
Had them get you some coffee.

296
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:41,949
Okay.

297
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,784
Thank you.

298
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,789
(sighs)

299
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,692
Stopped smoking, huh?

300
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,168
So, I thought
maybe we should talk.

301
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,903
Caught me a little off guard
the other day.

302
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,305
So what?
So anything in particular

303
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,673
- you want to talk about?
- Well, you know, I...

304
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,076
For starters, I hate
to beat a dead horse here,

305
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,078
but I think
maybe I wasn't clear

306
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,645
about why that price cut's
so important.

307
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,081
Oh, no, I understand

308
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,316
why competitive pricing
is important.

309
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,819
I just don't really think
that pricing is the issue here.

310
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,823
So, for reasons that
I will never fully understand,

311
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:28,195
in my absence, you decided
that you would make yourself

312
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:32,099
a middleman
inside of your own organization.

313
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,167
My prices,
right at market levels.

314
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,269
I think the problem here is
the prices

315
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,605
that Jerome and Louie
are paying you, right?

316
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,508
So please,
in the future, feel free

317
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,843
not to call me out here
and ask me to cut my margins

318
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,013
and get people that are trying
to fight a war killed.

319
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,215
Why don't you get your own house
in order first?

320
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,516
Fair?

321
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,622
But prices
aren't really the reason

322
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,857
you asked me out here to talk,
are they?

323
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,394
No, not really.

324
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,700
(takes deep breath, chuckles)

325
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,137
Come on, man,
you really gonna make me ask?

326
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,106
I wish that I had something
for you here, man, I really do.

327
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,710
The truth is, I have no idea
what's happened to Alton.

328
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,248
He went after the CIA.

329
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,715
He pissed off a lot of people,

330
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,551
people that are way above
my pay grade, trust me.

331
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,653
So what-what you saying?

332
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,755
CIA went down there
and found him and what?

333
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,223
Kidnapped him?

334
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,060
- Killed him?
- You have to understand.

335
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,828
The CIA, that's only part
of the equation here.

336
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,765
From the minute your parents
touched down in Cuba,

337
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,100
they would have been targeted

338
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,735
by any number
of intelligence agencies.

339
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,405
I'm talking about the DGI,
the KGB.

340
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,740
And your father,
a former Panther,

341
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,110
would've been what they called
a high-value target.

342
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,912
But wouldn't they want
to use him? Turn him?

343
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,747
A lot of times
it starts that way,

344
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,918
but if he resists,
if he doesn't cooperate,

345
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,853
then things can get out of hand.

346
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,955
You know, or, I don't...

347
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,757
(sighs)
You know,

348
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,160
he could be in some
Cuban jail cell right now.

349
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,464
I understand how hard...

350
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,434
this must be.

351
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:18,138
You spent all this time
hating him,

352
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,440
and then you form a relationship
with him again, and...

353
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,875
and he betrays you.

354
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,112
And then this.

355
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,948
Franklin...

356
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,284
I swear to you, whatever
happened to your father,

357
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,453
I had nothing to do with it.

358
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,562
Anything else?

359
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,963
Nah.

360
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,135
That's it.

361
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,141
Do me a favor.

362
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,409
Don't ever come to my house
like that again

363
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,811
or my place of business or
anywhere I'm not expecting you.

364
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,813
Okay?

365
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,315
(quietly)
Okay.

366
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,686
Oh, by the way, I got ducks
to put in rows tonight,

367
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,690
so Gustavo will meet you
for the exchange, same as ever.

368
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,693
FRANKLIN:
Okay.

369
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,699

370
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,015
How'd it go with the Colombians?

371
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,221
Pos iqual que siempre.

372
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,123
So listen, I got a few things
I got to take care of tonight.

373
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,093
So are you good to make the drop
with Franklin without me?

This is my office.

479
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,538
I really need you
to respect that.

480
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,706
Okay.

481
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,711
What's missing? Flavor?

482
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,881
No. Pork lard instead of oil,
for starters.

483
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,415
My daddy's recipe.

484
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,584
That man could cook.

485
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,418
Hey, I never told you about him?

486
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:47,987
He was a giant.

487
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:49,388
Played in the Negro leagues,
but...

488
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,390
gave it up
once my sisters came along,

489
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,825
'cause he was needed at home.

490
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,161
Gave up a lot after that.

491
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,396
Well, ain't that part
of growing up?

492
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,900
- Giving up childish things?
- Oh, for some, maybe.

493
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,902
I think that's the problem.

494
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,071
- Giving up what makes us wild.
- (knocking)

495
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:06,739
Hey.

496
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,507

499
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,615
How about I get Chelle
to come up here

500
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,784
and keep you company
till I get back?

501
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,418
That all right?

Yeah.
Chelle's always a good time.

Hey.

504
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,960
I told you I needed

00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,064
we found warmth
in that hospital.

643
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:13,845
And you right...

644
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,282
we owe you honor.

645
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:19,551
You know,
we are our own persons.

646
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,388
Ain't nobody controlling us.

647
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,190
(breath trembles)

648
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:28,427
You let my angel be a reminder
to you of that.

649
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:37,903
Oh.

650
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,705
You were right.

651
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,642
We going back
to the original price.

652
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,711
What about the money?

653
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,879
SKULLY:
Keep it.

654
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,881
I don't want that juju shit
on me.

655
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,902
(sighs)

656
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,077
(pops)

657
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,781
Where you going? Come on.

658
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,917
(laughs) We got to celebrate
getting that proposal in, honey.

659
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,953
Mm-hmm.

660
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,588
♪ We got them files in... ♪

661
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,923
You want to dance with me.

662
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,925
♪ They wanted thousands ♪

663
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,127

00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,630

665
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,202
Okay. All right.

666
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,205
- Who do I need to beat up?
- (chuckles)

667
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:50,141
I'm a pregnant lawyer,
pretty much un-convictable.

668
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,278
And we both know I got hands.

669
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,646
(both laugh)

670
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,615
Come on, talk to me.

671
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,450
Is this because of Teddy?

672
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,986
Nah, nah. It's just...

673
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:03,121
just a lot of tension, you know.

674
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,623
A lot going on.

675
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:08,627
Do you wanna...

676
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,962
Uh, I'm not in the mood
to meditate or cleanse,

677
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,998
anything like that, V.

678
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,633
...have sex?

679
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,635
You release some dopamine
that way.

680
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,304
(both laugh softly)

681
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,309
- Rain check.
- Hmm.

682
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,243
- But I appreciate you.
- (chuckles)

683
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,812
- And everything you do.
- Mm-hmm.

684
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:31,750
- Excuse me, Franklin.
- Wanda?

685
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:34,320
Hey, uh, sorry
to mess up your happy hour.

686
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:37,323
Franklin, you think
we could talk for a second?

687
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:43,495
- What's up?
- Okay.

688
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:46,832
So, I was eavesdropping
at the house the other night--

689
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,934
not even gonna lie, my bad--

690
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,036
but I thought
I heard you say something

691
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,171
about Betty having
water on her knees?

692
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,674
Can't walk up all the stairs
to collect the rent?

693
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,208
Well, I'm not sure if you know,
but...

694
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,545
I used to run track at Jordan.

695
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,448
- I didn't know that.
- Okay, well, I, um, grew up

696
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,716
doing construction work
with my daddy, too.

697
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,519
So handiwork?
Pssh, ain't no thing.

698
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,355
I mean, shit,
you could ask Leon.

699
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:11,523
One time I had to fix
his mama's dryer, right?

700
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,959
No wrench, all hands.

701
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,894
Last time
I went in the projects,

702
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,364
dryer still blowing.

703
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:20,599
You asking for a job, Wanda?

704
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,970
Look, I need something else
in my life.

705
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,473
Okay?
This-this scraping-by shit...

706
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,075
I don't know how much longer
I can do it.

707
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,910
(sighs)
Uh...

708
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,213
- All right, all right.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

709
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,415
Ooh, thank you, thank you,
Franklin.

710
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,883
Look, take as much time
as you need.

711
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,217
But not too much time.

712
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,719
- Bitches is broke.
- (chuckles)

713
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,754
- Thank you.
- All right.

714
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:03,609
FRANKLIN:
How'd it go in Inglewood?

715
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,977
Settled everything
without firing a shot.

716
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,314
Long as it's settled.

717
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,586
You talk to Teddy?

718
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,254
(sighs)
Yeah.

719
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,958
- And?
- You know, honestly,

720
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,593
I'm tired of talking
about this shit, Louie.

721
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,362
We about to start
this shit up again?

722
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,197
Yes, we are.

723
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:28,366
'Cause they got no idea
the shit we going through

724
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,368
out in the street, and you
won't let me talk to him,

725
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,938
so pardon me if I want to know
what the fuck he said.

726
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,606
- You want to know what he said?
- Yeah.

727
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,107
He said the prices
ain't changing,

728
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,709
'cause the prices
ain't the problem.

729
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,777
- Know what is?
- LOUIE: Hmm?

730
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:39,811
Y'all two.

731
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,381
Breaking away from me.

732
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,817
- Going out on your own.
- LOUIE: I see.

733
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,385
So you just gonna bend over

734
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,788
- and do whatever he say?
- FRANKLIN: (chuckles) No.

735
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,457
But this time he's right.

736
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:53,224
Look, I gave y'all a chance.

737
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,126
Did this shit
for as long as I could.

738
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,796
But this little experiment,
it's not working.

739
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,998
I'm happy to split the profits
with you all fifty-fifty.

740
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,333
But you got to come home.

741
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,969
Get this operation
under one roof.

742
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,804
No, we ain't doing that.

743
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,474
- Why? Why not?
- Because I don't want
to put my life--

744
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:11,743
our life-- at risk
for your bullshit-ass decisions.

745
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,979
Is that it?

746
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,582
Or is that you're so sure
that you're so much smarter

747
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,083
than everybody else?

748
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,485
Getting tired of this.

749
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:20,919
Lions fighting over sheep.

750
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,421
- This between me and him.
- Oh, yeah?

751
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,423
So why don't you
handle it, then?

752
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:28,026
Boom! That's right.

753
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,361
'Cause I know breaking away
wasn't Jerome's idea.

754
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:33,499
And I let it go,
'cause you'd been shot,

755
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:34,833
been through
some traumatic shit.

756
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,702
Hey, you let it go?

757
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,004
Yeah, that's right. For her.

758
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,840
Don't talk
out your goddamn neck, boy.

759
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,510
(laughs) Well,
then maybe you can enlighten me,

760
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:47,212
Unc, on what the fuck she wants!

761
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:50,448
Nah. Why don't you ask her
yourself, then?

762
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:53,218
What would you like,
Queen Louie?

763
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:54,853
What's gonna make you happy?

764
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,354
'Cause nothing seems to do it
for you.

765
00:40:56,354 --> 00:41:00,225
How about not being
under anybody's thumb, nephew.

766
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,460
FRANKLIN:
Well, I hate to break it to you,

767
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,863
but everybody's got to answer
to somebody. And me?

768
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,465
I answer to the man who may have
disappeared my fucking father,

769
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,635
and who will do the same to us
if we don't move this product.

770
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:13,038
Now, I don't know about y'all
two, but I'd like to stay alive

771
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,240
long enough
to enjoy what I've made.

772
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,208
So from here on out, I don't
want to hear anything else

773
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,476
about kilos or prices.

774
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,045
Y'all want to go out
on your own? Fine!

775
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,648
But do not for one second
fuck around

776
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,482
with what I got to do
to get mine,

777
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,218
'cause I promise you there is
nothing I'm not prepared to do.

778
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,891

782
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:36,514
And I am under
a lot of pressure.

783
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:38,583
We're glad you got
your own dreams,

784

You wouldn't believe it.

Okay.

at 10:00 on FX.

799
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,510
Here for the do, is it?

800
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,747
I don't--
I don't know what you're saying.

801
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,653
Do I gotta get naked for this?

802
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,857
Nudity isn't required, I think.

803
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:53,992
[scoffs] I don't know. Europe.

804
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,102
(screams)

805
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,636
WOMAN:
We are not safe here.

806
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:08,339
We don't really
live in this world.

807
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,041
We feed off of it.

808
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:13,478
Aliens. Mother of God.

809
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,314
How have you
not gone insane?

810
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,650
Once you sell your soul,
it's gone.

811
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,319
MAN: Boo!

812
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,320
It's breaking
all the rules.

813
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,488
(screams)

814
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:24,790
And I'm here for that.

814
00:45:25,305 --> 00:46:25,622
