- Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
- As soon as you got the keys,

161
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,793
and you're in, all of a sudden,

162
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,110
the kitchen's all
clean and unused.

163
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,763
- (laughs)
- I'm over here losing weight.

164
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,332
- Losing... (laughs)
- Look at that. Touch it.

165
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,952
Look at that.

166
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:04,678
See that?

167
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,769
Ooh, objection. Relevance
to the previous argument.

168
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,326
Overruled.

169
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,756
- Overruled?
- So, seeing as I got bamboozled,

170
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,358
I'm-a get that last egg roll.

171
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,726
- (laughs)
- Okay?

172
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,995
(laughs)

173
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,265
You really miss me cooking?

174
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,434
- Franklin: Hell yeah.
- Hmm.

175
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,871
- (Telephone ringing)
- Mm...

176
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,907
And now a nigga can't even get

177
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,927
a peanut butter, jelly
sandwich in this motherfucker.

178
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,112
- (laughs)
- (telephone continues ringing)

179
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,749
Franklin: 'sup?

180
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,153
I'll call you on
an outside line.

181
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,755
Yeah, five minutes.

182
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,390
(Hangs up phone)

183
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,927
Franklin: Uh...

184
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,396
Projects got raided.

185
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,937
What?

186
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,438
(Sighs)

187
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,641
Let's go, then, make sure
everyone's all right.

188
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,311
Yeah?

189
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,481
Peaches: Trying to. Damn.

190
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,516
Dallas: Come on.

191
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,017
- (Domino clatters)
- Shit.

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,687
(laughter) -He got
nothing. I'm going. Boom.

193
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,489
(Door bangs open)

194
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,959
♪ <i>You will see how
lady luck somehow</i> ♪

195
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,627
♪ <i>Forgot to shine on me</i> ♪

196
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,480

197
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,664
Dallas: You playing or not?

198
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,199
Nigga still gonna lose, though.

199
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,001
- (laughter)
- Fuck out of here.

200
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,537
It was attack dogs like down
in Birmingham back in the day.

201
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,739
Only thing missing was
the fucking fire hoses.

202
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,307
- What happened?
- They hit us hard.

203
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,810
Busting heads, grabbing
corner boys and shit.

204
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,163
It was that
motherfucking Buckley.

205
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,697
Franklin: Buckley? How
the fuck that happen?

206
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,414
Y'all got him in
your pocket, right?

207
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,234
If the cops already had the
projects on their radar,

208
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,018
he was probably
doing damage control.

209
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,320
He didn't touch
Leon or Jerome...

210
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,356
Touched Einstein right
into the goddamn hospital,

211
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,757
and he ain't the only one.

212
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,043
Motherfucker came
right for us, lo...

213
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,194
He need to be dealt with.

214
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,047
Louie: Okay. I hear you.

215
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,380
Uh, he is my guy. I will
find out what happened.

216
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,240
Franklin: All right.
What you need?

217
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,194
Leon: Me? I don't need nothing.
I don't need a damn thing.

218
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,395
It's them cops that's
gonna be in need.

219
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,729
- Lee...
- They got to understand,

220
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,698
if they come at us, we gonna
come right back at them.

221
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,836
What you saying?

222
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,287
Sherman's March to the sea.

223
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,297
Who?

224
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,594
William tecumseh
sherman, destroyed

225
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,336
everything in his
motherfucking path.

226
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,734
Louie: We are drug
dealers, Leon.

227
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:27,266
Cops is gonna come at us from
time to time. That's the game.

228
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,179
Siccing goddamn dogs
on us like we animals?

229
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:30,266
Ain't no fucking game, Louie.

230
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,832
Lee, look, just calm
down, all right?

231
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:33,533
We gonna get through this shit.

232
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,170
They've always wanted to wipe
us out... white folk, police...

233
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:36,587
Ever since the emancipation,

234
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,401
so I'm-a go back and get
my people armed and ready,

235
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:39,803
'cause if they
want a fucking war,

236
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,847
- I'm not gonna let them just...
- Franklin: Leon.

237
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,726
- (Cissy laughs)
- Mama?

238
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,184
- Mama.
- Oh, my baby.

239
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,539
- (Cissy laughing)
- Franklin: How are you?

240
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:57,634
(Cissy sniffles)

241
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,853
Cissy: Oh, my god.

242
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,890
Hey, sweetie.

243
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:05,608
Oh, Jerome.

244
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:08,086
Should've told us
you was coming.

245
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,650
(Cissy laughs)

246
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:13,452
Veronique: Wow.

247
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,484
Mrs. Saint.

248
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:18,235
Veronique.

249
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,531
I came as soon as I heard.

250
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,195
You heard what?

251
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:27,599
You haven't told them?

252
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:31,503
I'm pregnant.

253
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:33,390
(Chuckles)

254
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,454
- What?
- (laughter)

255
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,078
Jerome: What?

256
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,011
Yeah.

257
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:41,013
- We gonna have a baby.
- Jerome: Hey.

258
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:43,215
- Jerome: Congratulations.
- Veronique: Thank you.

259
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:44,883
Gonna name him Jerome.

260
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:47,019
(laughter)

261
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:59,030
(Train horn blaring)

262
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,735
Uh-oh.

263
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,770
She don't look happy.

264
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,340
All right, let's have it.

265
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:26,113
You don't think I got a
right to be pissed off?

266
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:27,930
Think you should be
glad it wasn't worse.

267
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:31,233
Worse than siccing dogs
on your own people?

268
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,936
Since when the fuck
are they my people?

269
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:35,971
They the same motherfuckers

270
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,906
been calling me
redbone my entire life.

271
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,009
All right, siccing them
on my people, then.

272
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:42,811
What you think this is?

273
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:44,907
What, you throw a
little cocaine my way,

274
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:46,722
sit a girl in my
lap, bat your eyes,

275
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,669
and I'm supposed to do
whatever the fuck you want?

276
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,686
I told you I was
gonna find somebody.

277
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,506
And I bet I won't have
to ask twice next time.

278
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,992
Now, are we done?

279
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:57,115
Hmm. I need to know that
there is trust here.

280
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,376
- (Rustling nearby)
- That you not gonna just fuck me

281
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,495
any time you feel like it.

282
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,320
You do what I ask,

283
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,938
you'll be fine.

284
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,334
Have a good night, lo...

285
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,552
(car door opens)

286
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,894
(Car engine shuts off)

287
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,742
Sorry, buddy.

288
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:26,286
They told me they fixed the
traffic while I was gone,

289
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,422
but...

290
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:28,745
Franklin: Look,

291
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,397
projects got hit yesterday.

292
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:33,282
Leon and his folks.

293
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:35,886
(Sighs): Okay.

294
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:37,375
They've gotten worse, man,

295
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:39,687
since you've been gone. LAPD.

296
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,306
Even in the last few months.

297
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:43,711
And the crackdown on my people's
been pretty fucking brutal.

298
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:45,561
Yeah, I mean,

299
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:47,980
you're moving literal
tons of rock cocaine.

300
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,364
What'd you expect?

301
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,901
Considering I'm moving
those tons of cocaine

302
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:53,038
on behalf of what I thought
was a grateful fucking nation,

303
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:54,997
I'm expecting a
little help, please.

304
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:57,383
Okay, so you asked me
here to help get the

305
00:13:57,468 --> 00:14:00,234
Los Angeles police department
to go easy on your people?

306
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:02,719
Well, you had contacts at
the LAPD before, right?

307
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,009
Well, I don't anymore.

308
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,131
Why? Why not? What happened?

309
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:07,601
Are you kidding me? Why not?

310
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:10,353
Your fucking father
went to the press.

311
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,586
Remember?

312
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,207
So now my people are more
wary than ever about exposure.

313
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,810
That's why they sent
a goddamn contractor

314
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:18,828
- in here after I left.
- Okay.

315
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,062
This is bullshit.

316
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,446
They're not coming after
you, right? These cops?

317
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:28,797
Just your people on the street?

318
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,289
Yeah, but...

319
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:33,108
So, my advice, don't
worry about it.

320
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,162
'Cause, yeah, crash
is a scary name.

321
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:39,148
Sure, at the end of the day,

322
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:41,976
these cops pose no threat
to you at all. You know why?

323
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,986
'Cause in the grand
scheme of things,

324
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,939
nobody fucking cares what
happens in south central.

325
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,752
Yeah, if it was a
white neighborhood,

326
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:50,578
you could be worried.

327
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:53,156
They'd send the fucking
national guard in here, right?

328
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:56,649
Just...

329
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:59,285
Keep yourself insular.

330
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:02,188
Only deal with your family.

331
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:04,063
They can never touch you.

332
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:13,438
Avoid the 110 on your way out.

333
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:14,917
Yeah.

334
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,803
'Cause it's a
fucking parking lot.

335
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:19,638
(Car door closes)

336
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,640
(Car engine starts)

337
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:24,710
(Knock on door) <i>- Announcer (on
radio): - Swing and a miss. Strike one.</i>

338
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:29,515
<i>.318 batter, 39
homers and 139 rbis...</i>

339
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,753
Avi: Mr. Simmons.

340
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,354
(Chuckles)

341
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:39,580
Welcome to Chinatown.

342
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,162
Funny place to start
following america's pastime.

343
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:44,797
You like baseball?

344
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,533
America's got a lot of
pastimes I ain't too fond of.

345
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,936
Okay.

346
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:53,706
Look, I need some
specialty items.

347
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:56,242
Some rocket launchers,
armor-piercing rounds,

348
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,743
anything to fuck some shit up.

349
00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:01,113
Might I inquire as to why

350
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:04,517
you're in need of
such lethal devices?

351
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:07,186
The other boys in blue.

352
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,640
You plan to declare
war on the police?

353
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:16,743
On oppression, on tyranny.

354
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,103
But I didn't think I had to
come and explain that to you.

355
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,100
It's true.

356
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:24,537
I've witnessed a few
uprising in my lifetime,

357
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,705
some more successful
than others.

358
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:30,042
So you'll believe me when I'll
tell you that the conditions

359
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:33,412
do not exist... In or
out of the projects...

360
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,381
To successfully lead

361
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:38,717
that proletarian insurgency
that you're dreaming about.

362
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,586
Hmm. Well, I guess that depends

363
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:42,488
on how you define
success, right?

364
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,258
(Chuckling): Seem...
Seems like surviving

365
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,127
would be a good idea.

366
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:50,796
If I get at least one of
them pigs before they get me,

367
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:52,264
I figure that's a win.

368
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:55,334
And what hell do you think
will visit upon your people

369
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:56,635
if you killed one of theirs?

370
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:58,103
I mean, it can't be any worse

371
00:16:58,205 --> 00:16:59,356
than what they're
doing right now.

372
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,906
Oh, really?

373
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:04,643
Much worse, boychik.

374
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:07,313
Look, I got money, you got guns.

375
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,948
Now, you gonna
give me this shit,

376
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,883
or do I have to
go somewhere else?

377
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:13,786
Just give me a few days.

378
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:15,788
As you said,

379
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,190
these are specialty items.

380
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,125
Call me when you got 'em.

381
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:21,827
Sure thing.

382
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,296
(Door opens)

383
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,499
Mr. Owens in 4a,

384
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:29,802
he said he wouldn't pay
until his toilet got fixed.

385
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:31,989
I thought he was just talking
shit, told him to show me,

386
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:33,405
but he wasn't lying.

387
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:35,007
So I went down to
the hardware store,

388
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:37,376
bought a $8 snake,
fixed it myself.

389
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,746
Thing is, I used some
of the rent money

390
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,082
I already collected
to buy the snake.

391
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,984
- That okay?
- Veronique: Of course.

392
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,953
Mrs. Saint.

393
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:50,656
Mama.

394
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:52,958
Welcome to the
westside development.

395
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,561
- My god.
- (both laugh)

396
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,329
- You look nice.
- Thank you, darling.

397
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,697
(Overlapping chatter)

398
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,100
- (laughter)
- Cissy: It's good to be here.

399
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,003
Hello.

400
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:06,639
Oh, yeah. I want you
to meet Wanda bell.

401
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:09,241
- Hi, Mrs. Saint.
- Cissy: Ah. So you're the one

402
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,877
- who's been staying in my home.
- I'm so sorry about the mess.

403
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:14,713
I would've cleaned up if I'd
known you was coming, but...

404
00:18:14,815 --> 00:18:16,849
Didn't nobody tell me.

405
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:22,187
It's fine. I hope it's
been a safe space for you.

406
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:29,828
I'm... Gonna go get to work.

407
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,797
So nice to meet you.

408
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:35,067
(Chuckles)

409
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:37,002
Uh, so what you think?

410
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:41,840
It is... Better than
I could've imagined.

411
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,043
I am so proud of you.

412
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:45,744
Of both of you.

413
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:48,347
We're just expanding on
the foundation you laid.

414
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,816
Cissy: Well, Franklin's
lucky to have found you.

415
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:54,753
I left him with a heavy burden,
managing all of this on his own.

416
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:58,524
He is one of the most
capable men I've ever met.

417
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,476
Just like his father.

418
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:02,379
- All right, mama. Come on.
- (laughs)

419
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:04,396
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

420
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:05,916
So, we gonna walk you
through everything.

421
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,900
There you go.

422
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,802
All right.

423
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:11,837
Including the downtown project.

424
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,573
Cissy: Okay.

425
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,142
Veronique: Mrs. Saint, the first
space that we're gonna have,

426
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:18,911
it's warehouse flex, right?

427
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,497
We're real excited
about where it's located

428
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:21,999
and all the options
that it gives us.

429
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,416
It gives us a lot of
opportunities for, you know,

430
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,051
growth.

Hmm. That sound nice.
What time you heading out?

we take her to dinner

you little beef you got.

You need to patch that shit up.

I hear that.

I know there's some
static between us,

but this...

448
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:11,063
This is not about Franklin.

449
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,500
Then what is it?

450
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,869
I'm just exhausted.

It's been one thing

452
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:21,607
after another after another
after... Ugh, and I just want to

453
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:24,009
sit here in this chair

454
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:26,645
and watch these white bitches
fight over stupid shit.

455

Nah. Nah-ah-ah.

456
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,649
Mm-mm.

457
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,520
I ain't going to accept that.

458
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:37,623
There's a lot of shit
going on right now.

wants to throw a dinner

463
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:52,971
for my sister that I
ain't seen in over a year,

464
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:54,740
bringing the family together.

465
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,311
And you won't do
that shit for me?

466
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:04,683
You're right.

467
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:09,288
I'm sorry.

468
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:14,059

Yeah.

Sorry about that, man.

Want you to know I
meant what I said.

Anything you need down here,

all you got to do is ask.

474
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:27,105
All right.

475
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,208
That's it?

No, actually, um...

Having a little get-together
for moms tonight.

478
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:37,516
Mean a lot if you came through.

479
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:41,320
I'll never forget what your

00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:19,252
But not like here.

639
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,763
Not like this.

640
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,300
But look what it took
for them to get there.

641
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,435
A revolution, right?

642
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:30,472
That's what the fuck
we trying to do.

643
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:32,007
Right.

644
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:36,144
But there are other
ways to wage revolution.

645
00:30:36,246 --> 00:30:38,413
When we were with the panthers,

646
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:40,982
lot of times, we made changes
without firing a shot.

647
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:43,151
Well, maybe you should have.

648
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:44,920
Maybe.

649
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:48,523
But then violence becomes
the story, not justice.

650
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:52,794
And you end up dead or in jail.

651
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:55,131
And the worst part
of it, that's exactly

652
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:57,350
what they want to happen.

653
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:02,604
Not only do you
lose, but they win.

654
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:06,943
So what you do, then?

655
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,112
There are other ways to fight.

656
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:18,653
Other ways to make change.

657
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:27,295
And there are more
people out in this world

658
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:30,031
who want to help than you know.

How dangerous is the man
that killed your father

and just showed
up a few days ago?

My father went
after him and lost.

Wasn't sure what happened
to him till I saw my mother.

Teddy's different.

hearing from her?

Uh...

720
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:27,007
And she seemed
kind of cool to me.

721
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:30,544
Maybe I'm imagining it.

722
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:35,682
And please don't shut her down
if she has something to say

723
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,685
just 'cause you don't
want to hear it.

Mm-hmm.

in, I asked if it was safe.

I was being nosy,
and I found that.

730
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:02,709
I bought this place
because of the security.

731
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:04,811
And the location.

wanted from you.

all that bullshit
