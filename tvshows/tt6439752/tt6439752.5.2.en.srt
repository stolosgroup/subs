1
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:07,325
(radio stations changing)

2
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:09,760
ALTON: (over radio) Irene Abe
was murdered by the CIA.

3
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:12,163
-I'm about to drop one on you.
-(muffled groan)

4
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:13,598
ALTON:
He goes by the alias

5
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,666
Reed Thompson.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,135
I even know his real name,

7
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:18,636
and I got pictures,

8
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,771
and I'm about to put that out
in the public

9
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:22,840
- so the world can see.
- TEDDY: He is threatening

10
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:25,110
to release my real name!

11
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:27,145
HAVEMEYER: You're out,
and not just from the op.

12
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:29,980
This is the end of your career
in the CIA.

13
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:31,516
TEDDY: (whispering)
Always have an exit plan.

14
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:34,119
Watch your back

15
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:35,986
'cause they don't care
about you.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,189
I really thought this was
the beginning of something.

17
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:40,291
HAVEMEYER:
Just wanted to let you know,

18
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:41,826
I'm still vetting the possibles,

19
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,362
but I should have someone here
to replace Teddy by next week.

20
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,464
I'd like to increase the buy.

21
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:47,998
300 keys per week.

22
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:50,801
You're making your country,
and your countrymen, very happy.

23
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:52,503
Don't get too happy just yet.

24
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:54,004
Hello? Morning.

25
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:56,807
LADWP. You're,
uh, Grady Williamson?

26
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,843
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just, uh, just one second.

27
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:02,813
Justin. 335685.

28
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:05,015
90% of how I spend my time now

29
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:07,185
is being in real estate
with you.

30
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:09,687
Grady's on our side,

31
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:11,689
legit business with us.

32
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,524
Got to make it count.

33
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,394
VERONIQUE:
I need you to swear to me that

34
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:18,729
until the day comes you can
walk away, you'll do everything

35
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,998
you have to do
to make sure our baby,

36
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,500
this family,

37
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,502
is safe and protected.

38
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:27,071
- Just behind that...
- (gunshot)

39
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:29,874
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

40
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:35,713
(silverware clinking)

41
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,548
(indistinct chatter)

42
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:45,890
So, the numbers are
gonna be in by Thursday.

43
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,393
We'll have a budget to you
by next week at the earliest.

44
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,728
- Hey, I'm gonna use
the bathroom.
- Okay.

45
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:56,567
(Havemeyer sighs)

46
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:00,571
TEDDY:
Yeah, you know, I've just been

47
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,106
taking care of a few things
I let slide

48
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:05,410
over the last few years.
Traveling. That sort of thing.

49
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:07,278
Resting, I hope.

50
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:11,249
TEDDY:
Yeah. There's nothing like

51
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:13,418
some real R&R to get your head
straightened out.

52
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,552
It's funny,

53
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:16,621
I can't picture you

54
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:18,256
at a vacation resort.

55
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,393
TEDDY:
You were right.

56
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:25,563
I probably had been in
a little too long.

57
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:27,732
Needed a breather.

58
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:29,267
I probably should've taken
your advice sooner, but...

59
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,272
So, now, here we are.

60
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,841
Sitting in a restaurant
you followed me to.

61
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:39,944
So, the thing is,
I've been talking

62
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:41,579
to some of my old contacts,
you know?

63
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,948
Trying to figure out what comes
next, including a few in Tehran.

64
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:46,751
That supposed to mean
something to me?

65
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:48,953
I know what's going on
over there,

66
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:50,788
and I know it's not going well.

67
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:53,791
I'm sorry, I don't know
what we're talking about.

68
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,295
Great. Um, in that case,

69
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:59,264
maybe just...

70
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:02,267
tell your boss that you have...

71
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,435
a possible asset

72
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,471
who knows about
the seven American hostages,

73
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,473
who also happens to have spent

74
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:10,007
three years in Tehran.

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,977
Okay, what if I did know what

76
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,780
you were referring to?

77
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:18,816
What exactly are you suggesting?

78
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,455
I'm suggesting

79
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,657
that I know the region,

80
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:30,295
I'm officially out
of the agency, and I might be

81
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,497
of great value to you.

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,499
It's a club soda.

83
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:37,702
(drink pouring)

84
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,837
Let's say we could use
someone like yourself

85
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:42,840
in a limited capacity,
is being back on mission

86
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,375
really the best use
of your time?

87
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,677
- As opposed to what?
- I was thinking about

88
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:49,880
Julia and Paul.
You know, your wife and kid?

89
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:55,586
TEDDY:
Yeah, they're fine. Thanks.

90
00:03:57,422 --> 00:03:58,823
Country needs me now.

91
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,658
Anyway...

92
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,159
I'm gonna be
at the InterContinental

93
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,160
for the next few days,

94
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:06,531
just in case you want to talk.

95
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,337
It was really good to see you.

96
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,604
Same to you.

*

99
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,893
AVI: Look, just admit
it can't be worth it.

100
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:38,763
This is a torch, and I can use
this torch if you want.

101
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,598
- TEDDY: Avi.
- And I cannot.

102
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,269
- (shouting in German)
- Shut the fuck up!

103
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:47,905
Will you?

104
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,410
I told you, the Iranian

105
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:54,078
Revolutionary Guard
can't be trusted.

106
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,414
- They've confiscated them all.
- Who the hell is that?

107
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:57,882
Possible Nazi, never mind that.

108
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,750
I paid the guards off, and they

109
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,886
- fucked us just the same.
- You're saying that you

110
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,288
bribed the Revolutionary Guard,
and they're still screwing us?

111
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:06,056
- A substantial bribe.
- And the hostages?

112
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,058
The Iranians say

113
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:09,727
that Hezbollah

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,095
- kept changing the terms.
- Oh, my God.

115
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:13,398
These fucking people.

116
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:15,400
You can't trust them.
I mean, they're all playing us.

117
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,101
You're telling me.

118
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:20,771
Hey, what about my,
uh, my commission?

119
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,409
All right.
I'll handle the Iranians.

120
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:27,244
- Get rid of the Nazi.
- It's a possible Nazi.

121
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,647
If he's innocent, he walks away.

122
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,982
What the hell else
am I supposed to do

123
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:35,252
stuck in the land
of my people's genocide?

124
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,822
You don't go to Paris
and not get a croissant, right?

125
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:40,991
- (speaking German)
- I am back, mein kommandant.

126
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:43,661
Tell me, do you remember
the name of your wife today?

127
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:46,797
Now, in this minute.

128
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,799
(continues in foreign language)

129
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,167
TEDDY:
Hezbollah and Iran

130
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,336
are both cheating us.

131
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,439
Everybody's making money here,
except for the U.S.

132
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,607
Still, you got no hostages
being released.

133
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,676
Some of the missile profits
are going to the Contras.

134
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,144
Yeah, a few million,

135
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:02,613
which is not making a dent,
let me tell you.

136
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,281
Bottom line is

137
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:06,784
you got to get out
of this mess with Iran.

138
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,119
We have directives
from higher up.

139
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,456
North won't listen to anyone.

140
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,491
He's pushing forward
no matter what.

141
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:15,793
Yeah, but on what time line?
That's what I'm saying.

142
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,628
'Cause the Central American
countries, they are

143
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:18,863
turning against us.

144
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,665
The Sandinistas
are winning the PR war,

145
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:22,032
and soon they're
gonna be winning

146
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,668
- the actual war, too.
- I don't think it's as dire

147
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:25,670
- as you're making it sound.
- Really? Every contact

148
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,205
I have, every single one,
tells me that the flow of arms

149
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:30,174
to Nicaragua has slowed.

150
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,179
What is happening
in Los Angeles?

151
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:43,654
I see what you're doing.

152
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:44,855
What?

153
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:47,992
You get yourself back
in my good graces,

154
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,360
prove you're on your game,
sober and fit,

155
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:53,864
and then-then, when something
goes wrong in L.A.,

156
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:56,200
what choice
do I possibly have, right?

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,035
You're saying there's
something wrong in L.A.

158
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,205
You are fucking incredible.

159
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:04,675
Who else knows this operation
as well as I do? Nobody.

160
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,177
Right? So, if there
are problems,

161
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,747
I should be able to identify
them pretty quickly.

162
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,215
That's all I'm saying.

163
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:15,520
After everything that happened,

164
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:17,087
you'd really go back?

165
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,690
Yes, absolutely.

166
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,091
Look, it's been over a year.

167
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,693
There have been
no follow-up articles,

168
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:25,229
there have been no reporters
sniffing around, nothing.

169
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:29,433
Couple of politicians
were asking questions.

170
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,236
Yeah, a couple of PR-hungry,
rookie congressmen

171
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,871
who were desperate to get
their name in the headlines,

172
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,072
and you know what?

173
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:37,074
Everybody thinks that
they're conspiracy nuts.

174
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,414
Just...

175
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,285
Let me go back.

176
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:51,622
At least see if I can figure out
what's gone wrong.

177
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:06,436
(camera shutter clicks)

178
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,608
(camera shutter clicks)

179
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,951
(metallic scraping)

180
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:25,322
GRADY:
They got you working
on Sundays now, huh?

181
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:27,592
Oh, yeah.
They say it's the only way

182
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,493
you're gonna keep up
with the backlog, but listen,

183
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:31,929
if you want
to call and complain,

184
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,764
I won't stop you.

185
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:36,266
(chuckles) Looks like I
should've been here yesterday.

186
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,936
Must've been a hell of a party.

187
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,938
Yeah.

188
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,472
Morning.

189
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,637
NEWSMAN: Population of
homeless living on the

190
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,138
streets is believed
to be over 33,000,

191
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:16,841
and shows no signs
of improvement.

192
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,809
NEWSMAN 2: We will continue
to monitor any developments

193
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:22,680
in this story and pass them on.
The L.A. City Council today...

194
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:33,691
GRADY:
Jesus Christ.

195
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,661
That is a serious airplane.

196
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:39,229
Should've seen the Cessna
Dragonfly I flew over Laos.

197
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:41,666
- Thing handled like a...
- FRANKLIN AND GRADY: '57 Chevy.

198
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,400
I told you that already? Well,

199
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,669
you'll have to forgive me.

200
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,704
Cocaine has not been good
for my memory.

201
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:50,340
- What's up?
- Got a lot on my mind.

202
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,342
Heavy is the head.

203
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:55,045
Uh-huh.

204
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,681
Can we talk the price break?

205
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:58,215
Well, we can
if that makes you happy.

206
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:01,385
It will if I get
the right answer.

207
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,224
I can give you your price break

208
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:09,593
on one condition.

209
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:16,066
- You want my plane?
- Yup.

210
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,603
I'm kidding, huh?

211
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,906
- How about a joy ride?
- That's it?

212
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,741
That's it.

213
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:28,245
- Done.
- Now we're talking.

214
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:29,714
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
November-two-niner,

215
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,315
you are cleared for takeoff
on Runway 2.

216
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,753
- Landing gear. Lights.
- FRANKLIN: Up.

217
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,587
- FRANKLIN: Off.
- GRADY: Flaps.

218
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,423
- FRANKLIN: Up.
- GRADY: Climb power.

219
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,892
Fucking plenty.
Get ready for this.

220
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,094
(Grady yelling excitedly)

221
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:46,931
(both laughing)

222
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,468
GRADY:
Oh, this thing
fucking moves, huh?

223
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:53,103
- FRANKLIN: Uh-huh.
- (Grady laughing)

224
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:54,972
GRADY:
Oh, there it is.

225
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:58,242
There's that smile.

226
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:01,111
Hey, I worry about you,
you know?

227
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,280
Gonna give yourself
an ulcer someday.

228
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:06,116
- (laughs) I'm 24 years old.
- GRADY: Yeah,

229
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,118
my point exactly.

230
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:09,920
Look, the business
will work itself out.

231
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:12,256
Yeah, it will,

232
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:14,124
long as I make it.

233
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,295
GRADY:
So how's everything else?

234
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,765
How's the lady?

235
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:23,167
She's good, real good.

236
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,468
Getting serious.

237
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:26,971
Think she's a keeper?

238
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:28,839
- I do.
- That's good.

239
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:32,142
I've had four good women
in my life,

240
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,477
all ex-wives,

241
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,679
all keepers,

242
00:11:35,712 --> 00:11:37,447
until they weren't.

243
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:40,484
Four? Damn. I didn't know that.

244
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,186
Any kids?

245
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:43,520
Yeah, a few.

246
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:46,456
Love my kids. Hate their moms,

247
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,826
- but I love my kids.
- (laughs)

248
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:51,128
- (laughs)
- FRANKLIN: Man...

249
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:52,863
You ever thought about
having some little Franklins

250
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:54,464
running around someday?

251
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:57,667
Yeah... maybe.

252
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,470
GRADY:
Well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

253
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:03,507
Like they'd won
the fucking lottery.

254
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:24,361
So, how is it?

255
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,030
It's not good.

256
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,433
Grady is a mess.

257
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,037
There's a massive disparity
between the amount of product

258
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,539
being moved and the money
that's making it to Nicaragua.

259
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:38,175
Now, it's hard to say exactly
how much he's skimmed,

260
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,244
but... my guess would be

261
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,712
mid-seven figures.

262
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,381
And not only that,

263
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:47,051
he's in business with the asset.

264
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,753
Legitimate real estate deals
using shell companies.

265
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,521
And, as if that wasn't enough,

266
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:54,424
he's also in a relationship
with one of his people,

267
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,226
a physical one.

268
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,728
- Grady's gone native.
- (sighs)

269
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:00,931
I think we both know
how that story ends,

270
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:04,568
unless you want to do something
about it right now.

271
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,406
You sure you can work
with the asset?

272
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,741
Considering the history there?

273
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,743
What, you mean that
I made him rich?

274
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,612
Or got him out of jail?

275
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,747
Saved his ass
with that reporter.

276
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:20,918
Yes, I think we'll be fine.

277
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:22,286
See, I was thinking more about

278
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,121
what you did
to his father in Cuba.

279
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:28,158
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

280
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,464
Get Grady in line,

281
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:36,300
but do it quietly.

282
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,575
- What the fuck?
- Don't worry.

283
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,144
(laughs) I'll get it
all put away.

284
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:50,447
- Ain't nobody worried.
- (laughs)

285
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,916
How was your flight?

286
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,484
It was good. Took Grady up.

287
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:58,488
What?

288
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:00,457
You want to sage me
or something?

289
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,592
Mm, I'm thinking about it, yeah.

290
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:04,494
(laughs) What's this?

291
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:08,332
This is my attempt
to align our chaos into...

292
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:11,435
- organized chaos?
- (grunts)

293
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:14,171
Oh, my God, I don't know how you
sit on the floor like that.

294
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:17,174
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, shit.

295
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:20,310
(grunts) Ah.

296
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:23,480
- That's the day the baby comes.
- If she sticks to the plan.

297
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,315
Or he.

298
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,351
The universe
wouldn't do me like that.

299
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,453
(both laugh)

300
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,621
Man...

301
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,991
So, wait a minute, ah, yeah.

302
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,792
- Look at you.
- (chuckles)

303
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,028
Color coded it using
them chakras and shit.

304
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:39,029
VERONIQUE:
Maybe.

305
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,665
(sighs)

306
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,533
That's the deadline
for signing off on trusts

307
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:46,136
for me and the baby.

308
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,005
And that over there,
that's the deadline

309
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:51,008
for the 501(c)(3)
nonprofit corp.

310
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,044
And do you remember
what that color is?

311
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,481
- Something about sex?
- Mm.

312
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:58,682
Sure, yeah.

313
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:01,051
The sacral chakra.

314
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:03,853
- Ah.
- Mm. OB-GYN visits.

315
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:06,690
You see, I was, I was close.
I was real close.

316
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,025
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

317
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:12,562
And that's the deadline
to submit for the building.

318
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,564
The colors represent
imagination,

319
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:17,167
freedom, trust.

320
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:20,204
Should be green. All the
fucking money we about to make.

321
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:22,839
(laughs) What we about

322
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:26,176
to get into with
this building is a big deal,

323
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,677
and you trusted my instincts
to go with it,

324
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,913
and it's gonna provide
for generations to come.

325
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,748
I can feel it.

326
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:35,585
Which is why you should have
a personal equity stake.

327
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,587
You gonna own a piece, too.

328
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,890
They just canceled
Diff'rent Strokes.

329
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,727
I'm really sensitive
right now, huh.

330
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,095
Are you for real?

331
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,197
Would I lie to a pregnant woman?

332
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:50,600
- I don't know. (laughs)
- Huh? Would I? Would I?

333
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:53,070
(kisses) Yeah, for real.

334
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,704
(sighs)

335
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:57,307
Paperwork's right there
in my briefcase.

336
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:01,445
Thank you, Franklin.

337
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,581
Don't thank me.

338
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,585
- Thank the universe.
- (both laughing)

339
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:11,888
I'm serious.

340
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:14,558
It's nice when someone
sees your value,

341
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,060
you know?

342
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:17,594
Mm.

343
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:20,430
Hey.

344
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,302
I'm gonna give you
the fucking world.

345
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,104
(whispers)
You promise?

346
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:38,448
FRANKLIN:
The U.S. Treasury has

347
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:39,649
started to investigate
money laundering

348
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:40,917
in Central America.

349
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,752
Panama banks
are solid for now.

350
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:44,454
There's a better way
to invest your money.

351
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:46,756
VERONIQUE:
The L.A. Community

352
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,125
Redevelopment Agency is working

353
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,593
to revitalize
this downtown area.

354
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:51,595
We're bidding on this property,

355
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:53,097
and we're pretty sure
we can get it.

356
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,433
Mm-hmm. So, the plan is,
using our shell companies,

357
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,435
to repatriate your money
from Panama.

358
00:16:58,468 --> 00:16:59,969
Repatriate? I don't know
what the fuck that mean.

359
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,139
What you trying to do
with our money?

360
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:04,474
Move it from Panama
into this country

361
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:06,276
and invest it in this project.

362
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,444
Legitimately, though.

363
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:08,945
How much?

364
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,814
VERONIQUE:
In order for us
to be competitive

365
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:13,283
and retain majority ownership,

366
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,452
our ideal buy-in from you two
is $10 million.

367
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:18,455
Shit, that's almost
all the money we got.

368
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:20,690
FRANKLIN:
Thing is, the more we put up
for private equity,

369
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:23,360
the more we own,

370
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:27,331
and the less the banks
are involved, huh.

371
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,633
(sighs) I don't know.

372
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,635
- Legit ownership?
- All legit.

373
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:33,670
And once the building's
finished,

374
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,805
we'll be getting
commercial rent,

375
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,308
and our stakes will appreciate
as the economy comes back.

376
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:40,644
How long is it gonna take
to get our money back?

377
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:42,346
Three years,

378
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,847
- maybe less.
- JEROME: Three years?

379
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,315
FRANKLIN:
Look, this is

380
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:48,152
a long-term investment,
all right?

381
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:50,854
Returns in the area
of eight percent annually.

382
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:54,191
Tax sheltered,
and best of all, clean.

383
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:57,327
It's passive fucking income,
that's what it is.

384
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,196
How you want to be.

385
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:00,830
And if we ever
do decide to sell,

386
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,666
your initial investment
can double,

387
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,668
triple, sky's the limit.

388
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:06,035
It's all in there,

389
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,504
along with
the comparative analysis

390
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:10,374
of other commercial properties
in the area.

391
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:11,841
LOUIE:
Mm-hmm.

392
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,677
We need to talk about it.

393
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,911
FRANKLIN:
Yeah, yeah, of course.

394
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:16,546
Take a look at the projections.

395
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,182
- Let us know.
- VERONIQUE: I'm gonna head back

396
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,916
- to the office. Mm.
- All right.

397
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,023
- I'll see you later.
- Mm-hmm.

398
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:28,892
(Jerome chuckles)

399
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,063
Anything new
about Rob and his friend?

400
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:40,370
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
Rob's out.

401
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:43,039
His friend who did
the shooting, too.

402
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,774
By "out," you mean...

403
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:46,276
Out.

404
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,246
Rob was on the pipe.

405
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,747
Couldn't be trusted anymore.

406
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,252
Damn, nephew. Wow.

407
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,925
(phone rings)

408
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,927
WANDA:
Thank you, baby.

409
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:07,597
Now, you know, you always
got to ask for me, Karen,

410
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:10,400
and then we'll always have fun.

411
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,769
(chuckles) Mm.

412
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:15,004
I can't wait.

413
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,142
I'm getting wet already.

414
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,450
WOMAN:
Oh, yeah.

415
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:29,419
JOHNNY B:
I'm busy.

416
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,588
This shit is short.

417
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:32,622
(sighs)

418
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:37,461
The FCC's getting
more complaints

419
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,263
about bill cramming,
so I'm taking

420
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:42,098
- a bigger cut for fines.
- That ain't my problem.

421
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,300
Fines can put me
out of business.

422
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,101
No business, no job.
Your problem.

423
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,670
(clicks tongue)

424
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:48,171
You know how much
the telephone company takes

425
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,507
after each call? 40%.

426
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,942
And then there's rent and upkeep

427
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:55,312
and equipment. I'm barely
staying above water here.

428
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:56,780
I could give a fuck.

429
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,014
So, this is the new deal.

430
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:00,216
You don't like it?
Door's right there.

431
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:03,620
(snorting)

432
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,955
Mmm. (sniffs)

433
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:08,492
Or...

434
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:11,795
if you want to party with me,
we could work something out.

435
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,830
Yeah?

436
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,001
Yeah.

437
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,374
That's all I got to do?

438
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:27,010
That's all, baby.

439
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,180
- Fucking bitch!
- Fuck you! And fuck this job.

440
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,182
JOHNNY B:
You think you'll get
another gig like this?

441
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:36,052
Sit on your ass all day
and bullshit on the phone?!

442
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:40,857
Vamos, apúrenle
que vamos bien tarde.

443
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:43,192
- It's your fault.
- No, it's not. Shut up.

444
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:44,861
- Yes, it is.
- W-Why would you even say that?

445
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,396
Échenme la culpa.

446
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,565
Tell your teacher
it was my fault, okay?

447
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:52,001
I was... I was the whole morning
in the, in the, in the toilet.

448
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,370
Cagando.

449
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:54,904
- Ew!
- That's gross.

450
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:57,040
- Ándenle, ándenle.
- Yuck.

451
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:58,408
And learn something.

452
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,544
No quiero burros.

453
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:04,381
GIRL: I know. I don't want
to be late. Come on.

454
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:09,018
- (school bell rings)
- Your kids look happy.

455
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,521
Pos hay la llevan,
gracias a Dios.

456
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:14,558
Took a long time.

457
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,526
And Xiamara?

458
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,727
Xiamara...

459
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:20,897
Pos resulta que...
She likes this life.

460
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,899
Maybe too much.

461
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:26,202
Well, I wondered if maybe
I wouldn't find you with...

462
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:29,072
Lucia. Thought about it.

463
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:32,075
Lanzarme a Miami. Show up.

464
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:34,411
But then I realized

465
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:37,714
my family's here, you know?

466
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,483
I think it's a good choice.

467
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:42,586
So...

468
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,089
What you doing here?

469
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:50,259
Grady's sloppy.

470
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,095
He's compromised.

471
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:54,297
He's a danger to himself,
to the mission,

472
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,265
to everyone.

473
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:59,969
So, they're bringing you back?

474
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:05,308
Entonces el Grady's out?

475
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,143
Shortly, yeah.

476
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:09,312
Mm.

477
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:14,117
He loves it here.

478
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,352
His job.
La feria más.

479
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:21,758
This-this guy is not gonna like
being told to leave.

480
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,527
It's not his choice.

481
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,332
I'm here

482
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,701
'cause I need to know
if I can still count on you.

483
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:38,975
Pues ya sabes.
Just want to take care

484
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:40,977
- of my family.
- Of course.

485
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:42,779
And I'll look out for you,
same as before.

486
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:44,548
Okay.

487
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:50,319
Grady's not a bad guy, you know?

488
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,822
And he's more fun than you.

489
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:54,991
I'm fun.

490
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:56,526
(laughs)

491
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:01,164
You are mi carnal,
but fun, you are not.

492
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:05,034
I got eight AKs, five MAC-10s,

493
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:06,803
and my new favorite,

494
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:09,172
a Mini Uzi.

495
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,375
Invented by a friend of mine,

496
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:15,812
Major Uziel Gal.
Got 15 of these.

497
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:18,548
- Feels like a toy.
- A toy that does 950 rounds

498
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,850
per minute.

499
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,486
And it never jams.

500
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,987
LOUIE:
Mm.

501
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,055
You like?

502
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:27,824
We do.

503
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:30,059
Look at you two,

504
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:32,529
regular Bonnie and Clyde.
Do you know that movie?

505
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:34,831
Know shit ain't end up
too good for them.

506
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:36,866
No, no, no, ignore that part.

507
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:38,702
I meant, just, you know,

508
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:41,505
having a partner in crime.

509
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:44,373
I'm jealous,
if you really want to know.

510
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:45,875
Yeah.

511
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,410
You got each other,

512
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:50,079
you got money, you got the city.

513
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:52,048
Hope it's making you happy.

514
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:54,350
Next time you come, stay longer.

515
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:57,053
Hmm? We'll talk more.

516
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:06,763
(sighs) That was weird.

517
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:09,566
You think he got something
going on with him?

518
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,735
You start thinking what
might be going on with Avi,

519
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:13,036
you end up in a straitjacket.

520
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:14,771
(scoffs)

521
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:16,205
What?

522
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,441
I mean, is he right, though?

523
00:24:20,076 --> 00:24:21,545
You happy?

524
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:23,780
Shit.

525
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:26,049
I'm rich, I'm alive,

526
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:28,718
got you sitting over there
in that skirt,

527
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:30,887
and the Raiders in L.A. (laughs)

528
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,589
I don't see how
I could be much better.

529
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,725
Well...

530
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,761
maybe I ain't say it enough,

531
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:40,429
how much I appreciate you.

532
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:44,568
Was a time you didn't want
to be in this game at all,

533
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,269
and now you all the way in,

534
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,672
and I know that
that's because of me.

535
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:52,909
And that's everything.

536
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:55,478
(banging on truck)

537
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:58,782
You a king among men.

538
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,952
I hope you know that.

539
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:08,291
OPERATOR:
Ocho, cuatro, dos, seis.

540
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:11,460
Yeah, Havana.

541
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,262
OPERATOR:
Sí, sí. Del La Province Habana.

542
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:15,599
Look, could you
connect me, please?

543
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:17,266
I'm having trouble
calling direct.

544
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,603
- Aquí tiene, señor.
- (line beeping)

545
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:21,104
CISSY:
Son?

546
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:23,306
Mama?

547
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:24,941
Mom, you there? Can you hear me?

548
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:26,275
Franklin?

549
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,945
It's so good to hear from you.

550
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:30,780
Sweetheart, how are you?

551
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:33,783
Uh, Mama, these connections
are getting worse.

552
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,318
I got to find a better one.

553
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:36,853
(staticky)
Franklin...

554
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:39,656
I got some important news
about Veronique.

555
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:43,326
I know they say
it's too early to tell people,

556
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,394
but you know
I had to tell you, though.

557
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:49,165
She's pregnant.

558
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,035
What did you say?

559
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:54,037
Mom, we gonna have a baby.

560
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,672
A baby?

561
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,375
Can't believe it. (chuckles)

562
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:01,711
How exciting!

563
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:03,847
Sure wish you was here.

564
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,652
Mama, can you hear me?

565
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:10,687
(line beeping)

566
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,861
(sighs)

567
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,869
(indistinct chatter,
laughter)

568
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:35,879
Chaperoning field trips now?

569
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:38,247
Just trying to open up
their worlds a little bit.

570
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:39,783
(laughs)

571
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:43,052
Do it again in a few weeks?

572
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:44,620
You got it.

573
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,559
Where'd you take them?

574
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,561
Uh, Santa Monica
for the last few times,

575
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,430
but got hassled by the cops,

576
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:56,099
so been going down
to El Segundo.

577
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:57,934
Hmm.

578
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:01,270
Remember when you, me and Kev
went to the beach that time?

579
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:02,872
(chuckles)

580
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:05,775
First time
I'd ever seen the ocean.

581
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:07,744
Shit's scary as fuck.

582
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,781
Come on.

583
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,454
LEON:
You ever look
at that book I gave you?

584
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:20,890
Mm. Meaning to.

585
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:23,092
Haven't got around to it yet.

586
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:26,395
I wanted to talk to you
about this

587
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,231
development opportunity
downtown.

588
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:30,566
Appreciate it, but...

589
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:33,636
gonna have to pass on that one.

590
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,739
Look, you know
I don't care about

591
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,240
what you do with your money.

592
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:39,408
Just want to make sure
you got a plan.

593
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:41,244
Look, already got more
than I ever thought I would have

594
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:42,946
- or could need.
- Yeah. (scoffs)

595
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:45,148
You know, can't be
doing you any good.

596
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:47,951
You know, you burying it or...

597
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:49,652
stashing it in shoeboxes

598
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,254
or wherever you keeping it.

599
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:53,122
Well, I'd rather that than
using it to build some building

600
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:56,325
that white folks will just want
to keep Black folks out of.

601
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:59,495
All right. All right.

602
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,799
Jerome told me about Rob.

603
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,634
Yeah.

604
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,437
(sighs)

605
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:10,439
He was on the pipe.

606
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:12,608
- Maybe he could've cleaned up.
- You didn't see him.

607
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:15,444
Could've folded any time.

608
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:16,980
Said some shit
he shouldn't have.

609
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:19,783
Couldn't have been easy.

610
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:22,952
It wasn't,

611
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,821
but it had to be done.

612
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,030
(sighs)

613
00:28:34,063 --> 00:28:35,464
Veronique's pregnant.

614
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:37,967
- Oh, shit, for real?
- (chuckles) Uh-huh.

615
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:40,669
It's only been about six weeks.

616
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:43,973
I ain't told nobody else.

617
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:45,809
But you see, that's why, man.

618
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:47,510
That's why.

619
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:51,580
Why I got to keep
this motherfucker tight.

620
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:01,991
I see you thinking it,
might as well say it.

621
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:04,193
(clears throat)

622
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:06,029
Nothing.

623
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:08,031
I'm happy for you.

624
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:10,867
About to be a daddy. (laughs)

625
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:13,502
- (chuckles)
- Shit is crazy.

626
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:16,339
About to be a daddy.

627
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:18,374
(crickets chirping)

628
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:30,219
I admire your taste in wine.

629
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,259
DWP.

630
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:39,028
But without the wig.
I'd offer you a line

631
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:41,030
or a drink,
but I'm guessing you'd say no.

632
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:43,532
- Yeah, I'm working.
- Right.

633
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:45,068
Right.

634
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,905
So, what, did you
come here to warn me?

635
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:50,406
You gonna rap my knuckles?

636
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:53,709
What'd you expect?

637
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:56,579
This house, those cars...

638
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:02,751
That's before we even get
to the millions of dollars

639
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:05,421
that are flowing
directly into your pocket

640
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:07,723
- and not to the cause.
- Well, there's a lot
of looking the other direction.

641
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:09,658
I just figured I was included.

642
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:12,595
You're not.

643
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,598
Fine.

644
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,967
I got the message.

645
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:19,969
Now, you can go tell
your masters

646
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:22,305
that you did your job,
all right?

647
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:24,440
(chair scraping)

648
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,946
It's too late.

649
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,847
Your contract's canceled.
It's over.

650
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:34,450
No.

651
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:37,921
No, I don't...

652
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:39,855
I don't think that it is.

653
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,969
Who has a relationship
with the Colombians?

654
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:55,138
Who can get 500 keys
across the border

655
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:56,472
and knows how to move it?

656
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:58,141
Yeah, you know, if it was
anybody else sitting here,

657
00:30:58,174 --> 00:31:00,009
those might be problems.

658
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:03,980
Wait, you're the guy?

659
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:06,482
(laughs)
Oh, my God.

660
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:08,517
You're the, you're the guy.

661
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:10,486
You're the guy that...

662
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:12,388
You're the guy that almost
went down with the ship.

663
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,992
Wow.

664
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:18,127
Well, how'd they get you
to come back?

665
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:20,829
Was it the carrot
or was it the stick?

666
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:25,834
You can keep the cars,
whatever money you've managed

667
00:31:25,868 --> 00:31:27,303
to squirrel away.

668
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:29,472
Wait, maybe they
didn't come back to you.

669
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:31,307
Maybe you volunteered.

670
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,641
You're one of the last
true believers

671
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:33,809
who's not in on the joke yet.

672
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,479
You know,
all the "God and country" guys

673
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:38,047
that I come across,
they're-they're looking

674
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,549
for something else
to fill, you know?

675
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,385
They want to be important.

676
00:31:42,418 --> 00:31:44,687
They want to feel
like they matter.

677
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,856
They want to feel like
they're not a fucking joke.

678
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:49,692
I'll be back here tomorrow,

679
00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:52,028
- and I expect you to be gone.
- GRADY: Well, hold on.
Let me guess.

680
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:55,031
Your wife left you. She's off
fucking some other guy.

681
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,865
Your kids,
they don't want to talk to you

682
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:58,401
'cause you're a fucking idiot.

683
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,036
And-and your parents,
I'm guessing that

684
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,838
they probably kicked you around
so much as a little pup,

685
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:04,407
that you started to believe

686
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,742
that you didn't matter,
that you weren't worth a shit.

687
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:09,045
Am I close?

688
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:14,450
(sighs)

689
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:22,391
You think I didn't
see this coming? (chuckles)

690
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,560
Yeah, you go back,
and you tell them

691
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,930
that I know an awful lot
that they don't want coming out.

692
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:30,266
You tell them that
I am this operation,

693
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,201
and that they better
think twice next time

694
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:33,869
before they come to this house.

695
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:35,404
(door closes)

696
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:42,545
Want me to send
some folks down there,

697
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:43,746
fuck his whole day up?

698
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:46,582
Nah. It was a stupid-ass
job anyways.

699
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,551
You wouldn't believe
how disgusting

700
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,286
some of these niggas are.

701
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:55,258
But it took me months of looking
even to find that one.

702
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:57,426
Thought of going back out there,

703
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,496
trying to explain the whole
two-year gap in my life...

704
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,733
The way people look at you

705
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,635
when they realize
you was on that rock.

706
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:09,572
So, don't tell them.
Make some shit up.

707
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:12,808
Mm-mm. That's part
of the recovery,

708
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:15,578
being honest with yourself
and the world.

709
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:18,281
(scoffs) You know,

710
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:21,984
I thought getting sober
was gonna be the hard part,

711
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:25,121
but staying clean, sh...

712
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:27,590
It's almost worse.

713
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:29,425
Especially when you
got to keep paying for shit

714
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,595
you did while you was high.

715
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:34,463
I got to do something, Lee.

716
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:40,269
I might need you to put me on.

717
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:43,606
You was here, remember?
Walked away for a reason.

718
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:45,441
I know, but that was
almost a year ago.

719
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:46,942
Temptation's still the same.

720
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:48,977
You really want to be
around that shit all day?

721
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,319
Don't think I got a choice.

722
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,488
You do.
And I'm gonna make it easy.

723
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:01,357
Ain't nothing here for you.

724
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,992
Gonna have to figure
something else out.

725
00:34:16,372 --> 00:34:18,407
*

726
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:33,322
(grunting)

727
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:35,358
(coughing, gasping)

728
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,206
Should've taken the out.

729
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:56,044
(gurgling)

730
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:57,913
(retching)

731
00:34:57,946 --> 00:35:00,216
(whispering)
I want you to understand,

732
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:03,051
this is not because
you insulted me.

733
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:05,888
(labored breathing)

734
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:08,056
It's because
you're bad at your job.

735
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,927
Your waste cost countless lives.

736
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,562
(coughs)

737
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,408
(doorbell rings)

738
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:30,413
You forget your key again?

739
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:43,091
- Hey.
- Hey.

740
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,894
- Can I come in or...
- Yeah.

741
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:47,796
Come on, man. (chuckles)

742
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,266
Yeah, welcome.
(clears throat)

743
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:07,149
It's a nice place.

744
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:19,495
It's safe.

745
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:22,265
It's quiet. Secluded.

746
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:24,467
Secure.

747
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:28,304
Guess it's everything
I'd expect from you, right?

748
00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:30,105
When'd you get back in town?

749
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:32,808
TEDDY:
Uh, a few weeks ago.
You know, what's crazy is

750
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:35,811
I never, in my life, thought
that I would miss Los Angeles...

751
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:41,784
But I don't know, man,
somehow this place

752
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:44,687
has a way of growing on you.

753
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,856
Oh, shit, I hear
you're coming up.

754
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,525
Got your pilot's license.

755
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:52,461
- (chuckles) Yeah.
- Holy shit.

756
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:54,997
And a lady, that right?

757
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:58,734
Yo, you want a cigar
or something?

758
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:04,373
Sure.

759
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:08,977
Thing's been moving smooth, man.

760
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:11,314
Got to call Grady.
He's doing a great job.

761
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:13,549
I know you like Grady.

762
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:15,551
I know that he is...

763
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:18,020
easy to be around.

764
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,657
That's his job.

765
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,826
Make you like him,
make you trust him,

766
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,361
make you think that
he's looking out for you.

767
00:37:25,394 --> 00:37:26,662
Saying he's not?

768
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:29,698
Saying he makes
some really poor choices.

769
00:37:29,732 --> 00:37:32,067
Now, partying,

770
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,538
that's something
I could forgive, but...

771
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:38,707
he goes and he gets
himself into...

772
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:39,908
let's call it

773
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:42,210
a romantic relationship,
with one of your crew,

774
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,546
and that's before we even get

775
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:46,715
to the two of you

776
00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:49,518
in real estate together,
which...

777
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:51,053
(whistles)

778
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:54,690
Look, I get it.

779
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,091
I know that, at the time,

780
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:58,060
it probably seemed
like a really good idea.

781
00:37:58,093 --> 00:37:59,395
If you're entwined
in legitimate business,

782
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:00,529
he's more likely to protect you,

783
00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:02,197
look after you, all that.

784
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,533
Why do you keep talking about
him in the past tense, Reed?

785
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,869
What I cannot
wrap my head around here

786
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:09,538
is how you could possibly think
that it is a good idea

787
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:11,407
to get that close
to your contact.

788
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:12,908
Figured if somebody
had a problem with it,

789
00:38:12,908 --> 00:38:14,109
they would've said something.

790
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:16,612
Here I am, saying it.

791
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:22,885
Grady was not your friend.

792
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,920
It's a matter of time
before he got everybody

793
00:38:24,953 --> 00:38:26,789
in a lot of trouble.
Good news is

794
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:30,393
it's been taken care of before
things can get too out of hand.

795
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:32,561
We can get back to doing things
the way they should be done.

796
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:34,497
Starting when?

797
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,766
Right now.

798
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:43,271
We got shit done before.

799
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,073
No reason why we can't
get shit done now.

800
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:47,109
That's really great to hear.

801
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:51,780
'Cause I don't think
I have to explain to you...

802
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:55,951
...that the stakes
have never been higher,

803
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:58,421
so there can be no more
mistakes, no more foul-ups,

804
00:38:58,454 --> 00:39:00,623
and no more loose ends.
Is that okay?

805
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:01,957
Yeah, okay.

806
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:04,993
Okay.

807
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:11,299
I'll, uh, be in touch about

808
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:12,835
the next drop.

809
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:16,004
In the meantime, uh,
this house that

810
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:18,173
you helped him get
through your trust,

811
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:20,976
go ahead and sell that.

812
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:23,111
Get me the cash. You know what?

813
00:39:23,145 --> 00:39:26,281
I don't carry a lighter anymore.

814
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:27,349
You mind?

815
00:39:27,382 --> 00:39:29,785
It's your world, man.

816
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:31,319
I just sell dope in it.

817
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,502
Hey, Reed.

818
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:50,839
Grady had agreed
to cut the prices down.

819
00:39:52,174 --> 00:39:54,643
$9,000 a kilo.

820
00:39:54,677 --> 00:39:56,211
I'm hoping you can honor that.

821
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:58,180
Let's keep it at ten for now.

822
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,485
Also, Reed's gone.

823
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:04,587
From here on,
you can call me Teddy.

824
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,902
