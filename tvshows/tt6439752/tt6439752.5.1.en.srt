What's 300,000 times 52?

159
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,524
FRANKLIN:
About 15.5 million.

160
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:52,527
Gustavo, if Franklin here
were to ask you

161
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,564
to give him $15 million,
what would you say?

162
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,432
I'm just telling you
what's happening on the street.

163
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:00,302
And I'm telling you
that the company is on my ass

164
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,170
about these funds. If I start
coming back with less,

165
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:03,972
that's gonna bring a lot
of attention

166
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,407
that you and I cannot have.

167
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,276
Yeah, but if my people can pay
less elsewhere, then they will.

168
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:11,213
And that's a whole other kind
of trouble for us.

169
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,547
I thought
your people were family.

170
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,318

All right?

470
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,228
Niggas die by the handful
every day

471
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,830

Look, as soon as Thad
reaches out,

474
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,400
then Rob will know
where he's at,

475
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,935
and then we'll go do
what has to be done, all right?

And as soon as we deal

- You think rob down with that?

485
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,554
- He ain't got no choice.
- Well, rob being out means

486
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:11,222
less product being moved,

487
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,691
less likely Grady is
to cut that price,

488
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,192
and I need the price cut,
Franklin.

Good morning.

630
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,841
Made you coffee.

(scoffs)
well, maybe you should start.

What were you gonna do?

634
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,884
Just go wander in the streets?

635
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:29,620
Looking for any random
corner boy?

636
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:30,854
I heard from Thad.

I know where he is.

638

I just needed something to...

639
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,693
Even me out
before I go out there.

640
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,730
- Out where, rob?
- Palm springs.

641
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,732
Where some family friend
of theirs has a place,

642
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,567
it sits empty in the summer.

643
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,604
I said I'd take care of this
and I will, you know?

644
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,706
Just... You just
give me a car and a gun.

645
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,441
No, I'm not letting you
go out there alone.

646
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:52,709
Peaches will go with you.

647
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,712
Thad's freaked out, man.
He's, like, paranoid.

648
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,881
If Peaches shows up with me,
he'll know something's off.

649
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,583
And if he doesn't,
I got to worry about

650
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,918
you getting high
and fucking it all up.

651
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,086
Now where does that
leave us, huh?

652
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,591
I mean, you could come with us.

653
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:10,594
You know, Thad knows you.
It'll relax him.

654
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,562
He'll think
we're coming to help.

655

(exhales)

656
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,707
call Thad.

657
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,609
Tell him we're coming
out there to get him.

658
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,412
I'll get Peaches
to get you some cocaine,

659
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:29,980
straighten you out, huh?

660
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,949
We'll all go out there
to the desert,

661
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,651
make sure this shit
don't come back to bite us.

662
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,019
Then after, we come back here,

663
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,789
I'll fly you to some fancy
fucking rehab place,

664
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:41,591
and you promise me
that you gonna get sober

665
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,794
and stay that way, all right?

666
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:47,364

fucking perfect, man. Thanks.

669

Promise me.

670
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,186
Yeah.

671
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:13,390
Yeah, I promise.

672
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,893
(snorts) so I heard
this story last week.

673
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,129
(snorts) the cops,
one weekend on the freeway

674
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:22,065
from L.A. To Vegas,
they put out a sign that says,

675
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,802
"one mile ahead, all cars
are being stopped and searched."

676
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:28,739
so all these people,
partying on the drive to Vegas,

677
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,141
they see this, get freaked out,
start to panic.

678
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:34,711
Then they see there's an exit
a half-mile ahead.

679
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,947
So the cars with drugs
and stuff in them,

680
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,750
they start getting off
at the exit, you know?

681
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:40,851
(chuckles)

682
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:43,620
to try and get around
the search?

683
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,789
Want to guess what happened?

684
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,057

00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,685
No. Please, please, rob. Don't.

784
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,154
Please, don't. Don't.

785
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,690
Rob, please.

786
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,026
No, please. Please.
Rob, no, no, no.

787
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:26,529
No, no, no. Please,
please, rob. Don't...

788
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,532
(dogs barking in distance)

789
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,875
(insects trilling)

790
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,064
PEACHES:
Right here.

791
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:08,238
Hey.

792
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,174
You did good.

793
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,077
Shit couldn't have gone down
any other way.

794
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,949
One last night, right?

795
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:31,728
Got to make it count.

796
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,701
(rob inhaling)

797
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:49,746
(rob coughing)

798
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,865
(door opens, closes)

799
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,875
(sighs)

800
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,043
hey, beautiful.

801
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,946
It's almost 11:00.

802
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,180
(grunts)

803
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,716
yeah, late night.

804
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:30,086
(exhales)
do I want to know?

805
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,790
No. Probably not.

806
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,893
Well, now I need to.

807
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:37,727
(Franklin grunts)

808
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:42,232
it's just a friend of mine
I went to high school with,

809
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,968
got into some trouble,
needed a little help.

810
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,970
It's all good.

811
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,608
You okay?

812
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,679
(sighs)

813
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,052
what ring's that?

814
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,189
VERONIQUE:
It's my first stone.

815
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,390
Azurite.

816
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,225
I bought it when I decided
I didn't want

817
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,228
my mom's energy around anymore,

818
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,831
but I didn't quite know
how to tell her.

819
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:16,966
Why do I feel like you about

820
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,736
to hit me with some bad news?

821
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,305
Mm.

822
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,374
It's not bad.

823
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:27,143
Listen, I know you didn't bust
your ass,

824
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:28,978
make it all the way
through law school,

825
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,014
just to be some housewife.

826
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,415
Some things will change.

827
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:35,919
Everything will change
if we have this baby, Franklin.

828
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,387
Yes, I know.

829
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:40,089
But you can still have
the life that you want.

830
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,895
I believe you.

831
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,063
I do.

832
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,801
I love you, Franklin.

833
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:56,906
Even though having this child
is nowhere in my five year plan.

834
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,007
(laughs)

835
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,678
I know this baby
will be amazing.

836
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:07,917
That a higher power put this
in our lives for a reason.

837
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,019
But I need you to hear me.

838
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:13,122
I will not accept a life
that does not support

839
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,457
this child in every way.

840
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,027
- And your other life...
- Is ending.

841
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,897
- Soon.
- (whispers) Okay.

842
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,666
Come here.

843
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,105
90% of how I spend my time now

844
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,507
is being in real estate
with you.

845
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,445
Grady's on our side,
in legit business with us.

846
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:38,448
He ain't gonna want anything bad
to happen to us.

847
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:41,951
Hmm. But until then,
you can't control it.

848
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,956
Neither can I.

849
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:49,192
I have to accept that.

850
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,761
Make my peace with it.

851
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,965
And I have.

852
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,506
I need you to swear to me

853
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:07,276
that until the day comes
you can walk away,

854
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:11,914
you will do everything you have
to do to make sure our baby,

855
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:13,116
this family,

856
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,918
<i>is safe and protected.</i>

857
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:17,920
(rob grunting, panting)

858
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,524
wish we could find that comet.

859
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:23,259
It's got to be
out here somewhere.

860
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,728
What it look like?

861
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:28,431
I think it's, like,
a bright spot

862
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,601
- with a tail behind it.
- A tail?

863
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:35,038
Think I read it was supposed
to be in the southern sky.

864
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,076
That way.

865
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,049
Oh, wow.

866
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,284
I think I see it.
(laughs)

867
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:51,320
FRANKLIN:
Yeah? Where?

868
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:55,725
It's right there. See?
Just behind that...

869
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,969
<i>FRANKLIN:</i>
<i>I'm gonna do whatever it takes.</i>

870
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,909
Promise.

871
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,077
(laughs softly)

872
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:21,150
FRANKLIN:
Spotted it during my flight
on Saturday.

873
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:23,653
I want to build us a compound.

874
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:27,990
A place for us to start
our legacy.

875
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,160
But I need to know
I have your loyalty, v.

876
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,995
(sighs)

877
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:34,897
baby, of course.

878
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,901
I'm serious.

879
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:44,107
You know, people I loved
told me they had my back

880
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,042
and then stabbed me in it.

881
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,246
But you see, the thing is,
all those people today,

882
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,914
they're all gone.

883
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,320
What you had, that predates me.

884
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,057
What you need from me now,

885
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:03,960
that's yours.
