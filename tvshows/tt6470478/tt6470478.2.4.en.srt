2
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:23,472
I got you a doughnut.

3
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:24,730
Apparently.

4
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:29,081
What are you doing today?

5
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:31,850
My least favorite thing in the world.

6
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:34,609
Looking for an apartment?

7
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:37,138
Yeah, I'll be out of here in 48 hours,

8
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,522
for both of our sakes.

9
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,132
What about your old apartment?

10
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:45,811
Kenny got arrested,

11
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:49,215
so I don't think he needs it anymore.

12
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,286
I don't think being neighbors
is such a great idea.

13
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,005
We had a fight.

14
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,217
I bought you a doughnut.

15
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,837
A really big fight
about some really big issues

16
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:14,558
that aren't gonna go away
because you got me a doughnut.

17
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,199
Remember that Usher-themed party I had?

18
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,634
I remember searching the
entire house for a TYLENOL.

19
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,503
Is it too late to apologize for that?

20
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,438
No. Never.

21
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,365
I miss you, Daddy.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,901
Who are you talking to?

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,303
I'm talking to...

24
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,674
To the chair?

25
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,224
If you can't fall asleep on your own,

26
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,493
you can have that Ambien
you've been asking for.

27
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,451
You sleep, I go away.

28
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,482
I don't need an Ambien.

29
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,401
Okay.

30
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,778
I'll be keeping an eye on you,
Dr. Glassman.

31
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,998
Trying to hop a fence, Mac?

32
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,185
I wanna go home.

33
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,187
We will, sweetie,
as soon as we fix you up.

34
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,155
Mac has Fragile X Syndrome.

35
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:30,393
A genetic disorder characterized
by intellectual disability,

36
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,429
behavioral issues, and hyperactivity.

37
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,532
The good news is that
the picket hasn't compromised

38
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:38,067
any vital organs,
major nerves, or arteries.

39
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,937
The bad news is that it
splintered inside his shoulder.

40
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,739
Oh, let's get this stick out of you, Mac.

41
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,173
- Will it hurt?
- Not a bit.

42
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,941
You're gonna sleep
through the whole thing.

43
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,253
Third time's the charm, right, Shaun?

44
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,827
Her name's Bill...

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,096
Short for "Sybil."

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,221
She likes things nice and simple.

47
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,550
Possible internal bleeding,
heel bone calcaneus fractures,

48
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,953
tibial pilon fractures,
and cervical fractures.

49
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,187
Her name's Kitty Kwon.

50
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,956
Hey, Kitty. You know where you are?

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,924
Unfortunately, yeah.

52
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,293
I was 150 feet from the summit.

53
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,552
Would've been the first female free solo.

54
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,266
Free solo?

55
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,134
Climbing without ropes.

56
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:53,183

57
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:03,577
Let's tidy up these
bleeders, irrigate the wound,

58
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:04,853
and close him up.

59
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,771
How do you find a new friend?

60
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:13,020
Lea is very mad at me.

61
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,528
Well, whatever you did to her, apologize.

62
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:18,692
I did. I said, "I'm sorry."

63
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,028
It may take even more than that.

64
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,019
Make a statement. Go big.

65
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,266
An apology's an apology.

66
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,453
If she doesn't accept it, just walk away.

67
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:32,072
And there we have the entire
spectrum of male response...

68
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,496
Dazzle them or dump them.

69
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,976
Just be nice to her, Dr. Murphy.

70
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,782
I don't like you looking like this.

71
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:44,017
I want you in a suit

72
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,485
with one of my famous ties.

73
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:47,554
I had more ties than birthdays.

74
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,978
How did that happen?

75
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:52,615
- You know what's funny?
- What?

76
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:57,120
I only have great memories of you.

77
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,434
What about all those other memories?

78
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,791
Why can't I remember them?

79
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:06,373
Good memories are like a beautiful song.

80
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:08,264
You don't want them to ever end.

81
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,780
I don't think that's all
we should talk about.

82
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,636
You're looking awfully sleepy.

83
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:22,545
Our clock is ticking. We need
to get to the good stuff.

84
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:28,770
You know, Dad, the real reason I'm here.

85
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,334
The surgery went very well.

86
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:36,670
We got every bit of picket,
and Mac is recovering nicely.

87
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,256
- Oh, thank you.
- He should be able to go home today.

88
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,333
This is all good news, Nicole.

89
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:47,003
I know. I know. I was... I was just...

90
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:51,207
I was hoping to have
one night without him.

91
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:58,300
Katherine!

92
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,796
- Mom. Dad.
- Thank God you're alive.

93
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:04,664
Thank you.

94
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,566
Unfortunately, there's
still a serious issue

95
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,136
we have to deal with.
Kitty has cervical fractures.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,037
She broke her neck.

97
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,040
Luckily, we can repair it
by fusing her spine.

98
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:16,243
Your range of motion will be restricted,

99
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,811
but when everything else heals,

100
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,046
you should be walking
within three months.

101
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,907
Will I be able to climb again?

102
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:27,037
Not at that level,
and certainly not free solo.

103
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,500
They should've just left me
on that mountain to die.

104
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:35,762
Then I think you'll prefer
the second option...

105
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,543
The Odontoid Screw Procedure.

106
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,132
It doesn't involve vertebral fusion

107
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:41,434
and could maintain
your full range of motion.

108
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,403
Seriously? Sign me up!

109
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:46,740
The spinal fusion surgery
is generally preferred

110
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,508
because it has higher healing rates

111
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,544
and more favorable long-term results.

112
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,379
But the screw procedure's less invasive,

113
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:54,014
so there's reduced collateral injury

114
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,398
and no permanent damage.

115
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,152
Would she be able to climb again?

116
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,554
Free solo? Everything?

117
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:01,888
Eventually, yes.

118
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:03,123
Can I say yes now?

119
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,224
Yes!

120
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:05,392
No.

121
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,498
If you give her this operation,
you'll be killing her.

122
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:20,031
You can get help.

123
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:23,634
You mean IEPs, speech therapy,

124
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:25,603
or a behavioral mod?

125
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:28,573
Have you considered a residential
facility, a group home?

126
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:31,309
Give him away? To strangers?

127
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,743
To professionals who can help him.

128
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,212
He was abandoned by his father.

129
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,703
I'm all that he has left.

130
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:42,676
God, he was such a beautiful baby.

131
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:47,815
And he was perfectly normal,
walking, talking...

132
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:51,997
But just after he turned two,

133
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,465
we noticed a change.

134
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:57,002
He started to lose his words.
He was going backwards.

135
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,060
When we got the test results,

136
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:06,644
everything we'd hoped for
our perfect, little boy was...

137
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:08,146
Was gone.

138
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,782
By the time he was nine, he
was too much for my husband.

139
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,818
And that was before his growth spurt

140
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:16,654
and before his mood swings became...

141
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,154
I don't want to give him up.
I... I just...

142
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:27,565
I just wanted a break
for one lousy night.

143
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,659
Nobody blames you for that, Nicole.

144
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:32,746
And you don't have to
send your son anywhere.

145
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:35,439
I'm sure that'd be devastating
for a kid like Mac.

146
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:47,819
I don't go to church, I swear,

147
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:50,263
and I have sex with strange men.

148
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,348
Your room's on the left.

149
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:01,900
Yes, it would.

150
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:09,157
Then he'd get used to it.

151
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,478
It started with a broken arm
and a concussion.

152
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:17,448
The next time, it was a shattered
femur and a ruptured spleen,

153
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:18,950
then a broken pelvis,

154
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:20,651
then a skull fracture

155
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,753
that put her into a coma for three days.

156
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:25,189
She needs this crazy... fix.

157
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:27,133
I'm not an adrenaline junkie!

158
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,728
Okay, when I climb,
adrenaline is the enemy.

159
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:34,999
I need to be calm, relaxed,
and focused, or this happens.

160
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:38,311
You've always wanted me to believe
I can do anything I want.

161
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:42,524
Each time that I summit, every
roadblock in my life melts away.

162
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:44,859
It's what I live for.

163
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:48,813
We... We just want you to keep living.

164
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,648
And I will, Dad,

165
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,368
but I can think of worse things
than dying doing what I love.

166
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:58,155
Mr. and Mrs. Kwon, I
understand how you're feeling,

167
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,124
but your daughter's 18.

168
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:01,459
It's her decision.

169
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:02,961
Thank you, Dr. Reznick.

170
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,090
I'd like to proceed with your surgery.

171
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,306
Remember you telling me when you grew up,

172
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,509
you wanted to be a nurse...
A "male nurse"?

173
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,177
- You're deflecting.
- Yes, I am.

174
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:22,913
I'm deflecting. I am... deflecting.

175
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,181
What is the point, Maddie?

176
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,983
Let's get to this, Daddy.
What do you say?

177
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,519
- Who are you talking to?
- Shaun, what are you doing?

178
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,788
You don't sneak up on me like that.

179
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:33,924
You may be experiencing delirium

180
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:38,029
with possible auditory
and/or visual hallucinations.

181
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,530
- I'm fine.
- It may be a symptom

182
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:41,766
- of severe post-operative...
- Shaun, Shaun, I'm fine.

183
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,878
I'm just... I'm really...
I'm just really tired.

184
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm...

185
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:49,774
I'm remembering.

186
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,776
Lying to your little buddy.

187
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,811
I thought you two were
Gilligan's Island-tight.

188
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,336
I'm just remembering.

189
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,117
Okay.

190
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:04,855
Lea said I was
a total jerk and a jackass,

191
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,425
even though all I did
was tell her the truth,

192
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:08,959
and then I did everything right,

193
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:11,595
but she still got mad at me again.

194
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,830
I thought this was Maddie time.

195
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:14,098
I asked for advice,

196
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:17,101
and Dr. Park told me to go big

197
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,170
and Dr. Melendez told me to walk away

198
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,763
and JL the anesthesiologist,

199
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:23,607
she told me to be nice,
but I don't know which...

200
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:26,977
Shaun, Shaun, Shaun, I just... I'm not

201
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:31,816
in the best wisdom mode
at the moment. Okay?

202
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,986
I'll tell Dr. Dulay you may be
experiencing psychosis.

203
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,722
I'm not psychotic, Shaun.

204
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:38,956
There's no need to bother her.

205
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,791
It won't bother her. It's her job.

206
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,626
- Shaun, stop!
- He won't listen to you, Daddy.

207
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,896
- He never does!
- Maddie, please! Will you please!

208
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,616
I'm having a vision.

209
00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:00,077
Just a vision.

210
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,705
Maybe it's the drugs. I don't know.

211
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,920
You're talking to Maddie.

212
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:23,851
Shaun, can you keep this between us?

213
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,771
Please? Just for a little while.

214
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,924
Okay.

215
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:38,983
We both know he can't
keep a secret worth a damn.

216
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,284
We'd better get to it.

217
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:41,452
I don't want to get to it.

218
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:42,787
I want to talk about the rest of it.

219
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:44,755
I want to talk about the... The...

220
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,690
The Usher parties and the ties.

221
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:48,826
Why can't we talk about your track meets?

222
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,661
Because we're past that, Daddy.

223
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:53,831
We need to talk about why
you're talking to a ghost,

224
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:56,634
why I'm not sitting here for
real, holding my father's hand.

225
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,202
Good dreams, please. Good dreams.

226
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:59,437
You want good dreams?

227
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,228
Go ahead. Take your pill.

228
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,938
This has got to happen, Daddy.
You know it.

229
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:25,271
What if they're right?
What if we are, in effect,

230
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,124
killing their daughter by giving
her the surgery she wants?

231
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,277
These are not issues
doctors should think about.

232
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,529
That's what we tell ourselves

233
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:34,847
because it makes it easier
for us to just do our job

234
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:36,649
and not worry about whether
we're helping or hurting.

235
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:38,918
For all we know, on her next climb,

236
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:40,286
she may meet her soul mate.

237
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:43,456
If, on the other hand,

238
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,425
you're not God and, like the rest of us,

239
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,460
you have no idea what will happen to her,

240
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,885
then you should back off.

241
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:52,498
Focus on the medical issues,

242
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:55,535
because as long as Kitty's
a competent adult,

243
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,126
it's all moot.

244
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,808
This is the two-bedroom.

245
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:03,591
The one-bedroom went about an hour ago.

246
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:06,027
Oh, no. I wanted the one.

247
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:10,683
Sorry. This has a much bigger
living room and a much better view.

248
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:13,075
And a much bigger price.

249
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:18,090
Oh, I didn't know it had a fireplace!

250
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:20,459
Damn it, Willow, I just
fell in love with this place,

251
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,662
which is just cruel, since
I definitely can't afford it.

252
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:25,064
You fall in love very quickly.

253
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:26,541
Shaun?

254
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:32,705
I found a cheaper apartment
with comparable amenities.

255
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:34,206
I wrote down the address.

256
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,594
What are you doing here?

257
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:39,045
You said you hated apartment hunting,

258
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:41,155
so I decided to help you.

259
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,216
That's being nice.

260
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,585
And don't forget about the doughnut.

261
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:48,854
That isn't being nice. It's being creepy.

262
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:51,057
- Did you follow me here?
- No.

263
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,392
I saw the rental address

264
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,728
highlighted on your tablet this morning.

265
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,863
That is creepy, too.

266
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,699
You know, I didn't ask
for your help, Shaun.

267
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,884
I do not need your help,
and I don't want your help.

268
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:15,715
Katherine, if you won't
reconsider this surgery...

269
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:16,673
I won't.

270
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,184
...then we have to
consider other options.

271
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:24,023
The decision is yours, unless

272
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:26,425
we have you declared
mentally incompetent.

273
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:29,245
You're saying that I might be crazy?

274
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,037
You were in Vienna for my Sweet 16.

275
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,538
I was the keynote speaker.

276
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:41,774
And that birthday card
signed by your secretary.

277
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:42,975
What's the point, Maddie?

278
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,044
All the committees
and councils and boards,

279
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,946
evenings, weekends, holidays...

280
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,714
- I was working my ass off.
- That's just an excuse.

281
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,116
You were avoiding me.

282
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,517
Oh, I was avoiding you?

283
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,652
When I was home,
you paid no attention to me

284
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,555
or anything I had to say.

285
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,524
I heard you've been
experiencing some delirium...

286
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,896
...possibly hallucinations.

287
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,961
Shaun.

288
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,059
I kept our secret

289
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,799
for 30 minutes.

290
00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:07,867
He betrayed you. He's not a friend.

291
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:09,435
It could just be ICU psychosis

292
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,737
brought on by lack of sleep,
but, as you know,

293
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:13,506
or would know, if you weren't psychotic,

294
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,274
it could be a lot worse.

295
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,676
It could be an indicator
of surgical complications,

296
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,678
like infection or cerebral ischemia.

297
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:21,839
I'm not psychotic. I'm just tired.

298
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,354
Oh, my God.

299
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,431
Either take the pill
or I'm gonna knock you out.

300
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:46,239
All right. Nighty-night.

301
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,537
How sweet.

302
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:04,465
You're willing to risk your life
to finish our little story.

303
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:09,528
- This is ridiculous!
- Why do you say that, Kitty?

304
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:12,264
This is about two overbearing
parents who just can't let go.

305
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,833
She wants to kill herself.

306
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,102
I fell off that mountain. I didn't jump.

307
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:17,770
You said you'd be happy to die

308
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:19,305
as long as you were climbing.

309
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,869
Mom, what I meant is, people
take risks all the time,

310
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:24,844
risks that reduce their lifespan,

311
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,556
every time they get into a car
or they smoke a cigarette.

312
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,357
We're all doing the same thing,

313
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,451
just calculating our chances
and hoping we defy the odds.

314
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,663
What about when you took
the sleeping pills?

315
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,702
It was four years ago, after
I'd been dumped on Twitter.

316
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,505
And I'd called my parents
as soon as I had done it.

317
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,307
It was hardly a suicide attempt.

318
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,808
You spent the night in the ER.

319
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,759
They said you nearly died.

320
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,985
Ugh. I'm such an idiot.

321
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,988
I... I... I thought the window was open.

322
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,857
That's what I get
for keeping them so clean.

323
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,492
Possible nerve, vessel,
and ligament injury,

324
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,926
and she's lost a lot of blood.

325
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,418
Let's get her into an OR now.

326
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,133
Mom! No!

327
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,334
I'll stay with him.

328
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,703
It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Ask Deezer.

329
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,538
Mom, where are you going?

330
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,562
No!

331
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,008
No!

332
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,933
2 milligrams lorazepam.

333
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,090
And some ice.

334
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:33,128
Kitty believe the surgery
her parents want

335
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,406
- will make her an invalid.
- That's not true.

336
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,542
She won't be able to be a top athlete,

337
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,677
but the impairment will be minor.

338
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,748
She'll be able to enjoy
an active and safe lifestyle.

339
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,117
That minor impairment could be as much

340
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:48,653
as a 50% restriction of head rotation

341
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:50,922
and a reduction in flexion extension.

342
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:52,290
That's worst-case scenario.

343
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,259
It's a permanent disability.

344
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:56,694
All kids make bad choices.

345
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,529
Kitty's may be worse than most,

346
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:01,633
but are we really gonna
hobble an adult woman?

347
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:03,268
Adult? She's 18.

348
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,003
It's the definition.

349
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,072
And two months ago, she was
17 and a helpless child?

350
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,508
I mean, she's obviously just as immature

351
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:11,743
and unreasonable as ever.

352
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,260
This is about your mother, isn't it?

353
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:16,414
If you could've controlled
her, you would've prevented

354
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,072
a lot of pain to herself and others.

355
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:23,544
Thank you. I think I have
enough to make my decision.

356
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,363
I'm sorry

357
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,289
that I hit you.

358
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,954
When you get scared,

359
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:43,331
do you think about
something that helps you?

360
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:47,802
Deezer.

361
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,450
Do you?

362
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,841
Think about something?

363
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,581
School change their dress code?

364
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:02,950
I'm not going to school.

365
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:09,567
Mr. Decker's still substituting.

366
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,362
I know Ken.

367
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:17,283
Dated him in high school.

368
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,112
He's a real horse's ass.

369
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:27,308
Tough titmouse. Get dressed.

370
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:34,993
Tough titmouse.

371
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:44,143
I see a vibrant, engaged young woman.

372
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,732
But I also see a reckless
disregard for your life.

373
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,646
And it's not clear to me
if that's a pathological state

374
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,907
or simply a product of youth.

375
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,786
Either way,

376
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,256
I have to err on the side of
the preservation of that life.

377
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,357
No.

378
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:07,992
I'm sorry, Kitty.

379
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:10,716
No.

380
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:12,230
Oh, my God.

381
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:20,161
Nothing I ever did was enough.

382
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,840
When I was home, you were out

383
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,642
or you were high, or both.

384
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,044
You don't remember that, do you?

385
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,945
You've always found
lots of time for Shaun.

386
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:30,048
Oh, stop. Shaun has special needs.

387
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,649
- He had no one else.
- I had needs.

388
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:34,218
I was lost and confused.
I needed my father!

389
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,287
Now? Now you tell me? Now?

390
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,522
When it... When it mattered,

391
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,257
when it might've made a... A difference,

392
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:41,292
you... You turned me away every time,

393
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,960
screaming, "You don't know me!"

394
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,595
- You don't!
- I know.

395
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,097
I know!

396
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:48,766
I have no idea who you are!

397
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,968
I have no idea what you wanted,

398
00:21:50,992 --> 00:21:52,336
what you wanted from me!

399
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,639
- I wanted you to be there!
- I was there!

400
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,008
Not enough, obviously. Otherwise...

401
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:58,432
Otherwise?

402
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:00,847
Otherwise...

403
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:02,847
Otherwise...

404
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,536
You were such a happy little girl.

405
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:12,123
We were best friends.

406
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,481
I... I don't get it.

407
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,450
What happened?

408
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,763
What made you so unhappy?

409
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:19,820
You did.

410
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,367
My only sin was growing up.

411
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:25,703
When I couldn't be your little
pinafore princess anymore,

412
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,171
you wanted nothing to do with me.

413
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:28,462
That's not true.

414
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,143
I loved you, and I still love you.

415
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,758
I hate you.

416
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:42,643
And I died hating you.

417
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,988
Think I'm gonna let you off that easy?

418
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,854
The night.

419
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,179
Let's talk about that.

420
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:30,309
Tequila... Stat.

421
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:37,441
I went big.

422
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:43,814
♪ Baby, when I met you
There was peace unknown

423
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:46,817
♪ I set out to get you
with a fine-tooth... ♪

424
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:51,331
Karaoke?

425
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:57,762
Hershey meant everything to me, Shaun.

426
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:01,340
I took the biggest chance
of my life going back there.

427
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,844
And then it just...

428
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,305
Then it just went away.

429
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:12,977
But I knew I could come back here

430
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:15,046
to get the support of my friend,

431
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,016
who was so different
because he was so open

432
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,819
and nice and honest.

433
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,949
But you gave me nothing.

434
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:32,830
You... You never even asked me once,

435
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:35,040
"What happened in Hershey?"

436
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,638
You just...

437
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,363
You just didn't care.

438
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:03,917
It went very well.

439
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,051
You should get most of the sensation
back in your hand,

440
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:08,520
but we do need to monitor your
motor strength and perfusion.

441
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:10,255
Okay.

442
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,119
We know Mac caused your injury.

443
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:15,038
No, I told you...
I... I cut it on a window.

444
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:18,333
No, Mac has never hurt anyone.

445
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,669
What were you doing to him?

446
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:26,508
Trying to help him.

447
00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:29,507
You need to find a place for Mac.

448
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:30,846
That is not our call.

449
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,045
You're overwhelmed, Nicole.

450
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:37,371
There's no shame in admitting
you need help to get Mac help.

451
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:40,908
He'll hate me.

452
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:57,258
You got to move out.

453
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,872
Soon as they find
someone who'll take you.

454
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,600
Okay, stop.

455
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:08,926
Not everything is about you.

456
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,317
Doctors say I'm dying,

457
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:14,139
and there's nothing they can do about it.

458
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,251
Tough titmouse.

459
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:33,227
He won't hate you.

460
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:38,288
He'll just be very scared.

461
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:41,846
You have been given an enormous challenge

462
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,627
that a lot of people couldn't handle.

463
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:47,839
I know you'll find
the strength to keep going.

464
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:51,256
I will.

465
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,891
Thank you.

466
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:10,830
Five years from now...

467
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:12,388
I want you to tell my parents something.

468
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:17,619
Tell them I never want to see them again.

469
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:23,588
Dr. Melendez, I know a kid
who had a lot of issues,

470
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:26,157
got into a lot of trouble,
fights, mainly with his dad.

471
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:29,160
And when I met his dad, I understood.

472
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:30,962
He was a real piece of work.

473
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:33,331
So, I stepped up,
found the kid a place to live,

474
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:35,667
got him a pretty decent job.

475
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:38,937
But he was already too... broken.

476
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,972
He needed a lot more than a friendly cop.

477
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:43,374
He needed a doctor.

478
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:45,647
The next guy he got
in a fight with had a gun.

479
00:27:46,635 --> 00:27:48,780
Nicole trusts you.

480
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:51,115
And that's why you have to
give her permission to let go.

481
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:12,270
How are we supposed to give advice

482
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:15,010
without dragging our baggage into it?

483
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:23,081
Maybe our baggage informs our advice,

484
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:25,083
gives us perspective,

485
00:28:25,107 --> 00:28:26,605
maybe even wisdom.

486
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,319
Maybe you're confusing baggage
with experience.

487
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:34,815
What's the difference?

488
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,497
If I knew, I wouldn't be up here.

489
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:43,913
Mom was out of town.

490
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:45,303
I can't take any more of this.

491
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:47,105
You caught me high
for the umpteenth time.

492
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:48,606
Maddie, why are you doing this?

493
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,309
The night I'd broke another promise,

494
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:55,613
and you decided to quit the bargaining
and the threats and take action.

495
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:02,391
So you dragged me outside
and locked the door.

496
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:09,856
I prayed you would come and find me.

497
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,944
Why didn't you come and find me?

498
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,302
I thought that

499
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:19,093
you would go to Jessica's.

500
00:29:20,162 --> 00:29:21,873
I thought you'd go to Aunt Becky's.

501
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:24,464
- If I had any idea...
- Oh, if you thought I'd die that night,

502
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:26,373
you would've let me back in?
Good to know.

503
00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:29,245
How could you do that?

504
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:32,402
Why would anyone do that?

505
00:29:32,426 --> 00:29:34,037
I don't get it!

506
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,675
How dare you do that!

507
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,721
Maddie, look at me!

508
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,082
I died that day, Maddie.

509
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:48,018
I died that day, too.

510
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,920
I don't get it! I don't get it!

511
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:52,289
I don't get it!!

512
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:00,697
Is there a problem?

513
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,099
No.

514
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:06,336
I just wanted to talk to you
before we started the surgery.

515
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,874
Kitty doesn't want you here
when she wakes up.

516
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:12,878
She'll change her mind.

517
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:15,464
With time, she will change her mind.

518
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:21,718
I have somebody in my life
who's self-destructive,

519
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:24,421
and there have been times

520
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:28,792
when I could've forced her
into treatment, and...

521
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:31,605
I'm sure it would've helped...

522
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,253
For a while.

523
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:35,692
But...

524
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:40,030
I think I have been pushing you because

525
00:30:41,762 --> 00:30:45,827
I sometimes think
I made the wrong choice.

526
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,457
But she would've hated me.

527
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:53,440
And I would've lost her.

528
00:30:55,142 --> 00:30:56,687
You're trying to save your daughter,

529
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:58,578
but I think you're gonna lose her.

530
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,290
Forever.

531
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:08,975
If we do this, she will grow and learn.

532
00:31:10,524 --> 00:31:13,526
And when she walks down the
aisle with her loving husband,

533
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:20,320
and when she holds her baby in
her arms for the first time,

534
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:24,056
we may not be there,

535
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:28,828
but those are the gifts we're giving her.

536
00:31:29,677 --> 00:31:31,288
And it's enough.

537
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:38,051
It will have to be enough.

538
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:52,909
Maddie, please.

539
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,167
Maddie... Maddie, look... Look at me.

540
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:56,236
Maddie, don't...

541
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:00,193
- Maddie!
- 2 milligrams haldol.

542
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:03,186
No... No, don't...
No, I... I can't let...

543
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,699
I... I can't have her leave me like this.

544
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:09,593
Maddie.

545
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:11,695
Please don't leave me like this, Maddie.

546
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:14,264
I should've held on to you. I sh...

547
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:16,400
I sh... I should've...

548
00:32:16,424 --> 00:32:17,734
I should've held on to you

549
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:20,437
until... Un... Until you talked to me.

550
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:21,605
I should've held on.

551
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,062
I...

552
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,078
Your mother

553
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:30,236
wanted to send you to rehab.

554
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:32,416
And I said no.

555
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,119
I... I said "No. I can fix it!

556
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:39,190
"She's my little girl!
She'll listen to me!"

557
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:43,122
I wanted to be the hero.

558
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:46,263
I wanted to earn you back.

559
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:48,665
I wanted you to love me again,

560
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:51,036
like you did once upon a time.

561
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:54,271
It was stupid.

562
00:32:56,697 --> 00:33:00,128
And I... I don't know what to say,

563
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,741
except I'm sorry.

564
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,619
I... I'm sorry.

565
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:14,032
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...

566
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:27,112
I know you loved me, Daddy.

567
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:34,913
I loved you, too.

568
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:12,659
If you send Mac away,

569
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,496
there will be people
who think you let him down,

570
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:20,241
question your love for him.

571
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,670
They'll say you gave up
on him as a parent

572
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,971
and took the easy way out.

573
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:30,809
They may even hate you for it.

574
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,747
But those people,

575
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,984
they don't understand.

576
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,521
I didn't.

577
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,905
Giving him up will be the hardest thing

578
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,656
that you will ever have to do.

579
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:57,713
But maybe you need to do it

580
00:34:57,737 --> 00:34:59,037
because of your love for him.

581
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,471
The surgery went well.

582
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,239
As long as you stick to the program,

583
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:26,942
you'll be walking within
eight to twelve weeks.

584
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:28,099
Or less.

585
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,047
Great.

586
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:37,953
You know, your parents did this

587
00:35:37,977 --> 00:35:41,623
because they love you, Kitty, so much.

588
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:45,570
I know.

589
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,543
Mom, I'm sorry!

590
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:05,870
No, Mom!

591
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,088
No! Shut up! Stop it!

592
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:34,866
You gather up all your crap?

593
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,413
Yes. I checked three times.

594
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:40,640
Good, 'cause anything
you leave, I'm chucking.

595
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:50,316
I'm scared.

596
00:36:53,552 --> 00:36:55,253
Tough titmouse.

597
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:39,564
I'm not a hallucination.

598
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,079
You've been asleep for 13 hours.

599
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,604
Hmm.

600
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:51,252
Was seeing Maddie therapeutic?

601
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:59,150
She said she loved me.

602
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:02,096
Hmm.

603
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:03,922
That's very good.

604
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,020
Or maybe it was just
me telling myself that.

605
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,299
You always tell the truth.

606
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:20,015
Thank you, Shaun.

607
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:40,692
Hey, kid.

608
00:38:41,627 --> 00:38:43,472
Neil!

609
00:38:43,496 --> 00:38:44,896
<i>Mi amorcita.</i>

610
00:38:45,831 --> 00:38:48,276
Hey.

611
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,645
I almost did my puzzle.

612
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:52,781
I can see that.

613
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:54,349
That's a great job, Gabi.

614
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,235
Mom and Dad gave it to me
for my birthday.

615
00:38:57,843 --> 00:39:00,222
Yeah. I... I remember.

616
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:04,701
Are Mom and Dad coming for me today?

617
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:10,031
Oh, mama.

618
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,666
No.

619
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:13,758
No, no, they can't.

620
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,463
Gabi, we love you,

621
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,927
but you have way more fun here
than at their place.

622
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,806
I think I see a piece of the cow.

623
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,466
Thank you for letting me crash.

624
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:05,554
Yes.

625
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:07,055
You

626
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,348
rented an apartment?

627
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:11,526
No.

628
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,562
I'm gonna get an Airbnb.

629
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:21,626
All right.

630
00:40:23,262 --> 00:40:25,990
What happened in Hershey?

631
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,769
Do you care?

632
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:41,690
I tried to... be nice,

633
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:44,626
and I tried to go big,

634
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,497
and I don't want to walk away,

635
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:52,141
and everyone likes doughnuts.

636
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:56,604
And I don't know how to answer that.

637
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:58,896
Just be honest.

638
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:10,243
I...

639
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:15,373
...don't care what happened in Hershey.

640
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,169
But I care that you care.

641
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:35,643
You want to try that song again?

642
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:40,615
Oh, yes!

643
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,840
Then, okay.

644
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:47,679
Okay.
