Unfortunately, the ingrown hair

caused an abscess

it could be a cutaneous pili migrans

61

or have a deep sinus tract

62
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,484

They're very distracting.

71
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,038
You have a dizygotic,

73

and Olivia talks too little.

And Olivia does not know
where the jugular vein is.

Her grades and USMLE
scores were nearly perfect.

So,
if it's not a lack of knowledge,

what do you think it is?

I think Olivia has the potential
to be an exemplary doctor

give her a little extra attention.

Isn't that unfair to Jordan?

Was it unfair to the applicant
who didn't get your position

that you needed some extra attention?

radiofrequency ablation.

325
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,262
Short recovery time, but a
significant chance his cancer returns.

326
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,345
Care to rebut?

327
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,785
I think we should consider
a hepatic lobectomy

328
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,320
and lymph node dissection.

329
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,122
Remove the affected
area of the liver,

330
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,658
all the surrounding tissue,
and every swollen node we find.

331
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,660
And that's the
aggressive approach.

332
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,962
Longer recovery time,
high risk of complications,

333
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,198
and, uh,

334
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,942
admittedly,
the best shot at beating the cancer.

335
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,669
By "complications,"
you mean a barely functioning liver,

336
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,004
a persistent threat of fatal bleeds,
and chronic pain.

337
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,606
As surgeons, you can gut him,

338
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,751
but as his primary doctor,
I have to find the balance

339
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,510
between longevity
and quality of life.

340
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,255
CLAIRE: Last week,
you were trying to perform surgery

341
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,314
from the gallery,
and now you hate surgeons.

342
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,549
Pick a side.

343
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,086
ASHER: A piecemeal approach
is not going to work with Billy.

344
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,054
Every time we try
to solve a problem,

345
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,522
we discover another one.

346
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,691
You may have left
your religion in Brooklyn,

347
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,744
but you keep looking for
meaning in random events.

348
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,361
The dice have no memory.

349
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,805
ASHER: I'm not looking for
meaning. I'm looking for patterns.

350
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,598
Maybe he's got some
underlying condition.

351
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,234
I agree with Asher.

352
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,336
The dice have no memory,
but they can be loaded.

353
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,040
So... safe and
seriously compromised

354
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,709
or aggressive and possibly dead?

355
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:27,413
Your case, Dr. Browne.

356
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,482
Your call.

357
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,493
How you feeling?

358
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,464
You sacrificed a lot.

359
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,399
Your hands, your career.

360
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,268
And you're taking it
out on me and Claire

361
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,721
and the whole
surgical profession.

362
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,371
I get it. It hurts.

363
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,607
You're pathetic.

364
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,685
You're worried about me
because I'll never be a surgeon?

365
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,777
Boo-hoo.

366
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,488
You're worried about me
because I took pleasure

367
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:00,980
in screwing with you and Claire?

368
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,114
That's who I am.

369
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,584
The question is, who are you?

370
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,477
You don't show up late
with lame-ass excuses,

371
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,279
and when you get dissed,
you diss back, so...

372
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,722
How are you feeling?

373
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,325
Forget I asked.

374
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,300
He's lost most of
his amniotic fluid.

375
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,968
Won't last very long in utero.

376
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,205
In helping the weak,
we hurt the strong.

377
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,706
C-section?

378
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,576
If we do a C-section
to save the strong baby,

379
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,844
there's a 90% chance
the weak baby will die.

380
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,182
But if we do an amnioinfusion
to save the weak baby,

381
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,418
there's an 85% chance
that strong baby will die.

382
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,552
It's the better option.

383
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,458
5% to decide which baby lives?

384
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,527
Kenzie's body has
already made that choice.

385
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,762
If there's a strong
baby and a weak baby,

386
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,240
it's pretty clear
which one we save.

387
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,265
Survival of the fittest.

388
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,436
Sorry. It's just...

389
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,548
That's not really what we're about,
is it,

390
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,541
as a civilization?

391
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,943
Aren't the strong morally
obligated to help the weak?

392
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,846
And if they don't,
isn't everybody ultimately worse off?

393
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,618
Neither baby has to die.

394
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,955
Delayed interval delivery.

395
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,625
We induce labor,
deliver the strong twin,

396
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,027
then stop the labor to
keep the weak twin in utero

397
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,795
until his lungs mature.

398
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,832
The chances of stopping
labor are very slim.

399
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,602
That's true. There's about a 70%
chance that both babies would die.

400
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,304
Which makes it the
worst possible choice.

401
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:32,972
We need to ask Kenzie.

402
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,074
No, we don't.

403
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,511
Once she hears there's the
slightest chance of saving both babies,

404
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,480
she won't listen
to any alternatives.

405
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,882
Statistically,
it's a terrible option.

406
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,185
But it is an option.

407
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:01,200
No. No,
you can't seriously be asking me this.

408
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,271
I know that this is something no
mother should ever have to decide.

409
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,006
There are no good options here,

410
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,309
but there is one that'll most
likely make you the mother

411
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,311
of a healthy baby boy.

412
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,751
Okay.

413
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,198
Prep for an amnioinfusion...

414
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,291
Have you named them?

00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,158
Dr. Allen.

Landon.

418
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,911
(CRYING) No. No,
I can't do this.

419
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,249
You have to save both of them.

that we diagnosed Billy

with metastatic
melanoma on Tuesday

424
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,875
and send him home on a Thursday.

425
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:09,068
Well, let's wait till Friday
to congratulate ourselves.

I believe she made
the right choice.

432
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,319
She made a choice
any mother would make

433
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,803
because the alternative
is unthinkable.

434

Isn't that exactly what
made it the right choice?

435
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,474
She has to live with it.

one of the reasons
I'm in this relationship

472

You are different.

not living together.

I am moving in with you.
