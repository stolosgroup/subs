1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,800
We should not live together.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,535
That makes no sense.

3
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,370
I rented that apartment,

4
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:17,373
and neither of us
can afford it on our own.

5
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,375
It has a fireplace.

6
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:21,744
We shouldn't live together.

7
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:25,347
It has a fireplace.

8
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:31,587
Do you ever think about us

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,434
being together...

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,393
as a couple?

11
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:39,161
Sometimes.

12
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,863
I don't want that.

13
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:46,869
You don't want us to be a couple?

14
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:49,672
Or you don't want me thinking
about us as a couple?

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,375
Neither.

16
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:55,478
If we get an apartment together,

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,580
I feel like that's a signal

18
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:01,350
that you and I might end up
as boyfriend and girlfriend,

19
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,686
and that's not going to happen.

20
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,288
You can't predict the future.

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,057
Feelings change.

22
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:10,459
I used to hate hugs, but now...

23
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:11,627
sometimes I don't.

24
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,596
But I don't want my feelings to change.

25
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,331
I like being your friend,

26
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,334
and romantic relationships
a-are unpredictable.

27
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,237
So much can go wrong,
especially when I am involved.

28
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,039
And if we live together,
it's gonna be awkward.

29
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,941
You're bound to walk in on me
when I'm naked

30
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:27,810
or hear the weird sex sounds I make

31
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:29,512
with some out-of-work drummer

32
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:31,113
or find me crying
when that drummer dumps me,

33
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:33,182
even though I was totally gonna dump him.

34
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:42,391
I was so unhappy

35
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,379
when we weren't getting along.

36
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:47,163
You were, too, right?

37
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,267
Yes.

38
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,235
Anything that puts our friendship at risk

39
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:55,224
isn't worth it to me.

40
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:56,972
Okay, Shaun?

41
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:02,077
Yes.

43
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,722
Our gallbladder removal's off.

44
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,057
Patient took an Ambien last night,

45
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,559
woke up eating a roast chicken.

46
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,726
Let's check the consult list

47
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,428
for something a little more interesting.

48
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,164
- See? Gallbladders are boring.
- You're a resident.

49
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,200
You don't get to call any surgery boring.

50
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:25,701
See?

51
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:30,539
This is interesting.

52
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:38,981
Fizzy urine.

53
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:44,286
42-year-old female, syncopal episode

54
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,854
with persistent loss of consciousness.

55
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,690
On the ride, she went
into PVT, rate of 180.

56
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,925
We shocked her back
to normal sinus rhythm.

57
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,293
I'm starting to feel...

58
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:53,996
She's going back into PVT.

59
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:55,273
We need to shock her. Get her into a bay.

60
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:56,334
- No. No.

61
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,204
That was cool, but you may have
just cracked her sternum.

62
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,173
- Get her into bay 2.
- What happened?

63
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:07,109
- You're her husband?
- Yes.

64
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:09,211
Your wife is pretty frail.

65
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,946
Any idea what could have caused that?

66
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:12,426
She did.

67
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:14,783
She's anorexic.

I'm Dr. Murphy. This is Dr. Park.

71
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,133
We're here about your urine.

72
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:32,968
How long has it been fizzy?

73
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,237
I hadn't even noticed. Is that a problem?

74
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,173
Ah, it can be a symptom
of several conditions,

75
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,309
many of them minor.

76
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,244
You're here for ortho,
a scope on your right knee?

77
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:44,947
It's been sore.
I've been training for a race.

78
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,150
Joint pain plus fizzy urine.

79
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:50,919
You could have emphysematous cystitis,

80
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:52,855
bladder cancer, kidney problems,

81
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,190
Those sound serious.
Should I call my husband?

82
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:58,227
Emphysematous cystitis is
a treatable bladder infection.

83
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,163
Your symptoms could also
be from a kidney stone

84
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:02,531
or dehydration.

85
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,767
Could my issues be caused by...

86
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,635
gastric bypass surgery?

87
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,237
It depends. When was it?

88
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,905
15 years ago.

89
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:12,241
I used to be 377 pounds.

90
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,442
That's a lot.

91
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,478
Your surgery wouldn't cause
those symptoms,

92
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,282
but we need to do a cystoscopy
to find out what did.

93
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:22,751
I'll cancel the ortho
and get Lim to sign off.

94
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:25,454
Hey, wait. What,

95
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,423
So, what is a cystoscopy?

96
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:30,826
It's like a knee scope,

97
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:33,423
except the camera goes up your penis.

98
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,667
You administered amiodarone?

99
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,222
Rhythm's normal.

100
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:42,938
That's good, right?

101
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,810
It's better than when you came in.

102
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:46,942
Your heart is failing

103
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:50,312
as a result of a condition
called mitral regurgitation.

104
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,548
One of your valves
isn't closing all the way.

105
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,150
Blood keeps leaking back
into your atrium.

106
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:56,352
That's why you fainted

107
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:58,120
and why we need
to repair that valve ASAP.

108
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,891
How long have you been anorexic?

109
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,397
I've had issues with food

110
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,099
on and off since I was 14.

111
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,267
Mitral valve issues
are a frequent complication

112
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,802
of long-term malnutrition.

113
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:16,049
This bout started about a year ago...

114
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,141
skipping meals, lying about eating,

115
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:20,809
exercising excessively.

116
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,311
I don't know what else I can do.

117
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,313
I-I can't monitor her 24 hours a day.

118
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:25,681
I'm not asking you to.

119
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:27,282
No, but you are starving yourself.

120
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,784
Mom.

121
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,753
Graham-y, come here.

122
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,441
What's he doing here?

123
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:35,691
When I got home,
I heard about the ambulance.

124
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,860
I made Cindy bring me here.

125
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,785
What's wrong with my mom?

126
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,234
She needs a surgery to repair
a valve in her heart.

127
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:49,371
This heart thing, is,
is that why she's so skinny?

128
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,441
Look, what matters, Graham,

129
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:55,505
is that these doctors
are gonna help your mom.

130
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:57,746
Okay?

131
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,489
You haven't moved your bowels.

132
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,191
Well, thank you, Shaun,
for that announcement.

133
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,993
Saves me the trouble of tweeting.

134
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,962
The nurses already knew. They told me.

135
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:15,764
They also said

136
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,367
you're no longer talking
to your dead daughter.

137
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:21,603
Constipated, but no longer
psychotic. A narrow win.

138
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:23,872
Your first defecation event

139
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:26,975
is a vital part
of the discharge criteria.

140
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:29,711
Event? What is this,
the post-op decathlon,

141
00:06:29,713 --> 00:06:31,780
- pooping, peeing, walking, talking?
- Yes.

142
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,216
You have to walk a full lap of the floor.

143
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:37,186
But you canceled physical
therapy this morning.

144
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,587
Those nurses have big mouths.

145
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,657
I canceled because
my leg is a little sore.

146
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,859
That could be phlebitis

147
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,993
or a DVT or a,

148
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:47,329
Could also be
an unsurprising complication

149
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,498
from a surgeon poking around in my pons.

150
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,333
Every day in the hospital

151
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:55,904
increases your risk
of infection by 1.37%.

152
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:58,777
You need to move your bowels,
and we should walk right now.

153
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:02,544
I'll go very slow.

154
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,779
Shaun, is there any chance

155
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:06,451
that you are needed elsewhere right now?

156
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:10,052
I-I have 8 minutes

157
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,488
until my patient's cystoscopy.

158
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,292
Good. Be early.

159
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,259
Urethra looks clean.

160
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,394
No lesions, no stones so far.

161
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,231
How do we check for obstructions
or stones further up?

162
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,800
Contrast cystogram.

163
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,535
Since you found this patient,

164
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:28,003
how about you do the honors?

165
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:32,841
You know this guy
used to weigh 370 pounds?

166
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:36,111
Thread the catheter
further into the bladder.

167
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,113
That's a big drop. Good for him.

168
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,449
He did have gastric bypass.

169
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:42,217
That makes it less impressive?

170
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,219
- Now infuse the contrast.
- Well, yeah,

171
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:47,189
it is the easy way, compared
to just diet and exercise.

172
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,925
The contrast dye is dissipating.

173
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,393
It's supposed to.

174
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:53,662
You said he's training for a race.

175
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,297
Obviously, he turned his life around.

176
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:56,765
Still dissipating.

177
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,467
Bypass made it physically impossible

178
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:59,735
for him to eat as much as he wanted.

179
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:02,590
It's gone. The contrast is gone.

180
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:07,009
- That makes no sense.
- Where did it go?

181
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,946
He probably has a fistula,

182
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,383
a tunnel connecting
his bladder to his intestine.

183
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,285
Air and bacteria moving
the other direction

184
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,886
caused bubbles in his urine.

185
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,925
Her liver and thyroid are normal,

186
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,561
but her electrolytes are off.

187
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,262
Her albumin is at 2.1.

188
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,630
She's severely malnourished.

189
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:31,619
She'll be totally vulnerable
to post-op infections.

190
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:33,802
She needs this surgery to survive,

191
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,971
but she may be too sick
to survive the surgery.

192
00:08:43,204 --> 00:08:44,626
In order to operate safely,

193
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,337
we need to boost your caloric intake,

194
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:47,594
optimize protein.

195
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,129
Can't you do that through my IV?

196
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,298
It's more efficient to pump
a nutritional supplement

197
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,599
directly into your stomach.

198
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,568
We use a tube
running down from your nose.

199
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,536
I had an NG tube once.

200
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,439
It didn't work.

201
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,691
She couldn't tolerate it.

202
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:05,245
Because it's not really about food.

203
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:06,613
It's about control.

204
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,950
You've lived for decades

205
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,152
with a condition
that has killed more people

206
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:14,988
than any other psychiatric illness.

207
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,391
You didn't just survive. You had a child.

208
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:20,861
Can you tell us how?

209
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:28,702
When I got pregnant, it was
like this terrifying miracle.

210
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:32,773
And the thought of
gaining all that weight, but...

211
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:36,476
I wanted him so much.

212
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:37,844
We both did.

213
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:41,882
Every meal, I would sit
with pictures of his ultrasound,

214
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:44,818
I-imagining the food
going directly to him.

215
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,657
Can you do that again?

216
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,626
Eat for Graham?

217
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,172
We've determined the fistula

218
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:06,406
between your bladder and intestine

219
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:08,241
was caused by Crohn's disease,

220
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:10,444
an inflammatory intestinal condition.

221
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:12,746
Once we reverse your gastric bypass,

222
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:15,482
- you'll need,
- Wait. R-Reverse my bypass?

223
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:16,616
Are you sure?

224
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:18,985
Bypass surgery shortens
the digestive tract.

225
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:20,587
People with Crohn's disease need

226
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:21,888
every inch of intestine they have,

227
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,457
or they risk critical,

228
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,092
even fatal malnutrition.

229
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,294
Okay, but I don't want
my husband to know,

230
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:29,162
and he'll be here soon.

231
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:31,164
Well, we would never reveal anything

232
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,599
without your permission,

233
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:35,669
but Crohn's disease is going to require

234
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,571
some major adjustments.

235
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:40,040
Well, I'll tell Spence about the Crohn's,

236
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:43,126
and I'll tell him I'm having surgery...

237
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:45,212
on my bladder.

238
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,549
Your husband doesn't know
you had gastric bypass?

239
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:51,785
That would require him knowing
I was obese to begin with.

240
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:52,819
That's not gonna happen.

241
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:55,422
Your husband must be very shallow.

242
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,892
Even if I don't disclose

243
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:01,795
that I reversed your bypass,
your scars might.

244
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,663
It requires a separate incision.

245
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,313
Well, tell him there was a complication.

246
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:08,635
Our obligation to protect your
privacy doesn't include lying.

247
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:09,970
And you shouldn't have to go
through this without him.

248
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:14,174
The single abdominal umbilical port.

249
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:18,712
We can repair Wade's fistula

250
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:20,781
and reverse his bypass

251
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:23,083
all through a single incision.

252
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:26,353
We can help deceive your husband.

253
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,054
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
- That's okay, Spence.

254
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:30,157
- Got here... as soon as I could.
- It's all right.

255
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:35,629
And since my husband is
surrounded by surgeons,

256
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,130
what's the issue,
what are you gonna do about it,

257
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:39,499
and how often have you
done it successfully?

258
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,442
How are you doing?

259
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,578
I'm fine.

260
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,185
Graham, would you mind filling this?

261
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,857
You've had one spoonful of tuna,

262
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:06,193
2 ounces of apple sauce.

263
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,627
That's it?

264
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,297
Mom, if that's all I had, you'd
never let me up from the table.

265
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,232
This is different. I...

266
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:13,500
can't eat too quickly.

267
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:14,701
I don't believe you.

268
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,879
It's true.

269
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:19,239
Your mother is suffering
from severe malnutrition,

270
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,174
and she's trying her best,
- I knew it.

271
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:23,343
You're too skinny.
That's why you're here.

272
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:24,678
That's probably why
your heart's messed up,

273
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,880
- and you still won't eat.
- Graham, I am trying.

274
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:29,149
- How hard can it be to eat?
- I'm not feeling well.

275
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,750
Me and Dad are really worried about you.

276
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,944
- Don't you care?
- Of course I do, Graham.

277
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,530
- So much.
- Then do something.

278
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,991
Prove it.

279
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,435
You provoked that argument?

280
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:51,204
Yep, and I may have just
saved our patient.

281
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:53,673
She requested an NG tube.

282
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:56,309
Understanding is nice.
Calories are better.

283
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:01,514
He's screwing this up.
His husband's scared,

284
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:03,049
and he just wants to know
what's going on.

285
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:06,019
Nothing like marital advice
from the divorced.

286
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:08,355
- You're divorced, too.
- And I'm not advising.

287
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:10,423
I'm not judging the health of a marriage

288
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:13,360
based on a single secret,
which is neither shocking

289
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:15,028
nor a sign of its imminent demise.

290
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,863
What, truth in a marriage is overrated?

291
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:19,332
Well, it was in mine.
Not every single insight,

292
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,601
opinion, or impulse needs to be shared.

293
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,203
Marriage sounds confusing.

294
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,971
No wonder you both failed at it.

295
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,878
How's it going in here?

296
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,847
Not as bad as I remember.

297
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,384
Does it hurt, Mom?

298
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:40,345
No, just a little awkward.

299
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,722
Makes it hard to talk.

300
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,491
But I'm okay.

301
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,562
I am so proud of you.

302
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:03,042
Dr. Glassman hasn't defecated

303
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:04,810
or done his physical therapy.

304
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,313
I am aware and yet unalarmed.

305
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:10,249
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

306
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:12,168
Oh, right!

307
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,188
Your Dr. Glassman's... friend.

308
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,091
Please order him to do physical therapy

309
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,994
and give him 15 milligrams of ex-lax.

310
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:24,063
The ex-lax is a decent idea.

311
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:27,666
As for the physical therapy,
of course, he's stalling.

312
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,569
Glassman's a proud man.
He ran this hospital.

313
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,304
He's reluctant to feel
weak and vulnerable

314
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,340
in front of people
who used to work for him.

315
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:36,508
That doesn't make sense.

316
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,644
He is weak. He just had brain surgery.

317
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,746
Well, sensical or not, that's my take.

318
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,114
He'll walk eventually.

319
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,883
Every day in the hospital

320
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,820
increases his risk of infection by 1.37,

321
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,722
Well, you tell him that,

322
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,056
and maybe he'll hop right out of bed.

323
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,958
I did. It didn't work.

324
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,227
He didn't respond to the stick.

325
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,429
Try the carrot. Although,
really, I would just advise,

326
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,734
Dr. Glassman doesn't like carrots.

327
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,170
What should I do with the stick?

328
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,407
It's a metaphor.

329
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,510
Uh, Glassman, appropriately,
is the donkey.

330
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,079
The stick signifies punishment.

331
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,122
The carrot signifies...

332
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,984
reward, but he is,
he's recovering nicely,

333
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,387
and your best bet is
to just be patient with him.

334
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,357
So, I should use a reward

335
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:29,294
to motivate Dr. Glassman
to do physical therapy.

336
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,330
Actually... what I'm saying

337
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:34,666
is that you should be
patient and supportive...

338
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,437
...and please, please answer that.

339
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,212
Close the door.

340
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,287
We were headed to pre-op when
he started projectile vomiting.

341
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,723
It's... green.

342
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,926
That could mean bile and
a partial bowel obstruction.

343
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:03,262
- We need an NG tube.
- An obstruction?

344
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,448
Did the Crohn's cause that?

345
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,367
It's hard to know for sure.
NG tube, stat.

346
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,419
You're doing great.

347
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,047
You should try and get some sleep.

348
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,466
I can't.

349
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:27,252
There's this voice in my head,

350
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,763
and it won't be quiet.

351
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:31,190
It keeps telling me that

352
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:36,562
this bag has 60 grams of protein,

353
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,597
40 grams of fat,

354
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,100
1,200 calories in total.

355
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:43,502
It just won't stop.

356
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:48,774
Try... to think of Graham and Sam.

357
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,677
I'm trying.

358
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,814
I'll get something to put over that.

359
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:02,754
Louisa, no!

360
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,657
No!

361
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,226
No!

362
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,796
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,865
I c... I just,

364
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,809
I can't stand it.

365
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,726
I got your deposit back.

366
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,701
Why?

367
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:29,866
Shaun, I told you that you and I
can't live together.

368
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:31,401
No.

369
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:32,802
You told me

370
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:34,737
we can't be boyfriend

371
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:36,239
and girlfriend.

372
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:39,876
We can s-still be friends with benefits.

373
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:43,713
The benefit is...

374
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:46,449
we would be living together.

375
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:47,750
I was clear.

376
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,419
- It's too complicated,
- You were.

377
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:52,655
We can't date or kiss or have sex.

378
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,462
But I thought you wanted to be friends.

379
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:00,963
Yes. Of course.

380
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,565
- And spend time together.
- Right.

381
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,833
Then it's simple.

382
00:18:08,906 --> 00:18:11,140
She begged us to reinsert the NG tube,

383
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,875
then pulled it out again an hour later.

384
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:15,845
Do we try again
with the tube and restraints?

385
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:18,314
Oh, we'd just be raising
her risk of self-injury,

386
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:19,882
pneumonia, a blood clot.

387
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:21,717
What about going back to solid food?

388
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,686
Anything less than 1,200 calories a day,

389
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,122
and her malnutrition
wouldn't be improving.

390
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:28,149
In fact, she'll keep losing weight.

391
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:30,760
We should go ahead with
that valve repair now.

392
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:37,934
I think we can improve her nutrition

393
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:40,536
without force-feeding or IVs.

394
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,007
I found a small study
where deep brain stimulation

395
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,742
was used to treat anorexia.

396
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:49,712
You want to use brain surgery
for a psychiatric disorder?

397
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:51,747
Surgical procedures have been effective

398
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:55,017
for, uh, depression, OCD, addiction.

399
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:00,556
This surgery could reduce
her anxiety around eating.

400
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,525
Once she's eating, her
malnutrition will improve

401
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,427
and reduce the risk of the valve repair.

402
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:06,829
It could also cause personality changes.

403
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,900
And this study covers six subjects

404
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,802
with only 50% success.

405
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:14,704
Well, this could be Louisa's only shot

406
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:15,972
at getting free of this illness.

407
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:18,341
And it was done in the UK.

408
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,943
DBS isn't FDA-approved
for anorexia treatment here.

409
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:23,145
So, we call an IRB ethics hearing

410
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:24,847
and argue emergent-use approval.

411
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:27,049
Which we shouldn't get
off such little data.

412
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:30,433
Nice work digging this up,

413
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,391
but it's not a real option.

414
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:36,259
Let's go talk to her
about the valve surgery.

415
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,574
Can I help you?

416
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:46,143
I'm looking for a carrot.

417
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:48,078
17, 18, 19...

418
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,681
No, uh, sorry, we don't
have any carrot muffins.

419
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:52,683
How about a lemon-poppy, Shaun?

420
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,955
Hello, Debbie Wexler.

421
00:19:57,957 --> 00:20:01,692
It's a metaphor for moving a donkey.

422
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:03,828
I need a carrot because I don't want

423
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,497
to beat Dr. Glassman with a stick.

424
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,866
He likes blueberry muffins.

425
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,301
How's Aaron,

426
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:12,203
Dr. Glassman recovering?

427
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:14,672
He moved his bowels this morning.

428
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:17,408
But he doesn't want to appear weak,

429
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,878
so he hasn't done physical therapy.

430
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,214
I want that blueberry muffin, please.

431
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:26,116
It has 23 visible blueberries.

432
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:29,053
You know, Aaron once told me

433
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,323
that his absolute favorites
were the chocolate chip ones.

434
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,091
Do you want one of those instead?

435
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:37,127
Yes, I want one of those instead.

436
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:48,672
Oh, hi, Dr. Park.

437
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:51,008
Um, I have a few questions
about Wade's surgery.

438
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,843
Sorry, I'm pretty busy.

439
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:54,111
Actually, I need to get going.

440
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:55,379
Uh, I'll walk with you.

441
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,147
I know Wade's surgery is this afternoon,

442
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:59,683
but I've been researching
treatments for Crohn's lesions.

443
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:01,118
What'd we do before the Internet?

444
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,487
I talked to two experts
who felt that Wade should be put

445
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:05,623
on REMICADE or Azathioprine

446
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,491
before any surgical interventions.

447
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:08,759
Interesting recommendations,

448
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,561
but considering they haven't
seen your husband's chart...

449
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,096
Well, this doctor felt strongly
that you should see

450
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:13,497
how he responds to medication before,

451
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,432
Wade's care is completely
appropriate for his condition.

452
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,067
But if his Crohn's lesions
could be treated

453
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,836
without cutting him open,
- That's not what we're treating.

454
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,907
Excuse me?

455
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:26,310
Go talk to your husband.

456
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:36,153
I brought you a chocolate chip muffin.

457
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:38,455
I love chocolate chip.

458
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:39,790
Thank you.

459
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:44,228
Where is it?

460
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,564
At the nurse's station.

461
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:49,066
- You can walk out to get it.
- Shaun, you see,

462
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:51,201
here I thought you were
doing something nice for me.

463
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:52,636
- I am.
- No, you're not.

464
00:21:52,638 --> 00:21:53,871
You're manipulating.

465
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:55,039
My leg hurts,

466
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,174
and I-I have a sore throat,

467
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:59,343
and I don't feel like walking.

468
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:03,080
Dr. Blaize says you
don't want to seem weak

469
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:05,349
in front of people
who used to work for you.

470
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,584
Dr. Blaize is wrong.

471
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:09,053
I don't want to walk
because I don't want to walk.

472
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:11,055
And this is condescending,

473
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:13,157
and it's insulting, and it's annoying.

474
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:18,929
Should I get you your muffin?

475
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:21,765
Well, that would be nice.

476
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,007
An orderly is eating it.

477
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:45,356
Mr. DeLeon, can I help you?

478
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:48,392
Uh...

479
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:52,930
my wife's decided against
the valve-repair surgery,

480
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,198
at least until she's tried

481
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,300
the deep brain stimulation
for her anorexia.

482
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,073
Did Dr. Browne tell you

483
00:23:03,075 --> 00:23:04,942
that it's an experimental brain surgery,

484
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:06,944
which could alter your wife's
personality forever?

485
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:09,146
That's if we get
the special approval required.

486
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:11,382
She's explained all the issues.

487
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,624
I got our apartment back.

488
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:34,161
I had to pay $300 more as a deposit

489
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,563
because someone else wanted it,
but that's okay.

490
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,198
No, Shaun!

491
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,033
It has a fireplace.

492
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,035
Why aren't you listening to me?!

493
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,870
You're not listening to me!

494
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:58,218
I'll be okay running into you naked...

495
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,221
or hearing sex noises

496
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:04,259
or seeing you cry
over breakups with drummers.

497
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,627
I know that you think you can,
but how can you be sure?

498
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:09,996
Because living with you

499
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:11,731
will be good for me.

500
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:15,235
It makes me happy.

501
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,279
You remember what you said, Shaun,

502
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:29,549
that no one can predict the future

503
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,954
and feelings can change?

504
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:36,250
What if I end up hurting you again?

505
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,993
I don't want to risk our friendship

506
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,797
over an apartment.

507
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:43,930
Do you?

508
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,559
If we don't live together,

509
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:57,980
you will have to buy your own batteries.

510
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,315
- We'll still see each other.
- That will be hard.

511
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:05,151
- I work a lot.
- We'll find a way. I know we will.

512
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,829
I need to go to work.

513
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,339
I'll stop on the way home

514
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,675
and tell the manager

515
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,977
we don't want the apartment.

516
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,881
No, I'll do it.

517
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,835
The subjects who responded in this study

518
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:59,906
are all long-term sufferers
with a target BMI of 13-16,

519
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,708
who actively pursued this treatment,

520
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,643
much like our patient.

521
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,847
Additionally, DBS surgery
requires lighter sedation

522
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,582
and places less strain on her system

523
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:12,185
than an open-chest procedure.

524
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,553
You're referring to the valve repair

525
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,155
recommended by Dr. Melendez?

526
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:17,857
Yes.

527
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:20,560
I propose delaying that surgery
by a couple weeks,

528
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:21,895
which would be well worth it

529
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,296
in terms of reduction of risk

530
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:25,332
if the DBS is successful.

531
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,935
Excellent presentation, Dr. Browne.

532
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:30,236
Very thorough.

533
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:32,539
Agreed, though I do have concerns

534
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,907
about approving this procedure

535
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:36,343
based on the small subject pool.

536
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,410
But I'll confer with,

537
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,813
There is, uh, one more person

538
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,983
I want you to hear from, the patient.

539
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:45,652
This is an IRB, not a therapy session.

540
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,790
Actually, patients
who had the opportunity

541
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:54,327
to air their concerns
are eight times less likely

542
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:56,262
to sue their hospital.

543
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:02,302
You paged me?

544
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:04,104
You can step out. Dr. Park's got this.

545
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,141
Grab the sheet.

546
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:15,248
You talked to Wade's husband.

547
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,983
Maybe we should discuss this later.

548
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:19,419
I can patch him up
while tearing you down.

549
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:21,588
You violated
our patient's confidentiality.

550
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,956
I told him what we weren't treating.

551
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,491
That's not a violation.

552
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:25,925
And their marriage is better off

553
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,794
for having his secrets out in the open.

554
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:29,562
That'd be meaningful
if you were a marriage counselor

555
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,032
instead of a surgical resident.

556
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,600
Whatever lie blew up your marriage

557
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:35,802
won't be undone if Wade tells the truth.

558
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:39,906
I was just trying to help our patient.

559
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,708
Our <i>former</i> patient.

560
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,977
Wade's demanding a transfer
to another hospital.

561
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:53,453
I have tried cognitive
behavioral therapy,

562
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:56,366
food psychodynamic therapy,

563
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,995
family therapy,

564
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:03,797
in-patient treatment,
out-patient treatment,

565
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,933
anti-depressants, NG tubes,

566
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,735
TPN.

567
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:13,907
And yet, here I am, dying.

568
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,280
Killing myself.

569
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:25,552
And I can't stop on my own.

570
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,272
Please...

571
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,524
help me... to stop.

572
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,665
Are you aware

573
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:42,702
DBS has been known
to cause personality changes?

574
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:44,337
In your case, the electrode

575
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:45,972
would be at the nucleus accumbens,

576
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,242
Dr. Browne explained all of the risks.

577
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:51,111
It's important
we know that you understand.

578
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:56,483
The nucleus accumbens plays
a role in maternal attachment,

579
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,805
delivering dopamine when moms
interact with their children.

580
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:06,228
Now, what if in trying to
overcome your eating disorder...

581
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,229
you lose the ability
to feel love for your son?

582
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,244
My son is everything to me.

583
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:25,411
For that past year,
he has been watching me

584
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,313
starve myself to death.

585
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:31,918
I'll risk anything

586
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,587
to keep him from seeing me succeed.

587
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:43,897
Thank you, Ms. DeLeon.

588
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,236
We'll need a few minutes to talk.

589
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,974
You kept it a secret because
you think I'm shallow.

590
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:01,149
I said the same thing. I kept it a secret

591
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,573
because of "friendly fatties."

592
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:03,941
Any news on my transfer?

593
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:07,712
San Francisco General
should have a bed tomorrow.

594
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:09,347
Come on. It's a joke.

595
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,881
- A joke?!
- I'm here to clamp

596
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:12,249
your nasogastric tube.

597
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,818
About a couple we've known for years?

598
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,386
We were at their wedding,

599
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:16,565
and yet you treat them

600
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,822
- like a punch line.
- This used to be green.

601
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:19,423
- Now it's brown.
- You're the one who lied.

602
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,791
If I'd known you were offended,

603
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:23,728
The point is, is that's why
I didn't tell you.

604
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:27,999
Red and green makes brown.

605
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:30,234
Your bowel is bleeding.

606
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:33,838
You need surgery now!
Page Dr. Park and Dr. Lim!

607
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,506
He has a strangulated bowel.

608
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:37,041
- Spence.
- It's gonna be okay.

609
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,876
We need to open up an O.R. now!

610
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:43,547
By a margin of 2-to-1,

611
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,783
this Internal Review Board has decided

612
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:48,452
in favor of allowing this procedure.

613
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:50,788
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

614
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,356
Hope the surgery goes well.

615
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:03,134
Use the 45 mm gold stapler.

616
00:31:04,903 --> 00:31:08,873
The truth coming out
didn't help Wade's marriage.

617
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:12,710
Hopefully, with some time.

618
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:14,078
Secrets are corrosive.

619
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,946
Wade should've been honest
from the start.

620
00:31:15,948 --> 00:31:19,083
Maybe Wade thought Spencer would feel

621
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,886
the same way you did about his bypass,

622
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:24,221
that he lost weight the easy way.

623
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:34,432
Okay.

624
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,866
It's time.

625
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:54,185
Graham-y.

626
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:03,780
You are...

627
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,742
the highlight of my life.

628
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:10,034
You know that, right?

629
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,772
Yeah. I love you, too.

630
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:17,875
I love you more than
any person on the planet

631
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:20,711
ever loved any other person
on the planet.

632
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:23,614
I-I know.

633
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:27,585
Mom, you're gonna be okay, right?

634
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:29,186
Of course, baby.

635
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,441
Of course.

636
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:34,492
We'll see you guys in a few hours.

637
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,498
I love you.

638
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,344
The chocolate chip muffin didn't work.

639
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,540
The donkey won't walk.

640
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:58,782
I told you that Glassman's
probably embarrassed.

641
00:32:58,784 --> 00:33:00,251
No. He's not.

642
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:01,852
I asked him,

643
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,798
and he said you were wrong.

644
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:07,291
Doesn't mean I'm actually wrong.

645
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:15,866
He needs help recovering.

646
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,068
I'm trying to help,

647
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,904
but it's not working.

648
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:22,406
He got angry at me.

649
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:26,877
Dr. Glassman is your patient.

650
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,513
You need to fix his lack of mobility.

651
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:31,015
This is your problem.

652
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:33,117
I don't know what to do.

653
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,052
I don't know how to help him.

654
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,954
Being sick is hard.

655
00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:39,757
Being around sick people is hard.

656
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,725
We want to help.

657
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,327
We all struggle with what to do.

658
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,462
Your obsession,
- Okay.

659
00:33:45,464 --> 00:33:48,095
More than a muffin or a bowel movement

660
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:50,201
or a walk around the ward,

661
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:53,390
what Glassman needs
is someone to be there for him.

662
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:56,740
A patient, supportive friend.

663
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:04,181
I know the perfect person.

664
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:17,722
Mm.

665
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,708
Hey, there.

666
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,561
How are you feeling?

667
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,363
I'm okay.

668
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,593
I feel like...

669
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,104
I want something to eat.

670
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,275
I'm hungry.

671
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:42,280
All right, buddy.

672
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:43,981
Let's get you home.

673
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:46,717
Get you a decent night's sleep.

674
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,821
See you in the morning.

675
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,633
I'll get you some food.

676
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,371
Are you sure you're all right?

677
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:10,975
Yeah.

678
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:12,810
I just...

679
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,214
I wonder if that hug
felt different for him.

680
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,885
Did it for you?

681
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,435
Your husband's surgery went well.

682
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:39,036
He's in recovery now.

683
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:40,604
I think he's awake.

684
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,872
Thank you.

685
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,585
Wade told me where to find these.

686
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,589
This is him before bypass?

687
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,991
He said that seeing these

688
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,560
would help me understand
why he never told me.

689
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,563
Which...

690
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:07,732
I said was ridiculous.

691
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,977
Is he gonna end up like this again?

692
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,514
It's possible.

693
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,026
I wish I didn't know that.

694
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,514
Yeah?

695
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,852
Debbie, hi.

696
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,090
Oh, um...

697
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:08,192
Shaun thought you could use a visit.

698
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:10,294
- Huh.
- Oh, and, uh,

699
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:11,662
and another muffin.

700
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:14,165
Thank you. I wish
I'd known you were coming.

701
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:17,201
I would've slipped into something
a little less comfortable.

702
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:18,769
You look... good.

703
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,938
Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well...

704
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,849
Unlikely, but thank you.

705
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:25,342
I am...

706
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,145
sorry that I've been...

707
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,647
out of touch.

708
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:32,183
- Well, I had a brain tumor.
- Mm.

709
00:37:32,185 --> 00:37:35,019
Understandable. We both dropped the ball.

710
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,161
Okay.

711
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,796
- Here we go.
- What's happening?

712
00:37:45,798 --> 00:37:47,898
- We're taking a walk.
- Oh, no, no, thank you.

713
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,200
- Oh, yes, we are. Yeah, mm-hmm.
- No, my leg hurts a, Ow, ow.

714
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:52,436
Which is exactly
why you need to take a walk.

715
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,474
Wow. You're really good at this.

716
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:57,975
You sure you haven't done this before?

717
00:37:57,977 --> 00:37:59,677
Well...

718
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,513
I spent a little time as a nurse.

719
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,550
I always liked the night shift.

720
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:08,719
Everything gets really quiet.

721
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,721
It's almost, It's almost peaceful.

722
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,308
Just came from Louisa's room.

723
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,579
She's eating.

724
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:34,445
That's great news.

725
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:35,746
Yeah.

726
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:37,680
Hopefully we'll be able
to do the valve repair

727
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,016
in a couple weeks.

728
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,719
I hope you're right.

729
00:38:43,122 --> 00:38:44,688
But you won't be a part of the surgery.

730
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,267
Or any of my surgeries.

731
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:51,295
You went around me,
directly to the patient.

732
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:53,063
I had a good idea

733
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:54,598
that you didn't take seriously.

734
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,833
I considered it,

735
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,068
and then I decided against
taking it to the patient.

736
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,770
And yet, I managed
to get Aoki and Andrews

737
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,472
to sign off at the IRB.

738
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,477
You didn't get Andrews.

739
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,049
You voted for me?

740
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:14,318
You made a strong case.

741
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,053
But you're,

742
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:18,022
you're booting me off your service?

743
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:20,191
Disagree with me all you want.

744
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:21,859
I expect my residents to.

745
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,012
I expect them to argue
passionately for their position.

746
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:29,333
And I expect them
to then accept my decision.

747
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,970
Even when you're wrong?

748
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,908
I can't run my team any other way.

749
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:59,830
You know what was insane,
was the 1928 Torpedo Roadster.

750
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:01,232
With the Purpleheart trim?

751
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:03,500
Ah, and the lizard-skin interior.

752
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,071
My neighbor in Wyoming
had a Silver Arrow.

753
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:09,373
Oh, I'd love to drive one just once.

754
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:14,228
Good job. You got him walking.

755
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:17,781
Debbie Wexler did it.

756
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,918
She's a better carrot than I am.

757
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,653
She's a better friend.

758
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:31,495
Hey, it's me.

759
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:34,874
Yeah, just making sure
the check got there okay.

760
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:38,085
Great, great.

761
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:41,605
Hey, I have a question...

762
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,382
about Phil.

763
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,510
I know, I know. He's long gone.

764
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:49,096
I was actually wondering...

765
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:51,348
what do you think would've happened

766
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,050
if I hadn't seen you two together?

767
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:10,934
I found my next apartment.

768
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,836
Okay.

769
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:16,006
It's has a fireplace...

770
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:17,441
and natural lighting...

771
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:19,209
No. N-N-No.

772
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:21,545
...and a really great roommate

773
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,781
who's also a friend.

774
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:27,184
He works a lot, so might be
hard to see him otherwise.

775
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,515
I'm talking about you, Shaun.

776
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:38,228
I don't want to risk anything
hurting our friendship.

777
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,099
If you say you can handle
living together,

778
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:43,767
I trust you.

779
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:53,477
W-We're... going to be roommates?

780
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,282
Oh...

781
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:03,821
I-It has a fireplace.

782
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:05,089
Yes, it does.

783
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,790
Oh!

784
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,359
We're going to be roommates!

785
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:11,061
We're gonna be roommates!

786
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:12,996
- Okay!
- Yes.

787
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:14,898
- Okay!
- Yes!

788
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,100
We're gonna be roommates!

789
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:17,668
Oh, y...

790
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,269
Yes!

791
00:42:20,305 --> 00:43:20,222
