2
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,416
It's crooked-

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,668
What'd you say?

4
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,920
It's a little crooked!

5
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,840
Drop it a little.

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,059
Cool. Let's go...

7
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,341
This one's the best...

8
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,424
Watch. Watch.

9
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,770
Fuck.

10
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,230
Recognize him, Boss?

11
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,027
Yeah. Romo...

12
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,448
YOU'RE NEXT MAYO
TIJUANA BELONGS TO THE ARELLANOS

13
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,521
Come on, assholes.

14
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:01,741
Too slow, you fucking pigs!

15
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,792
Fuck it...

16
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,502
Stop!

17
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,092
You assholes can't shoot for shit.

18
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,886
Fuck!

19
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,356
Custom made.

20
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,400
Fucking asshole.

21
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,908
Hey, Güero...

22
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,131
Who taught
these fucking guys to play?

23
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,011
Been too long, brother...

24
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,806
How are you?

25
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,518
Save me a seat?

26
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,772
Sure.

27
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,816
What's up?

28
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,157
...Arellanos are drowning.

29
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,701
That's why they're hitting back at us.

30
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,911
Now's the time to hold 'em under.

31
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,208
My mother used to say,

32
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:39,005
"Ask God to move a mountain,
be ready to wake up next to a shovel."

33
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,467
I'm ready to dig, man.

34
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:52,060
Been pushing your guys for more product
to move through Tijuana...

35
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,395
I'm getting the run-around.

36
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,275
Things have gotten too loud, Mayo.

37
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,611
Arellanos tried to kill you, man.

38
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,782
Something change?

39
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:11,162
Make it work with what you got.
Or go back to Sinaloa.

40
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,082
Alright.

41
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,005
Be easier keeping things "quiet"

42
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,299
if the Army hadn't hit
two of our spots last week...

43
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,301
Army's not my problem, man.

44
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,262
I know...

45
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,765
Far from it.

46
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,934
Ever since this war broke out,

47
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,187
Army's hit every organization in Mexico...
except Juárez.

48
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,524
Something on your mind, Mayo?

49
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,905
Whatever you're doing,
it's money well-spent.

50
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,077
Or maybe it's just good luck.

51
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,037
Maybe.

52
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:54,997
Sure...

53
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,336
Alright then...

54
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,697
Come on...

55
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,001
Fuck.

56
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,855
Done for the night, boss?

57
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,776
The fuck you doing in my truck?

58
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,780
Was gonna move it.

59
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,783
Some fucking kids were snooping around...

60
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,452
You know how they are.

61
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,550
Don't ever touch my truck.

62
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,598
Won't happen again, boss.

63
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,610
Sorry...

64
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,363
Hold up.

65
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,338
What's that girl's name?
One who serves drinks, with the fine ass.

66
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,926
Lucia.

67
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,135
Lucia.

68
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,848
Cool.

69
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,152
<i>Tell Barron to start with the army.</i>

70
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,531
<i>So we can send
the fucking correct message.</i>

71
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,579
Anything?

72
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,039
Not on this one either.

73
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,585
That's Ramón Arellano's voice
on that tape.

74
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,210
That's not Ramón.

75
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,547
This kid's lying to us.

76
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,798
It isn't him, man.

77
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,469
Intelligence reviewed these tapes
two weeks ago.

78
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,973
- They made a mistake.
- Fuck this kid, Walt.

79
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,815
Take it back down to Intelligence
and have them make the correction.

80
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,710
I'm a little hungry...

81
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,573
Been working hard on this.

82
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,783
Maybe some Burger King?

83
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,744
- Go fuck yourself.
- Hey.

84
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,500
He needs a girlfriend.

85
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,755
Yeah.

86
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,465
Probably.

87
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,011
No one's heard anything on my brother?

88
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,015
No.

89
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,560
Not yet.

90
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,278
Alfredo is smart.

91
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,658
He'll be okay for a while.

92
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,923
- Get started on the next tape. All right?
- Okay.

93
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,392
That kid's a piece of shit.

94
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,436
Pushing his head
through a wall won't get us Benjamín.

95
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,981
Please, just get him something to eat.

96
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,276
Kid's all we got.

97
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,221
<i>Next, please...</i>

98
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,522
<i>Her name's Sofia Elvira Herrera.</i>

99
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,025
She owns the account we've been on...

100
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,404
The Juárez cartel's
paying her $200,000 every month.

101
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,073
Question is, why?

102
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,701
Who is she?

103
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:28,664
Former beauty queen. From Monterrey.
Won the pageant there twice.

104
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,167
'83, again in '85.

105
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,960
And before then?

106
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,255
Can't find anything on her before 1983.

107
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,759
No property listing,
car registrations... nothing.

108
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,097
"Sofia" changed her name.

109
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,142
Only explanation...

110
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,645
You're sure she's the one
handling the money?

111
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,733
She's been at the bank each time.
Matches when withdrawals were made.

112
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,943
Can't be a coincidence.

113
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,615
What're our other angles
into this account?

114
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,033
This is it.

115
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,413
This woman's the conduit, as you say -
between Juárez and Hank,

116
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,789
then something connects them.

117
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,916
Go back to the archives...

118
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,545
Figure out who Sofia was
before she changed her name...

119
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,053
<i>...The situation
we discussed in Tijuana.</i>

120
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,763
<i>I'm hearing it's unresolved...</i>

121
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,059
Told the Sinaloans they're on their own.

122
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,480
Maybe that's the problem.
You need to take a firmer hand.

123
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,190
<i>Speaking of which...</i>

124
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,276
<i>my accountants in Mexico City
noticed some unusual activity...</i>

125
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,238
<i>in your numbers this month.</i>

126
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,785
You still there?

127
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,706
Your cut, is it up or down?

128
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:59,713
Money moves around, man.
I don't fucking know.

129
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:05,469
<i>That's why I want to take a closer look.
To see where it's "moving"...</i>

130
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:11,725
I'm sending some men to Juárez.
To review our mutual enterprises...

131
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,019
<i>Ensure there's no... misunderstandings.</i>

132
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:21,443
If you're so worried, we can
shut this whole "partnership" down.

133
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,823
<i>Save your accountants a trip...</i>

134
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,784
<i>How's that girlfriend of yours?</i>

135
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,288
The fuck you talking about?

136
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,331
<i>The Cuban.</i>

137
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,542
The black girl. In Havana.

138
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,752
She still in that apartment
off Obispo boulevard?

139
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,380
<i>Come on, man.
Why haven't you put her someplace nice?</i>

140
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,551
<i>Or is that part of the excitement,
the exotic texture?</i>

141
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,472
Heard of the DGI?
Dirrecion General De Intelligence.

142
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,100
Cuba's secret police.

143
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,271
<i>Its boss, he's an old friend...</i>

144
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:03,736
Those men you pay to protect her...
they work for him.

145
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,408
Play games with me, they'll pick her up.
Take her for a ride...

146
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,611
And when they get bored
of doing whatever they want...

147
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,996
they'll leave her in the street
for dogs to pick at.

148
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>We clear now?</i>

149
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:21,545
<i>My men will arrive tomorrow.
Make sure they get whatever they need...</i>

150
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,589
Hey!

151
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,022
What's her name, man...

152
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,607
Stop fucking around.

153
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,193
Found it.

154
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,951
Fuck it. This is far enough.

155
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,916
Come on...

156
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,711
Let's go, man.

157
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,425
Walk.

158
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,732
Check this out...

159
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,613
This kid in the picture your son?

160
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,949
Yeah. He's four...

161
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,535
Too bad his dad's an asshole.

162
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,132
Here.

163
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,760
Take it...

164
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,476
There's a shovel in the trunk.

165
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,936
He's good there.

166
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,569
Vicente, some of the guys,
we're going out tonight.

167
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,862
Pick you up at 11...

168
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,405
I can't.

169
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,157
Have things to do.

170
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,593
Gotta figure your shit out, Victor.

171
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,244
What the fuck's that mean?

172
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,872
Means I gotta page you
to get hold of your ass lately.

173
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,225
Don't think these dudes don't notice.
Been trying to cover for you.

174
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,543
I got a thing with Tenci. Okay, Rogelio?

175
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,797
She's been on me to spend more time.

176
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,300
What do you want me to say?

177
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,178
I can't get out of it.

178
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,347
Let's go.

179
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,752
- Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

180
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,360
- Look.
- It's water.

181
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,698
Don't get too wet,
mommy's taking you soon.

182
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,657
What is that?

183
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,575
A fly.

184
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,858
I'll protect you from the fly.

185
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,370
<i>Shit feels off, don't it?</i>

186
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,207
<i>Didn't call to hear you bitch.</i>

187
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,668
<i>Can you move that thing
by next week, or not?</i>

188
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,252
<i>It's done.</i>

189
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,506
<i>Was just saying...</i>

190
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,882
<i>Shit feels off.</i>

191
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,344
<i>Army'll move on soon.</i>

192
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,306
<i>And that other shit. The Sinaloans?</i>

193
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,017
<i>You scared, man?</i>

194
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,228
<i>C'mon...</i>

195
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,980
<i>Talked to your brother?</i>

196
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,275
<i>Of course I've talked to Benjamín...</i>

197
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,445
<i>Right...</i>

198
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,532
It'll be okay...

199
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,450
Everything will be okay.

200
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,035
<i>Well, look...</i>

201
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,788
<i>Tell him we're praying for him.</i>

202
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,959
<i>My wife lights a candle for Ruth
every Sunday.</i>

203
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,460
<i>Never misses one...</i>

204
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,672
<i>Appreciate that, bro.</i>

205
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,758
<i>Don't worry...</i>

206
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,720
<i>With God's help, we'll get through this.</i>

207
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,351
<i>We're gonna beat this thing.</i>

208
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,856
What's wrong with Benjamín's wife?

209
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,860
What's wrong with Benjamín's wife?

210
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,862
His wife?

211
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,030
Yeah, lights a candle for her
every Sunday.

212
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,824
What's wrong with her? Is she okay?

213
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,117
They mean his kid.

214
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,911
His daughter. Her name is Ruth, too.

215
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,913
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

216
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,749
All right, his daughter,
what's wrong with her?

217
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,833
She's sick.

218
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,377
We're always talking about it.

219
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,545
Sick how?

220
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,256
She has trouble breathing and shit.

221
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,425
Like seizures.

222
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,554
I saw it happen once. It's fucked up.

223
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,266
Ramón would get high and talk
about how we all had to pray for her.

224
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,855
This condition, describe it to me exactly.

225
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,618
<i>...called lymphatic malformation.</i>

226
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,902
From what I can tell,
looks pretty rare and difficult to treat.

227
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,988
<i>Causes masses,
blockages to the lungs, the brain.</i>

228
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,341
<i>If your source is right on this,
we might actually have something.</i>

229
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,365
Sir?

230
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,429
There aren't that many places
that specialize in this treatment.

231
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,417
These clinics,
tell me you have addresses for them.

232
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,669
Only four facilities
specialize in the disease.

233
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,548
Three of them are in high-populated areas,
Tijuana, Guadalajara and Mexico City,

234
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,884
and all of those tie
into larger hospitals.

235
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,094
That is a bad fit
for a fugitive like Benjamín.

236
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,055
Which narrows it down to this one.

237
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,598
Just outside Cuernavaca.

238
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,518
It's the smallest, it's private,
and it's in an upscale neighborhood.

239
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,649
- We should look into it.
- San Diego already has.

240
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,527
I got ahold of the clinic's database,
ran the list of patients.

241
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,631
Turns out one of them
didn't provide a local address.

242
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,491
Emergency contact
leads back to a P.O. box.

243
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,911
Sir, this thing's real.

244
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,502
Could be Benjamín
or just someone looking for privacy.

245
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,920
Well, let's find out.

246
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,881
Patient has an appointment
tomorrow afternoon.

247
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,800
I spoke with the receptionist myself.

248
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,266
Brief Providencio. Get a team together.

249
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,351
Yes, sir.

250
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,021
<i>So what are
these assholes gonna find?</i>

251
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,305
We've pulled out
millions of dollars already...

252
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,485
If Hank looks closely,
that leaves a trace...

253
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,862
How long'll it take
for them to figure it out?

254
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,283
Who knows... not long.
What the fuck do we do?

255
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:29,413
The money we got from the last Cali load.
It's a couple hundred million...

256
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,666
Hank knows about it!
Won't replace what we've taken...

257
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,838
We're not gonna replace it.

258
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,233
Anything yet?

259
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,987
Not sure I know
where I'm supposed to start...

260
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,657
She lived in Monterrey in the early '80s...

261
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,120
Right. Thanks...

262
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,753
The boys really love him.
Can't get enough...

263
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,756
...Palma's got charisma.

264
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,175
Yeah...

265
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,719
What you call a "natural leader"...

266
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,304
I fucking heard you, Neto.

267
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,098
Enough.

268
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,351
So maybe now you'll listen.

269
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,481
If Güero Palma's
calling shots for Sinaloa,

270
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,358
what's Mayo need you for?

271
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,946
Get ahead of this, kid -
or get back in line...

272
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,769
Ordered you a coffee.

273
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,270
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

274
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,271
Got my thing?

275
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,692
Any trouble?

276
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,319
You have my thing or no?

277
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,533
Ran that Texas plate for you.

278
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,714
"Edith... Edith Richards."

279
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,967
That's the registered owner.

280
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,426
She's 72.

281
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,014
This is not the car.

282
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,435
This isn't the car.
I told you Cadillac. This is a Dodge.

283
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,937
- Hey.
- This is Dodge.

284
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,605
Hey. That's what came back.

285
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,900
Which means the car you saw
was probably stolen.

286
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,111
Swapped plate. It's pretty common.

287
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,156
Especially if the vehicle's been used
to commit a crime.

288
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,208
Are you okay, Victor?

289
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,293
You eaten?

290
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,714
Are we friends now, Agent Jaime?

291
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,886
No.

292
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,598
No, I know we're not friends.

293
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,273
How long have you been on the job?

294
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,031
Too long.

295
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,367
Coming up on my 26th year.

296
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,706
Got a family?

297
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,833
Daughter.

298
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,047
Yeah. She lives
with her mother up in Virginia.

299
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,300
You?

300
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,345
No.

301
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,226
We tried for a while, but...

302
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,144
didn't work.

303
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,743
Everything okay?

304
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,290
Gotta go.

305
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,542
Victor, be careful.

306
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,296
Watch your back.

307
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,154
- <i>Hey.</i>
- It's me.

308
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,864
Of course -

309
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,909
You're the only one with this number.

310
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,246
<i>You there?</i>

311
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,292
Those guys from the security service,
they still outside?

312
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,462
Yes.

313
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,718
Always... My personal bodyguards.

314
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,637
Everything okay?

315
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,848
Look...

316
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,602
Our plan, you leaving...
something's come up.

317
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,695
This how it felt

318
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,905
when you were closing in
on Félix Gallardo?

319
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,410
That was bullshit, man.

320
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,788
They gave us Félix.

321
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,961
Bye. Thank you, doctor.

322
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,385
Look...

323
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,598
Thank you.

324
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,515
Say thank you.

325
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,309
Thank you.

326
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,144
Bye.

327
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,728
Here.

328
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,396
Up we go.

329
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,409
LYMPHATIC CLINIC

330
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,746
My men
have eyes on the girl right now.

331
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,915
Alejandro Ayala tells me you're in charge.

332
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,999
How far out are we?

333
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,627
We should have a visual on the house
by the time we land.

334
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,088
The girl and mother,
they match the description.

335
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,342
Fuckin' A.

336
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,682
We were making progress,

337
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,086
but shit's getting complicated...

338
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,852
Complicated how?

339
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:14,984
Fucking Army,
hit a couple of our spots...

340
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,779
What's Mayo's plan -
get them off our back...

341
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,115
Look...

342
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,492
Didn't know we were meeting.

343
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,284
Gentleman.

344
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,413
Mmm.

345
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,166
Fuck, Arturo...

346
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,752
You look like shit...

347
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,587
Thought I was the one in jail.

348
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,221
We talking business?

349
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,974
Problems in Tijuana.

350
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,602
Army hitting our spots.

351
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:52,856
How do we fix it?

352
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:57,902
Reached out to Amado,
help replace the product we lost.

353
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,612
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:00,989
And?

355
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,991
Said he's out.

356
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,952
Fucking guy's scared...

357
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,916
Why don't you tie yourself
to other organizations?

358
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,961
Now we're relying on Amado...

359
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,844
What about my "La Comadre" thing,
it still working?

360
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,473
What, jalapeño cans?

361
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,057
Yeah.

362
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:34,105
Gotta tell El Léon
you're stealing his ideas...

363
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,317
Thought you said
you came up with that in the cafeteria?

364
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,403
Oh.

365
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,708
What?

366
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,669
Been searching
political events in Monterrey...

367
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,547
anything that might tie to the PRI

368
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,966
around the time
our "beauty queen" was there.

369
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,884
There she is.

370
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,387
And look who else...

371
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,973
Hank González.

372
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,727
Holy shit. September 1981...

373
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,397
Says her name's Yessenia Chasco...

374
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,777
Start looking under this new name...

375
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,461
Yes?

376
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,924
They're headed up...

377
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,066
<i>We count
five men on the perimeter.</i>

378
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,569
Guys on the inside?

379
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,405
No. But no one's come or gone
since the girl arrived back.

380
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,075
No confirmation on Benjamín.

381
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,328
Wouldn't be that much security
if Benjamín wasn't here.

382
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,789
If it's his wife and kid,
of course there would be.

383
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,771
If we keep sitting here,
we're gonna get made.

384
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:25,133
We move on the house and he's not inside,
this angle's burned forever.

385
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,220
Phone it in to Rebollo.

386
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,307
Says it's your call.

387
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,904
What are you thinking?

388
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,530
What's your gut tell you?

389
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,449
We putting money down?

390
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,700
I'm fifty-fifty.

391
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,879
We're going in at dark.

392
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,892
Got a couple desks
you can use, whatever you need...

393
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,102
This is just a summary.

394
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,021
I'll need actual files.

395
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,191
Last six months of receivables,
to start with.

396
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,740
Follow me.

397
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,016
Going somewhere, Miss?

398
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,771
This is everything we've got...

399
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,446
Fucked up my boots.

400
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,615
Why don't you get in the car...

401
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,866
Come with us...

402
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,082
Amado says to call him
once you're outside the city.

403
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,376
Have a place to go?

404
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,004
Miss.

405
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,840
You have a place to go?

406
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,632
Okay.

407
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,344
Leave and get a taxi.

408
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,639
After 15 minutes,
get out... and catch another one.

409
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,682
You understand?

410
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,312
Miss. You understand?

411
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,814
Go...

412
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,941
Go!

413
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,299
What happens now?

414
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,051
Stealing Hank's money,

415
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,802
two dead accountants.

416
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,221
Might as well
burn the fucking building down...

417
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,599
Fuck Hank.

418
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,769
By the time he knows what happened,
I'll be gone.

419
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,231
Gonna take a day or two
to pull out all that Cali money,

420
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,485
make the transfer...

421
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,866
Take 10 million for yourself.

422
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,037
Time to disappear, man...

423
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,340
Hey, open up -

424
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,342
Need to use your phone...

425
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,385
No phone here. Beat it.

426
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,638
My engine's dead...

427
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,639
Come on!

428
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,350
Get the fuck outta here...

429
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,728
Back off, fucker!

430
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,729
Andrea -

431
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,025
Check this out...

432
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,404
We've been looking at this wrong.

433
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,175
<i>I couldn't find anything
under Yessenia's real name...</i>

434
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,219
So I went back to that photo.

435
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,429
Started looking at the other people in it...

436
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,890
This man.

437
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,642
Edgar Benzal.

438
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,104
He was married to our girl before he died.

439
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,480
Died...

440
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,440
He knew Hank?

441
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,526
No. Wasn't even a member of the Party.

442
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,902
He was military.

443
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,446
A Captain. 6th Infantry Battalion.

444
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:03,828
He was killed in a helicopter crash.
Few months after this photo was taken...

445
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,371
So what's that mean?

446
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:11,586
It's who he served under...

447
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,628
Get down, get down!

448
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,730
Find Benjamín.

449
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,505
Don't move! Come on!

450
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,134
Check the house!

451
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,928
Get the fuck out of my house -

452
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,721
Calm down -

453
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,097
Hold her!

454
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,392
<i>You okay?</i>

455
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,518
Yeah.

456
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,398
Headed to the country now.
My cousin's place...

457
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,193
You'll be safe there.

458
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,902
<i>Yeah.</i>

459
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:25,034
Won't be long. I'm putting that last piece
together, coming to get you.

460
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>We'll be in Chile in two days.</i>

461
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:34,418
On a beach, the mountains behind us...

462
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,796
Don't make me wait.

463
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,048
<i>I won't.</i>

464
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,015
Bedroom's empty.

465
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,186
- It's empty!
- Move on!

466
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,771
Where's your husband?

467
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,648
Take me to my daughter.

468
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,317
You're not seeing your daughter
till we find your husband.

469
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,820
Where is he? Do you prefer
your husband to your daughter?

470
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,196
Take me to Ruth!

471
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,864
Where is your husband?

472
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,157
Fuck.

473
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,958
Turn her around...

474
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,006
Turn her around.

475
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,220
Is this your dad?

476
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,139
My dad.

477
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,265
Walt...

478
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,976
I want my mom.

479
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,059
Look...

480
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,811
Look.

481
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,106
- My daddy.
- Yes.

482
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,734
Where is he? Where's daddy?

483
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,111
Walt, he's not here, man.

484
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,030
Look.

485
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,114
Walt.

486
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,201
Mom!

487
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,537
Look at me.

488
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,707
- Where is your dad?
- Walt!

489
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,044
The maid says he left this morning.

490
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,220
Rip the fucking house apart.

491
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,472
Walt, he's not here.

492
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,896
Hold up.

493
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,660
You sure about this, man?

494
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:39,168
Staying here, trying to hang onto Juárez
after I'm gone - it's gonna be a fight...

495
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,797
It's life, man.

496
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,883
Never wanted anything different...

497
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,557
- Take care, brother.
- You too.

498
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,769
Let's go.

499
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:06,278
After Yessenia's husband, Edgar...
graduated the academy,

500
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,781
he was assigned to 6th Infantry Command.

501
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,951
Under General Gutiérrez Rebollo.

502
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,374
They were close.

503
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,459
Rebollo was his mentor.

504
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,464
After Edgar died...

505
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,677
Rebollo maintained a relationship
with Yessenia...

506
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,596
That account...

507
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,098
the money we've been following...

508
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,017
the Juárez cartel
hasn't been funneling it to Hank...

509
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,355
They've been paying off General Rebollo.

510
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,567
The man running Mexico's war
on drug traffickers...

511
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,696
The payments started
the same month Rebollo arrived in Tijuana.

512
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,952
You two found this?

513
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,204
At the library.

514
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,416
They weren't even hiding it.

515
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,336
Just didn't think anyone would look.

516
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,965
You did.

517
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,454
Get back to the office.

518
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,289
Start writing it up...

519
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:46,170
Call the Army for comment.

520
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,840
Start with General Pinel.

521
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,924
Pinel.

522
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,511
From Mexico City.

523
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,387
And the Federal Prosecutor?

524
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,806
I'll call him myself.

525
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,713
Good evening...

526
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,264
Hey. You ladies seen a gold colored car?

527
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,976
A gold Cadillac...

528
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,311
Like this one.

529
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,439
Please...

530
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,945
Seen a gold car like that? Man driving it...

531
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,322
No?

532
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,448
Why...

533
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,494
Who are you?

534
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,292
Used to be a cop...

535
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,879
Look, please...

536
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,300
The man driving that car...

537
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,843
He's dangerous.

538
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,099
He hurts women.

539
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,478
Be careful.

540
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,866
<i>They want to destroy me...</i>

541
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,268
Not just our business.
Enedina, they have my fucking family!

542
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,564
<i>The lawyers spoke to Ruth...
She's fine.</i>

543
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,359
She'll be released tomorrow.

544
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,153
They had their hands on my wife -

545
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,865
<i>Benjamín, she's fine...
Important thing is you're safe.</i>

546
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,621
For how long?

547
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,041
We hold on, Benjamín -
that's all we can do.

548
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,709
For as long as we can...

549
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,758
You were right.

550
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,135
About staying on the move...

551
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,222
<i>You've always been right.</i>

552
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,851
I'll call when I hear from the lawyers...

553
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,604
Thanks.

554
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,519
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

555
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,545
I just landed back in Tijuana.

556
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:18,006
What are you still doing down there?
Get up to San Diego right now.

557
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,716
What the hell are you talking about?

558
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,927
Oh, shit, you haven't heard.

559
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,848
Walt, General Rebollo
is about to be arrested.

560
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,722
Where have you been?

561
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,281
Work thing.

562
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,700
With Rogelio?

563
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,783
Yeah...

564
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,460
Funny. He called.

565
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,423
Asked if you were with me.
Like you told him you were.

566
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,722
I told him you were.

567
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,856
Where were you, Victor?

568
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,624
You fucking one of those whores from work?

569
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Liar.

570
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,847
I've been out by the factories.

571
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:55,103
Looking for the man who killed Teresa.

572
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,859
Other girls too...

573
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,114
Other girls...

574
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,456
How long've you been doing this?

575
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:22,005
A while. I don't know...

576
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,224
No one's doing anything to make it stop.

577
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,106
And you think you can?

578
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,444
I don't know.

579
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,951
Maybe.

580
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,000
No?

581
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,047
You're going to get killed. Doing this.

582
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,719
You know that?

583
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,805
Hmm.

584
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,100
Look at me, Victor.

585
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,689
You have to stop.

586
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,775
Tell me you'll stop.

587
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,722
What the fuck's going on?

588
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,590
The CNI...

589
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,928
they're here to remove anything
that could embarrass my bosses.

590
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,516
Is it true?

591
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,025
You've been taking orders from
Amado Carrillo Fuentes this whole time?

592
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,904
You think so black-and-white.

593
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,909
You should know that
better than most people...

594
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,750
our countries,
they don't want to fight this war,

595
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,337
just create the impression of it.

596
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,843
I did what was necessary
to get things done.

597
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,930
Fuck you.

598
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,894
The kid, where is he?

599
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,533
Get up. We're leaving.

600
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,786
I've been asking for you.
They haven't brought more tapes.

601
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,454
Where are we going?

602
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,498
We're going to San Diego.

603
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:08,542
What about my brother?

604
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,251
Wait.

605
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,171
Wait, I need to find my brother.

606
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,798
Come on.

607
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,593
- I'm not leaving till we do.
- Listen to me!

608
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,428
Your brother's dead, Alex.

609
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,057
He died three weeks ago.
I was there, I saw the body.

610
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,517
All right? They killed him.

611
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,894
Look, I lied to you. All right?

612
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,771
But if you stay here, you're gonna die.

613
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,897
You hear me?

614
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,024
Come on.

615
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,092
Hey! You can't take him -

616
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,411
Easy. Stay away.

617
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,840
Let him go. It's the American.

618
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,859
What's going on?

619
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,988
There's a problem
at the airfield, sir.

620
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,910
Police are there. Military too.

621
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,621
They've seized the entire hangar...

622
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:48,433
They say you're all over the news...

625
