00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>The arrest of General Rebollo
stunned Mexico City and Washington, DC.</i>

3
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,484
<i>It made guys calling the shots
look incompetent.</i>

4
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>Corrupt.</i>

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,989
<i>Or maybe just clueless.</i>

6
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,205
<i>The General had been sold as a savior.</i>

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:44,377
<i>So respected, the US shared
its best intelligence with him.</i>

8
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,840
<i>And Mexico gave him command
of our entire anti-narcotics program.</i>

9
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,844
<i>The whole time,
he was on the Juárez cartel payroll.</i>

10
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,347
Cannot believe this shit.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,224
Hey.

12
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,645
Nice spot. Roomy.

13
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,901
Amado's gone.
But he's not getting out of the country.

14
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,654
Well, we got
a couple other addresses to check.

15
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,740
And a lead on his brother, Vicente.

16
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,825
You must have a good source in Juárez.

17
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,538
<i>Rebollo being dirty
meant nothing was what it seemed.</i>

18
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>Just weeks before the arrest,</i>

19
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,128
<i>America's drug czar had called him
a man of unquestioned integrity.</i>

20
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,507
<i>That quote didn't age well.</i>

21
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,177
<i>Now Rebollo faced 40 years in prison.</i>

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,097
<i>Amado Carillo Fuentes
was the most famous trafficker alive.</i>

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>And any claim of progress
seemed like a bad joke.</i>

24
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,104
<i>It was a new low in America's drug war.</i>

25
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,817
<i>The only thing Mexico
and the US could agree on,</i>

26
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,403
<i>they needed Amado caught. Soon.</i>

27
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,947
Relax.

28
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,698
Answer their fucking questions.

29
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,327
<i>They'd just
have to find him first.</i>

30
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,581
<i>The search
for the mysterious Juárez Cartel boss,</i>

31
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,501
<i>Amado Carillo Fuentes, continues...</i>

32
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,170
<i>It's believed
the drug trafficker fled Juárez...</i>

33
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,588
<i>Question was,</i>

34
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,092
<i>would anyone besides
Amado and General Rebollo</i>

35
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,052
<i>be dragged into the spotlight?</i>

36
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,388
<i>Face justice?</i>

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>♪ Heart breaker ♪</i>

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,351
<i>♪ You stole the love
Right out of my heart ♪</i>

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,314
<i>♪ Heart breaker, heart breaker... ♪</i>

40
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,343
<i>Still on hold?</i>

41
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,738
No one at Citibank
knows where the accounts went.

42
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,157
They "vanished."

43
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,997
Hank's cleaning his tracks.

44
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,136
...don't believe me,
I'll bring it tomorrow -

45
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,554
show you it's true.

46
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,724
- See you later.
- Bye!

47
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,916
Hey. You need a ride?

48
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,298
Headed up past Las Flores.
That where you're going?

49
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,215
No thanks.

50
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,554
Not much further,
but you don't want to walk.

51
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,222
<i>What just happened here?</i>

52
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,641
<i>You were just humoring me, weren't you?</i>

53
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,018
<i>You no more think
that I could be a TV weather girl</i>

54
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,562
<i>than you think Gracie could be a jockey.</i>

55
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,106
Can I have one?

56
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,026
- You're an interesting guy, Alex.
- Thanks.

57
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,574
Maybe we can go for a drive later?

58
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,452
Check out the surfers.

59
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,078
We're supposed to stay put.

60
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,498
Hmm. At least
till you talk to the investigator.

61
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,045
You nervous about that?

62
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,177
I don't know. Not yet.

63
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,776
I'm gonna step outside for a minute.

64
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,947
Could we have Domino's again? For dinner?

65
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,783
Yeah, sure, man.

66
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,175
- How's it going in there?
- Pretty good.

67
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,799
What's "pretty good" mean?

68
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,348
Five days ago,
he found out his brother was murdered.

69
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,934
Since then he's been
drug across the border

70
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,269
and asked to testify
against a drug cartel. So...

71
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,313
Pretty good.

72
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,399
Um, he wants pizza for dinner.

73
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,032
- What, Jack?
- Need me to say it?

74
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,744
The Rebollo thing is a fucking disaster.

75
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,829
We helped Amado take out his competition.

76
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,915
You're saying
that's not in the DEA handbook?

77
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,875
Guys could lose
their jobs over this, Walt.

78
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,086
Yeah, well, maybe we all should, Jack.

79
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,753
Right.

80
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,678
Any word on Amado?
I mean, what's El Paso saying?

81
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,805
They're looking, all hands on deck.

82
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,894
Look, this kid's gonna say
what I need him to say?

83
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,189
Rebollo was a bad apple.

84
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,191
The price of doing business in Mexico.

85
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,068
That's what it is.

86
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,823
What's the word on his immunity?

87
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,824
I'm working on it.

88
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,453
Thought it was a done deal, Jack.

89
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,206
Alex Hodoyan is no fucking angel.

90
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,587
Hey, make sure
he wears long sleeves tomorrow,

91
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,713
with the investigators.

92
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,341
I don't want them asking
where those marks on his arm came from.

93
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,638
- We clear?
- Yeah, we're clear.

94
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,770
<i>No sign of Amado.</i>

95
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,856
Whole thing's going to shit.

96
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,484
Arellanos are coming back hard now.

97
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,237
At anyone who tested 'em...

98
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,365
Guys are turning on us?

99
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,242
They're scared, Chapo.

100
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,120
Lot of dead bodies on the street.

101
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,415
But with the Army out of Tijuana...

102
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,833
the border's opened up.

103
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,210
Bro, we're out of product -

104
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,338
Amado's fucking vanished!

105
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,256
Mayo got a plan to get us more shit?

106
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,135
Mayo's gone back to Mazatlán.

107
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,554
Arellanos have been looking for him...

108
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,016
No shit they are...

109
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,604
We should pull
the guys we still got outta Tijuana.

110
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:53,194
It looks bad keeping men on the ground,
when Mayo's fucked off.

111
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,407
Pulling back makes us look weak.

112
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,078
We aren't "pulling back," Arturo...

113
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,121
You fucking lost.

114
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,666
Call it what it is.

115
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,091
Truth is, it was always a dumb idea.

116
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,886
Time to cut our losses.

117
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,527
Let the guys know...

118
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,530
Palma's right.

119
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,824
Okay, boss.

120
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,876
- Is it done?
- It's done, sir.

121
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,757
Cell's packed. Transfer's signed.

122
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,513
Going somewhere?

123
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,016
Palma is.

124
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,980
Nice touch back there.

125
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:17,278
Letting the opinionated prick
ride out with a "win."

126
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,782
Let him know.

127
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,918
They're ready for you.

128
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,955
Good. Let's start...

129
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,302
Still nothing on Amado?

130
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,097
- Not yet...
- Stay on it.

131
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,268
Got an update from our guys in El Rubi -

132
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,105
Mayo's crew cleared out.

133
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,318
Great news, right?

134
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,282
...I'm back now.
The fucking Army's gone -

135
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,410
Things are going back to how they were.

136
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,705
Make that clear.

137
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,334
After all we've been through...

138
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,421
what matters is - we're still here.

139
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,633
The Arellano Felix family's back.

140
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,011
Stronger than ever...

141
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,030
- Cheers!
- God damn right!

142
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,935
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

143
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,566
Dina, wait up...

144
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,907
You good with this?

145
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,953
I'm glad
you're home, Benjamín.

146
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,176
Almost done fueling, sir.

147
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,386
Let's go.

148
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,429
Let's move.

149
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,555
What the fuck...

150
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,073
Let's go this way! Let's go!

151
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,545
Keep going!

152
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,049
Get to the plane!

153
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,569
Close the door!

154
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,783
Put these things on -

155
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,095
Fuck!

156
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,012
Flaps aren't working -

157
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,639
What does that mean, boss?

158
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,558
We can't take off.

159
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,646
We have to get out...

160
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,981
Go - now -

161
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,084
Let's go, sir! Let's go!

162
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,801
Oh, thanks, man.

163
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,849
Thanks.

164
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,076
You ready for tomorrow morning?

165
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,913
They are like lawyers, right?

166
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,082
Yeah.

167
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,003
Basically, you're...
an indictment on the Arellanos.

168
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,631
They just wanna know what you know.

169
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,177
Your bosses are worried
about what I'm gonna say?

170
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,386
Right?

171
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,018
General Rebollo made
a lot of people look stupid.

172
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,324
Look, at some point,

173
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,619
they're gonna ask you about what happened

174
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,204
at the base.

175
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,836
How long you were there, what went down.

176
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,011
Rebollo lied to you.

177
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,765
You shouldn't
get in trouble for believing him.

178
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,228
Don't worry,

179
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,692
I will tell the lawyers
what your bosses want them to hear.

180
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,580
My dad eats pizza with a knife and fork.

181
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,754
After they get what they need,

182
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,051
maybe I can go home, see my mom.

183
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,308
No, Alex, we talked about this, remember?

184
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,102
Yeah.

185
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,607
I can't go home
'cause I'm talking to the investigators.

186
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,278
The Arellanos will kill you
if you go back Tijuana.

187
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,158
They probably have someone
waiting at your parents' place.

188
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,494
Okay? You can't go back home, not yet.

189
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,634
I'm gonna make sure
that whatever comes next, you'll be okay.

190
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,890
Thanks.

191
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,645
Don't be nervous about tomorrow,

192
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,399
all right? We fucked up, not you.

193
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,198
Tell the lawyers whatever you want.

194
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,582
See you tomorrow, Walt.

195
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,880
See you tomorrow.

196
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,676
Andréa...

197
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,397
Heard back from the Minister's office.

198
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,065
It's a 'no.'

199
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,611
No press is getting access to Rebollo.

200
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,783
He's issuing a brief statement -

201
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,953
then no further comment.

202
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,746
This "statement"...

203
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,872
The usual.

204
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,166
Nothing about Hank.

205
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,378
I'm sorry.

206
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,338
But this is as far as it's going to go.

207
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,550
It's time for us to move on.

208
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,135
Right.

209
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,723
It's a hell of a story. Rebollo.

210
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,518
You earned a couple days off.

211
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,979
I'm okay.

212
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,858
Still have some follow-ups.

213
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,403
This was good work, Andrea.

214
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,203
Heard you're running
a story on the Arellanos.

215
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:17,294
With names and photos
of every associate we have on file.

216
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,172
They think
things are going back to 'normal'.

217
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,176
Seems like maybe
we should disappoint them.

218
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,928
Hmm?

219
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:28,907
<i>I've been trying
to reach you - I was scared...</i>

220
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,451
I know. Sorry...

221
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,786
<i>You're okay?</i>

222
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,665
Yeah, I'm okay.

223
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,210
How long'll it take
to set up another flight out?

224
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,007
Not sure it matters.

225
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,636
<i>Amado...</i>

226
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,514
I get out, and what?

227
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,519
My face is everywhere...

228
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,271
<i>It won't stop.</i>

229
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,358
<i>The man I burned,
he won't ever stop coming for me.</i>

230
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,610
You can't think like that...

231
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,284
I want you to go to Chile without me.

232
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,493
Don't wait.

233
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,287
No -

234
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,707
I'll meet you. When I can.

235
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,252
What are you going to do?

236
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,462
<i>I have one more thing I can try...</i>

237
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,755
<i>If it works...</i>

238
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,884
we'll be good.

239
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,596
I'm not going without you. I'm not -

240
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,015
Marta. Chile's set...

241
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:40,854
The house, all of it.
Please. I'll meet you when it's safe.

242
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,023
<i>I don't believe you...</i>

243
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,651
Promise me that you'll come.

244
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,028
<i>I can't do that...</i>

245
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,864
But I'll do what I can.

246
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,994
<i>This is our best option.</i>

247
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,788
Talk soon.

248
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,120
Fuck.

249
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,282
Get out of the car!

250
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,908
Hey! Out of the car, asshole!

251
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:17,992
Out of the car!

252
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,663
Get out of here!

253
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,330
Go on...

254
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,876
Go!

255
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,298
There a problem, officer?

256
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,426
Come closer.

257
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,266
What is this, man?

258
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,185
You really a cop?

259
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
Stop.

260
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,528
Unbutton your shirt.

261
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,949
Come on, man.

262
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,077
You like her?

263
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,750
- I don't need her...
- I said take your shirt off!

264
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,921
Look, I have money in the car.

265
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,257
Take off the fucking shirt, asshole!

266
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,269
Sometimes these girls...

267
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,813
...I don't know,

268
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,067
they like it rough...

269
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,795
Morning.

270
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,311
Alex, open up.

271
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,944
Give me the key.

272
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,953
Alex?

273
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,166
Fuck!

274
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,376
<i>The kid fucking bolted.</i>

275
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,753
He went back to Tijuana.

276
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,148
- <i>We don't know that.</i>
- Well, we gotta get a team...

277
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,216
- Walt...
- The kid's in danger. He went home.

278
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,886
<i>Trust me. Come on, Jack.</i>

279
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,637
Fuck this kid, Walt.

280
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,600
<i>We don't know where he is.
And maybe that's for the best.</i>

281
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,479
<i>Rebollo's toxic, man. He played us.</i>

282
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,232
<i>The fewer reminders of that
staring us in the face, the better.</i>

283
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,194
The Arellanos are gonna kill him.
You know that.

284
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,113
Because of what we put him through.

285
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,115
<i>"We"?</i>

286
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,327
<i>Walt, be smart about this.</i>

287
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,996
The kid's immunity was a long shot.

288
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,832
<i>It's time to move on.</i>

289
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,670
Fuck!

290
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,449
...You slept late.

291
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,683
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah. Feeling good today.

292
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,145
Better watch out.

293
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,565
- Yeah, right.
- What?

294
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,032
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, man.</i>

295
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,034
<i>Heard about Vicente?</i>

296
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,370
Three more spots got hit last night -

297
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,832
He won't be in for long.

298
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,751
How the fuck are they getting all this?

299
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,129
Mmm. Who knows...

300
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,424
<i>He wants some shit handled.
We got work tonight.</i>

301
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,553
Yeah. Okay...

302
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,887
<i>Pick you up at 10:00.</i>

303
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,015
See you then.

304
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,684
Bye.

305
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,608
Rogelio worried?

306
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,279
Things'll settle down...

307
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,533
Bosses come and go.

308
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,370
What you've been doing.

309
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,956
Out at the factories...

310
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,958
With everything going on now...

311
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,961
I'm done with all that.

312
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,380
It's over.

313
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,973
You don't have to worry...

314
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,853
- Allow me.
- Oh!

315
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,647
You look so handsome washing dishes!

316
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,731
Oh, yeah?

317
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,026
- Should do it more often.
- Mmm.

318
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,208
You think I don't know this was you?

319
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,548
This shit with Mayo -

320
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,759
Start thinking you're a boss now?

321
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,510
Isn't personal, man.

322
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,305
You'll always be part of Sinaloa.

323
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,599
Sinaloa is my organization!

324
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,478
Not anymore, man.

325
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,314
Me and Mayo run things now.

326
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,649
Way it has to be.

327
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,743
This shit doesn't work without me -

328
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,415
Forget where you come from?

329
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,296
Take care.

330
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,724
He'll get over it...

331
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,853
The new prison in La Mira, it's nice.

332
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,855
Got ocean views...

333
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,858
He'll be sending you a postcard soon.

334
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,615
Look - you should reach out to Mayo.
See where he's at with new product...

335
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,703
'Shit with my nephew... He hasn't got long.

336
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,873
We'll figure something out.

337
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,093
What's up, man?

338
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,595
Wanna pull up a fucking chair?

339
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,431
You're out too, Neto.

340
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,058
Going with Palma to La Mira.

341
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,481
Already packed up your cell.

342
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,613
Didn't even see it coming.

343
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,992
Fuck...

344
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,496
Gotta act like a boss to be a boss, right?

345
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,082
Heard that somewhere.

346
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,252
Guys see you whispering in my ear

347
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,546
who's it look like's in charge?

348
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,676
Sounds like you got good advice.

349
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,310
Don't fucking touch me.

350
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,231
You'll be thanking me soon.

351
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,275
The prison in La Mira,

352
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,943
it's nice. Ocean views.

353
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,452
I ain't sending a postcard.

354
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,413
Fucking pricks.

355
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,054
Let's go...

356
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,450
- Morning.
- Good morning.

357
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,870
Anything else?

358
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,413
A lottery ticket.

359
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,581
Sure.

360
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,760
Damn.

361
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,472
Hey,
you can't come through here -

362
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,556
Tapia...

363
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,321
Thanks.

364
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,033
That you, Tapia?

365
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,910
Hey.

366
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,831
Was driving by...

367
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,836
Someone found a dead girl.

368
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,005
When our guy showed up,

369
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,757
wasn't one girl, was seven.

370
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,137
Fucker didn't even bury the last one.
Just dumped her here this morning.

371
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,767
This morning? Today?

372
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,850
Yeah...

373
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,438
Ground under her body was still wet.

374
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,193
You're sure - it was this morning?

375
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,030
Oh.

376
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,241
Any idea who did this?

377
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,662
Few of 'em have marks...

378
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,250
Bites and shit... One was strangled.

379
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:19,130
Our Tech says
it could be a couple of different killers,

380
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,133
using the same spot to dump bodies.

381
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,805
It's fucked up.

382
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,985
<i>In the '90s,
the bodies of murdered women</i>

383
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,196
<i>began to appear
in the deserts outside Juárez.</i>

384
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,368
<i>Many of them, drawn to work in factories
that sprang up along the border.</i>

385
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,913
<i>They were parts of a machine.</i>

386
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,958
<i>Feeding a globalized economy.</i>

387
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,462
<i>And they were killed
because they were women.</i>

388
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,380
<i>Hundreds of them.</i>

389
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,718
<i>The femicide epidemic
was ignored by authorities for years.</i>

390
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,097
<i>Until a movement led by women in Juárez</i>

391
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,018
<i>began risking
their own lives to demand answers</i>

392
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,774
<i>and draw attention to the killings,
which continue to this day.</i>

393
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,735
Alex?

394
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,613
<i>Jack, it's me. What's up?</i>

395
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,741
<i>Found Alex Hodoyan.
Figured you'd wanna know.</i>

396
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,286
Great, where is he? I'll go pick him up.

397
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,495
<i>No, Walt.</i>

398
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,623
<i>Baja State cops found his body.</i>

399
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,834
<i>Hanging from an overpass.</i>

400
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,179
<i>The kid didn't last two hours.
There's nothing you could've done.</i>

401
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,776
<i>Walt, you still there?</i>

402
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,825
<i>If you're where I think you are,
you need to get your ass back up north.</i>

403
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,312
<i>Right. Thanks.</i>

404
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,943
Hey. This your handwriting?

405
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,195
DEA liaison to the task force.

406
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,697
Embassy finally called me back...

407
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,990
Want me to call?

408
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,158
I'll do it.

409
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,248
Souvenirs from Mexico!

410
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,460
Gifts!

411
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,840
Souvenirs from Mexico!

412
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,568
<i>Thanks for meeting me.</i>

413
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,560
Surprised you're still in Tijuana.

414
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,855
Just for the day.

415
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:53,028
<i>You are the DEA liaison agent
from General Rebollo's task force?</i>

416
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,905
That's correct.

417
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,744
This is off the record.

418
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,997
I'll just take notes.

419
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,665
I won't use your name.

420
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,712
How long did you work with Rebollo?

421
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,968
I'm not here to talk about Rebollo.

422
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,388
You said your paper
broke the story on him, right?

423
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:27,688
You hear about a dual Mexican-US citizen
being held at the task force for weeks?

424
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,355
No lawyer?

425
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,551
Why didn't
you tell me you were coming?

426
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,578
Got our hands
on one of the Sinaloans -

427
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,618
Fucker talked.

428
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,413
What'd he give up?

429
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,293
Mayo.

430
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:55,466
He's in Mazatlán. At some high-rise...

431
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,509
We fucking got him, Enedina.

432
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,927
What did Benjamín say?

433
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,014
Haven't told him...

434
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,683
Came to you first.

435
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,772
I'll talk to Benjamín...

436
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,153
Get some men, go to Mazatlán...

437
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,073
Kill that fucker.

438
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,362
The torture...

439
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,382
did it work?

440
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,635
It always works, to a point.

441
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,515
When did it stop?

442
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,598
Your drinks.

443
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,351
Thanks.

444
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,438
Alex talked
'cause of his brother.

445
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,399
He was trying to save him.

446
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,735
Why'd he think
cooperating would save his brother?

447
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,948
'Cause I told him it would.

448
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,078
Did the information from Hodoyan's torture
lead to any arrests?

449
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,746
No, it did not.

450
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,958
Did anything come out of it?

451
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,127
It got him killed.

452
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,923
You're younger than I figured.

453
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,356
When he was being held without a lawyer,

454
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,691
when he was being tortured,

455
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,527
supervisors in the DEA knew?

456
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,322
Made it pretty clear
that they didn't want to, officially.

457
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,032
But yeah.

458
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,286
They knew what was happening.

459
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,914
We were running out of time.

460
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,420
Doing this, you get lost.

461
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,385
You ever want something
that you couldn't get?

462
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,180
No matter how hard you pushed?

463
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,726
What do you do when that happens?

464
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,145
I don't know.

465
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,316
Learn to stop wanting it.

466
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,159
I won't use your name.

467
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,162
But this could still come back on you.

468
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,418
Agent Breslin, why are you talking to me?

469
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,927
Everyone's talking about Rebollo,

470
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,846
but it's not that simple.

471
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,934
We're not the good guys.

472
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,648
I'm not a good guy.

473
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,869
URGENT CARE

474
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,095
Welcome. Follow me, please.

475
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,575
The doctors will be in to see you shortly.

476
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,221
Heading out?

477
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,473
Yeah...

478
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,018
Everything okay?

479
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,606
You been drinking?

480
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,984
Yeah. I have.

481
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,821
I was wrong.

482
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,326
I couldn't stop it.

483
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,494
I can't...

484
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,667
I thought one man was doing it,
but it's not.

485
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,422
There's more...

486
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,887
You mean the girls? Out by the factories?

487
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,812
Hmm.

488
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,488
I gotta go.

489
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,450
Victor...

490
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,172
<i>What's up, you ready?</i>

491
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Yeah.

492
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,149
- Luis, shall we?
- Good night, boss.

493
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,280
Where does this guy live?

494
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,411
Not much further.

495
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,061
LA VOZ
THE MAFIA RETURNS TO TIJUANA

496
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,604
<i>For the third day in a row,</i>

497
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:10,799
<i>negotiations continued
behind closed doors...</i>

498
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,226
Get down!

499
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,535
Oh, shit!

500
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,955
<i>A round fired
by his men hit the curb</i>

501
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:44,499
<i>and struck David Barron in the left eye.</i>

502
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,003
<i>Turned out
the Arellanos' legendary enforcer</i>

503
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,338
<i>wasn't indestructible after all.</i>

504
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,929
<i>The motive for the attack was obvious
to anyone paying attention.</i>

505
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,935
<i>Over 40 journalists
were murdered in Mexico in the '90s.</i>

506
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,982
<i>Assassinated for telling the truth.</i>

507
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,495
This it?

508
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,504
Yeah...

509
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,735
What're we
really doing out here, man?

510
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,742
How long
you been working for the DEA?

511
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,225
It's not what you think.

512
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,488
If you're gonna do it, then do it.

513
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:52,270
<i>The authorities finally got
an anonymous tip on Amado's location.</i>

514
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,829
It's not my fault!
We tried to revive him - we tried -

515
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,373
He knew the risks!

516
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,502
<i>On July 7th, 1997,</i>

517
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,546
<i>Amado Carillo Fuentes died in Mexico City.</i>

518
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:23,259
<i>His heart gave out while undergoing
plastic surgery to alter his appearance.</i>

519
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,690
<i>Amado's time had run out.</i>

520
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,663
Welcome to Chile...

521
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:00,296
<i>US officials expect
a major power struggle among drug cartels</i>

522
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,092
<i>now that Mexico's
number-one drug kingpin is dead.</i>

523
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:08,138
<i>Carrillo Fuentes,
known as the Lord of the Skies, has died.</i>

524
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,266
<i>His body was identified
by authorities at a clinic in Mexico City...</i>

525
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,561
<i>When asked
about Carillo Fuentes,</i>

526
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,565
<i>Carlos Hank Gonzaléz
said he had no comment.</i>

527
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,953
He out of surgery?

528
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,289
Who knows -

529
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,127
Call me if anything changes.

530
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,837
I'll be at the office...

531
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,298
Andrea - what for?

532
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,258
He'd want this in the paper tomorrow.

533
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,055
<i>Carlos Hank Gonzaléz
died in 2001</i>

534
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,807
<i>surrounded by family and friends.</i>

535
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:57,145
<i>Over 2,000 people attended his funeral.</i>

536
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,024
<i>A statue of him
still stands outside Mexico City.</i>

537
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:06,529
<i>In 1998, American law enforcement
launched an investigation</i>

538
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:10,366
<i>tying Hank
to drug cartels and money laundering.</i>

539
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,161
<i>Operation White Tiger.</i>

540
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,080
<i>When word got out,</i>

541
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:20,085
<i>Hank's allies on both sides of the border
had the investigation shut down.</i>

542
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,630
<i>Janet Reno ended up
issuing him an apology.</i>

543
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,967
<i>Sometimes the truth isn't enough.</i>

544
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,844
<i>But if you let that stop you...</i>

545
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,223
<i>I think you aren't doing your job.</i>

546
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,236
Song's about meth...

547
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,654
The lyrics.

548
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:49,989
Crazy, right?

549
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,366
We should get some.

550
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,700
Totally.

551
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,506
Stay cool.

552
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,010
Check this out...

553
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,887
I brought the "badge."

554
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,058
Turn it down.

555
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,103
Problem, officer? All good?

556
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,899
We're in town on, like, an investigation...

557
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,252
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MEXICO

558
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,735
Working hard, man...

559
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,906
Get out of the car.

560
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,451
Get out of the car!

561
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,329
Guess I'm getting out.

562
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,417
- Relax, bro.
- Hands on the car.

563
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,835
I told you we're here working...

564
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,254
Hey, relax bro.

565
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,672
Chill out...

566
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,678
Nice boots there.

567
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,513
Shut up. Head down...

568
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,183
Fuck you, asshole!

569
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,478
Drop it, asshole! Drop it!

570
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,229
Fuck you!

571
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,740
Ramón...

572
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,286
Fuck, man...

573
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:31,925
Hello?

574
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,052
<i>Enedina. Hey...</i>

575
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,806
Heard your family's looking for me...

576
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,046
<i>Not for much longer...</i>

577
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,770
We have nothing to discuss, Mayo.

578
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,855
<i>Not sure that's true...</i>

579
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,399
Your brother, Ramón...

580
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,278
ran into some trouble down here.

581
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,491
<i>I wouldn't wait up for him...</i>

582
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,967
Hey, Enedina...

583
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,202
What happened?

584
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,225
<i>Following
the news on Amado?</i>

585
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,432
They're doing some horseshit
with the body.

586
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,352
Corpse IDed by the Mex Feds
up and vanished.

587
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,606
The two surgeons
who operated on him turned up dead.

588
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,817
In a couple of oil drums outside Jalisco.

589
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,403
Payback?

590
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,904
Who the fuck knows?

591
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,531
Mexico.

592
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,493
The war on drugs.

593
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,706
Are you sure the drugs are winning?

594
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,001
Yeah.

595
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,378
Yeah, might be.

596
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,970
Got your mind set on transferring?

597
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,513
Yeah.

598
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,643
Think El Paso's done with me.

599
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,187
So, what's your next move?

600
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:55,735
Think I'm gonna take some time,
try and figure some of my own bullshit.

601
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,739
I have to sooner or later.

602
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,661
I hear Chicago
can always use a good agent.

603
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,665
You talk to Dani lately?

604
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,045
I fucked that up pretty good.

605
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,256
Not sure
she'd give me the chance to fix it.

606
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,301
Well, all you can do is be honest.

607
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,011
With her.

608
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,265
Yourself.

609
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:30,937
Yeah.

610
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,082
<i>I heard about Ramón...</i>

611
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,695
How'd you do it?

612
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,539
Had my guys dress like cops.

613
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,708
Hit him on the highway.

614
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,336
Was my idea. Puerto Vallarta...

615
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,674
Ahead of its time.

616
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,097
They with you?

617
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,807
My guys.

618
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,564
Listen, Chapo...

619
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,945
That piece of border we been looking for...

620
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,448
Think I found it...

621
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:26,992
Juárez.

622
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,538
Amado's gone.

623
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:35,668
Time we made a move.

624
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,131
Heard his brother's
gonna try to hold on to it.

625
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,093
Don't see Vicente fitting in.

626
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:46,888
Shit's strange...

627
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,515
Amado. Way it went down...

628
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,644
He's gone, not coming back.

629
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,027
The future, it's ours. Belongs to Sinaloa.

630
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,039
Might be time to rethink
your living arrangement.

631
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,919
Brother, I need you back home.

632
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,021
Look, I don't know
how much of this you wanna hear.

633
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,601
I wasn't happy with who I was.

634
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,148
Figured anyone that was close to me
would see that too.

635
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,691
Sooner or later.

636
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,237
So I went looking for something.

637
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,614
Something that'd make me...

638
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,742
I don't know, worthy.

639
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,828
And the whole time, I'm just...

640
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,626
making shit worse and hurting more people.

641
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,713
Thank you.

642
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,134
There is no fixing it.

643
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,471
That's what I finally figured out.

644
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,852
I don't know, look, I'm sorry.

645
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,812
I know this is a lot to hit you with, but...

646
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,274
That's why we go to the meetings, man.

647
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,696
You get older, doesn't mean you get wiser.

648
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,949
You know, I got two marriages.

649
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,035
Daughter won't talk to me.

650
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,330
Some grandkids I never met.

651
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,963
Believe me when I tell you, man,
shit isn't easy.

652
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,969
I mean, I've been out four years, okay?

653
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,265
Still trying to make...
I'm still trying to make things right.

654
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,226
Yeah.

655
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,521
I know one thing.

656
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:05,651
Seventy grand never hurts.

657
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,322
No, it does not.

658

Drive here?

Yeah, truck's in the back.

663
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:35,765
- Thanks.
