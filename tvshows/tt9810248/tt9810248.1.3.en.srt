We lost one of our guys.

171
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:57,564
Emotions run high.

172
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:00,436
Please.

173
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:11,795
I just got off the phone
with your coach, Angelo.

174
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:16,321
Before that, I spoke
to your history teacher.

175
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,106
Both full respect,

176
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,891
for you
and who you are.

177
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,200
I --

178
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,941
I-I--

179
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,333
I didn't do anything.
I didn't -- I didn't --

180
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,074
I didn't
do anything.

181
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:33,034
I've looked in the eyes
of some very bad people.

182
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,430
And I feel like I can see
a man's soul in his eyes.

183
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:43,740
I look at you,

184
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:47,527
I see a good kid
who's been shaken up

185
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,529
and needs a little help
settling down again.

186
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,664
Moses, do you know what

187
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:58,189
a memorandum
of cooperation is?

188
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,976
It's an agreed version
of the truth.

189
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:04,239
We agree on the truth.

190
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:07,111
We cooperate
with each other.

191
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,765
You get to go home
where you belong.

192
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,205
So I wrote up
what we said in the car.

193
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:22,823
"I knew they were police
and my gut said run,

194
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,129
so I ran."

195
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,043
That fair?

196
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,919
"The cop chasing me had me
down a dead-end street."

197
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,357
Blackstone
or South Blackstone?

198
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,235
Blackstone.

199
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,149
Thank you.

200
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,589
Um...

201
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,807
"I had to get away."

202
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,333
"I made a move
toward the cop"?

203
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,248
"I ran toward the cop"?
- I didn't -- that.

204
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,815
I didn't do that.
I didn't intend for that.

205
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:02,993
Maybe, maybe we do a little
lawyer language here.

206
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,386
Sometimes easier.

207
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:07,432
So that would be...

208
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:13,395
"Pursuant to my attempt
to escape,

209
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,702
there was physical contact...

210
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:23,405
...between myself
and the police officer,

211
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,363
as a consequence of which...

212
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:28,497
...he hit his head."

213
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,762
That didn't happen.
It didn't --

214
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,155
I didn't intend
for that to happen

215
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:35,460
because he was running
and I was trying

216
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:36,897
to run at the side

217
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,594

219
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,380
So, so, so,

220
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,992
so what if I don't want
to do this memorandum?

don't cooperate?

336
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,018
- Jack.
- A big murder

337

five minutes
before you retire?

338
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,672
I don't think so.
- Who gets it, Jack?

339
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:35,804
- Not you.
- Yes, but who?

340
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,458
- Danny Pascoe.
- Danny Pascoe --

341
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:40,069
conveyor belt lawyer.

342

You can't have it.

344
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,032
Then it's over.

345
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:47,990
What?

346
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,861
If you won't let me
represent Moses Johnson

347
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:53,126
as a public defender,
you give me no choice.

348

What are you
talking about?

349
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,867
I'm resigning, Jack,

350
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,087
and I'm going to represent
him privately.

351
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,959
This is crazy.

352
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,962
Sometimes community
is the same as family,

with Moses.

354
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,966
And, when it's family,
you don't say no.

You step in.

So, there's a reporter here,
third row.

371
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,309
We have Mr. Sessions, right?

372
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,571
Peter Sessions.

00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,182
Yeah.

379
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:04,414
Women have always been judged
in this way.

380
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:07,287
Jeannette Rankin ran
for Congress in 1916

381
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:10,507
and they said that her gowns
were too "severe."

382
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,640
Hillary Clinton --
they said that she was

383
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,816
"confused about her gender"

384
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:17,471
because her pantsuits
were too baggy.

385
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,560
After all of this time,

386
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,083
they are still more comfortable

387
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:24,478
with women carrying babies
than ballots.

388
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,610
- Come on, now.
- And here I come,

389
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:29,135
shoeless, barefoot me,

390
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:33,008
and he is more concerned
about what is not on my feet

391
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,792
than what is coming
out of my mouth.

392
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,707
Say that.

393
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,361
So we have to ask ourselves,

394
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:42,235
what is -- is hiding
underneath the cheap headline?

395
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,716
I know.

396
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,763
Everywoman
in this room knows.
Right.

397
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,983
- Right.
- It's fear.

398
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:56,162
It's fear because I am
demanding accountability

399
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,164
from the
Chicago Police Department.

400
00:17:58,294 --> 00:17:59,556
- Say that!
- Right!

401
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,950
Fear that I want to end policing

402
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,693
that's just personal security
for rich white folks.

403
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:08,826
- Tell 'em, tell 'em.
- Fear that I am demanding an end

404
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:12,308
to the executions of Black
and brown children.

405
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,789
Fear I want to build a movement.

406
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,313
I want to build a future
where Black and brown children

407
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:18,967
can bechildren

408
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,491
and where they are safe
and where they can thrive.

409
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:25,495
And Mr. Sessions here is afraid
because, in that future,

410
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,889
he has to lose
his first place in line.

411
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,326
It ain't about my shoes!

412
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:32,502
It ain't
about my shoes.

413
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,200
Don't get distracted!

414
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,027
It's about my ideas.

415

- Alright now. Alright now.
- Tell 'em.

416
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,335
- Tell it. Tell it.
- Tell it.

417
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,684
That's what
I'm talking about.

418

Wonderful, baby.
That was brilliant.

419

Franklin,

I'm his lawyer, only they
don't want me to be.

428
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,226

429
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:01,401
I wanted to talk
to you about it.

430
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:02,576
- No.
- No, no, baby.

431
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,578
I-I wanted --
- No, no, no.

432
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:07,407
We agreed.

433
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,451
No, no, no.

434
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:09,713
We agreed.

435
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,193
I want Moses Johnson

to have the best
representation possible.

437
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:15,502
I want that.

438
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,373
But you, you --
you promised me.

439
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,419
You looked me in my eyes

"After 17 years at home,

at home, now,
