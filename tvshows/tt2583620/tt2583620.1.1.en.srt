MAN: <i>It's crazy times,

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,170
So one side is saying,

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,174
"Hey, people are killing
each other with machine guns.

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,723
Maybe normal civilians
shouldn't have machine guns,

5
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:24,606
and only soldiers who are
in an active ground war."

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,395
And then the other side is saying,

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,902
"Well, you can't take away machine guns
because of the Second Amendment.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,443
The Second Amendment,
you can't regulate guns

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,440
because of the Second Amendment."

00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,444
So, to be clear, your argument is

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,322
that guns should have
no regulations on them

12
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,365
because of the Second Amendment,

13
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,663

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,209
"A well regulated."

15
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,918
That's literally how it starts!

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,418
And the whole amendment has 27 words,

17
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,888
and three of them are "a," "well,"

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,223
and "regulated."

19
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,764
That's 11.1%, folks.

22
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,314
11.1% isn't that much."

23
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,858
But imagine you're on a plane,

24
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,114
and halfway through your journey,
the pilot comes on

25
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,493

SAMIR: <i>So you know how, in school,
rumors would get started,</i>

466
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,290
and it didn't even matter
if they were true or not,

467
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,007
it would just become legend?

468
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,502
You know what I'm talking about?

469
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,004
Well, unless <i>The Times</i>

470
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,850
<i>and a jury of his peers
were being huge gossips...</i>

471
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,890
<i>- [LAUGHTER]
- ...that rumor about...</i>

472
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,098
- ...Coach Keller...
- [LAUGHTER]

473
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,525
...being a pervert who preyed on kids?

474
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,986
That rumor was true.

475
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,776
<i>That one did happen.</i>

476
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,412
You know, I've been
feeling like my comedy

477
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,954
could really make a difference, like,
the more I open up on stage,

478
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,748
the... the more I change the world.

479
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,089
Is that completely
narcissistic and delusional?

480
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,335
Uh, yes, but I don't mind it.
I like this new you.

481
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,175
So do I.

482
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:14,478
Hey, um, do you remember
that guy we ran into

483
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,444
who you defended, and then later
you found out he totally

484
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,234
- did do all those horrible things?
- I can't believe I said that.

485
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,319
No, no, no, it's good that you told me.

486
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,192
What did you say
the guy's name was again?

487
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,036
- I can't tell you that.
- Yes, you can.

488
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,700
David says a good defense attorney

489
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,113
- never lets her opinions seep into...
- Oh, great, David.

490
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,250
Really?

491
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,995
I'm so sorry I mentioned
my friend's name in passing.

492
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,276
No, no, no, keep going.
There's gonna be a great story.

493
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,542
I've been starved for some
of that David Kandel wisdom.

494
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,962
And I've been starved for some of that
Samir Wassan jealous prick routine.

495
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,931
Jealous prick? Okay. Routine? Wow.

496
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,800
Why, what would you call it?

497
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,928
What would I call a law professor

498
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,847
who's always having romantic dinners
with his former student,

499
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,190
- my girlfriend?
- They are not romantic.

500
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,856
David is my friend, and my mentor...

501
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,980
Oh, mentor. Okay.
Yeah, why was I worried?

502
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,529
There's no way a mentor would try
and fuck an attractive student.

503
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,405
Screw you, Samir.

504
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,242
"Screw you." That's really good.
Are you taking argument classes?

505
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,115
'Cause that's still some beginner shit.

506
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,124
Maybe move up to "Go fuck yourself."

507
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,168
Rena?

508
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,498
Great.

509
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,099
So I met a murderer today.

510
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,234
I did.

511
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,519
I actually met a murderer.

512
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:44,443
I was talking to this
tattooed guy on the bus,

513
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,989
and he just straight-up told me
that he murdered someone.

514
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,075
You know, I guess it makes sense,
'cause if I was a murderer,

515
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,665
I would want to tell people,
too, you know?

516
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,622
Pride in what you do is important.

517
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,332
Although, it seems like
resisting the urge to tell people

518
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,881
might be an important life skill
for a murderer.

519
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,587
[MAN COUGHING]

Buck.

522
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,683

I've got something you guys might like.

Do you guys have
a girlfriend who's got, like,

527
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,130
a creepy older "mentor"?

528
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,894
You know, who's, like, just her friend,

529
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,772
and not trying to sleep with her at all.

530
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,395
Just some older, white,
pretentious motherfucker.

531
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,193
With his fucking little beard,
and he knows everything.

This guy knows everything.

533
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,993
And then you get in trouble.

534
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,206
You get called a jealous boyfriend

535
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,164
for trying to save her
from getting MeToo'd

536
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,287

Wow.

Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that.

00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,099
Must be so exciting for you
to know someone on that list.

Don't make me hurt you, Samir.

Hilarious as always, Samir.

Hey, what would your, uh, mentor David
have thought of that set?

00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,755
What are you talking about?

550
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,252
- Wait, where are you going?
- I have to get to my shift.

551
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,679
What shift?

552
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,435
- Rena, what's wrong?
- I'm late. You gonna get me fired?

553
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,306
Okay.
Why would they have you come in now?

554
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,684
And they're not gonna fire
their best lawyer for being slightly late.

555
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,562
Lawyer? Are you kidding me?

556
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,064
Wait, wait, wait, you're...
you're not a lawyer?

557
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,732
Screw you.

She doesn't have a career
without fucking David Kandel.

560
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,212
Rena, I screwed something up.

561
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,867
You have screwed many things up,
Samir, but I am late right now.

00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,809
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, listen. I changed something.

- Okay? You were supposed to...
- Supposed to what?

564
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,519
Keep waiting patiently for you
to get your career together?

565
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,692
No.

566
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,359
Wait, where's your red coat?
The one we got in Paris?

567
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,818
- What are you talking about?
- Paris. When we went to Paris. The...

568
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,865
We never went to Paris
'cause we couldn't afford it.

00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,658
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

- Hey, hey, hey.
- I swear to God,

- You okay, honey?
- I'm fine.

573
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,502
She's fine. It's okay, it's okay.

574
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,213
Okay, hey, hey, that was the trip
that saved our relationship.

00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,248
- But we didn't go on it...
- Saved our...?

Listen, we couldn't go because
you couldn't afford it,

00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,573
- but now I can afford it, so...
- You're a dick, Samir.

- Okay, you don't understand...
- No, you don't understand.

affect me or anybody else.

Hey. I'm sorry. Hey.
Remember when you gave me that advice,

583
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,135
when you told me that I
could be strong on stage?

584
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,821
That I could play to my strengths?

585
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,320
You said that I need to let go of stuff?

586
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,869
So I did that. I did that for us.
I did that, I did that for you.

587
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,079
You said it was okay to punch.

gonna show up in your act?

Listen to me. Listen to me.

00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,882
I have this power, okay?
I have this superpower.

593
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,929
I do. The reason you're doing
this right now...

594
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,783
The reason I'm doing this
right now, Samir,

595
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,139
is that you are a selfish asshole.

Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

Maybe this is how it goes.

if you go on a murder rampage,

can you try not to do it
while I'm here, please?

So, Candy Gower
from <i>The Gower Hour</i>

624
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,231
is coming to the late set tonight.

625
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,898
- Okay.
- And she is here for you two.

628
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,964
but <i>The Gower Hour</i> needs
a new cast member,

629
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,569
and it's pretty much narrowed
down to two up-and-coming comics

Uh, we work at Wellspring Capital.

654

So you're, what, like, hedge fund guys?

655
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,546
Yeah, actually,
we invest in hedge funds.

did I get that right?

the details right here.

I have been the MVP up

But somehow, suddenly,
you get funny.

How does that happen, huh?
How the hell you pull that off?

Didi, we really don't have to do this

- What are you talking about?
- I don't want it.

- You can have it. I don't want it.
- No. No, that is some...

You've been fucking killing it.

And I'm honestly kind of embarrassed

691
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,149
that I didn't see how funny
you were from the start.

But you can't stop now.

00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:40,747
Please keep it going
for the incredible Didi Scott, everyone.

778
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,509
Karen Conroy, she broke my heart.

779
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,681
Lizzy Appleman, what a bitch!

780
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,894
Mary Beth Bryce!

781
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,343
She didn't even know I was alive!

782
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,896
Bye-bye! Mrs. Kern from Westlake High.

783
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,769
B-plus. You're gone!

784
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,645
Sarah Vollman.

785
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,024
Oh, my parents' friends' kid, Neel.

786
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,867
I don't like how he looks at me.

787
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,112
Parson twins! Fuck them both!

788
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,909
Um, Yuri Bhattacharya.

789
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,327
Yuri Bhattacharya's mom.

790
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,243
Let's go for it!
Yuri Bhattacharya's fucking dog!

791
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,914
Ah, Serena Tam!

792
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,881
She wouldn't share her lunch...
Fuck you, bitch!

793
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,588
Uh, um, Billy Chung!

794
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,755
From college.

795
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,128
Fuck Billy Chung!

796
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,255
Goodbye! Uh...

797
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,053
You know what? Dr. Baldwin, my dentist?

798
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,218
Fuck him! Fuck root canals!

799
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,095
[LAUGHTER]

800
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,474
Thank you! I like that.

801
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:44,602
Uh... Skip Torrance, Jana Torrance!

802
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,145
All the Torrances!

803
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,863
WOMAN: Boo!

804
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,107
"Boo"?

805
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,859
WOMAN: Boo!

806
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,370
Really? Read the fucking room.

807
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,907
What are you doing here?

808
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,830
You shouldn't be here.

809
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,566
You have something to say to me
in the middle of my act?

810
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,797
Your "act"?

811
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,962
I hear this kid kills hecklers.

812
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,585
This is gonna be good.

813
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,504
This is your act.

814
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,798
I found it.

815
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,677
It's just names, Samir.

816
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,140
I don't even know who these people are.

817
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,980
People who wronged you,
people you don't like.

818
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,602
Your act is just you being
superior to other people.

819
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,065
Taking them down.

820
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:31,110
Go ahead.
Use me. Use me for fuel.

821
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,650
Burn me up so you can get
where you always wanted to go.

822
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:34,786
Do it.

823
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,536
What's stopping you?

824
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,213
Okay.
You want to hear the whole story?

825
00:48:56,058 --> 00:49:00,769
You're right, I have been selfish.
You said it and I heard it.

826
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,604
I don't know if anybody else
could've gotten me to hear that,

827
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,315
but you sure know how
to get me to hear things.

828
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,485
But I don't want to talk to you
about that tonight,

829
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,361
ladies and gentlemen.

830
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:16,076
Tonight, I want to talk to you about
someone I've known a very long time.

831
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,988
Clever, loveable in a lot of ways,

832
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,997
someone you'd think
would be a good person

833
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,367
with a lot to offer the world.

834
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,044
Ladies and gentlemen,

835
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:30,633
tonight I want to talk to you about...

836
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,049
...myself.

837
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,764
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

838
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,391
I'm a comedian.

839
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,435
Which is a job like any other.

840
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:50,478
Except instead of climbing
into the gears of an enormous machine

841
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,447
to chase a hat,
like I assume all of you do,

842
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:57,488
I come up here and I try
and make people laugh.

843
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,699
Why? Because I want to spread joy?

844
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,914
Because I want the world
to be a better place?

845
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:08,379
Nope! It's because I'm a garbage can
who needs lots of money and validation

846
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,247
emptied right into me!

847
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:14,171
I want people to come up to me
on the street and ask for selfies!

848
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,302
I don't even care if they know who I am.

849
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,343
I just want them to think
I'm somebody!

850
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:23,181
And I want to have it so much
that I want to be sick of it.

851
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,474
I want them to come up to me
and I want to be like,

852
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:29,850
"Don't you know I'm just a garbage can
who wants to live my own life?"

853
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,935
Why do I want that?

854
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,690
I don't know.

855
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,406
But it doesn't matter.

856
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,495
I am a bully.

857
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,950
People are just material to me.

858
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,452
I throw them away.

859
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:53,794
I'm a country with one export
and there's really only one thing

860
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,339
left for me to give!

861
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,383
Ladies and gentlemen,

862
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,932
I've been Samir Wassan!

863
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,828
- Hey.
- Hey, dude.

864
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,172
- You have fun?
- Yeah, it was actually

865
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,257
- really funny.
- Glad you liked it.

866
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,799
Oh, look.
Didi Scott's right there.

867
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,929
- You want to say hi?
- No, I'm fine.

868
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,515
You sure? Well, I'm gonna.

869
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,765
Hey. You were hilarious.

870
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,604
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

871
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,065
Thank you. [CLICKS TONGUE]

872
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,649
Something to take the pain away.

873
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,777
Coming right up, Deeds.

874
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,574
Well, holy shit.

875
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,541
JC Wheeler.

876
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,413
- In the fleshy flesh.
- [CHUCKLES]

877
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,540
I saw your set.

878
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:22,129
Wow. If...
If you had any notes...

879
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,891
NARRATOR: Samir Wassan
learned the hard way

880
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,477
that sometimes,
getting everything you want

881
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,980
means losing everything you love.

882
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,183
And after finally finding
himself on the verge

883
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,060
of becoming somebody,

884
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:39,483
he chose instead to once again

885
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,527
be a nobody.

886
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,867
In the end, Samir's final encore

887
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,862
is a show you can only buy a ticket to...

888
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,455
...in The Twilight Zone.

889
00:52:50,305 --> 00:53:50,899
