5
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:30,321
That's impossible.

6
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,095
Test 405-E is a total failure.

7
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,282
The object remains sealed.

8
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,926
Commencing Test 406-A.

00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,773
Using highly corrosive acid.

10
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,860
We will find a way to open it.

14
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:11,821
Focus on your breathing.

15
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:13,332
Relax.

16
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,644
Just let the inspiration flow
out of you.

17
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,234
Did it work?

18
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:26,075
I mean, I don't want to speak
for the rest of the group,

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,033
but I feel
the exact same.

20
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:31,034
So... 0 for 9, then.

21
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,012
Good thing it's a big board.

22
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,474
What's next?

23
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:37,106
Perhaps muses cannot choose
whom they inspire.

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,783
Or I am terrible
at being one.

25
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:40,098
Either way,
we should stop.

26
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:41,394
This is not working.

27
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,192
When we find a way
to activate your powers...

28
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,441
If.When.

29
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:45,785
You will inspire us
to have something

30
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,141
that we've never had in
our fight against Malivore.

31
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:50,664
An advantage.

32
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:52,057
That's the spirit.

33
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,406
Now what's next?

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,712
Uh...

35
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:56,496
- Mind meld.
- Wow.

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,759
Let me guess who came up
with that thunderbolt.

37
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:03,025
As the only person who's
actually been inspired by Cleo,

38
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:04,686
quit trying to force it.

39
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:07,032
Just be natural.

40
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,512
Ain't nothing natural
about that.

41
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:13,252
It worked.

42
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:15,254
I know how we defeat Malivore.

43
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:17,082
We summon a time travel monster

44
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,910
to send us back in time

45
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:20,963
and stop him from being born.

46
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,872
Where is Lizzie with the zinger
when you need her?

47
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:27,324
She had a far greater duty
this morning.

48
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,763
And I quote, she had
"a fashion emergency."

49
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,531
Yeah, that's been going on
since the day we met, so...

50
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:32,836
You know what?

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,491
I think Jed's right.

52
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:35,903
Yeah?

53
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:37,537
Not about the time travel.

54
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,731
Maybe we're going about this
all wrong.

55
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:41,411
Instead of you trying
to inspire us,

56
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,370
maybe you just need to focus
on what inspires you,

57
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:46,754
like, uh, a song
or a work of art.

58
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,267
Or a special someone.

59
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:51,073
Great.

60
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,639
If Kaleb's game is the
answer to our problems,

61
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:54,170
then we're doomed.

62
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,634
Whoa. Something just happened.

63
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:01,213
Anyone have any brilliant ideas?

64
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,437
Yeah.
Not you, Jed.

65
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,175
Take that as a yes, Hope.

66
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,090
More like a maybe.
I just need to do some research

67
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:09,482
before I share with the group.

68
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,918
But I can assure you,
it's completely safe

69
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,007
and I won't even have
to leave school.

70
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,796
Sweet. I love research.

71
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:17,882
At least I potentially inspired
one person.

72
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:20,102
Oh, make that two.

73
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,060
I believe our monster problem's
connected to the artifact,

74
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:24,584
which we know was
in Triad's possession.

75
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,064
So maybe there's a clue

76
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:28,458
in their records,
if they still exist,

77
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,591
which would be at
their old headquarters.

78
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:32,592
Naturally.

79
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,203
It's all so clear now.

80
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:35,769
Thank you, Cleo.

81
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:38,337
Do not thank me
until you find what you seek.

82
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,991
I would like to accompany you.

83
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,297
And I'd like to accompany you.

84
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,298
You.

85
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,777
Um, because...

86
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,475
my-my skill set
might come in handy

87
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,129
if the mission goes sideways.

88
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:48,963
The more the merrier.

89
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,777
Let's go.

90
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:55,093
You mind sharing

91
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,660
your actual plan with me?

92
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,575
The prison world is bound
to The Necromancer.

93
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:01,186
So what if we take a page
out of Kai Parker's playbook?

94
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,883
Uh, that dude had
a lot of plays.

95
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,581
Could you be
a little more specific?

96
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,496
Well, if we sever
The Necromancer's ties to it,

97
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,367
the prison world
will collapse.

98
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:11,631
And destroys everything inside
of it, including Malivore.

99
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,155
Got to admit,
it's pretty brilliant.

100
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,634
Thank you. Can't take
all the credit.

101
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:17,463
Now all we need to do

102
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:20,074
is find our necrotic friend
and make him an offer.

103
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,641
His blood and the duplicate
ascendant we need

104
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,382
for the severing spell.

105
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:26,433
And in exchange, I will free him
from the prison world.

106
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,649
I take it back.
That's a terrible idea.

107
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,303
Don't worry,
I'm gonna screw him over.

108
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,566
I just need to
figure out how.

109
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,613
I thought you told Dr. Saltzman
this was gonna be risk-free. It is.

110
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:38,615
Hence the chalk.

111
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,443
Astral projection.

112
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,749
The Necromancer can see
different planes of existence,

113
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,968
so he should be able to see

114
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:45,274
but not touch, maim,
or kill you.

115
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,014
Like I said, safe. In that case,

116
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:48,277
I'm coming with you.Sorry.

117
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:49,495
Not enough chalk.

118
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,931
You just said it's safe.

119
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,803
Besides, look at my résumé.

120
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:55,414
I'm the only one here who's beat
The Necromancer in negotiation.

121
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,416
Remember what the banshee said.Yeah.

122
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,722
But we said screw fate,
remember?

123
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,152
This is our chance
to actually do it.

124
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:02,943
I, for one, can't think
of anything more romantic

125
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:03,988
than strolling hand in hand

126
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:06,259
through a postapocalyptic
hellscape.

127
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,479
Maybe this wasn't
the best plan.

128
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:18,568
Superheroes are supposed
to save people,

129
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,352
not kidnap them.

130
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,789
I should probably get
Dr. Saltzman down here.

131
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:24,878
Though he'll ask
why we're

132
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,315
keeping Finch out here
in the barn

133
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,533
of the family
you're staying with.

134
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:29,361
Wait, you haven't told him yet?

135
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,884
Well, I was worried
if I told him

136
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:32,495
I didn't compel
your memories away,

137
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,324
our days of superhero team-up
would be over.

138
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,108
Okay, look, I need you.

139
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,371
Just put on your secret
identity, all right?

140
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,678
Go to school and act normal

141
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:44,028
while I deal with this.

142
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:46,426
The Blur and E-man got
to take a day off.

143
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:49,555
Fine.

144
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,340
I will sign off
on laying low,

145
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:53,733
but not the superhero names. What?

146
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:55,866
Um, um, E...

147
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,259
money?
Hmm.

148
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,435
E-commerce?

149
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,132
Right?

150
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:03,361
I'll think of some better
ones in geometry class.

151
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,321
Invisique saeclum.

152
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:11,621
Lizzie. How...

153
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,275
How long have you... Long enough to know

154
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:16,021
that you've been
playing dress-up with a muggle.

155
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,550
Hello?

156
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:31,745
I see it's business
as usual around here.

157
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:52,792
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, it's me.

158
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:55,142
Jo, Jo, look. It's me.

159
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,405
Wade.

160
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:58,320
Where is everyone?

161
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:00,409
And what are you doing?
Why are you dressed for battle?

162
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:03,673
Well, Dr. S gave us
a three-day weekend.

163
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,501
But I stayed behind
to defend the school

164
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:08,025
in case the big M sends
another monster.

165
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,244
What are you doing here?

166
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,421
I thought you were Eat, Pray,
Loving with the townies now.

167
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:14,640
I was just looking
for Lizzie.

168
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,686
Things aren't exactly
panning out at my new school,

169
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,122
and I kind of need some advice.

170
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:19,428
Well, she left.

171
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,255
I don't know where she went,

172
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:23,997
but being the defender of
the school takes many forms.

173
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,349
I'm a great listener
and my WIS score is 18.

174
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,786
Why do you have this?

175
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,702
And can I borrow it? Knock yourself out.

176
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,530
I was just using it
as a stand-in

177
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,749
for my wizard's focus crystal.

178
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,234
Hey, you don't LARP, do you?

179
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,015
I do not, but thank you.

180
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,413
I think that this is
exactly what I need.

181
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,457
Just give me
a chance to explain.

182
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,589
I didn't want to lie
to your dad,

183
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:53,418
but the only other choice
was wiping Ethan's mind.

184
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:54,898
Okay, you can stop.

185
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:56,421
I'm not here to bust up
your bromance.

186
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,423
The truth is,
I need your help.

187
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,469
Turns out Josie has
a serious crush

188
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:02,475
on this she-wolf.

189
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,049
You should probably
just be happy for her.

190
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,480
That would be premature.

191
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:16,001
Because Finch has obviously
already activated her curse.

192
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:18,835
So she's killed someone.

193
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,532
Maybe it was an accident?

194
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,055
Or maybe...

195
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,801
I didn't kill anyone.

196
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:27,496
And I chain myself up
every full moon so I don't.You must have.

197
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,889
It's half the requirement
to become a werewolf.

198
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,630
The other half is genetic,

199
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:34,807
so, like,
being able to do this...

200
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,027
which means
that your parents

201
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,243
or grandparents
were wolves, too.

202
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:42,056
I always thought
I was the only one.

203
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,251
I mean,
how do you even know that?

204
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:47,262
And how did you make yourself
invisible last night?

205
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,923
Post tenebras spero lucem.

206
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,527
I'm a witch.

207
00:08:58,611 --> 00:08:59,963
But I like to think
of myself

208
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:02,966
as Josie's sister,
first and foremost.

209
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,663
At least I know where Jo's
damage comes from now.

210
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,840
Okay, my sister has terrible
taste in women as it is.

211
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:09,494
But there's no way
that I'm letting her near

212
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:10,887
a cold-blooded killer.

213
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:12,410
Whoa.

214
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:14,238
Easy, Lizzie.
We don't know that yet.

215
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:15,544
I didn't kill anyone.

216
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,725
Well, I'm gonna need you
to prove it.

217
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,071
We both want the same thing.

218
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:24,074
If you help us, we will
not only grant your freedom,

219
00:09:24,158 --> 00:09:26,337
but you will also get
the satisfaction of knowing

220
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:27,512
that you were
directly responsible

221
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,296
for Malivore's destruction.

222
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,690
How generous of you, Tribrid.

223
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:34,040
But why should I believe
that you,

224
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,000
my second most detestable enemy,

225
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:38,523
would keep your end
of the bargain?

226
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:41,091
Because seeing is believing.

227
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:44,355
If you sever your ties, then
the world will become unstable.

228
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,488
Holes will start
to open up.

229
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:49,186
Doors... all you have to do is
walk through one.

230
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,101
You can be in control
of your own fate.

231
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,755
Think he'll go for it, Landon?

232
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,713
I am not Landon.

233
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:58,935
I am the dictator
of departed souls.

234
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,719
The monarch
of the macabre.

235
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:03,417
The almighty...

236
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,507
Knock it off.

237
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,552
I mean,
he's pretty unpredictable.

238
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,119
You and Malivore
are literally

239
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:10,729
the only two things
he's afraid of.

240
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:12,078
So if he's been on the run
from the mud man,

241
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,253
you have even more leverage.

242
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:14,777
That's a ringing endorsement.

243
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,561
Come on, what's the worst
that could happen?

244
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,084
I mean, if he says no,
we just give him the finger

245
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:19,477
and head back to our world.

246
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,783
He can have this one
if he wants it.

247
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,001
So, you know,
just project confidence.

248
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,568
Head up,
shoulders back.

249
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:26,317
He won't stand a chance.

250
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,629
There goes our leverage.

251
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:43,632
Looks like The Necromancer
already found a way out.

252
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,812
I don't think he made it.

253
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,862
You sure this is him?

254
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:00,903
I'd know that terrible
fashion sense anywhere.

255
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:03,739
Wow. Something actually
killed The Necromancer.

256
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:06,524
Guess this mission's
kind of a bust.

257
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,657
Remember the last time
he died in this prison world?

258
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:11,050
He's banished to this world,
so all we have to do is wait,

259
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:12,182
and eventually he'll resurrect.

260
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,792
Hopefully in one piece.

261
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,012
I don't really feel like
playing Mr. Potato Head

262
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:17,709
with his dismembered body.

263
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:19,668
Looks like our little
mini-date isn't over yet.

264
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:21,982
What do you think got him?
Malivore?

265
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:34,905
Or that.

266
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,262
Probably that.

267
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,399
Okay.

268
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:58,322
I'm picturing
who I want to talk to.

269
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:07,909
I swear,
if Wade broke this thing...

270
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,830
It works just fine.

271
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:17,295
I am stronger
than you can ever be.

272
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,380
I will always find a way back.

273
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,691
Miss me?

274
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,439
Huh. Looks like someone had

275
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:38,028
a "going out of
supernatural business" sale.

276
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:40,450
I think I gave
you an unhelpful idea.

277
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:43,394
Perhaps I can inspire
a better one on the way home?

278
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:45,231
Yeah, she's right.
Maybe we should head back.

279
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:47,325
Maybe grab something
to eat on the way?

280
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:50,454
No, you did
great, Cleo.

281
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,848
This control panel,
it isn't just for lights.

282
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:55,981
It also has listed
two fire suppression systems.

283
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,462
One for in here...

284
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:02,993
one for somewhere... else.

285
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:06,818
I do not see a door.

286
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:09,782
Uh-uh. I'm not
fighting a mummy again.

287
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:12,998
If this place was ransacked,

288
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:15,143
why would they
leave this behind?

289
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,624
Ah, maybe
it can't be moved.

290
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:41,379
Okay. I see the door now.

291
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:57,347
Great.

292
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:59,262
We can find out what Triad
paid for paperclips

293
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:01,351
in 1997.

294
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,092
This is Triad's documentation

295
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,834
on all their
supernatural objects.

296
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:09,446
If they know anything about
the history of the artifact,

297
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,404
it'd be in here.

298
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,624
So, you want to
dig around in my brain?

299
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,713
Not exactly.

300
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:18,281
Vampires have this ability.
It's called a "head dive."

301
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,283
We can be present
inside of your memories

302
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:25,027
as events unfold,
like invisible witnesses.

303
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,354
If you're okay with that.

304
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:29,771
Or we could just
do it anyway.

305
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,186
Unless you want me
to tell you-know-who

306
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,308
about your superhero
extracurriculars.

307
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:36,706
You and Josie are twins, right?

308
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:37,996
How'd you figure that out?

309
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,828
Because you're the evil one.

310
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,368
Do it.

311
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:47,345
If this is what it takes
to prove I didn't kill anyone...

312
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:50,247
...I'm in.

313
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,296
How is this possible?

314
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,544
I destroyed you with an ax.

315
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,884
Silly girl.

316
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:59,278
All this time I've been
hiding inside you,

317
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:02,941
waiting for the perfect time
to escape.

318
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:06,156
You are so gullible.

319
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,649
No, I'm really just your
subconscious projection of me.

320
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:12,294
Well, it's fair
that we have trust issues.

321
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,655
So why don't you just drop
that tacky paperweight

322
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,488
and see for yourself?

323
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,090
See?

324
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,266
I'm practically harmless.

325
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,224
This thing must be
malfunctioning.

326
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:34,226
I didn't want
to talk to you.

327
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,619
And yet...

328
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,534
...here I am.

329
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:38,927
Deep down,
you must want

330
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:41,016
to hear what I have to say.

331
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,801
I mean, I do know all
of your weaknesses.

332
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,021
And I know exactly
what's wrong with you.

333
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:48,719
But if you really don't
want to talk to me,

334
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:51,805
that should be pretty simple
to prove.

335
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:54,508
Just drop the prism.

336
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,434
Hmm. That's what I thought.
Let's chat.

337
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:01,066
Think back to the day

338
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,951
you first turned
into a werewolf.

339
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:04,870
We'll start there.

340
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,878
A hospital? That's weird.

341
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:18,488
Think like a killer, okay?

342
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:19,837
This is the perfect,
target-rich environment

343
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:21,926
for the weak and enfeebled.

344
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,580
Not to mention

345
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:26,496
unattended children who could be
the first victim of...

346
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,106
Finch?

347
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,281
Finch Tarrayo?

348
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:30,765
That's me.

349
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:36,941
I thought you took us back
to the first day she turned.

350
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,730
I did.

351
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:43,295
Just my imagination, or is
this thing staring right at us?

352
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,254
That's impossible.
Nothing can see us

353
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,665
or hear us or touch us, so...

354
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,985
Okay, then why can
I feel its breath?

355
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,402
No! Oh, God, please!

356
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,586
That was close.

357
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,636
Hope?

358
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,860
That doesn't look good. It'll be fine.

359
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,471
Anything that happens
to my astral form

360
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,081
can't carry over
to my physical body.

361
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,256
Yeah, just like how a
monster isn't supposed

362
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,779
to be able to attack us here?

363
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:34,085
This mission doesn't
seem so safe anymore.

364
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:35,695
We should go home.

365
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,741
The Necromancer
will probably revive soon.

366
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,308
Yeah, but that wound
is getting worse by the second.

367
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,831
Plus, we don't know
how many more of those

368
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:43,229
astral-plane-attacking
monsters are around.

369
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:46,968
You're right, it's not safe.
You should go.

370
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:48,539
You mean we should go.

371
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:51,711
Sorry, there's no time.
Hope, don't you dare.

372
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:52,981
I love you. Remeo.

373
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:01,900
Damn it, Hope.

374
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:23,874
You are not gonna like this,

375
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,051
but you are never gonna have
that happy human life

376
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:28,966
that you want. Gee, thanks.

377
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,621
But I didn't ask
your opinion on my future.

378
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:33,449
I asked why all
of my romantic relationships

379
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:34,711
are such disasters.

380
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,191
And I answered that.

381
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,454
The problem is not
the relationships.

382
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:41,805
The fault, my dear Josette,
lies in you.

383
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,150
Why do I even bother?

384
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:47,071
I knew you weren't the one to talk
to. Aren't you gonna ask me why?

385
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,551
I'm sure that it's gonna
be some put-down

386
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,466
about how I'm too weak
to have a relationship.

387
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,121
Or I'm just not good enough
to have a happy life.

388
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:55,123
Ooh, you just dropped
a key word there.

389
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:56,515
I never said you
couldn't have

390
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,040
"a happy life." I said...

391
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:00,563
A happy human life.

392
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:01,955
Ding, ding, ding.

393
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,957
We both know that
you can't have

394
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,698
a real relationship

395
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:08,179
if you're repressing
an essential part of yourself.

396
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,920
What, you? I wish.

397
00:19:10,004 --> 00:19:11,574
It's more basic than that.

398
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:13,576
You want to know what's
really wrong with you?

399
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,405
You're a witch who's
pretending that you're not.

400
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,408
You're trying to trick me
into taking my magic back.

401
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,105
Kiddo, I am you, like it or not.

402
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,846
I mean, you could
have waited

403
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,153
and asked any of your friends
about this,

404
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,851
but instead you asked
a question to a crystal

405
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:30,336
that lets you talk to yourself.

406
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,334
Why?

407
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,906
Because you already knew
the answer.

408
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,601
Josie.

409
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:40,259
I need your help.

410
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,878
We've got a
10-10 in progress at Lou's Bar.

411
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,749
Reports of a brawl.

412
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,231
52 responding, but
we are a good 20 minutes out.

413
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,938
<i>♪ Oh, I think there's
something wrong with me ♪</i>

414
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:08,159
<i>♪ The sun goes down...</i>

415
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:14,293
<i>♪ I guess I'm just another
three-leaf clover. ♪</i>

416
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,435
Maybe Finch is a
natural-born killer that preys

417
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,133
on elderly patients.

418
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:35,179
I mean, this could be
the start of her spree.

419
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:39,318
This patient's last name
is Tarrayo, just like Finch.

420
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:51,021
I'm glad you're here,
my little goldfinch.

421
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,936
I need you to know

422
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,721
something about
our family.

423
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:58,028
We have a secret.

424
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:01,771
Some call it a curse,

425
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:04,861
but it can also be a blessing.

426
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:08,129
You can't trust anyone.

427
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,954
But before I go,

428
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,874
I can help make you strong.

429
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:19,267
And then you'll always be
able to protect yourself.

430
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:24,097
I, I don't understand.

431
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:27,018
Bring me my special candies
from my coat.

432
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,935
Oh, no.

433
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,593
Tonight...

434
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,117
when the full moon rises,

435
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:46,772
head down into the basement.

436
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:50,520
And don't tell anybody
where you are.

437
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,147
I'm so sorry.

438
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:13,669
You just made me remember
that I killed the only person

439
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:16,067
who ever cared about me.

440
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,854
What kind of monster are you?

441
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:27,030
She's burning up.

442
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:30,207
It's like some sort
of magical infection.

443
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,643
Is there any way
to, like, hit the eject button

444
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:32,992
and pull her out?

445
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,691
Not without a witch, but

446
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:37,258
hopefully Lizzie
will be back soon.

447
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:38,520
Okay, but not soon enough.

448
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:39,956
We can't wait.

449
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,653
Look, I-I'm more
than happy to cheer

450
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,438
my Tribrid girlfriend on
from the bleachers

451
00:22:43,522 --> 00:22:45,744
while she dunks on monsters,
but-but sending me back

452
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:47,572
was the magical equivalent
of "hold my purse."

453
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:49,008
She was trying to protect you.

454
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:50,096
Except this time, she's the one

455
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,315
who's actually in trouble.

456
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,843
You want to help?

457
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:54,884
We need to find out
what bit her.

458
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:58,453
Except all of our monster
experts are MIA

459
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:00,324
at the moment.

460
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:02,108
All except one.

461
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:04,197
It's a Berbalang.

462
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,678
Red necrotic eyes? Insatiable
appetite for dead flesh?

463
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,245
Able to interact
with the astral plane?

464
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,812
Classic Berbalang.

465
00:23:09,896 --> 00:23:11,204
What, you've actually heard
of this thing?

466
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:12,641
Heard of it?

467
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,120
Yeah, I've crossed swords
with it

468
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:15,687
and lived
to tell the tale twice.

469
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,254
I've been gone a long time.

470
00:23:17,338 --> 00:23:18,821
Medium aberration,

471
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:21,302
neutral evil,
plus five modifier...

472
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:23,695
Wait, is this a D&D thing?

473
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,436
Yeah, told you... expert.

474
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,265
If... and that's a big one...

475
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:31,007
D&D has its facts right,

476
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:34,053
how does one go about curing
a Berbalang bite?

477
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:35,973
Wait.

478
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:40,103
It bitHope?

479
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:41,539
Okay, forget D&D.

480
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:42,975
According to Filipino legend,

481
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,847
Berbalangs are
like living viruses.

482
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:47,371
They replicate themselves
through physical contact.

483
00:23:47,455 --> 00:23:49,286
If you get bit by one,
it's only a matter of time

484
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,513
before you turn into one.

485
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,951
Hope?

486
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:00,954
Are you okay?

487
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:16,357
How could you two be hungry
at a time like this?

488
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:19,621
Uh, guys, Hope-alang is
no-doubt coming for us

489
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,971
and you're busy
hoarding my nugs? It's bait!

490
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:24,452
Berbalangs eat dead flesh.
We can use this

491
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:26,454
to get her into the bunker.
And trap her in there

492
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:28,603
until we can figure out a way
to turn her back.

493
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:32,764
Good idea... does this
remind you of anything?

494
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,679
What could this possibly
remind me of?

495
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:36,464
Rulien's Keep. This is exactly

496
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:38,248
how our guild trapped
that owlbear, remember?

497
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:40,946
Our first 30-hour
marathon session?

498
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,253
We got kidney stones
because we drank

499
00:24:43,337 --> 00:24:44,994
so many energy drinks,
but you wouldn't stop

500
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:46,430
until the lich's
phylactery was destroyed.

501
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:48,519
Right, right.
How could I forget?

502
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,216
Sorry to interrupt
your war stories,

503
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,175
but we need to pick up the pace
before Hope gets here.

504
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,569
You don't know the half of it.
According to the lore, we only

505
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:57,097
have one hour before Hope's
transformation is permanent.

506
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,666
Then what if this doesn't work?

507
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,758
Or what if it works too well?

508
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:10,287
Is it weird that I still
find her attractive?

509
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,633
Oh, hey, let me, um...

510
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:18,205
I'm gonna check that
for you, okay? Uh...

511
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:22,553
No mention of any artifacts
or anything,

512
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:26,042
but I hope I saved you
a little bit of time.

513
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:30,953
Um, so...

514
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:33,085
check this, tonight,

515
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:35,914
I was thinking,
you know, you, me,

516
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:38,700
drinks at the Tap,
barbecue from The Pit Stop,

517
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,180
and then moonlit dancing on
the roof of the old clocktower?

518
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:44,662
That sounds fun, but I will
have to pass for now.

519
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:46,664
Okay.

520
00:25:46,748 --> 00:25:47,970
Okay, message received.

521
00:25:48,054 --> 00:25:49,145
Got to up my game.

522
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:51,452
That is not what I was saying.

523
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:53,018
Well, then you're
gonna have to send

524
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:54,846
some clearer signals, 'cause

525
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,457
you clearly dig me.

526
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,023
So what-what's up?

527
00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,503
What I got to do to get a date?

528
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:01,766
Not this.

529
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,855
I do not like it when you try

530
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,075
to impress me or be cool.

531
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,286
I want you
to drop the act.

532
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:11,629
And be honest.

533
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:16,089
Is that something
you are capable of?

534
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:27,444
You'll never believe
what I found.

535
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:29,141
Hope?

536
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:30,846
Are you in there?

537
00:26:33,578 --> 00:26:35,104
She's trying to talk, I think.

538
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:36,544
Hope!

539
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:39,634
This isn't you.

540
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,937
Fight it!

541
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:45,031
Also, faerie folk
cause indigestion.

542
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:57,213
Landon... she wants you!

543
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,741
Run!

544
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:04,268
Everything's gonna be okay.

545
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:07,528
I know that
must have been painful.

546
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:10,313
Probably why you blocked
the memory, but

547
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:13,621
at least now we know that you
didn't hurt anyone on purpose.

548
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:15,405
Yeah, congratulations.

549
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:17,146
You proved I'm a killer.

550
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,458
Something I have to live with
for the rest of my life.

551
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,460
There might be a way to fix it.

552
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:28,897
You have a time travel spell?

553
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,250
Not quite.

554
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:34,298
But I know one that can put
memory blocks in place.

555
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:38,646
It can make you forget what
happened with your grandpa and

556
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,735
even all of today

557
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:43,524
if you want.

558
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:51,136
I have to remember
what my grandpa said.

559
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,138
And I can't
trust anyone.

560
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:55,623
I have to look out for myself.

561
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:59,105
It's too bad.

562
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,631
I really liked Josie.

563
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:16,509
Thought you didn't want
to talk to me. I don't.

564
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:18,033
But this is Sanskrit.
I took one class on it

565
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:19,512
last year,
but I've forgotten everything.

566
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:21,950
Sorry, um, why should I care?

567
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,213
Because I said I've forgotten.
I'm sure my subconscious hasn't.

568
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:26,607
Again, why should I care?

569
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:28,130
Because I do.

570
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:30,611
Now you're starting to get it.

571
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:32,264
It says...

572
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:36,573
"to stop a person
from becoming a Berbalang,

573
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:40,490
you need
a pearl-bladed weapon."

574
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:42,448
Perfect. Dad has a dagger
like that in his study.

575
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:44,233
He uses it to open bottles.Ah-ah-ah.

576
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:45,887
Not so fast.

577
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:49,151
The weapon needs to be imbued
with an enchantment.

578
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:50,761
And there's
no witch here

579
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:53,155
to cast a spell,
and Lizzie's not back yet

580
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,723
and fae magic just won't cut it.
I know what you're trying to do.

581
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:58,334
I'm not gonna take back my magic
just so you take me over.

582
00:28:58,418 --> 00:29:00,597
For the last time,
I don't need to take over.

583
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:03,992
Because I already live
in here.

584
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,255
Well, you're about
to get evicted.

585
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,344
There's the girl I know.

586
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:11,260
The tough bitch that buried
the hatchet in me.

587
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:15,220
The one that said that she was
both strong and good.

588
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:17,570
But if you're

589
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:19,485
so strong...

590
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:21,531
why are you afraid
of your own power?

591
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:23,751
And if you're so good,

592
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:26,761
how can you let your friend
turn into a monster?

593
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:31,937
Ticktock, Jo.

594
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:46,948
Okay, if you're gonna eat me,
can I at least

595
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,253
talk to my girlfriend first?

596
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:49,994
Stand down!

597
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:53,432
Stay your hand, ghoul.

598
00:29:53,516 --> 00:29:56,092
Or face the wrath of Fangsbane.

599
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:04,930
Maybe not so much wrath,
more like a stern lecture.

600
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,797
I failed my saving throw.

601
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,276
Okay, Hope?

602
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,323
It's me.

603
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:15,716
I know that you can hear me.

604
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,978
That you're trying
to talk to me.

605
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:18,675
Liar!

606
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,287
I didn't know
Berbalangs were so judgy.

607
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:25,643
You want something to eat?

608
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,293
Eat this.

609
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:30,517
Ventus.

610
00:30:38,648 --> 00:30:40,223
Now that's
what I call a glow-up!

611
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,830
You took your magic back.

612
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:44,353
I had to, to enchant this.

613
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,789
A plus two dagger.

614
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,660
That should stop the process.

615
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:49,710
If you stab her
in the heart.

616
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:53,188
This is what
we were looking for.

617
00:30:53,272 --> 00:30:56,539
These sketches of the artifact
date back to the Renaissance.

618
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:58,106
You can tell all that
just by looking at it?

619
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,717
Look at the signature.

620
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:02,763
Leonardo da Vinci.

621
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:04,199
He's the one
who made it.

622
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:06,375
I th... I think.

623
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:07,855
I don't know, my Italian's
only good enough

624
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,334
to order at a restaurant, but...

625
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:11,206
Good.

626
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,860
So, guess we can
get out of here now?

627
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:15,079
Hey, man, I thought
you were having fun.

628
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:17,647
Yeah, yeah, I was, um...

629
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:19,562
It's just...

630
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:23,092
Ah, yeah... girl problems.

631
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,525
The, uh, sound carries.

632
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:29,398
Look, you probably don't want
advice from the old guy, but...

633
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:31,226
I'm thinking maybe

634
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,403
you should tell her why
you actually came on the trip.

635
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,797
'Cause I like being around her?

636
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:40,109
Are you sure that's
the only reason?

637
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:45,806
Hold up, you smell that?

638
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,029
Like... like
something's burning?

639
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,688
The parchment!

640
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:00,219
There is no
coming back from this.

641
00:32:01,427 --> 00:32:02,957
If we're wrong, Hope dies.

642
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,303
Are we really willing
to risk stabbing her

643
00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:07,131
in the heart
based off of some board game?

644
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:09,225
Technically,
it's a tabletop RPG.

645
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:12,354
And technically, I'll shut
up. If we don't, she'll turn into

646
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:14,798
one of those things forever,
and that's the real risk.

647
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:20,884
As defender of the school,
the lot falls to me.

648
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:22,843
But I'm only acting in that
capacity because the real protector

649
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:24,888
of the school
is currently a monster.

650
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:26,981
I'm scared.

651
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:30,415
We all know how much
Hope means to this place.

652
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:32,161
To all of us.

653
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,036
Landon. Landon, wait!

654
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,220
Come on, Hope.

655
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,618
Come back to me.

656
00:33:01,617 --> 00:33:04,196
Worst date ever.

657
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:22,250
Well, that was
a fun car ride.

658
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,256
Um...

659
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:28,430
You two should
get some rest.

660
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:30,214
Um, I'm about to grab a bite.

661
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:32,086
Oh. So you cantalk.

662
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,914
From how quiet the car ride was,

663
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:36,268
I thought you were incapable
of speech.

664
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:41,312
You're-you're right.

665
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,967
Okay? It's not
easy for me

666
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,926
to be vulnerable.

667
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,536
Like admitting

668
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,066
the real reason
I went on the mission.

669
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:55,892
I wanted...
I wanted to have your back,

670
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:59,813
in case Malivore sent
another monster after you.

671
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,252
You are worried about me?

672
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:08,209
That is actually very sweet
of you, Kaleb.

673
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:09,950
Thank you
for being honest with me.

674
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:12,648
You're welcome.

675
00:34:12,732 --> 00:34:14,955
I'm sorry it took so long.

676
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:16,869
Just, the
last time

677
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:21,309
I was vulnerable with someone...

678
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,833
I ended up dead.

679
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:26,575
Craving blood.

680
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:29,012
Sporting a new grill.Mm-hmm.

681
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:32,581
You became a vampire.

682
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:34,539
Yeah, it's... it's a long story.

683
00:34:34,623 --> 00:34:36,019
I'm sure I'll tell you
about it sometime.

684
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:37,412
I do have

685
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:39,636
a free evening coming up.

686
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,112
You playing?

687
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:43,896
Not at all.

688
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,376
It is...

689
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,818
a date.

690
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,648
I, uh...

691
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:58,048
Something.Phlegm.

692
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,829
You were great today.

693
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:05,962
So great that you kicked me out
of the prison world

694
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:07,746
the moment things
got dangerous?

695
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,314
I want you to feel like
you can count on me...

696
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:13,100
Not just when it's safe,
but when there's trouble. I do.

697
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:15,798
Landon, I sent you away so that
I could handle the mission,

698
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:18,892
but I knew that you were able to
figure out what the monster was.

699
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:21,499
Divide and conquer.

700
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:24,640
It's standard
power-couple stuff.

701
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:28,115
You could warn a guy
next time.

702
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,942
This should make
it up to you.

703
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,166
Ready to roll?

704
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:36,993
Tonight we're going
to be exploring

705
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:39,126
the Mines of Shadowspire.

706
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,519
Looking good,
Jon Snow.

707
00:35:41,603 --> 00:35:44,178
Let me get
your character sheets.

708
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,176
Actually, I forgot to ask.

709
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,352
Did The Necromancer
ever revive? No.

710
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:50,702
I'm not sure what it means.

711
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:53,140
We're gonna have to have
Cleo inspire a new plan.

712
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:56,452
But whatever it is,
I want you by my side.

713
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:58,805
Thanks.

714
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,326
Um, I'll be right back.

715
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,154
Don't pull any
cards without me.

716
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:10,548
That's not how it works, but...

717
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:13,290
Sure you don't want
to hang around for a while?

718
00:36:13,374 --> 00:36:17,207
We could eat rocky road and talk
about how I ruined Finch's life,

719
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,863
and ruined any shot
that Josie had with her.

720
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:23,822
I'm not ready
for that yet.

721
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:25,302
<i>♪ The rain would pour...</i>

722
00:36:25,386 --> 00:36:27,348
But about Ethan...

723
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:30,090
I won't rat you out.

724
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:32,179
You can continue
the amazing adventures

725
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:35,273
of Nerd Man and Geek Boy.

726
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,663
What should I do?

727
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:42,363
I don't want to compel
his memories away, but...

728
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:45,022
I don't like lying to your dad.

729
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:47,846
Don't get me wrong,

730
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,938
playing superhero with a human
is probably a terrible idea,

731
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:55,550
but...

732
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,943
who am I to judge?

733
00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:00,516
I was wrong about Finch.

734
00:37:01,161 --> 00:37:02,557
And I was wrong

735
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:05,869
to siphon you
and take the ascendant.

736
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:07,910
So...

737
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:11,218
I'm probably not
the right person to ask.

738
00:37:11,302 --> 00:37:13,655
And... I should also

739
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:17,485
stop pretending like
I know the answer all the time.

740
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,227
You'll make the right call.

741
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:22,098
You always do.

742
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:24,231
And in that spirit...

743
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:29,196
What would you do about Josie
if you were me?

744
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:31,934
I'd try telling her the truth.

745
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:34,241
She can handle it.

746
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:37,901
She can make her own decisions
about who she's dating.

to the artifact in my hands,
Dorian.

765
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:30,253
The fire suppression system
literally turned them to dust.

766
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,516
Yeah, the electrical fire
triggered it.

767
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,475
Yeah, well,
I guess you had to be there,

768
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,173
but we do have one clue
to go on.

769
00:38:37,257 --> 00:38:40,307
The Triad file with Da Vinci's
blueprints in it had a name:

770
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,874
Project Pandora.

771
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:47,096
Yes, as in the mythical box that
contains all the world's ills.

772
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,534
Remember?
The one that Hope and I opened.

773
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:52,319
Yo, E.

774
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:54,364
We got to talk.

775
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:56,148
I was thinking about it,

776
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:59,413
and we should tell Dr. Saltzman.

777
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:02,416
I promise I will not
let him take your memories away.

778
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,070
But it's always better
to tell the truth

779
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:07,994
before something goes really...

780
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,207
...wrong.

781
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,387
Oh, crap. Hey.

782
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,608
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

783
00:39:18,516 --> 00:39:20,303
I'm really glad
that you were here today.

784
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:21,826
Not just because
you prevented me

785
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,699
from turning into a Babadook
or whatever,

786
00:39:24,783 --> 00:39:27,441
but because I wanted
to apologize.

787
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:29,181
Today was
the second time

788
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:30,835
that I've put you
in a position

789
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,968
to where you felt pressured
to take your magic back.

790
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:34,970
It shouldn't have taken
you turning into a monster

791
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:37,581
for me to realize
that it was time.

792
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:40,367
You were with me
when I defeated my dark side.

793
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,892
And when it was over, I was so
horrified by what I had done

794
00:39:43,976 --> 00:39:45,154
that I just really wanted
to make sure

795
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:46,460
that it never happened again.

796
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:48,810
But in a way, that
was kind of like

797
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:50,681
letting the dark
part of me win.

798
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,771
It's a battle that's
always going to be with me,

799
00:39:53,855 --> 00:39:56,953
and I don't want to run
from that anymore.

800
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,995
This is who I am.

801
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,958
Does that mean
you're gonna move back?

802
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:05,530
I'm not sure about that one yet.

803
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:09,787
Hey, Hope,
can I talk to you for a minute

804
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:11,963
while Landon's getting
his miniatures?

805
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:16,581
You're so lucky Lizzie
didn't hear you say that.

806
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,624
What's up?

807
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,452
Have you noticed
anything strange about Landon

808
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:23,888
since he got back?

809
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:26,500
He's actually been
pretty perfect.

810
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:28,593
Well, not as a DM.

811
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:31,418
Please don't make me ask. Dungeon Master.

812
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:33,420
Look, this
is gonna sound weird,

813
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:35,465
but earlier today he forgot
about our D&D campaign

814
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:37,424
to Rulien's Keep.

815
00:40:37,508 --> 00:40:40,731
Which isn't a biggie, except
that was his favorite module.

816
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,603
And then there's
the Berbalang.

817
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:45,736
It only eats dead flesh,
but it was hankering for Landon.

818
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,782
Could just be
a residual phoenix...

819
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,436
Also not
a balanced part

820
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,916
of a Berbalang's breakfast...
They hate fire.

821
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,702
But the thing that
really got me, Hope,

822
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:58,395
was that he stabbed you
in the heart

823
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,621
after you called him a liar...

824
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:02,056
He didn't have
a choice, okay?

825
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:03,493
I would have done
the same thing.

826
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:05,539
Yeah, but Landon wouldn't.

827
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:08,665
He would never hurt
you, Hope. Ever.

828
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:13,372
There's something wrong
with him.

829
00:41:14,305 --> 00:42:14,533
