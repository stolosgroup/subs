1
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:14,931
Hey, I forgot my ID.

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,200
Could you hook me
up with some beer?

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,392
Get out of here, kid.

Oh.

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,307
Were y'all using these?

7
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,311
My bad. Listen, I think
we need to have a talk

8
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,147
about civic responsibilities.

9
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,781
What do you think you're doing?

10
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,616
Turning ourselves in
for armed robbery.

11
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,242
And after serving our sentences,

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,536
we're going to devote our
lives to community service.

14
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,817
What is that sound?

15
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,193
I'm humming.

16
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,611
A song.

17
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,321
Are you unwell?

18
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,032
Quite the opposite. Everything
is right in the world.

19
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,427
Lizzie and I are friends again,
Landon's back, and I haven't

20
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,221
seen any new monsters,
which means the defensive

21
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,372
perimeter I spelled around
the school is working.

22
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,666
Today is going to be a good day.

23
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,792
I hope. Morning, Cleo.

24
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,710
Morning. I got tea.

25
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,588
See? Scones. Hi.

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,881
Uh, um...

27
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,176
Are you feeling okay?

28
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,529
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

29
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,929
Yeah, um, uh, you didn't happen

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,014
to see any slugs
crawling around, did you?

31
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,599
No. No?

32
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,726
What is it with you guys?
Can't a girl just be happy?

33
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,538
Of course you can. It's
just, um... it's just, um...

34
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,523
Unexpected. It's unexpected.

35
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,569
No. Nope. Nothing is putting
me in a bad mood today because

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,195
today is the day
that I figure out

37
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,989
the one thing we have
left to worry about...

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,782
Why the monsters
are still coming.

39
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,367
How are we gonna
figure that out?

40
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,345
Well, you are gonna help
Dr. Saltzman with research

41
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:46,541
while Cleo and I are going to
get some quality roomie time.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,133
Lizzie.

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,926
What are you doing
here? You scared me.

44
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,595
You forgot your sweater.

45
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,805
I thought you might need
it after the ice-cold way

46
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,682
that you violated twin code.

47
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,935
Oh, here we go. You have
a crush, and you told

48
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,395
our father before telling me.

49
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,897
'Cause it's already over.

50
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,192
I made things weird and
I can't un-weird them.

51
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,277
That's because, sweetie...
And I love you...

52
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,612
But you have zero game.

53
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,031
What you do have,
however, is a sister

54
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,408
with magical powers and
an encyclopedic knowledge

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,786
of every rom-com ever.

56
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,121
I'm here to help.

57
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,416
No, Lizzie. I beg
of you, please,

58
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,293
let me fix this on my own.

59
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,587
Finch is a completely
normal human.

60
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,674
I want to fix this the
regular way, without magic.

61
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
Just promise me.

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,637
Lizzie.

63
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,264
So great to see you.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,911
What's up? We have
a monster problem?

65
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,729
Oh, it is way worse,
Mr. Williams. We have

66
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,191
an angsty, teenage, high school,
impossible crush problem.

67
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,945
Right, right, that, uh...
that-that is worse, and, um

68
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,405
thankfully,not my department.

69
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,449
So best of luck to you both.

70
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,286
That's actually totally okay,
'cause Lizzie was just leaving.

71
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,121
Everything alone. Mm.

72
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,457
Right, Lizzie? Perfect. Awesome.

73
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,209
Love you. Uh...

74
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,346
Invisique.

75
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,525
Well, well, well.

76
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,777
Heard you might've
had a late night

77
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,155
doing totally normal,
completely unheroic things.

78
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:45,243
Um... keep it down, E.

79
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,787
What are we doing
next? Any leads?

80
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,789
Um...

81
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,501
I was thinking we
could just lay low.

82
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,461
But yesterday was awesome.

83
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,338
I want to do it again.

84
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,716
And this way

85
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,302
you won't have to compel
people all the time.

86
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,595
You can keep your
identity a secret.

87
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,391
You'll look...Blur-some.
Mm-hmm.

88
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,353
First of all,

89
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,814
do not ever say that terrible

90
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,109
superhero name to me ever again.

91
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,987
Second, we just got
lucky last night.

92
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,906
Mystic Falls barely has
one robbery a decade.

93
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,366
Yeah, that we know about.

94
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,038
My mom's old police scanner.

95
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,223
I figure, if I'm
your human sidekick,

96
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,498
the least I can do is

97
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,000
help you find our next case.

98
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,420
Do you want to skip P.E.

99
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,340
and bring down Mystic
Falls' vast underworld

100
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,716
of petty criminals?

101
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,763
Or am I the only one
that had fun yesterday?

102
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,558
Yeah, you're right.

103
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,870
Thanks.

104
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,001
So... you're back.

105
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,963
Yeah. All that drama at my
old school is completely done.

106
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,883
I'm just focusing on the now.

107
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,011
Making myself open

108
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,432
and available to anything
or, you know, whatever.

109
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,893
Does that whatever include

110
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,645
staying on campus for lunch?

111
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:36,729
I'd love that.

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,774
I'll be there. Here.

113
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,026
For lunch. Yeah.

114
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,403
Then maybe I'll see you.

115
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,696
Yeah, cool.

116
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,618
I totally get it. She's hot.

117
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,245
Lizzie?

118
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,288
I told you that
you needed my help.

119
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,710
Stop it.

120
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,214
You knocked away my books?

121
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,884
It's called a "meet-cute," my
young Padawan, rom-com 101.

122
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,095
And step one is now
officially complete.

123
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,847
Well, what's step number two?

124
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,891
Don't look so worried, and
I'll be happy to tell you.

125
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,395
Stand up straight. Chin up.

126
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,938
There. Much better.

127
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,569
You're gonna get
the girl for sure.

128
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,738
This is so cool.

129
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,992
You said Rasputin,
Napoleon and Einstein

130
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,118
all held this thing?

131
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,371
And Queen Elizabeth I.

132
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,748
What? How far back does this go?

133
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,375
That's what we have to find out.

134
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,297
Monsters started appearing
after Hope opened it,

135
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,254
so my theory
is,they're connected.

136
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,755
But first we just
have to figure out

137
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,132
where it originated.

138
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,469
Um, Dr. Saltzman, not
that I'm not thrilled

139
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,972
to be on Team Library. I
am... it's nice to be useful,

140
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,950
especially since I can't even
be monster bait anymore...

141
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,351
But it kind of feels like
a vampire would be able

142
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,854
to look through these
books a lot faster than me.

143
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,608
Maybe I just like your company.

144
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,234
Mm-hmm.

145
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,614
So why the crossbow?

146
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,164
Okay.

147
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,999
Hope asked me to
keep an eye on you

148
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,602
and make sure you're safe
while she's testing out

149
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,127
her new theory.

150
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,463
What theory?

151
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,925
This was your great idea?

152
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,178
Consider it a brainstorming
session... with brie.

153
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,222
I must say,you
seem rather relaxed

154
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,182
about our lives being in danger.

155
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,102
Perhaps if you had been the one
at the bottom of that well...

156
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,584
Actually, that was sort of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

157
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,583
We've been assuming
that the gremlin

158
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,816
just happened to grab you,

159
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,401
but what if it wasn't random?

160
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,612
What if you're what
Malivore wants?

161
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,198
Why would he want me? No clue.

162
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Next step would be
testing my theory.

163
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,160
Hmm, and how would we test that?

164
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,121
Well, first we'd have
to use you as bait

165
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,749
to see if it would happen again,
if you're willing, that is.

166
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,378
But don't worry, I'd be there
to keep you safe the whole time.

167
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,756
We'd just have to lower
the perimeter spells

168
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,759
and pretend like we're
having a good time.

169
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,719
You know, sort of like...

170
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,513
What we are doing right now.

171
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,266
Don't be mad, we
can totally stop.

172
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,851
I just figured you might
need a little bit of a push.

173
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,246
And if we can get
a talking monster,

174
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,622
we might actually
get some answers.

175
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,273
What do you say?

176
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:30,027
You lead me into very strange
situations, Hope Mikaelson.

177
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,366
Fine. But why a picnic?

178
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,618
I mean, I figured if one of
us is gonna be used as bait,

179
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,495
we might as well enjoy it.

180
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,973
Besides, not all the
monsters are that bad.

181
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,584
One of them was even
sort of... whimsical.

182
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,472
That didn't take long.

183
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,182
Here.

184
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,436
This one doesn't
feel very whimsical.

185
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,611
It might not be as
bad as it seems.

186
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,450
Probably as bad as it seems.

187
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,457
Corrupan vinea.

188
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,006
Foolish girls.

189
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,517
Oo ni le soro.

190
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,193
Good thing you were
here to keep me safe.

191
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,071
At least we know the monsters
are definitely after you.

192
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,531
Now we just have
to find out why.

193
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,543
What's with the lights?

194
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,507
She's a walking horror
movie. That's awesome.

195
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,093
What is she?

196
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,511
Besides some creepy chick

197
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,596
putting a damper on my
positivity, no clue.

198
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,723
Either way, I owe
Gaby some money.

199
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,184
I had a wendigo in
the monster pool.

200
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,519
Rookie mistake.

201
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,937
It's never a wendigo.

202
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,539
But we still should be
able to get answers.

203
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,815
She talks, right?

204
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,901
Not exactly.

205
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:38,030
I recommend covering your ears.

206
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,254
Dr. S, I think, I think she's...

207
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,922
A banshee.

208
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,316
Okay, well,how do we get answers

209
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,943
out of a banshee without
our brains melting?

210
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,177
Don't know.

211
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,099
Until we figure that out,
she's not going anywhere.

212
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,895
Well, we have all the
time in the world, right?

213
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm sure you're wondering
what happens next.

214
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,450
"Step two" You need to sneak
out of a bad party together.

215
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:26,412
I call this the "You want
to get out of here?" moment.

216
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,913
That's really specific.

217
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,290
Step three. We
can skip this one.

218
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,625
It involves a missing pet

219
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,378
or some sort of non-life-
threatening emergency.

220
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,565
But step four, this is where
the real fireworks happen.

221
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,341
The spontaneous life highlight.

222
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,428
I'm talking night swimming. I'm
talking impromptu road trip.

223
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,721
I'm talking...

224
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,389
Moonlit dance in the parking lot

225
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,641
during an actual school dance.

226
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,060
I thought you said this
wasn't your department.

227
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,812
They're painting my office.

228
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,606
At least someone gets it.

229
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,942
If we can just get to
step four, it's automatic.

230
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,528
She will have no choice
but to fall for you.

231
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,072
Well, I don't want
to manipulate Finch.

232
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,408
I want her to actually like me.

233
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,577
Never gonna happen.

234
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,663
Why not?

235
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,042
'Cause that would require you
to actually shoot your shot.

236
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,920
Well, then, I'll ask
her out on a real date.

237
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,296
Tonight.

238
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,474
"Alternate step two"

239
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,476
Extroverted sister provokes

240
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,521
introverted sister out
of her comfort zone.

241
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,898
Our little secret.

242
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,900
It's good.

243
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,449
Do werewolves just
work out anywhere?

244
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,993
No.

245
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,329
I just came up here 'cause
the gym was occupied by

246
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,373
whatever that thing is.

247
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,126
She is a banshee,or
so I am told.

248
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,462
Well, I just lost 20 bucks.

249
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,047
Totally had wendigo.

250
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,091
Apparently, it's
never a wendigo.

251
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,385
I wouldn't know.

252
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,303
I've been relegated
to the Junior Squad

253
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,430
ever since I... Hurt MG?

254
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,142
I heard. Yeah. Everyone has.

255
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,120
I keep thinking I'll find a
way to make it up to all them.

256
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,146
And you will.

257
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,528
Why are you up here?

258
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,363
I am supposed to be researching

259
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,323
how to allow the
banshee to speak

260
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,285
without using her mouth, but...

261
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,871
I just found out that

262
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,415
the monsters are coming
here because of me.

263
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,711
I needed a moment
to process that.

264
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,838
Because if you can't
get the monster to talk,

265
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,091
you can't figure out
why they... want you.

266
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,636
Are you all right?

267
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,221
Something just came over me.

268
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,639
I think I know how we can

269
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,933
solve both our problems
at the same time.

270
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,489
All the good stuff must
happen at night, right?

271
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,830
You know what this
mission needs? Snacks.

272
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,458
Every stakeout involves
cheap snacks and coffee.

273
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,753
Ethan...

274
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,338
I dig the enthusiasm.

275
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,632
I really do.

276
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,134
But, you know, we
can just hang out

277
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,219
without it having
to be a mission.

278
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,681
Except now I know that
superhuman vampires exist.

279
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,852
It's pretty hard to go back
to normal life after that.

280
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,397
I mean, think about
it. If you exist,

281
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,649
then what else is out there?

282
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,276
Maybe there's an
evil version of you.

283
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,486
A superpowered bad guy

284
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,071
just waiting to attack

285
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,781
and your destinies are
bound to intersect,

286
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,407
so whenever

287
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,786
he or she shows up,
we have to be ready.

288
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,081
Well, until they do...

289
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,791
I'm gonna head to class.

290
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,877
Cool. I'll just, uh, let
you know if I hear anything.

291
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,674
Are you sure you don't
want to come with? Yeah.

292
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,344
After everything else that's
happened this year, it's

293
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,013
it's just nice to have
something to care about.

294
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,556
You know?

295
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:26,068
Okay, so what kind of,
uh, stakeout snacks

296
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,736
are we talking about here?

297
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,822
I know that look.

298
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,573
Why don't you just
tell me what's wrong?

299
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,701
Because you're in a good mood.

300
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,078
Let me guess. A banshee
can only be stopped

301
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
with a certain enchanted
blah, blah, blah

302
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,623
from the mountains
of blah, blah, blah.

303
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,709
Look, we always find a
way to stop the monster.

304
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,627
I'm sure I can handle it.

305
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,588
According to Irish mythology,
the banshee is a harbinger.

306
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,426
Whenever they appear,
death is not far behind.

307
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,320
Okay, that just means
that death could be coming

308
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,929
for anybody in Mystic Falls.

309
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,851
And when has that
ever been our luck?

310
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,933
Hope, we have to
prepare ourselves

311
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,120
for the very real possibility
that she may say something to us

312
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,562
we don't want to hear.

313
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,480
Dr. Saltzman?

314
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,277
Cleo and I know how to
get this monster to talk.

315
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,867
Here's the spell. Alias Vocem.

316
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,620
It allows one to speak
through another as a conduit,

317
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,373
without being able to
burst our eardrums.

318
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,418
It's brilliant.

319
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,086
You thought of this?

320
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,005
Yeah, I know, right?

321
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,258
Oh, but I know what's
missing! Wait, wait.

322
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,303
You all right?

323
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,639
Ask me in a few moments.

324
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,434
Hope, we're ready.

325
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,940
I found it. Blue Calamus.

326
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,817
Josie told me it's
basically a truth weed.

327
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,862
If we give it to Jed, the
banshee can't lie to us.

328
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,698
Well done, Team Library.

329
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,340
There's not much time
till the full moon.

330
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,078
When Jed turns, we don't
want a monster in his head.

331
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,370
Yeah.

332
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,414
Well, now we just need
something of hers.

333
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,844
Vauntidictus calimus vox.

334
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,652
Ah.

335
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,570
Clever girl.

336
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,572
Trapping my voice in a body

337
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,740
that cannot scream.

338
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,158
Or lie.

339
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,702
Now we can have a
civilized conversation.

340
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,581
Are you sure you want to
hear what I have to say?

341
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,668
Why are you here?

342
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,672
Malivore promised me
freedom from the darkness

343
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,425
in exchange for
bringing him that girl.

344
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,804
And why does he want her?

345
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,851
You are forcing me
to tell the truth,

346
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,729
but that does not
mean I have to answer.

347
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,152
This is not the question
that troubles you.

348
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,156
Go on, little girl.

349
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,409
Ask what you really
wish to know.

350
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,623
Who's gonna die?

351
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,216
There are many possible roads.

352
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,428
But one is clearer
than the others.

353
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,640
If she stays here

354
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,976
he dies.

355
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,228
Wow, tea twice in one day.

356
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,313
Hope, can we talk about...

357
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,066
There's no need to.
It's not happening.

358
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,776
No one's dying today.

359
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,486
The banshee does not agree.

360
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,614
I know you're new here, but
there's always a loophole, okay?

361
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,283
It's basically our school
motto. We'll find it.

362
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,286
Mm. If you are so
confidant, then why did you

363
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,163
spell Landon into his room?

364
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,293
I think it is time
that we talked.

365
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,810
You made it.

366
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,353
You guys, this is Josie...

367
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,872
I know that there's been
weird energy between us

368
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,356
since the first
moment I saw you.

369
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,318
And then things got weirder
when I bailed on you.

370
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,169
But it's not because I'm
not into you, because I am

371
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,320
into you, I'm just cautious,

372
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,614
because I usually mess
things like this up

373
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,241
and I really don't
want to mess this up.

374
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,035
And you're hot, okay?

375
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,138
And worse, you're also really
cool, and that's scary,

376
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,873
because I think that if we
became a thing, it would be

377
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,375
a thing.

378
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,585
But I like you. I like you
in a way that I haven't

379
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,170
liked somebody in
a really long time.

380
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,673
So I think that we
should give this a shot.

381
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,010
So, do you, maybe,
want to hang out

382
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,971
tonight?

383
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,184
I...

384
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,729
can't tonight.

385
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,188
Got plans.

386
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,274
Uh, yeah. That's
totally understandable.

387
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,859
Um, short notice.

388
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,569
Uh, tomorrow night, then, maybe?

389
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,696
Tomorrow might be bad, too.

390
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,491
Sorry.

391
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,501
For a long time, I searched for

392
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,961
a place like this.

393
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,963
A place to call home.

394
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,175
But I cannot be the reason that
trouble comes into your lives.

395
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,927
Which is why I need to
go. You don't have to.

396
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,530
The monsters are always
coming after someone.

397
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,157
We've never made anyone
leave because of it.

398
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,724
But is that what you want?

399
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,267
Be honest.

400
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,478
Would you be happier
if I left? Yes.

401
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,899
I didn't mean that. You did.

402
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,278
Because truth weed can
also be used to make tea.

403
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,127
No.

404
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,046
She said she had plans,

405
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,591
which didn't even involve
coming up with a good excuse.

406
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,468
Obviously just means that...

407
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,886
She's seeing someone else.

408
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,431
You were right.

409
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,266
I waited too long.

410
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:17,479
Or we're just in a slightly
different rom-com now,

411
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,440
the "steal her back from less
worthy competition" story.

412
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,692
Don't worry, it's
a total classic,

413
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,629
and there's usually a really
great music moment, so...

414
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,904
Lizzie.

415
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,448
I know.

416
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,534
You wanted to do this
the "natural way."

417
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:35,664
Actually, I kind of just
want to know who she's seeing

418
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,332
and if it's serious.

419
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:42,129
So you mean, like, if
someone could do some magic?

420
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,966
Invisible spying?

421
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,262
Go home. I'll find
out how serious it is.

422
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,398
I think I know how
I can help you.

423
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,150
Legend says

424
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,278
that a banshee is a demon
drawn to inconsolable grief.

425
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,905
That they seek out women
who've died of a broken heart

426
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,365
and possess them.

427
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,953
The person that you once
were is still in there.

428
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,539
You are not this thing.

429
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,376
Tell us why he wants Cleo,
and we will find a way

430
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,669
to set you free.

431
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,504
It's no use trying to talk

432
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,173
to the human woman.

433
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,591
She won't believe you.

434
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,051
After her child was taken,

435
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,471
no one could tell her
what happened to it.

436
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,808
No one could heal the
hole in her heart.

437
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,810
She was abandoned by everyone...

438
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,605
Her village, her husband.

439
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,150
They couldn't stand
to hear her cries.

440
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,945
They fled from her grief.

441
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,031
That's when I found her.

442
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:56,536
She knows you will be no
different than anyone else.

443
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,663
Humans run from
grief like a sickness

444
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,250
afraid that it will spread,

445
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,419
that they will catch it.

446
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,379
Oh, it is their nature.

447
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,840
I'm not like everyone else.

448
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,135
But you are out of time.

449
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,970
The full moon rises,

450
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,057
and this body is about to turn.

451
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,895
I've never felt such strength.

452
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,481
Cleo left.

453
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,733
I tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen.

454
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,777
What's going on?

455
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,278
We need to unlink Jed

456
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,030
from the banshee
before he turns.

457
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,657
Pondas.

458
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,540
Hope, what's wrong?

459
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,749
I just need to know.

460
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,171
Now that Cleo's
gone, is Landon safe?

461
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,464
No.

462
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,258
Don't listen to her. I am bound

463
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,634
to tell the truth, remember?

464
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,429
I was not sent to capture Cleo.

465
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,849
I was sent to drive her
away from your protection.

466
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,565
One road darkens, the
other grows clearer.

467
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,612
Cleo dies, too.

468
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,961
Where you going?

469
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,689
Cleo cloaked herself
from my locator spell,

470
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,190
so I'm gonna have to find
her the old-fashioned way.

471
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,799
And before you try to stop me,

472
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,176
I just wanted to say
that I'm... I'm sorry.

473
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,053
I'm sorry that it apparently

474
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,513
always has to be
this way for us.

475
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,848
We can never just be happy.

476
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,141
But I can't let her die

477
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,851
when I'm the one
that sent her away.

478
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,769
I know.

479
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,480
I think you'll want
these when you find her.

480
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,525
A bag of clothes?

481
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,485
You don't need a locator spell.

482
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,321
You're a wolf.

483
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,535
Hold on, we're almost there!

484
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,248
Dr. Saltzman

485
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,208
when she was inside my head,

486
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,336
making me do things...

487
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,105
All right, let's just worry
about you right now, okay, Jed?

488
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,798
I think I saw something.

489
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,134
A memory. I-I think
I know her name.

490
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,935
Nearby units, 10-33.

491
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,521
Possible alarm trip
at Mystic Falls High.

492
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,731
Uh, copy that.

493
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,191
Probably a false alarm.

494
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,151
Happens about once a month.

495
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,881
It's go time. Hey,
hold on, hold on.

496
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,281
You heard them.

497
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,991
They said it's
probably a false alarm.

498
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,993
Or it's what I've
been talking about.

499
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,578
Another powerful creature.

500
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,955
I've seen my mom's files.
Our high school has

501
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,583
a weird history of
unexplained events.

502
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,920
Then I'll go.

503
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,881
I'm sorry, but you
said it yourself.

504
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,133
You're just a human sidekick.

505
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,287
Who's there?

506
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,083
I can smell you.

507
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,044
Invisique saeclum.

508
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,671
I-I'm sorry.

509
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,524
I didn't know that you were
a werewolf. I thought...

510
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,425
Who are you? Uh,
it's complicated.

511
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,388
You came here to
turn. I'll help you.

512
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,474
No. Run!

513
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,871
Please tell me Dorian
has at least one

514
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,038
magical object in this...

515
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,749
Very funny.

516
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,101
Lizzie?

517
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,245
What the hell are
you doing here?

518
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,896
I was able to lure it away.

519
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,707
Werewolves are always
gonna chase vampires first.

520
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,107
You have to get out of here.

521
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,276
We're getting out of here.

522
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,320
You take the back exit.
I'll lure it out the front.

523
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,198
MG, I...

524
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,699
Go.

525
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,031
I know your instincts

526
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,492
are telling you to
bite me right now,

527
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,244
but you can fight it.

528
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,013
We don't have to
hurt each other.

529
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,162
Not bad for a sidekick, huh?

530
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,404
I know who you were
before you died.

531
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,947
Kaelan.

532
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,576
My Old Irish is a little rusty,

533
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,953
but this is from
the Clan Kinelarty.

534
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,330
From the year 1014.

535
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,749
Very good, but you're too late.

536
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,554
I know what happened
to your son!

537
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,350
What did you say?

538
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,101
Your son.

539
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,938
Drystan.

540
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,482
The one they took from you.

541
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,776
Don't listen to him. He's lying!

542
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,611
How old was he when
the English took him

543
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,796
from you to fight in their wars?

544
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,614
11? 12?

545
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,741
And you never knew
what happened to him.

546
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,910
No, don't listen! He survived.

547
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,288
He survived the battle.

548
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,291
Tell me!

549
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,211
There was a survey done
in England 50 years later

550
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,963
called the Domesday Book.

551
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,757
He's here.

552
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,759
Living in a small village.

553
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,970
Drystan... Kinelarty.

554
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,847
He lived a long time, too. Look.

555
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,307
Just below his name, he had...

556
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,101
Children.

557
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,228
Grandchildren.

558
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,231
One of them was named after you.

559
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,860
I'm so sorry.

560
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:12,156
I can only imagine if
somebody took my child

561
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,033
and I never knew what
happened to them.

562
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,996
They shouldn't have left
you to grieve like that.

563
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,207
No one should have to
grieve alone like that.

564
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,013
Thank you.

565
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,391
You can sleep now.

566
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,478
I know why Malivore wants Cleo.

567
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,478
You just gave me
a weapon, buddy.

568
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,538
Hope, thank you.

569
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,375
Like I said,
nobody's dying today.

570
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,754
Let's get you home.

571
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,945
I suppose it was a good thing

572
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,197
you were there to keep me safe.

573
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,972
After I put you in danger.

574
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,935
Look, what I said before.

575
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:08,106
It was true that was how I felt,
but it's not the whole truth.

576
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,816
I know I've been distracted

577
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,152
and-and not in the best of
moods since you got here,

578
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,612
but that has nothing
to do with you.

579
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,489
Because the truth
is that you are

580
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,407
a kind and brilliant badass,

581
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,785
and I'm lucky to have
you as my friend.

582
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,287
As far as I'm concerned,
this is your home.

583
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,248
No matter what.

584
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,293
Even if it brings danger?

585
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,855
We're kind of used
to that around here.

586
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,715
And what of that creature?

587
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,676
It must be working for Malivore.

588
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,512
Our monster problem
is multiplying.

589
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,931
Why do you think it ran away?

590
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,559
I don't know, but

591
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,811
something about
it felt familiar.

592
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,480
Almost like I've
fought it before.

593
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,614
Werewolves.

594
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,241
Who knew, right?

595
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,243
I did kind of call it.

596
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,745
I mean, it was no
supervillain, but

597
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,998
that thing was pretty
scary either way.

598
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,417
I get why you wanted
me to stay behind.

599
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,252
I'd be dead if you had.

600
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,504
And then I never would've
saw this sweet hero base

601
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,298
you've been working on.

602
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,675
That's what sidekicks
are for, right?

603
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,347
Actually

604
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,434
you're not really
sidekick material, E.

605
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,603
But I'm gonna need
you to go ahead

606
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,396
and make another one
of those janky masks.

607
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,315
I have a feeling
you're gonna need it.

608
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,193
Partner.

609
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,785
I'm gonna need a superhero name.

610
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,455
Now I will handle the
hero names, all right?

611
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,916
Okay.

612
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,043
Uh, first things first, partner.

613
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,755
What are we gonna do about

614
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,549
her?

615
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,940
That bad, huh?

616
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,114
Finch is

617
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,993
seeing somebody else.

618
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,621
And it's really serious.

619
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,749
I'm afraid you'd just
get your heart broken.

620
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,711
That's okay.

621
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,922
You just saved me
months of spiraling.

622
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,762
But I should've let you
find out on your own.

623
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,849
I'm sorry.

624
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,018
I guess I just felt like

625
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,813
maybe you

626
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,815
didn't need me anymore.

627
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,067
Believe me,

628
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,236
I know the feeling.

629
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,290
Does twin code say anything

630
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,668
against cuddling after
one twin has moved out?

631
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,045
It's encouraged, actually.

632
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,351
So much for this
being a good day.

633
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,270
There's still another
monster out there,

634
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,063
and I'm gonna get
zero sleep worrying

635
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,190
that what the banshee
said is gonna come true.

636
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,943
All's well that ends well.

637
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,737
Easy for Shakespeare to say.

638
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,447
He's dead.

639
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,824
The rest of us actually
have to work to be positive.

640
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,868
Now I feel so much
pressure, you know?

641
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,786
Like I have to be
happy no matter what.

642
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,455
Like, I'm afraid that if...

643
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,499
The happiness went away,
it might never come back?

644
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,002
But it will. I promise.

645
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,590
We just have to find
the moments of happiness

646
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,008
between the monsters.

647
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,893
And screw fate, you know?

648
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,145
Screw fate.

649
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,951
Dr. Saltzman told
me what happened.

650
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,953
Your plan worked.

651
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,372
Seriously?

652
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,207
You underestimate yourself.

653
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,793
Because of you, the
banshee found peace.

654
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,127
And you have reclaimed

655
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,129
your rightful
place in the Squad.

656
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,090
Thanks for believing in me.

657
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,928
When you were inside her mind,

658
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,430
did you discover why
Malivore wants me?

659
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,099
Not right away.

660
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,433
It was kind of hazy.

661
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,310
I didn't understand
what it meant,

662
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,145
but now I think I get it.

663
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,231
Because I have literally

664
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,733
never had a genius
monster-hunting idea

665
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,027
until I was standing
next to you.

666
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,369
This part of the
job I did not miss.

667
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,914
To Kaelan.

668
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,963
And now

669
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,090
it's your turn with this thing.

670
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,943
Oh, you still don't know
where it came from, huh?

671
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,845
No, but today's still a win.

672
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,264
We know why
Malivore's after Cleo.

673
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,224
She's a Muse.

674
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,810
A Muse?

675
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,146
Like inspiration muse?

676
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,231
A witch who's the
seventh daughter

677
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,191
of a seventh daughter

678
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,069
has a special magical
power, the power

679
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,529
of inspiration.

680
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,365
Why does Malivore
need inspiration?

681
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,409
He has a problem
he needs to solve.

682
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,619
If I had to guess,

683
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,581
he's looking for a way
out of the prison world.
