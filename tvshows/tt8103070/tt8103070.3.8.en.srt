she shattered the Sandclock,

down this school,

I swore I'd always
have his back.

164

give up on Landon, which is

00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,706
before the truth about him
hiding the ascendant came out.

166
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,530
Now that it has...

167
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,241
It seems you cannot keep one vow
without breaking the other.

168
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,993
Boom.

169
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,580
So... unless there's some
third option I'm not seeing,

170
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,108
I'm-a just stay Switzerland
till I can figure something out.

171
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,382
I have an idea.

172
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,134
LIZZIE:
Well, at least
one thing is clear.

173
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,096
You certainly put the "ass"
in "astral projection."

174
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,306
If Landon had left
you a message,

175
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,142
why haven't MG or I seen it

176
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,353
on any of our recon missions?

177
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,979
That's what we're here
trying to figure out,

178
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,232
so maybe try helping.

179
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,109
You know, you're
not the only one

180
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,320
who lost a boyfriend
in a tragic prison world mishap.

181
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,698
So you want
to compare losses now?

182
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,783
I guarantee you
that's not a fair fight.

183
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,743
We're comparing blind spots,

184
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,871
and you definitely
have one for Landon.

185
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,082
Just like I had
one for Sebastian.

186
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,584
I couldn't see things clearly
like everyone else.

187
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,837
I was in so deep.

188
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,714
That's it.

189
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,258
You've astral projected
here before.

190
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,261
So you can tell me
the things that I'm not seeing.

191
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,221
Anything that's changed.

192
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,248
I'm telling you, there
is nothing diff...

193
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,185
Wait.

194
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,461
This is new.

195
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,064
It looks like a note or...

196
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,858
A message.

197
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,360
But it's not there anymore.

198
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,653
Maybe a gargoyle ate it?

199
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,654
(wind whistling)

200
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,573
Or the wind blew it away.

201
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,992
I mean, that thing
could be anywhere.

202
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,785
Not really.

203
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,956
Every day in a prison world
is the same day, right?

204
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,877
Which means the wind
always does the same thing.

205
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,128
Look.

206
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,029

207
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,364

00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,427
Helpful.

LIZZIE: That's super impersonal.

212
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,807
That doesn't sound
like Landon to me.

213
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,017
Would you get down here

214

and help me read the next line?

215

"My name is Landon Kirby."

216
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,804
I knew it.

217

Lizzie, he's alive.
This is proof.

218

Then let's get home
so I can give you a tissue.

which we can use to
power the ascendant.

Hold on, you guys are going

Dr. Saltzman,
that's way too risky.

We need more time.
HOPE: Well, if you
hadn't been lying to us

Landon is, exactly?

We don't know.

242
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,156
Once we are
physically in the prison world,

243
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,946
then we can do a locator spell.

incredibly dangerous mission

has to be conducted on a

But you also know me,

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,816

I wouldn't do

or anyone at this school,
even Jed.

262
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,406
So why do you think

263
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,746
I've been lying this whole time?

264
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,956
Lizzie and I astral
projected into this world.

265
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,336
I've seen its horrors
with my own eyes.

266
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,206
If we open a door to it,

267
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,626
we could be marching right
into one of Malivore's traps.

268
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,676
Or worse, giving him
exactly what he wants.

269
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,006
A way into our world.
HOPE: What Malivore wants

270
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,007
is Landon.

271
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,426
Always has, always will.

272
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,596
Which is why we need
a better plan.

273
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,266
Otherwise, we will be trading
a life of someone here for him.

274
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,526
Why do you think we all fought

275
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,960
so hard to lock Malivore away
in the first place, Hope?

276
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,406
We can't screw that up.

277
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,826
And if Landon were here, I'm
sure that he'd agree with me.

278
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,696
Well, he's not. And
if you were trapped,

279
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,036
he'd risk his life to save you.

280
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,116
That goes for any of you.

282

we shouldn't go after Landon.

283
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,256
We just have to be
smart about it.

284
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,006
And what you're talking
about right now,

285

it's not smart.

It's desperate.

287
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,426
I know I'm not the leader
of the Super Squad,

288
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,846
but I did lead the fight

289
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,266
that saved this school
from Triad.

290
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,316

that put Malivore

where he's at right now.

292

In my belief,
magic is neither good or bad.

326
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,696
Its alignment,
positive or negative,

327
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,100
is set off by the
user's intention.

328
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,206
So I guess that's
how you intend to help me

329
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,206
with my vows... plural... to MG.

330
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,206
And remind Hope
that my intentions towards her

331
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,426
have always been good.

332
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,570
I'm still not convinced
MG's were.

333
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,386
I understand you are angry
with your friend,

334
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,476
but saving Landon
will require action.

335
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
You cannot be
Switzerland forever.

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,236
Um, speaking of action,

337
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,856
Super Squad meeting
started about ten minutes ago,

338
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,130
so I got to...

339
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,906
(sighs) I'll think on it.

340
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,140
I promise.

341
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,786
ALARIC:
Malivore's not the only threat

342
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,496
we need to worry about.

343
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,586
Let's not forget,
The Necromancer is trapped

344
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,216
inside the prison world as well,

345
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,046
and he is notorious
for holding a grudge.

346
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,886
I wish we had more time,

347
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,676
but these planets aren't
gonna wait for us, so if we're

348
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,596
gonna do this, we need to
get prepared immediately.

349
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,726
Which means you all need
to make the decision

350
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,120
that's right for you.

351
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,856
Sorry I'm late.

352
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,856
I miss anything important?
No, you're just in time.

353
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,106
Are you coming with us
to the prison world

354
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,316
to save Landon or not? Uh...

355
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,066
Where's MG?
ALARIC:
He's not joining us,

356
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,800
here or there.

357
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,036
So, if I go, I'm just
doing him dirty like he did us.

358
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,576
And if I stay, I'm still
screwing him over.

359
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,326
And Landon. Sounds like a no.

360
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,150
Moving on. Wade?

361
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,046
Well, as a general rule,

362
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,706
I tend to avoid situations

363
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,376
that will probably lead
to my untimely demise,

364
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,006
but Gaby and I

365
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,296
really need a DM
for our next campaign,

366
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,596
and-and Landon's the only one
that's any good at it.

367
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,500
S-So, yeah, I'm-I'm Team Hope.

368
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,620
Let's go get our boy.

369
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,396
JED:
The pack's a lot smaller
these days,

370
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,856
but I'll rally all the wolves
I've got left.

371
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,146
As long as the witches
stop spelling

372
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,486
scarlet letters onto my shirts.

373
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,616
Wow.

374
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,156
I think that can be arranged.

375
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,576
Elizabeth?

376

LIZZIE: It's risky for sure,

377
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,400
and if I need to make a decision
right here, right now...

378
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,626
...I'm with MG. HOPE: What?

379
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,716
N-No. You're the only
Gemini witch we have.

380
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,256
If you don't activate
the ascendant,

381
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,886
then this whole thing
falls apart.

382
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,006
Maybe it should.

383
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,676
You know, maybe he's right.

384
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,556
I'm sorry, Hope.

385

We'll find another way.

Um, some people go mini-golfing
on their first official date.

389
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,550
Please tell me
you're not one of those people.

Sorry. I was just thinking about

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,166
how your disdain for my favorite
sport makes us incompatible.

394

Yeah, I'm seeing that.

395
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,626
Because the only
thing we can agree on

396
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,320
is that we want to go on a date.

397
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,466
So how about a ditch date?

You mean, like, right now?

Listen, headmaster's daughter,
I know it goes against

headband and all,

Mmm. And pretty cute when you're
thinking about being wild.

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,606
I mean, I didn't really
have a choice.

485
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,316
Lizzie bailed on me

486
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,276
and you're the only other
Gemini witch I know.

487
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,156
Yeah, in theory. Except I don't
have my magic and you know that.

488
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,776
Which sucks,

489
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,616
because a love potion
is about the only way

490
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,036
that Finch is ever
gonna talk to me again.

491
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,560
What if I could fix it?

492
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,916
I mean, not you
and Finch, but...

493
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,610
your magic.

494
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,466
If you take it back,
we can save Landon.

495
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,780
KALEB: I know I was trippin'...

there was no need.

497

Lizzie put the kibosh
on Hope's rescue mission

498
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,726
for about another month, so,

499
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,436
all you and I got to
worry about now is that whole

500
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,130
"getting to know each other"
part.

501

Cleo. What the hell?

You all right? Yes.

503
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,066
That took far more out of me
than I expected.

504

527
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,656
I went into your head thinking

528

that you needed
someone to save you.

out of the darkness
and into the light.

Without magic,

538

monsters or drama.

539
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,726
Those things are
a part of you, Jo.

540
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,250
They always will be.
You can't run from them.

541
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,356
I could guilt-trip you
about the fact that

542
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,106
your walk on the dark side
led to the creation

543
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,276
of this prison world and
Landon being trapped there...

544
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,776
Which you kind of just did.
...but no one feels

545
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,236
more guilty about what happened
to him than I do.

546
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,576
So I'd rather just
focus on the good,

547
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,020
because that's
the Josie Saltzman that I know.

548
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,850
Thank you.

549
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,336
I just miss him.

550
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,416
I hate the position that
I'm putting you in, but...

551
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,860
You don't need to keep talking.

552
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,740
I've made my decision.

553
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,346
KALEB:
You don't have to worry about
the whole Josie thing.

554
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,136
Okay? Because we're gonna
get Landon back

555
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,646
in the land of the living before
Hope can say "abracadabra."

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,436
You two captured this thing?

557

KALEB: Uh, yeah.

558
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,630
More or less.

559
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,526
Well, let's start with the more.

560
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,616
Uh... I summoned it,

561
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,776
Dr. Saltzman. No, look, look,

562
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,286
before you freak out,

563
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,696
you said that you wanted us
to catch a monster

564
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,206
to try to get some
more answers, right?

565
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,706
This one does more than that.

566
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,206
In theory.

567
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,876
But it will not accept money

568
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,666
in exchange for Landon's soul,
as we expected,

569
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,440
so we are in need
of your expertise.

570
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,846
Well, I'm a little rusty
when it comes

571
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,346
to psychopomps, but I think
I know what it wants.

572
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,386
Go get some of Landon's
personal items.

573
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,516
It'll need some of those to
identify his soul or whatever.

574
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,856
Nerd stuff. Copy that.
We're on it.

575
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,356
Oh, and, uh, Cleo?

576
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,816
Next time you want
to summon a monster,

577
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,896
just ask for permission
first, okay?

578
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,316
Now get moving.

579
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,170

I got to say,
a road trip was a great idea.

583
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,036
So, you gonna tell me
where we're headed?

584
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,456
(gas nozzle clunks) Um...

585
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,416
West. W-We need to go west.

586
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,086
MG:
I guess it doesn't matter
as long as we keep moving.

587
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,716
You gonna show me
what's on your mind?

588
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,216
It's a surprise. Let's
just get back on the road.

589
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,806
Lizzie, wait.

590
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,846
There's something
I need to say before we do.

591
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,556
It might be cheesy,

592
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,146
you'll probably make fun of me
for this later,

593
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,566
but you're my person,
Lizzie Saltzman.

594
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,316
You always have been
and you always will be.

595
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,316
I know. But I didn't know

596
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,526
that you had my back
the same way.

597
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,236
Not until today.

598
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,496
So I just wanted
to say thank you,

599
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,166
because I truly understand
just how much that means.

600
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,520
Can I just get a rain check
on this conversation?

601
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,256
I have so many things that
I want to explain to you,

602
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,506
and I regret all the times
that I let you down

603
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,466
or made you feel used.

604
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,096
And I promise that

605
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,710
I'm gonna try really, really
hard not to do it ever again.

608

Because Hope has Josie.

609
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,446
And we both know that

610
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,656
she won't stop
until she gets the ascendant.

611

So I'm sorry,

612

but if it's the only way
to save my sister, I'm...

613
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,246
I'm gonna give it to her.

00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,916
Not mine.

809
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,706
Not anymore.

810
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,256
You don't mean that.

811
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,756
Trust me.

812
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,296
I do.

813
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,006
Because if everybody

814
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,676
is gonna bail on me
when it matters most,

815
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,096
I have to bail

816
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,436
before it gets
to that point again.

817
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,516
Because I cannot bear
the thought

818
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,976
of watching you

819
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,646
or anyone else I love get hurt.

JOSIE: Does that mean I can go?

824
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,256
Well, according to these tests,

825
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,650
there are no traces
of black magic in your system.

826
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,546
So, technically,

827
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,716
you're safe to return
to Mystic Falls.

828
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,266
And it's still my choice, right?

829
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,186
Unless I have reason
to believe it shouldn't be.

830
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,016
If anything, last night was
a painful reminder

831
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,936
of why I need to distance myself
from this place.

832
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,526
Speaking of,

833
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,356
I did what you told me to and
I talked to Mom this morning.

834
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,406
She said that you guys
have a friend in town

835
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,656
with a room that I can use.

837
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,456

842
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,070
Maybe a little... sad.

843
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,676
But if I'm gonna

844
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,306
allow my students
to make their own decisions

845
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,806
about raiding a prison world
full of monsters,

846
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,846
the least I can do is

847
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,306
let my daughter
live the life she wants.

848
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,290
So long as she's safe doing it.

849
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,686
(chuckles)

850
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,010
Come on.

851
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,526
I'll give you a ride to school.

852
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,116
HOPE: So what do you remember?

853
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,406
LANDON: I remember us.

854
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,140
The last night we were together.

855
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,126
How perfect it was.

856
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,746
Until you dissolved
into a puddle of mud,

857
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,860
which I hardly
take as a compliment.

858
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,360
Then what happened?

859
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,740
Darkness.

860
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,766
After that...

861
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,976
(chuckles)

862
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,686
...darkness is the only
thing I can remember.

863
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,960
Makes you feel any better,
I know what Malivore is like.

864
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,316
Being so lonely, it's...

865
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,156
physically painful.

866
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,526
Deep down, I must've known
you were looking for me.

867
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,196
I'm guessing that's what made me
find my way back to you.

868
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,916
Technically,
we have Cleo to thank for that.

869
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,286
We should probably get her
a fruit basket or something.

870
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,586
(chuckles) She's the new girl?

871
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,586
And my roommate.

872
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:14,836
It was going great until we got
in this big fight. (chuckles)

873
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,546
I'll probably be spending more
time in your room from now on.

874
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,386
Mm, as long as we keep it PG-13.

875
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,966
What was your fight about?

876
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,766
When I was struggling,
while you were gone,

877
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,396
she kept pushing me
to find a way to move on.

878
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,726
And then she killed
the one thing

879
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,050
that I thought
might help me find you.

880
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,696
A leprechaun.

881
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,736
Oh, okay. Long story.

882
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,486
Anyway, doesn't matter.

883
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,536
'Cause I needed this.

884
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,600
Just being in your arms.

885
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,076
But?

886
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,230
I may have pissed off
a lot of people in the process.

887
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,546
I guess it runs in the family.

888
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,506
When I was little, my mom

889
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,596
was taken by
a group of vampires,

890
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,040
and my dad had to go to...
extreme lengths to get her back.

891
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,806
Things were never the same
after what he did.

892
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,566
Sounds like risking everything
for the people you love

893
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,800
is a classic Mikaelson move.

894
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,446
Always has been.

895
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,430
Forever will be.

896
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,986
You'll never have
to go through that again.

897
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,656
I promise.

898
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,996
Gonna hold you to that.

899
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,996
Now kiss me.
