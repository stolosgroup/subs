1
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:04,221
Previously on Legacies...
I love you, Hope Mikaelson.

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,876
Hope, what's happening?
Landon?!

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,052
I knew you were alive.
I could just feel it.

4
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:10,358
Long time no see.

5
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:11,707
Who or what are you?

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,056
I'm not who you think I am.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,666
I went through hell
to find you.

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,059
I am the son of Malivore.

9
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,495
We exist to destroy each other.

10
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:18,714
Are you breaking up with me?

11
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,063
Goodbye, Hope.

12
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:20,890
My dad built this school

13
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,022
for people like us.

14
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,024
Come with me.

15
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:27,505
That's what this vision quest
was about.

16
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,507
The way we
can finally defeat Malivore.

17
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,249
I have to become the Tribrid.

18
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:33,424
Where you headed?

19
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,209
To find another way
to kill Malivore.

20
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:36,166
Need a hand?

21
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,863
Landon?

22
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,041
What are you doing to him?

23
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,391
That is not Landon, Hope.

24
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:44,870
We want our friends back.

25
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,091
Fate's a bitch, isn't it?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

27
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,063
My friend!
Ah...

28
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:06,109
How is this possible?

29
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,981
How is any of this possible?

30
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,537
This world can be whatever
you want it to be, Cleo.

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,763
Malivore.

32
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,939
Don't look at me that way.

33
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:57,160
Your eternity can be one
of endless peace...

34
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,944
or misery.

35
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,773
Your paradise
or your hell.

36
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,514
It's your choice.

37
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:06,256
I would choose peace, but I
imagine it comes at a cost.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,171
Just one favor.

39
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:12,349
A single, inspired solution for
this little problem that I have.

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,178
What is the problem?

41
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,404
♪

42
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,807
Hello, Clarice.

43
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,069
God.

44
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:38,810
Sorry.

45
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,638
Unexpected side effect
of taking over Landon's body

46
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,336
is I now have all his memories.

47
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,207
Do you know
how many movies

48
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,382
this kid has seen?

49
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:46,992
At least he gives us
a shorthand.

50
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,820
I'd like to get this over with
as soon as possible.

51
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,170
Oh, come on.

52
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,519
You have to be
a little impressed

53
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,216
with how I tricked Landon
out of the darkness.

54
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,522
All it cost me was The
Necromancer's freedom.

55
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,393
Which it sounds like
he screwed up again.

56
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,221
Actually,
Ted did something noble.

57
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,657
Which I'm not even gonna try
explaining to you.

58
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,877
But I will explain this.

59
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,054
You're not
Hannibal Lecter.

60
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:07,752
You're the lamb.

61
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,667
You won't kill me.

62
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:12,061
You'd be killing him.

63
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,237
For all its
human fragility,

64
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,674
this vessel is
perfect in that way.

65
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:19,851
Well... I mean,
it's not that perfect.

66
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,375
You're gonna
give me proof

67
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,506
whether or not Landon's
still in there,

68
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,856
and you-- whatever--

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,380
because, you know, if not...

70
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:31,123
Look, I share your frustrations.

71
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,082
I want to kill you, too.

72
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,867
But doing that would only make
you a fully activated Tribrid.

73
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,695
We're at an impasse.
You're right.

74
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,220
I'm not gonna kill you until
I know that Landon's alive.

75
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,526
But I have no problem hurting
you until I know that he is.

76
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,572
In ways that
he'll heal from

77
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:45,921
and thankfully
won't remember

78
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:48,271
until I bring him back.

79
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,361
Does your headmaster know
you're planning on torturing me?

80
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,146
Do your friends?
Need-to-know basis.

81
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,453
But don't worry, I'm sure
that they'll come for you.

82
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,325
You know, once they hear you
start screaming.

83
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,421
I'm guessing you
didn't cast that spell.

84
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,904
I'm also guessing
that's not to keep me in here,

85
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,342
but to keep you out.

86
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,912
Dr. Saltzman, what the hell?

87
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,827
Well, this is awkward.

88
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,481
Nobody told me
that there was gonna be

89
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,917
a Super Squad meeting
this morning.

90
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,484
Just like
nobody told me

91
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,312
about the barrier spell
that was put up in the gym.

92
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,314
That's because this is
an emergency session

93
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,273
about how we're gonna deal
with Malivore.

94
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,101
And how you fit
into that plan.

95
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,625
Then I'm all ears. Plan away.

96
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,018
Not my plan.

97
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,284
Cleo's the key to all of this,

98
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,676
our problem being
that Landon--

99
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,635
Mali... Malivore...

100
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,289
Malidon?--

101
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,116
has consumed her.

102
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,335
Which means we
have to assume

103
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,206
that she's in the
belly of the beast,

104
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,425
in the pocket
dimension

105
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:58,428
inside of Mali... whatever.

106
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:01,213
Yeah, I've been there twice, so
you can skip to the actual plan.

107
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:05,653
If we can find Cleo,
she may be able to inspire us

108
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:08,220
with a way to get her out.

109
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,353
And what about Landon?

110
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:12,529
Took longer than I expected,
but there it is.

111
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:13,704
Does someone else

112
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:15,532
want to tell her, or should I?

113
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:16,490
Cleo's the target

114
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,013
of this mission.

115
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,537
Though we're
obviously hoping

116
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,366
she'll inspire a way
to save Landon, too.
Okay,

117
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,804
and how do we get inside
Malivore, besides him eating us?

118
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,806
Malivore thinks that being
inside of Landon's body

119
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,374
is protecting him,
but the way I see it,

120
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:35,160
that's his greatest weakness,
which Kaleb and I can exploit

121
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,727
with our vampire
strength.

122
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,903
Hmm. The exhaust port
on the Death Star.

123
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:40,209
Exactly.

124
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,168
Sorry.

125
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,692
It's a good plan.

126
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,694
Why didn't you guys
tell me sooner?

127
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,479
'Cause of the way you
are with things when
it comes to Landon.

128
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,915
Don't get us wrong,
you're our best weapon,

129
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,656
no doubt, but we get
one shot at this, Hope.

130
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,354
We can't have you
going off the rails

131
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,268
and blowing everything up.

132
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,531
I wouldn't do that.

133
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,883
Is that seriously
what you guys think?

134
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,279
We know you, Hope,

135
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,846
it's why we put up
the barrier spell

136
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,891
in the first place.

137
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:13,416
We thought maybe
you should sit this one out.

138
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,505
I'm totally on board.

139
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,942
Cleo is our best chance to bring

140
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:21,598
both her and Landon back--
I would never jeopardize that.

141
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,427
I'm really sorry that
you guys think that I would.

142
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,603
But I can help.

143
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:29,563
I will help,
so please, just let me.

144
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,089
I say we put it to a vote.

145
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,049
How could you?!

146
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,399
There is no way
I'm letting you

147
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,443
go through with this plan
without me.

148
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:41,531
Hope, stop!
You're hurting me.

149
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,228
Well, then I guess
we're even.

150
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:45,535
Because you always voting
against me hurts me, too.

151
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,103
Now, siphon that damn barrier
so we can do this my way.

152
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:57,591
What's this I hear
about a plan?

153
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,469
The Mystical Anatomy
of the Human Mind?

154
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,471
Hey, yeah, it's, um...

155
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,821
for a group project.

156
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,650
Which you clearly don't want
to tell me about.

157
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:16,653
Is that your thing?
'Cause it happens a lot.

158
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:19,134
I know. But it won't be forever.

159
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,092
There's just a lot
going on right now.

160
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,616
I'm gonna make it up to you.

161
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,488
Then you can start
with our bowling date tonight.

162
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,098
What's taking you so long?

163
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:30,145
Have you canceled
your date... yet?

164
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:31,320
Sorry.

165
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:32,495
Clearly a work
in progress.

166
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,497
So, thanks in advance

167
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,281
for understanding.
Pretty hard

168
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,674
to understand something
you know nothing about.

169
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:38,588
Trust me,

170
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,155
the less you know, the better.

171
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,765
Aren't you both being
a wee bit dramatic?

172
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:42,940
It's not a big deal.

173
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,638
I had to cancel with Ethan, too.

174
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,378
Except our date isn't canceled.

175
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:47,684
It's just rescheduled.

176
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,947
Once we finish this project.

177
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,514
Which will be soon.

178
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,124
I hope.
Just let me know, Jo.

179
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,691
That's all I'm asking.

180
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,957
This isn't gonna end well.

181
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,176
A head dive?

182
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:02,830
Seriously?

183
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,658
But, hey, if you
want to go charging

184
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,355
into a mental
trap, be my guest.

185
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:08,531
All right, Kaleb,
you're up.

186
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,707
I still think you
should let me go with you.

187
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,969
You don't know

188
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,144
what you're gonna run into
in there.

189
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:14,668
I do.

190
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,365
It's ugly.

191
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,716
You really think you're
just gonna stroll

192
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,718
into my mind
and rescue your students?

193
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,982
That's optimistic.

194
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,332
I'll have access
to your mind, too.

195
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:29,334
Yeah, I figured
this wouldn't be easy.

196
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:30,422
And that's why you both

197
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:31,423
will be watching Kaleb and I

198
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,424
while we're incapacitated.

199
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,730
If you see any signs

200
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:37,560
of trauma, or if Goth
Landon wakes up...

201
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,693
pull me out.
By the time

202
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,172
they see anything,
it'll be too late.

203
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,565
Dad.

204
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:43,914
Maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

205
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,177
Actually,
it's not bad.

206
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,093
I just wouldn't
call it inspired,

207
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,182
though, because you've made
one grave mistake:

208
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,054
I'm aware of what you're doing.

209
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,536
So you won't be entering
my subconscious mind.

210
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,755
You'll be dealing
with my conscious mind...

211
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,758
...which cannot wait
to torture yours.

212
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,107
Okay.

213
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,021
We should call this off.

214
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,719
Like hell.

215
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,590
But you definitely
need a wingman, Doc.

216
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:08,591
No.

217
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,288
We stick to the plan.

218
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:36,271
This is gonna be fun.

219
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,797
All right.

220
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:43,713
The coast is clear.

221
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,759
Invisique saeclum.

222
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,630
Do you think
he bought it?

223
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,240
I guess we'll find out.

224
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,286
Get us in there.

225
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,650
You were right-- this
is super unsettling.

226
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,957
Can't say it gets easier,
but the fact

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,306
that we're in the darkness

228
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:12,655
and not being attacked
by monsters

229
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,788
means that
your plan worked.

230
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,746
Dr. Saltzman and Kaleb
must be keeping

231
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,836
Malivore's conscious mind
distracted.

232
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,490
So...

233
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,015
...which way do we go?

234
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,843
We could vote on it,
but you know our headmaster's

235
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,584
not here to break the tie
this time.

236
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:30,717
All right.

237
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:33,850
Let the record show

238
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:37,288
that I voted for you,
too, and you won.

239
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,682
Have some trust
in the democratic process, Hope.

240
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,684
It still feels like
I lost the popular vote.

241
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:44,121
I mean, the only reason
why anyone trusts me to be here

242
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,471
is because you're
keeping an eye on me.

243
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,996
I mean, can you blame them?

244
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,867
You do have this...

245
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:55,872
habit of prioritizing Landon
at all costs.

246
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,700
I already said
I was sorry.

247
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:00,485
I mean, what more do you want me
to do to prove it to you?

248
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,705
If I had to guess,
I'd say find Cleo.

249
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,142
If that is what you want,
all you have to do

250
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,231
is stick to the plan.

251
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,711
Okay.

252
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,844
In that case,
your plan, your call.

253
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,672
Pick a
direction.

254
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:21,332
I guess I chose right.

255
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,726
Or wrong.

256
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,163
Could be a trap. It's a
classic Malivore move.

257
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,775
Either way,
I'll back you up.

258
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,693
♪

259
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,426
Kaleb.

260
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,646
What the hell
are you doing here?
Me?

261
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,083
Why the hell are you mopping?

262
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,780
Not important.

263
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,956
I specifically asked you
not to come.
Yeah.

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,957
Like I said, you clearly

265
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,264
could use a wingman.

266
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,619
Oh, man.

267
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,451
This is my high school.

268
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:37,800
Wasyour
high school.

269
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,802
Past tense.

270
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:42,413
We're in some sort of
merged consciousness

271
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:45,765
within his dimension.
Doc, I don't speak Malivore.

272
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:46,635
Where-where are the...
where are the monsters

273
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:47,810
and-and the darkness?

274
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,594
He said he has access
to our minds.

275
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,901
He obviously does,

276
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,120
because this
is a memory

277
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,730
you and I share.

278
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,777
The day we met.

279
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:09,092
You know what
won't help them?

280
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,833
Hovering.

281
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,966
Our job is to do nothing
unless there's a problem.

282
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,925
So maybe you should load up
on magic, like me,

283
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:18,841
and try to stay calm.
Can you stop telling me
how I should feel?

284
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,844
Okay.

285
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,933
You're clearly mad at me.
So what's up?

286
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,849
I didn't like the way that
you treated Finch earlier.

287
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,460
Sometimes you can be
really dismissive
about my relationships.

288
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,288
So what? It's not like
you and Finch are serious

289
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,463
or anything.

290
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,031
Well... not yet.

291
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,163
Hey.

292
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,729
What are you doing here?

293
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,993
Jed said you'd be in here,
and I thought,

294
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,996
if you can't come to the date,
the date can come to you.

295
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,477
Plus, I found this
ridiculous compatibility
quiz the three of us

296
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,392
can take to get to know
each other better.

297
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:51,700
You know, in case
we ever get serious.

298
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,879
There's got to be
some way out of here.

299
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,055
Damn, homecoming.

300
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,666
I remember this night
like it was yesterday.

301
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,060
You know I caught the
winning touchdown that night?

302
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,671
I'd probably be
going pro right now.

303
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,412
If you hadn't found me.

304
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,893
I think football would have been
the least of your problems.

305
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,764
What's that supposed to mean?

306
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,506
'Cause I fed on somebody
afterwards?

307
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,334
Let's not forget the part
where you almost killed me.

308
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,771
Which is a legit response
to a vampire hunter showing up

309
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,512
in your locker room
with a crossbow.

310
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,210
Which you knocked out
of my hands.

311
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,994
And then you pumped me up
with vervain

312
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,517
and dragged my ass
to the Salvatore School.

313
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,345
Memory over.

314
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,999
The point is, you didn't trust
that I could handle it--

315
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,088
kind of like coming
with you today.

316
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,091
I have only ever tried
to look after you, Kaleb.

317
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:41,228
Yeah, we're not going in there.

318
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:44,057
That's exactly what
he wants us to do.

319
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,754
But then we're not gonna find
another way out.

320
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,190
Doc, this night sucked.

321
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:49,584
Okay? But I keep telling you,
we're a team now.

322
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,249
Took you guys long enough.

323
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:06,470
Get lost in your own memory?

324
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,298
What do you want?

325
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,953
Just for our star wide-out
to know the full story.

326
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:12,912
You see, I've seen
into both your minds,

327
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,218
and there's a funny thing
about this particular memory

328
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:16,785
that you two share.

329
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,659
They don't exactly match up.

330
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,183
Yeah?

331
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,496
Cleo?

332
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,899
I invited them to dinner.

333
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,859
Oh, yeah.

334
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,165
That's...

335
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,818
exactly why we came here.

336
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:36,038
Right, Hope?

337
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,608
Well, if this is a trap,
at least it smells good.

338
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,052
So, Cleo, how are you?
Perfect.

339
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:51,880
Thank you for asking.

340
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,403
You know, I have a lot
that I want to ask you.

341
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,491
Do you need any help

342
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,015
with that, um, art project?

343
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,146
I just know that
when I need help,

344
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,149
I-I like to go
to my friends, so...

345
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,412
Hmm, that is wise,
but as I said,

346
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,370
I am good.

347
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:05,372
Ooh. I'm happy

348
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,243
you're adjusting so well.

349
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,029
It's just that, mm, some of
our other friends might not be.

350
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,682
Which, speaking of,
have you seen Landon recently?

351
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:14,076
I heard that he moved
to this neighborhood, so...

352
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,078
Uh, hey, I think
we came here

353
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,340
to visit Cleo.

354
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:19,255
Remember?

355
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,691
Then perhaps that was a mistake.

356
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:21,518
This is not
a good time.

357
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:22,606
Please go.

358
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,912
We just got here.

359
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,089
To hell with this plan!
There's no reason

360
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,091
to talk in riddles
or pass around fake food,

361
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,049
because none of this is real.

362
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,233
You should have left
when you had the chance.

363
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,365
Hey, say what you want,

364
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:43,453
we were there.

365
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,716
Then you won't mind a replay.

366
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,937
Let's review
some game-night footage.

367
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,548
It was neck and neck.

368
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:54,290
The ball's placed
just shy of midfield.

369
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,900
He's going deep.

370
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,728
He's breaking free.
He caught it!

371
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,121
He's at the 20, the ten...

372
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,731
Touchdown!

373
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,211
All-all right.
Enough with the "previously on."

374
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:05,258
I destroyed the Danville
Bucks, and then I fed.

375
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,911
It's not news.

376
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,913
Flag on the play. You did feed.

377
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:11,133
But it was just the appetizer.

378
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,798
No.

379
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,801
You're lying. I never did that.

380
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,151
Let's check
behind door number two.

381
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,291
It's all
coming back now.

382
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,945
How it felt that night.

383
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:44,949
So traumatic that
your mind repressed it.

384
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,169
That uncontrollable bloodlust.

385
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,432
Now, for fun,
let's crank it up a notch.

386
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,478
Make you feel it all over again.

387
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,003
No!
Kaleb,
it's time to abort.

388
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,614
Pull us out now.
I can't!

389
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,185
It's his mind--
he's got a hold on me!

390
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:07,015
You looking
for that vervain?

391
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:09,496
Slight rewrite. The real Landon
would say the remake

392
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,801
is never better
than the original,

393
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:12,629
but, I mean, I got to disagree.

394
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,461
I'm guessing this isn't part
of your rewrite.

395
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,071
I hate to leave,

396
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,856
but I'm pretty sure
I know how this ends.

397
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:24,206
Oh, one more thing I should have
mentioned back in the cage,

398
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,077
but if you die
within my consciousness,

399
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,167
it will severely damage
your mind in the real world.

400
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,342
Good luck.

401
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,605
He seems hungry.

402
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:35,391
"Would you rather...

403
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:37,480
"have a vacation home
in the mountains

404
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:40,004
or on the beach?"

405
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,354
Both.Both.

406
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,269
Jinx!
Jinx!

407
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,229
What?

408
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,188
We can't help it
that we're compatible.

409
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,538
Yet you've only known each other
for, like, three weeks.

410
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:52,843
Anyway,
mine's beach.

411
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,410
Not that you asked.

412
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:57,196
Okay, let's go
to another section. Oh.

413
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,850
The Five Qs of Love.

414
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,112
Number one.

415
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,114
Have you ever had
a relationship

416
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:06,857
that you were absolutely certain
was meant to be,

417
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,511
but it all turned out
to be a mirage

418
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:11,862
and broke your heart
because life is cruel?

419
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:13,864
You made that up.

420
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,692
And you don't need
to answer that.

421
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,216
No, it's okay.

422
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,260
Of course I have.

423
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,348
People are

424
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:22,351
constantly growing and changing.

425
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,266
You can't control it.

426
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,789
But...

427
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,269
you just have to hope
you're growing

428
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,053
in the same direction,

429
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,272
I guess.

430
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,231
I was just about
to say that, too.

431
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:37,018
My turn.

432
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,066
Oh, this is
an easy one.

433
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,331
"Where do you see yourself
on your 25th birthday?"

434
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,861
Did I say something wrong?

435
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,651
Oh, crap.

436
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,440
Nice try.

437
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,486
I'll be right back.

438
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,532
I've got a secret mission
to crash.

439
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,100
Leave me now. You have done

440
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:17,667
quite enough.We're not going
anywhere.

441
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,321
Hope,

442
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,280
this isn't in the playbook.
Sorry, but I've had

443
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,456
enough make-believe to fill up
this entire crappy black hole.

444
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:24,761
I know what it's like

445
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:25,980
to want to hold on
to what you love

446
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,198
even after it's gone.

447
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,330
I did it over
and over again,

448
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:30,419
from one fake Landon
to the next.

449
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,942
The lesson
that I learned is

450
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,857
that the illusion never lasts.

451
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,207
But what is real,
what does last,

452
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,949
no matter how many times you've
screwed it up, are your friends.

453
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,996
We came here to help you, Cleo.
I am so used

454
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,477
to having to fight for myself,
I did not believe

455
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,696
anybody would come for me.

456
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,350
You're Super Squad.

457
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,352
We never leave a member behind.

458
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,529
You once said that you
wanted us to be friends.

459
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,009
I want that, too.

460
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:57,359
I'm gonna stop at nothing
to bring you home,

461
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,405
but we need your muse powers
to lead the way.

462
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:04,453
I appreciate that more
than you can know, Hope, but...

463
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:07,195
You're too late.

464
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,720
Got to hand it to you,
it was a pretty good plan.

465
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,680
Drawing the eye of Sauron
away from the muse,

466
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:16,160
while the two of you slipped
into Mordor

467
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,162
through the back door.

468
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,164
Considering how many movies
this vessel has seen,

469
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,166
I probably should have seen
this one coming.

470
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,472
Well, then you should know
in those movies

471
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:24,995
that the good guys always win.

472
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,649
The good guys don't usually
blow the whole plan

473
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,042
in the second act.

474
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,565
The moment you broke up

475
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,045
that dinner party, you
alerted my consciousness.

476
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,527
Now, if you
don't mind--

477
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,745
pun definitely intended--

478
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,965
me and my muse got
to get back to it.

479
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,229
And you both have
somewhere to be, too.

480
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:54,547
MG?

481
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:56,636
MG?

482
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,429
Hope?

483
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,087
Are you okay?

484
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,610
I don't think so.

485
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,438
Where are we?

486
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,788
Malivore sent us back to
the night that you killed Landon

487
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,747
and activated his
phoenix powers.

488
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,618
But it's just a head dive.

489
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:23,880
None of it's real.

490
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,622
Then why does it feel real?

491
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,450
Hey, we can use this
to our advantage.

492
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,799
We know what happens next.

493
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,236
So if it feels real,
then my blood will, too.

494
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,282
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

495
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,112
At least not until you've heard
my offer.

496
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:51,734
Doc, I don't know
how long I can hold it.

497
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:54,302
The hunger's too strong.
I need to feed.

498
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,478
Just breathe, okay?
Let it pass.

499
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,742
I killed all those people.

500
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:02,484
Why didn't
you tell me?

501
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:03,572
'Cause you didn't need to know.

502
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:05,269
What matters is
right now, okay?

503
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:06,662
And that you can beat this.

504
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,123
Landon?

505
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,647
In the flesh.

506
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,605
Well, not technically.

507
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:39,347
Which is how you were able to
feed on me and I'm totally fine.

508
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:43,177
That's my theory, anyways.

509
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,180
How did... how did you find us?

510
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,790
This place was lighting up
the darkness like a beacon.

511
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,836
When I saw you two in trouble,
I just jumped in.

512
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,490
I don't know,
I didn't think much past that.

513
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:03,850
Landon Kirby.

514
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,722
Finally.

515
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:10,509
How long have I been gone?

516
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,861
The answer's here somewhere.

517
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,558
Rezvendas.

518
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,994
I don't understand.

519
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,648
We should be able
to pull them out.

520
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:20,997
It's Malivore.

521
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,521
He's keeping the head dive
in place.

522
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,523
So Malivore is
this group project?

523
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,698
We were trying
to sneak into his dimension,

524
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,090
but now
everyone's stuck.

525
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,701
Do you have any other questions?

526
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:32,661
Just one. How can I help?

527
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,576
This is strictly
witch territory.

528
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,579
Got it. This spell that
can sever any mental connection.

529
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,102
But it's a chain spell,

530
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,191
so we can only draw magic
from a person,

531
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:42,366
not the school.

532
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,631
Taking this much
can be dangerous.

533
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,850
We don't have
a choice.

534
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,460
Siphon me.

535
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,770
As much as you need.

536
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,424
Hard pass.

537
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,469
I haven't offered
you anything yet.

538
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:00,210
Don't bother.
All I care about is MG.

539
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,777
That's cute, but we both know

540
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,474
you care
about more than just him.

541
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:05,607
Look, I know that
this is supposed to be

542
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,566
mental torture and all,

543
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,611
but this is the night
that I chose to save MG's life,

544
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,221
after he'd just murdered
my boyfriend,

545
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,049
so I don't know
if you can compete with that.

546
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,747
I don't know,
I'm pretty competitive.

547
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,402
All right, have it your way.

548
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:20,491
I'll even help.

549
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,412
Yeah, no, I feel nothing.

550
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,762
Well, I feel better.

551
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:31,938
I've been wanting to do that
all day.

552
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:34,593
Okay, here's what I want to do.

553
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,811
Offer you that deal.

554
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,639
Just for kicks.

555
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,641
Landon's here, Hope.

556
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,730
You're lying.

557
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:45,081
Okay, not herehere,
but out there,

558
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,953
in the darkness.

559
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:49,433
He and I share a mind, remember?

560
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:51,610
He's waiting for
you to rescue him,

561
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,829
like always.

562
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,744
I'm not gonna let you
manipulate me.

563
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,964
I respect the resistance,
but come on, Hope,

564
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,096
I'm giving you
the only thing you ever want.

565
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,665
Hell, I'll even make it easier.
You follow that path...

566
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,974
...it'll lead you straight
back to Landon.

567
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:10,324
In the darkness.

568
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,021
Beggars can't
be choosers.

569
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,938
I promise,

570
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:19,028
the time you spend with him
won't just seem real.

571
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,989
It will be.

572
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,776
But this is
a limited-time offer.

573
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,039
Stop doing that.
Just leave MG to me and go.

574
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,867
Because once
those lights are gone,

575
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:34,043
your chance to find Landon

576
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,045
will be, too.

577
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,178
♪

578
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,886
Are you sure you want to do
this? It can be really painful.

579
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,801
I'm dating a Gemini, right?

580
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,498
Got to get siphoned
at some point.

581
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,544
I never told you
I was a Gemini witch.

582
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:58,677
But I told you
I was nosy.

583
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,375
I've been asking around.

584
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:02,898
Researching.

585
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,987
That's why you were
in the library?

586
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,033
You could have just asked me.
I would have,

587
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,035
if you weren't
always running off

588
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:10,384
on some super
secret mission.

589
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,691
So I found a really
interesting book

590
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:16,172
on your coven,
but there were pages ripped out

591
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:18,044
in the section
about Gemini twins.

592
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:20,916
That's really weird.
I know.

593
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,702
And I doubt it was an accident.
I'm sorry to break up

594
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,442
this conversation,
but we're good to go.

595
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:35,365
Anima Dimittere.

596
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,541
Animo creverunt.

597
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,282
Anima Dimittere.

598
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:41,371
Wow. That is a lot to process.

599
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:42,764
How many fake
me's were there?

600
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:43,983
Three?
Two.

601
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:46,855
Uh, it's a long story.

602
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:48,901
Yeah, but you're not
about to miss any more.

603
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,076
'Cause your girl is
working on a way...Shh, shh.

604
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,731
No details.

605
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,124
Everything I know, he knows.

606
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,650
The point is,
Hope is on the case.

607
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,435
That's the problem.

608
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,219
What I just heard

609
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,960
were all the ways that Hope,

610
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:07,963
you guys, everyone
has put themselves in danger

611
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,052
one way or another
because of me.

612
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,098
Landon, this...

613
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,622
this is not your fault.
Man, it's Malivore, man.

614
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,145
I keep saying,

615
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,452
that bitch is everywhere.
He and I

616
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,410
share a body and a mind.

617
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,630
I keep playing it out
in my head,

618
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,066
and every which way I try,

619
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,242
I keep coming
to the same conclusion.

620
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:27,940
As long as I am the
only viable vessel

621
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,681
for Malivore,
this ends one of two ways:

622
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:32,814
my body dead...

623
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:35,469
or Hope becoming the Tribrid.

624
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:40,691
I will do anything to avoid
one of those endings.

625
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:43,956
We can't let that happen
to Hope.

626
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,914
If we kill your body,

627
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,657
that'd be closing the last door
in or out of Malivore.

628
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,791
You'd be trapped here.

629
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,010
Yeah.

630
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,146
It'll suck.

631
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:01,843
But infinite nothingness beats
some of the things

632
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,802
I've been through in my life.

633
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,892
I'll cope.

634
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,900
When the time comes...

635
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:19,252
...do it.

636
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,430
Promise me.

637
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,876
This is taking longer
than I thought.

638
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,400
Shut up.
Damn.

639
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,011
Do you have any idea
how much effort

640
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:40,534
it must have taken
for him to manage that?

641
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,014
I'm almost rooting
for you now, buddy.

642
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:44,146
So what is it
gonna be, Hope?

643
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,887
You gonna heal him?

644
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:47,933
You gonna go
after Landon?

645
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,501
I guess the choice
wasn't clear.

646
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,373
I can't let you do both.

647
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,900
What happens to him
if I go?

648
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,859
It's not your problem.

649
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,382
You'll have Landon.

650
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:06,212
Isn't that
what you want?

651
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,569
It's...

652
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:18,877
it's okay, Supergirl.

653
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,530
I get it.

654
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,794
If he thinks you are Supergirl,

655
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:25,884
then we have officially reached
the delusional stage.

656
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,150
You're really cutting it close.

657
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:34,501
You're so sure of my decision.

658
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,941
Why wouldn't you be?
I've proven over and over again

659
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,464
that it's
always gonna be Landon.

660

I'm so sorry, MG.

661

Oh, well, whatever.

662
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,483
The next round of torture
is going to be even worse.

663
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,311

664
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:04,835
Why even offer me a deal?
What do you want?

665
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:06,794
Yeah, see?

666
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:10,015
I'm torturing you already.

667
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,983
Hope, what happened
in there?

668
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,985
We found Cleo.

669
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,161
But we didn't get
the answers we wanted.

670
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:28,076
Did you find
anything?

671
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,948
Any sign of Landon?

672
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:32,951
No.

673
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,344
No, we didn't.

674
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,844
I know today was rough,
but, um,

675
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:59,107
I didn't know it was
ice cream rough.

676
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,154
Yeah, it's my... my second.

677
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,852
I just figured I'd
come up here and...

678
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:07,376
reminisce about simpler times.

679
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,815
You know, when my boyfriend
wasn't a sadistic jackass.

680
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,903
So please

681
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,340
come on in,

682
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,863
save me from myself.

683
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,299
Pretty sure
you were the one

684
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,084
doing all the saving today.

685
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:23,175
Well, we're still down
two Squad members,

686
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:24,872
so let's face it,

687
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:27,135
we got our asses kicked today.

688
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,659
I respectfully disagree.

689
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,183
The way I see it,
we won--

690
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,055
not the war,
but an important battle.

691
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,492
Malivore
was just toying with us.

692
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,581
I mean, we don't even know
what he wants.

693
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,018
What he wants

694
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,150
is to drive a wedge between us,

695
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,065
to turn us all
against each other,

696
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,675
to isolate you.

697
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,678
Which makes us all weaker.

698
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:51,072
How do you know?

699
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,944
'Cause that's what bullies do.

700
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,208
And he failed.

701
00:33:56,251 --> 00:34:01,082
We are more together than
we have been in a long time.

702
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,693
Especially...

703

Okay,

705
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:10,265
Mr. Bright Side,

706
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,963
your plan today was
brilliant, so...

707
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:15,749
tell me, what do we do next?

708
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,926
I don't know.

709
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,363
But as long as

710
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,757
we do it together,
we'll beat him.

711
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:27,587
If I were him, I'd be scared.

712
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,591
I bet Cleo's scared, too.

713
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:36,117

your relationship.

813
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,378
I do it with my sister, too.

814
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,554
Well...

815
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:01,556
I've had enough therapy sessions
with Emma

816
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,254
to know that this is
the part where I ask:

817
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:06,387
why do you think that is?

818
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:09,390
Because you guys...

819
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:12,524
have something
that I never really had...

820
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:16,702
...but I'm pretty sure
that I want.

821
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,443
Love.

822
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:22,403
The kind
that is soft

823
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:26,320
and builds on mutual respect,
that grows over time...

824
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:31,020
...and becomes something
that I would do anything for.

825
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,501
Maybe you should be
having this conversation

826
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:36,417
with MG, not me.

827
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,420
I made it pretty clear to him
that I was open for business,

828
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,554
but... he hasn't come around.

829
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,861
Ethan has.

830
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:47,559
Josie said
he asked you on a date.

831
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,865
Which I promptly canceled.

832
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:53,652
Okay, well,
maybe you should un-cancel.

833
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,437
With everything that's going on,

834
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:59,397
do you really think
that I'm ready for that?

835
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:01,616
No.

836
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,618
But...

837
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:06,055
I don't think anybody's ever
ready for that kind of love.

838
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,448
It just...

839
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,276
happens.

840
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:12,584
And then you try and hold
on to it for dear life.

841
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,543
But when it gets hard,

842
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:17,763
which... it will get hard,

843
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,592
know that
your friends

844
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,507
will always be there for you.

845
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,814
Speaking of,

846
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,642
do you mind staying
for a bit,

847
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:30,123
just until I fall asleep?

848
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,488
Show yourself.

849
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:50,273
There is something
we need to discuss.

850
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:54,495
I like the sound of that.

851
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,499
Has inspiration already struck?

852
00:40:58,543 --> 00:40:59,848
Yes.

853
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,633
But not for you.

854
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:03,983
Then for who?

855
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,343
It's a Squad thing.

856
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,519
You wouldn't understand.

857
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,654
Here's what
I understand:

858
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,960
how to make you suffer.

859
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:26,484
Maybe that'll
inspire you

860
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,311
to give me what I want.

861
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:31,532
Do your worst.

862
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:35,536
I only need to endure it
till my friends rescue me.

863
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,197
Hope? What's wrong?

864
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,155
Nothing.

865
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,636
I'm feeling
very inspired.

866
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,465
I have an idea.

866
00:41:52,305 --> 00:42:52,161
