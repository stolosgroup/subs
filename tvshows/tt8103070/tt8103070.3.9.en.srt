1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,383
(speaking German)

2
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,016
(loud banging on door) (gasps)

4
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,257
Put the heaters away, boys.

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,344
This guy's a scientist,
not a soldier.

6
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,537
Now, toss the place and find it.

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,877
Before der Führer
beats us to it.

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,566
(chalk writing on chalkboard)

9
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,186
ALARIC: I guess
the saying is true.

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,646
Those who don't learn
from history

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,656
are doomed to repeat it.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,906
LANDON: Actually, the original
quote is from George Santayana,

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,236
who said, "Those who do not
remember the past

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,286
are condemned to repeat it."

15
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,826
Not that it really matters.

16
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,376
(chuckles)

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,036
It's good to have you
back, Landon.

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,586
But the monsters are back, too.

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,796
Yeah, I always miss
the good ones.

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,926
Like, first there was the mummy,
and then, and then a minotaur,

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,006
and now a leprechaun?

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,756
What did it want?
We believe Malivore sent it

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,596
to retrieve the Ascendant.
Makes sense.

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,476
Malivore can't meatsuit me
if he's stuck in a prison world,

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,846
so of course he wants a way out.

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,170
That's not happening
on my watch.

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,106
Our watch.

28
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,526
Landon's safe.

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,066
But the rest of us...
not so much.

30
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,696
It's like you said,
history repeating itself,

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,576
doom... whatever.

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,536
With the Ascendant destroyed,

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,456
the monsters may be
after Landon now.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,246
So let's focus.

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,286
After the leprechaun
came the Ferryman,

36
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,246
which Cleo summoned
to bring you back home.

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,126
Which is why I nominate Cleo
for the Super Squad.

38
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,926
More like nominate yourself
into her pants.

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,546
All in favor?

40
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,296
We're not exactly
on great terms,

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,546
but she brought
Landon back to me,

42
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,556
so she has my vote.

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,886
Well, that's a majority.
Motion passes.

44
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,686
Is it? Where is everyone?

45
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,306
Like, Josie and MG and, and...

46
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,226
the rest of the students?

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,396
Well, we've been having some
enrollment issues. (chuckles)

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,986
Yet another reason to get this
monster problem all sorted out.

49
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,776
Well, if history has
taught us anything,

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,196
it's that we need to find
whatever portal they're coming

51
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,036
out of and seal it up.
LIZZIE:
How?

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,496
By stepping in every puddle
in town and seeing

53
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,076
if we wind up in
an alternate hell dimension?

54
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,126
ALARIC: Well, I'm glad you
asked, Elizabeth, because that's

55
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,416
your assignment today.

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,046
If Cleo can summon a monster,

57
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,416
it stands to reason
she can summon another.

58
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,216
Perhaps a harmless one
who will talk

59
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,586
and give us answers
once we capture it.

60
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,716
Now, I expect you all
to work together while I'm gone,

61
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,000
harmoniously.

62
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,856
Wait, where you going that's
more important than this?

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,936
I'm going to see a supernatural
scholar about another lead.

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,236
We will summon this monster
when I get back.

65
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,800
Now, remember: harmoniously.

66
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,196
JOSIE: I can't even look at you
right now.

67
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,616
I mean, what kind
of mystery meat is that?

68
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,336
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm not sure.

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,916
But whatever it takes to fit in

70
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,086
on my first day. Good luck.

71
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,546
Mystic Falls is clique-ier
than The Salvatore School,

72
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,926
which has actual factions.

73
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,306
Over there is where
the jocks sit

74
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,660
with the mean girl cheerleaders.

75
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,516
Well, she doesn't look
so mean to me.

76
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,436
Tori Thompson? Please.

77
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,816
The LARPers and comic book geeks
sit over there.

78
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,316
It's probably more your speed.

79
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,276
Well, maybe at our last school,
but here,

80
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,946
we can be as cool
as we want to be.

81
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,656
How cool is that, exactly?

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,866
I see myself trying out
for the football team...

83
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,406
(female voices echoing)

84
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,576
...because Tori Thompson is
totally into me.

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,996
(laughs)

86
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,666
Yeah, she just told her friend.

87
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,626
Knock it off. No vamp powers.

88
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,546
Relax, they don't even know.

89
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,216
Yeah, and we need to
keep it that way

90
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,546
or my dad is going to
yank us out of this school

91
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,296
so fast our heads
are gonna spin.

92
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,966
Okay, he's probably lurking
in the parking lot right now.

93
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,516
You're being paranoid.

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,120
Please, just try being
human with me.

95
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,896
Okay, fine. No powers.

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,316
But if this place is
so important to you,

97
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,146
why are we sitting here alone?

98
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,106
Mind if I join you guys?

99
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,446
Looks like there's
plenty of room.

100
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,100
That'd be cool, right?
Yeah, sure.

101
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,206
I'm MG.

102
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,286
I remember, from that
flag football game.

103
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,416
You transferred here, too? Yeah.

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,916
And, um, speaking of football,
I was thinking of trying out.

105
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,030
You got any pointers?

106
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,490
Uh, study hard instead.
I just got cut.

107
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,266
LIZZIE:
I thought you were on my team.

108
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,056
And I am, because your dad said
that we all need to

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,726
work together on this one.

110
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,356
Well, he's not here,

111
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,566
and I am not working
with Hope Mikaelson.

112
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,486
Lizzie, the last time we
went against Doc's plans,

113
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,856
a leprechaun nearly killed him
with a necktie.

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,866
Maybe ponder that for a sec.

115
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,946
This is my pondering face, okay?

116
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,076
And that plan was still way
better than the one

117
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,246
that Hope came up with,
which could have sent Josie

118
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,456
to the dark side.

119
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,416
And at least I'm doing something

120
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,956
instead of moping around
because MG left.

121
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,376
Okay, I can tell that
you're in a bad mood,

122
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,666
so I'm gonna refrain
from pointing out

123
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,756
your involvement in that, too.

124
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,386
Besides, MG's probably

125
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,886
just out somewhere
taking a walk or something

126
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,466
to blow some steam off.

127
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,846
MG enrolled at Mystic Falls
this morning.

128
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,290
He'll be staying
with Josie in town.

129
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,606
Josie is his only friend there.
He'll be back in no time. Okay?

130
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,066
I hope so.

131
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,986
Because, as your new bestie,

132
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,946
you mooning over his comic books

133
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,366
is a little creepy.

134
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,746
Yeah, this is research.

135
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,326
Oh, yes.

136
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,956
The adventures of
trench coat guy and Tinker Bell.

137
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,916
First off, that's
John Constantine,

138
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,046
and you damn well know it.

139
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,916
Second, that is a pixie.

140
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,466
A kinder, gentler version
of a genie...
(laughs)

141
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,596
As if genies even exist.

142
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,306
...that trades wishes
for favors.

143
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,806
So all we gotta do is
a solid for one of 'em,

144
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,936
wish for them
to close the portal as payback.

145
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,250
Our Malivore problem
is done and dusted. Boom.

146
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,316
Oh, damn.

147
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,616
That's that little ponder face
you were talking about.

148
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,576
What are you thinking?

149
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,970
It's classified.

150
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,406
LANDON:
I thought we were supposed

151
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,810
to be working with
Lizzie and Kaleb.

152
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,046
What is that?

153
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,780
The note Lizzie left
on the door to her room.

154
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,426
Hey, are you okay?

155
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,756
I mean, I've been picking up
on some weird tension.

156
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,846
Never better.

157
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,136
I've got you back.

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,540
That's all that matters anyway.

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,186
I'm not sure Lizzie
feels the same.

160
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,186
Yeah. I may have tried
to guilt Josie

161
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,896
into taking her magic back

162
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,566
to open a door to save you,

163
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,606
but it didn't even happen,
so I don't know why

164
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,316
Lizzie's so bent out of shape.

165
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,276
Well, how would you have felt if
it had been me in danger

166
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,576
instead of Josie? Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,826
Whose side are you on?

168
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,946
Yours. Always.

169
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,746
I'm just saying

170
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,956
the reason you two are mad
at each other is because

171
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,076
you're more alike
than you think.

172
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,746
Take that back immediately.

173
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,746
You're both smart,
powerful witches

174
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,740
who'd do just about anything
for who or what you love.

175
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,466
I really hope you're wrong,
because if you're right,

176
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,290
I think I know what Lizzie's
about to do next.

177
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,016
I was unaware
you jogged, Lizzie.

178
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,816
I'm, uh, more of a night runner.

179
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,526
It's normally so dark, in fact,
that you can't even see me.

180
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,486
Well, I always sprint
the last mile.

181
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,026
No pressure to keep up. Wait!

182
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,196
And leave your mentor
in the dust?

183
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,036
I'm here to officially
welcome you...

184
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,616
Sculptress of Statuary,
Slayer of Small Ones...

185
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,416
As a member-elect
of the Super Squad.

186
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,360
Thank you... I think.

187
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,046
What is expected of me?

188
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,216
Merely one super-heroic event,

189
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,756
as approved by your
Super Squad mentor.

190
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,096
Meaning you. Yes.

191
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,676
So lucky, right?

192
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,476
And I've already thought
of just the thing.

193
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,960
HOPE:
And I bet I know what that is.

194
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,616
You were gonna summon
a monster behind my back?

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,236
Please. Like you
weren't planning on

196
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,736
doing the same thing.

197
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,236
And knowing you,
you would have released

198
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,616
a Kraken with a Muppet allergy

199
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,826
that would have wiped
out the rest of us.

200
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,286
Okay, unlike you,

201
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,246
I actually listened
to your father,

202
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,546
so I was thinking cute,
talking, harmless.

203
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,296
Well, why don't you share
with the rest of the class?

204
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,506
Why don't we summon a cherub?

205
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,216
They're basically flying babies.

206
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,336
LIZZIE: With bows and arrows.

207
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,426
Cupid was a total bloodbath.

208
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,596
Remember?

209
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,136
Um, he wasn't actually Cupid,

210
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,266
and shouldn't we just wait
for Dr. Saltzman?

211
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,596
BOTH: Stay out of this!

212
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,226
It doesn't matter who he was,

213
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,396
because pixies grant wishes.

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,016
Okay, so does a monkey's paw.
How would that work out?

215
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,276
You'll see.
Fire up that summoning spell.

216
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,736
I do not believe
that will be necessary.

217
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,590
The monster is already here.

218
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,576
(growling)

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,286
(purring)

220
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,036
Oh, that is the cutest
monster ever.

221
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,246
(babbling)

222
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,206
(giggling)

223
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,876
What is it? I don't know.

224
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,416
But I want one.

225
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,780
(purring, chuckling)

226
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,716
Did you summon that thing? No.

227
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,676
We must be wary.

228
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,976
(sneezes)
LIZZIE:
More like merry.

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,436
This thing could check
all of our boxes.

230
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,896
Now, somebody, quick,
throw a blanket over it

231
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,316
and we'll find out
if it can talk.

232
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,670
(high-pitched voice): Screw you.

233
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,316
How's that for talking?

234
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,906
Grab it.

235
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,390
(laughing)

236
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,156
MONSTSER: Too slow. Too slow!

237
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,190
(monster laughs maniacally)

238
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,626
Are you sure it went this way?

239
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,336
Yes, Hope, I can hear it.

240
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,966
Are you two deaf and dumb?

241
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,006
Let's see if the thing is as
fireproof as it is critical.

242
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,716
HOPE:
No, don't.
See where these pipes lead?

243
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,756
MONSTER:
Okey-dokey. Just dumb. (laughs)

244
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,056
Regrettably, you're right.

245
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,056
We need a song of ice
and not fire.

246
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,676
A quick Glae Solidatur

247
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,186
will freeze this little guy
in his tracks.

248
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,106
HOPE:
We want to interrogate it,
not kill it.

249
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,896
Remember?
I'll just cast immobilus.

250
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,750
Oh, great,
so it can drown in there.

251
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,736
(monster coughing)

252
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,946
Once again, Hope,

253
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,156
this is all your fault...

254
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,140
Yah! (squeaks)

255
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,286
MONSTER:
Smell you later, ladies...
Damn it.

256
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,060
(monster giggling)
Here. Let me help.

257
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,206
Like I've been saying all day,

258
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,086
I don't want your help.

259
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,006
I can't believe that you would
push me in here.

260
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,006
I didn't. It was the monster.

261
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,546
You know what, Hope?

262
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,846
At least when I'm a bitch,

263
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,216
I own it.

264
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,806
Now, for the last time,

265
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,790
stay the hell out of my way.

266
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,500
People always get hurt
when you don't.

267
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,356
ALARIC: I really
appreciate your help.

268
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,396
Whatever you can do
to identify that would be great.

269
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,196
Anything for an old pal.

270
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,326
Especially the one
who helped me get this gig.

271
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,446
You deserve it.

272
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,156
How's, uh...

273
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,496
how's Emma? Oh, we're solid.

274
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,246
Yeah. At least we will be

275
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,746
once she wraps up
this semester in Shanghai.

276
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,086
Ah.

277
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,110
Mac? Mm...

278
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,466
Do I even want to know why
you're interested in this?

279
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,426
Well, we think
Malivore opened up

280
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,926
another portal somehow.

281
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,676
Monsters started appearing

282
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,886
once Hope and I opened up
that artifact,

283
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,646
and I just want to know
if it's a coincidence

284
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,976
or a... you know,
cause for concern.

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,670
I'll give you a call
as soon as I have information.

286
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,486
Unless y-you'd prefer
to stick around.

287
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,576
(chuckles) Why would
I want to do that?

288
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,036
(chuckles)

289
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,246
Because you could've
sent me photos

290
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,246
of this thing, Rick, and called.

291
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,996
Your daughter goes here

292
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,876
and now so does MG.

293
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,626
So, like you said...

294
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,450
Coincidence or cause for concern?

295
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,346
I wish I knew.

296
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,096
Josie came in contact
with black magic.

297
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,226
Now, she checks out fine,
but, you know,

298
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,250
black magic can be tricky.

299
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,316
I hate the idea
of spying on her,

300
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,896
but, uh...

301
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,550
what do you have in mind?

302
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,036
I had a teacher
call in sick this morning.

303
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,100
I need a substitute.

304
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,076
Well...

305
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,956
my human history's a...
a little rusty, but...

306
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,456
(chuckles)

307
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,216
Who said it was history class?

308
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,280
(whistle blows)

309
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,346
ALARIC: All right. Let's, um,

310
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,870
stretch the ham... hammies.

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,016
(sighs)

312
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,816
Paranoid, huh?

313
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,896
Your dad has questionable timing

314
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,856
and extremely questionable taste

315
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,066
in athletic apparel.
But h-he's not...

316
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,036
A total spy?

317
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,536
That's fine. He can
spy all he wants

318
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,956
if there's nothing
for him to see.

319
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,076
So no using vamp
speed or strength

320
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,786
to impress
Tori-Crop-Top-Thompson

321
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,336
with your soccer skills.

322
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,650
Promise?

323
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,886
(grunts softly)

324
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,306
(whispers): Stop looking.

325
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,096
It's really hard. Okay.
Stop looking.

326
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,330
HOPE: Too short.

327
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,266
Too green. Mm.

328
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,686
Too Gimli.

329
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,646
(gasps) You remembered.

330
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,066
(laughs)

331
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,276
That's a lawn ornament.
This is pointless.

332
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,066
No, it's a process.
There are literally

333
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,196
thousands of wee folk
in mythology.

334
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,156
We just have to figure
out what this one is.

335
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,036
It would go a lot faster if we
could share notes with Lizzie.

336
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,656
Not an option.

337
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,496
Apparently, I'm hazardous
to everyone's health.

338
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,996
Okay.

339
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,286
Radical idea, I know.

340
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,376
Have you thought
about apologizing

341
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,916
to her for pressuring Josie?
I can't.

342
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,716
And not because I don't want to.

343
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,636
But because if you
disappeared tomorrow,

344
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,716
I'd do it all over again.

345
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,596
Well, what brought me back was
something you hadn't thought of.

346
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,266
And I bet if you
and Lizzie had worked together,

347
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,726
you'd have found another way.

348
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,306
Yeah, but we didn't.

349
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,766
And I can't change the past.
Fair.

350
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,106
But you can change the present.

351
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,356
Starting with our current

352
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,436
adorable little monster...

353
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,146
LIZZIE (over P.A.):
Good morning, Stallions.

354
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,816
This is The Salvatore School
Monster Warning Service.

355
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,196
There's yet another monster
on the loose,

356
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,616
but more on that later.

357
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,496
Because the true threat to all
our lives is Hope Mikaelson.

358
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,036
And not just 'cause
she has scabies.

359
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,440
(laughing maniacally)

360
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,256
Gotta go easy on that arm.

361
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,306
Oh, that's right, I need to.

362
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,686
Unless you need a Band-Aid
for that cut, QB None.

363
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,846
Oh, knock it off, Blake.

364
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,266
We can't all go 12 seasons

365
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,856
without taking a snap like you.

366
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,566
It's only been three.

367
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,856
Who am I to question your math?

368
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,696
Yeah, go ahead, bail.

369
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,366
Like you bailed on your family.

370
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,800
Worked out great.

371
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,826
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

372
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,956
Break it up, break it up.
Break it up.

373
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,826
All right, everyone go take

374
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,520
a couple laps
around the school. Go!

375
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,756
Not you.

376
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,086
Go pick up some of those cones

377
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,440
and cool off.

378
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,886
(grunts)

379
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,306
After you go pick that up.

380
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,830
Go on, move.

381
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,766
JOSIE: What was that about?

382
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,306
I don't know, you tell me.

383
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,686
JOSIE: I don't know.
Everything's fine here.

384
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,146
Better than fine, actually.
It's perfect.
Huh.

385
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,760
Well, it doesn't seem
that way to me.

386
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,986
Ethan got cut from
the football team

387
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,340
and he's messed up about it.

388
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,600
(horn blares)

389
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,690
(horn blaring)

390
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,586
Holy crap.

391
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,190
How did you just move that fast?

392
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,966
HOPE: I cannot believe you.

393
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,506
Scabies? Really?

394
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,306
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

395
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,466
I was too busy washing
the chlorine out of my hair.

396
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,476
Though I can't say I disagree
with the spirit of the message.

397
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,226
Okay, let's do this.

398
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,266
I've saved you and this
school over a dozen times.

399
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,356
And how many times
have you put us all

400
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,936
in grave,
life-threatening danger?

401
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,686
It's a wash, Hope.

402
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,736
And the truth is,

403
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,776
you're only there for us

404
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,026
when you need something.

405
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,696
HOPE: Look, I'm not proud

406
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,486
of what I asked Josie to do,
but let's be real:

407
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,946
you're the reason she went dark
in the first place.

408
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,866
LANDON: Ding, ding. Round over.

409
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,746
Everyone back
to a neutral corner.

410
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,326
You two are not
making any sense.

411
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,786
Okay. Butt out, new girl.

412
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,246
You have no idea how deep
our history goes.

413
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,956
CLEO: That is correct.

414
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,006
Which is why I am taking
both of you at your word.

415
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,426
If Hope says

416
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,756
she did not push
Lizzie into the pool,

417
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,256
then I believe her.

418
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,846
And if Lizzie

419
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,346
swears she did not make
that announcement,

420
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,926
then I believe her, too.

421
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,136
But we heard her voice.

422
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,266
CLEO: Perhaps we should focus

423
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,976
on that fact.

424
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,806
And an explanation for it
that does not require

425
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,066
either of you to be wrong.

426
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,670
The monster.

427
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,856
Sounds like I'm here
right on time.

428
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,106
Critter was just
in Doc's office.

429
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,236
LIZZIE:
God, you will do anything

430
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,180
to suck up to Cleo.

431
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,116
Killing monsters
does not impress me.

432
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,286
HOPE: No, he didn't kill it.

433
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,656
It's molting.

434
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,326
What kind of creature does that?

435
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,916
LIZZIE: Butterflies?

436
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,376
Frogs? Gremlins.

437
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,546
Oh, it is definitely a gremlin.

438
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,006
Oh, awesome.

439
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,756
Finally. (laughs)

440
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,570
I mean, I mean...

441
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,556
LIZZIE: I don't get it.

442
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,556
How does something so cute

443
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,396
become this?

444
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,830
Duh.
Feeding them after midnight.

445
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,236
Oh, come on.
You've never seen...

446
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,106
Disrespect.

447
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,566
Says it right here, nerd.

448
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,826
That's what gremlins feed on.

449
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,326
Okay, well, then the movie...

450
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,786
Which you all still
should have seen...

451
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,826
Obviously took
some artistic license.

452
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,100
Perhaps it is pitting the two
of you against one another.

453
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,046
Great.

454
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,416
We've been feeding it
an all-you-can-eat buffet.

455
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,506
The stronger it gets,
the more dangerous it is.

456
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,700
For Landon, right?

457
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,966
Wait, that's it.

458
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,756
If we want to trap this thing,

459
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,466
we have the perfect bait.

460
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,476
Do not look at my boyfriend
like he's a piece of cheese.

461
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,636
We are not... Using me as bait

462
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,646
is a great idea.

463
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,056
I mean,

464
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,896
if Malivore wants me,
like always,

465
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,566
then the gremlin has no choice
but to come for me, right?

466
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,050
And we'll be waiting
when it does.

467
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,026
Look, the only way
this goes wrong

468
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,640
is if you two can't
work together.

469
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,930
It's all up to you two.

470
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,536
ALARIC: This isn't about us, MG.

471
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,916
It's about
what's best for Ethan.
Is it?

472
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,586
Or is it more like keeping our
secrets safe at his expense?

473
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,336
JOSIE: Burdening Ethan with it

474
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,956
won't end well, either.
Dad's right.

475
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,546
We can't risk it. No offense,

476
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,030
Jo. But what are you
really worried about risking?

477
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,820
Do I get a vote?

478
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,716
Well, this isn't a democracy.

479
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,686
But we can hear what
you have to say.

480
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,170
I think it's really cool that
MG has superpowers, because...

481
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,646
...I'd be dead without them.

482
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,647
And I understand why you'd want

483
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:37,856
to keep that a secret.

484
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,066
And I'm happy to keep it.

485
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,696
ALARIC: Yes, I believe you.

486
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,276
But I made your mother a promise

487
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,866
that I'd look after you
and keep you safe.

488
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,196
MG?

489
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,696
Please compel him.

490
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,866
That's my decision.

491
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,746
Compel me to do what?

492
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,326
There's no reason to be scared.

493
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,746
You had a bad day.

494
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,996
You got cut
from the football team

495
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,206
and you're mad about it,

496
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,496
so you went home
after gym class.

497
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,626
But you're gonna wake up
tomorrow feeling better.

498
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,216
And you're gonna find
what makes you happy

499
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,886
that's not football,

500
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,346
then go after it.

501
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,136
But you're not going
to remember this conversation

502
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,910
or anything that
happened with us today.

503
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,000
I feel better already.

504
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,960
I don't remember a thing.

505
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,590
So you don't remember the thing
you're not supposed to remember?

506
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,486
Is there any possibility

507
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,970
that you told his mom
about vervain?

508
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,206
Mm.

509
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,956
Yeah. Son of a bitch.

510
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,416
CLEO: This is quite intense.

511
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,836
At least the dude's little.

512
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,626
Minotaurs, gargoyles,

513
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,086
Headless Horseman...

514
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,756
That's when the real intensity
kicks in.

515
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,176
Hey.

516
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,466
It's okay.

517
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,096
You get used to it.

518
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,676
I do not want to.

519
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,476
I thought this school
was perfect for me...

520
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,806
Secure, enlightened, creative.

521
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,476
But now I am unsure

522
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,976
if I wish to be a member
of your Squad.

523
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,146
Look, I used to feel

524
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,106
the same way about this place.

525
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,236
Just take it from me: don't
let fear drive you away from...

526
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,720
something good.

527
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,206
Uh, especially when you don't
have anything to be afraid of.

528
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,246
From what you have all told me,

529
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,956
Malivore is terrifying.

530
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,836
So explain how

531
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,610
I'm supposed to feel safe.

532
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,926
Uh...

533
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,306
Uh, maybe I, uh...

534
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,976
just...

535
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,346
totally misread
that whole situation. I'm...

536
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,396
sorry.

537
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,960
Ask again when our lives
are not in jeopardy.

538
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,406
I'm gonna go

539
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,656
get, uh, uh, another...
another book.

540
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,970
Yeah. Okay.

541
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
(growling)

542
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,996
HOPE: It's here.

543
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,546
Then you were right.

544
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,956
You can use gremlin goo
to cast a locator spell.

545
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,796
All the more reason
to moisturize.

546
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,280
It's on the move. Get ready.

547
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,516
I don't mean to interrupt this
awesome teamwork on display,

548
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,226
but where do you need me,
exactly?

549
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,566
Anywhere is fine.

550
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,106
If you really wanted to help,

551
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,800
you could slather yourself
in honey.

552
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,536
Uh, it doesn't matter.
It's not coming.

553
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,600
What do you mean?

554
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,496
He's right.
It's headed off-campus.

555
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,536
Oh, great.
You screwed up the spell.
The spell worked just fine.

556
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,836
Your attitude,
on the other hand?

557
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,626
Disrespect.

558
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,796
Remember?
Well, maybe
it ate so much

559
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,490
it's full.

560
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,466
Or Malivore's not after Landon.

561
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,506
Then who the hell

562
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,056
does he want?

563
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,556
(door opens)

564
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,750
The gremlin...
The gremlin took Cleo.

565
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,856
Put that down.
You're not coming.

566
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,736
Like hell. Cleo got grabbed on
my watch. I'm getting her back.

567
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,946
LIZZIE:
So you guys
uncovered how to

568
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,816
incapacitate/murder a gremlin

569
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,156
prior to her being kidnapped?

570
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,446
No, but I will. Personally.

571
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,036
Okay, who's gonna stay here

572
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,826
and keep an eye on the school?
You mean Landon.

573
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,666
You miss the part where I suck
at protecting people?

574
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,076
LANDON: Kaleb's right.

575
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,376
Not about the sucking.

576
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,166
And before you tell me
why I'm wrong,

577
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,796
there are, like, four other
students at this school

578
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,336
and the monster isn't
after me for once.

579
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,756
I don't need protection.

580
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,926
So let me handle the research

581
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,096
while the three of you

582
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,216
handle finding Cleo together.

583
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,636
Because doing things the way
you have been doing them

584
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,450
is exactly what
the gremlin wants.

585
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,500
ETHAN: Found it.

586
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,186
My mom said

587
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,646
it's an herbal supplement
to help with my arm.

588
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,070
She sends me the stuff
all the time.

589
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,986
(MG grunts)

590
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,406
Mm. Yeah.

591
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,326
That... Mm.

592
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,196
That stings like vervain.

593
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,866
Holy crap, is vervain
your kryptonite?

594
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,246
ALARIC: When was the last time

595
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,326
you took one of those pills?

596
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,786
Uh, this morning,

597
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,416
before I worked out,
around 6:00.

598
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,296
A dose that size,

599
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,966
it should be out of your system

600
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,626
in a couple of hours.
Then you and MG can try

601
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,006
having that, uh,
conversation again.

602
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,386
If something different
than that happens,

603
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,830
give me a call.

604
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,870
Where are you going?

605
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,186
I think you and I need
to talk privately.

606
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,250
(door opens)

607
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,656
(door closes)

608
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,196
ETHAN:
I guess we got
time to kill.

609
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,406
Might as well tell me
your origin story.

610
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,866
Uh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

611
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,456
Why not?

612
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,416
You're just gonna wipe
my memory anyway, right?

613
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,996
Kind of like how

614
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,940
Zatanna mind-wiped Batman.
(scoffs)

615
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,886
In Identity Crisis
issue number six.

616
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,546
Yeah.

617
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,886
Hold on.

618
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,506
Hold on, hold on. (laughs)

619
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,516
How'd you know?

620
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,596
All right, look,

621
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,556
I would never admit this
to anyone, but...

622
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,396
I've loved comic books
since I was a kid.

623
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,516
Wow. (laughs)

624
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,276
It's our secret, all right?

625
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,210
(both laugh)

626
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,856
This should be the spot.

627
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,656
Great. A literal cow pasture.

628
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,116
But, hey, pun intended.

629
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,616
That's supposed to be
good luck, right?

630
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,206
KALEB:
Pipe down
for a sec, Lizzie.

631
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,890
(indistinct sounds)
You hear that?

632
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,770
Of course you can't.

633
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,916
Cleo! (grunts)

634
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,570
Hold on, okay?

635
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,256
Nice work. Yeah.

636
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,030
Dissero.

637
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,540
Cleo, we can levitate you
out of there.

638
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,566
I said "we."
Doesn't this all seem
a bit too easy?

639
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,646
If I were a gremlin, why would
I leave Cleo in a place

640
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,686
that is so quick to find?

641
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,946
KALEB: Who cares?

642
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,696
Maybe gremlins are dumb.
Or smart.

643
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,276
Or at least, as smart as we are.

644
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,656
I mean, it used Cleo as bait.

645
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,736
Just like we did with Landon.

646
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,076
You think?

647
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,220
(distant thudding)

648
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,770
(growling)

649
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,336
Call it a gut feeling.

650
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,626
(high-pitched roaring)

651
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,740
Fools!

652
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,806
(screeching)

653
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,346
How is it so big?

654
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,476
We've been kumbaya
since Landon's speech.

655
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,056
CLEO: It is my fault.

656
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,976
I may have used
some colorful language

657
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,250
as it dragged me here.

658
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,050
Like they say,
the bigger they are...

659
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,440
So, what's plan B?
(horn honking)

660
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,926
(car door opens)

661
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,046
(roars)

662
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,120
No way.

663
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,306
He's like Gremzilla now!

664
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,636
And far less frightening than
I will be if you have scratched

665
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,686
my paint.

666
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,146
Focus, guys.

667
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,726
I figured out how to
defeat the gremlin.

668
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,976
Disrespect makes
the gremlin stronger,

669
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,606
and respect weakens it.

670
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,486
In hindsight, actually
makes a lot of sense.

671
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,776
Probably shouldn't have
taken hours of research.

672
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,220
So we have to respect
each other?

673
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,760
Ha. We're doomed.

674
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,326
You're a vampire?

675
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,746
Now, it's nowhere near as dope
as getting bitten

676
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,496
by some radioactive bat
or anything, but, uh,

677
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,376
yeah, it's the truth.

678
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,336
It's still cool as hell.
Super strength?

679
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,176
Super speed? The blood
thing is a bit of a bummer,

680
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,346
but the only bad part
was your mom and dad

681
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,676
not accepting you
for what you are.

682
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,056
Yeah.

683
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,000
That part was, uh,
definitely rough.

684
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,226
My story's the opposite.

685
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,936
My mom's done everything
she can to support me,

686
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,776
even letting me stay
here in Mystic Falls

687
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,396
to let me make the
most of what I got.

688
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,236
Which isn't much,
compared to you.

689
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,156
But that's why getting
cut hurts so much,

690
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,996
'cause I don't know
how to tell her.

691
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,690
Or who I am without football.

692
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,296
Wait, can you compel that
into me?

693
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,176
Uh... Yeah.

694
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,006
But, um,

695
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,580
I'd rather help you figure
that out on the other side.

696
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,646
Well, I'm curious
about your next move.

697
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,306
What do you mean?

698
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,646
Well, you can say that
you're not a superhero,

699
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,686
but that's a load of crap.

700
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,486
If there's one thing guys
like us know, with great power

701
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,606
comes great responsibility.

702
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,590
So how are you gonna use
those powers for good?

703
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,430
(watch beeping)

704
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,810
(beeping stops)

705
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,870
The, um, vervain
should be out of your system.

706
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,580
Hey, can I ask a favor first?

707
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,476
Don't take everything away.

708
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,550
Uh, leave the part
where we met today.

709
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,736
Why?

710
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,526
Because we're friends now,
right?

711
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,100
And I-I could really use one
right about now.

712
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,366
KALEB: What are you waiting for?

713
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,940
Start complimenting each other
while I go distract this thing.

714
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,246
(roars)

715
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,836
I like the color of your hair.

716
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,296
I also like the color
of your hair. And the cut.

717
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,440
Although the one before it
did frame your face better.

718
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,926
Seriously?

719
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,016
Respect has to be genuine.

720
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,976
You guys have to understand
that despite your differences,

721
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,516
there's a lot you two
have in common.
LIZZIE: Disagree.

722
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,146
I would have never made
the choice that Hope did.

723
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,540
Josie could have died.

724
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,526
(whoops)

725
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,776
Here. Grab this.

726
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,526
I'm sorry about that.

727
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,906
I never meant to hurt
your sister or you.

728
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,470
I just didn't know
what else to do.

729
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,286
Well, I guess

730
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,206
the way that you put
Landon first 24/7

731
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,060
is kind of like what I do
with Josie, and myself.

732
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,416
Maybe in the past,
but you've changed, Lizzie.

733
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,086
And honestly, I wish I
could be as proactive

734
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,280
as you when it comes
to bettering myself.

735
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,386
LANDON: Okay, come on, Cleo.

736
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,466
You got this.

737
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,426
And I wish I had
your confidence.

738
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,976
I can only imagine
what it's like

739
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,346
to not second-guess myself
all the time.

740
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,460
To always be the hero.

741
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,976
Y-You're doing it!

742
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,316
It's shrinking!

743
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,736
Well, I'd trade my confidence

744
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,276
for your brutal honesty.

745
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,026
And your ability to
coordinate outfits.

746
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,236
(chuckles)
Well, that can be arranged.

747
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,786
If you teach me your badass,
icy glare.

748
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,286
LANDON: Come on.

749
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,600
You got this.

750
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,980
We got this.

751
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,240
Not so big now, huh?

752
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,466
I'm sorry about today.

753
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,926
Might be new,
but you are totally Squad.

754
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,386
Welcome to your first mission.

755
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,000
Let us blast this thing.

756
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,816
Where did it go?

757
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,880
It's right here.

758
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,276
(high-pitched whimpering)

759
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,656
It is only a matter of time

760
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,866
until I return
to my magnificent form...

761
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,956
Hmm. At least we know
it still talks.

762
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,206
Yeah. You know, we better
get a "A" on this assignment.

763
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,246
I want to take the little thing

764
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,246
and put it in a mason jar
and just give it to Doc S.

765
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,166
So long as we respect one
another the entire time

766
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,796
it remains in captivity,
for if we do not...

767
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,506
I don't love those odds.

768
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,426
You thinking what I'm thinking?

769
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,886
More often than I care to admit.

770
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,620
(gremlin squealing)

771
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,936
How was your first day back?

772
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,630
LANDON: Exhausting.

773
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,896
Well, at least the thread count
is better here than in Malivore.

774
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,760
(chuckles)

775
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,236
Don't leave this bed, ever.

776
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,456
I wish that were the answer.

777
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,166

00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,256
I don't really know the words

783
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,306
to express how much I appreciate
what you did for me.

784
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,766
But I don't want my being back
to be a burden to you.

785
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,186
Or to anyone else.

786
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,896
You're not a burden.

787
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,186
And even if you were,
I mean, I can handle it.

788
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,686
You're everything to me.

789
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,186
You've more
than proven that, but...

790
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,066
maybe that's the problem. No.

791
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,446
The problem was that you were
stuck in a hell dimension.

792
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,826
Now that I'm not,

793
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,326
I don't want to come between you

794
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,196
or any of our friends
ever again.

795
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,616
Which means I can't
be everything to you.

796
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,706
It clearly breeds resentment.

797
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,706
I don't care.

798
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,876
As long as I have you.

799
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,676
That's the thing, Hope...
You always will.

800
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,256
So maybe worry about having me

801
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,636
a little less
and having everyone else more.

802

00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,266
maybe I'm right about this.

00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,920

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,796

815

Not that I'm complaining.

Humor your old man.

00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,746
What did you think
we were gonna talk about?

824
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,706
Oh, I don't know...

825
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,006
me being willing
to do black magic with Hope,

826
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,030
thus losing my chance to go to
Mystic Falls High and live here.

Yeah, well...

828
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,030
That would be
pretty hypocritical.

829
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,266
I understand why you did it.

830
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,096
I don't condone it,

831
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,016
but I know you were
just trying to make up

832
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,726
for a past mistake.

833
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,316
Kind of like I'm trying to do.

834
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,236
With the portal?

835
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,026
No. I'm talking about us, Jo.

836
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,286
You know, there is

837
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,100
nothing more important to me
than you and your sister.

838
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,286
And maybe you'd know that

839
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,536
if I said it more,
instead of just...

840
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,996
(inhales deeply) ...showing up
and buying milkshakes.

841
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,216
I do know that, Dad.

842
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,506
Never stop
buying me milkshakes, okay?

843
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,320
Deal.

844
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,450
(both chuckle softly)

845
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,936
You know you can talk to me.

846
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,846
Right?

847
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,670
About anything.

848
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,186
I don't want to keep each other
in the dark,

849
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,566

no matter how noble
our intentions are.

851
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,560

852
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,640
Just trying to let you go
a little, you know.

853

855
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,636
You know, it's hard.

856
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,370
It's really hard. (sniffles)

857
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,936
You know, like, Malivore's...

858
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,226
(chuckles):

I, uh...

862
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,776
I'm gonna head back
to the school.

863
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,600
Or you could stay for dinner.

864
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,206
Aunt Elena's gonna be home soon
from her shift,

865
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,456

for us to talk about.

869
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,530

873
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,016
like everything's perfect
at Mystic Falls,

874
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,210

875
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,986
There's this girl at school.

877
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,430
it's complicated.

878
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,696
Yeah.

879
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,786
Well, in that case,

880
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,520
Malivore can wait.

881

I don't know.

there's something we don't.
