1
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:03,247
I know a lot of things
have changed around here lately,

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,708
but in my opinion,
that's a sign of growth.

3
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:07,793
And despite our growing pains,

4
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:11,797
I like to think our student body
has never been more...

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:14,049
united.

6
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:16,552
(quietly): There's,
like, nine of us here.

7
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:19,722
Which means your voice carries,
Hope.

8
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:23,017
But despite our spotty
assembly attendance,

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,727
which I will address,

10
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:29,088
we now have
30 students enrolled.

11
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:33,051
Which officially...

12
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:36,905
...makes us a school
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

13
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:38,866
And, more than that,

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,950
a home!

15
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,327
And-and more to that,

16
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:43,227
uh, sense of community...

17
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:45,956
...I give you Elizabeth
Saltzman. (clears throat)

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,668
(clapping)

19
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:52,421
I know I'm not the only one
who misses

20
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:54,506
the way things used to be
around here.

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,883
That doesn't mean

22
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,260
that our way of life
needs to change.

23
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:00,346
The simple math is

24
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,847
fewer students
equals less tuition.

25
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:02,914
Which is why...

26
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,811
...the smoothie bar

27
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,396
has been shuttered,

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,066
the pool closed,
and all of our dances

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,151
and trips have been canceled.

30
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,527
But...

31
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,321
I have a way
to turn that all around,

32
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:18,596
with your help.

33
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,119
Our first...

34
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,371
Hopefully last...

35
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:27,623
Salvatore School
Fundraiser Month.

36
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:29,607
(Alaric clapping)

37
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:34,463
Over the next four weeks,

38
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:36,298
we will be hosting
a series of events.

39
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:38,509
A car wash, a bake sale.

40
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,470
And I am well aware
that that is only two ideas,

41
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:43,430
so any recommendations

42
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:44,872
are welcome.

43
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,267
That's the spirit, Cleo.

44
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,353
Hope and I can make art
and host an auction.

45
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:51,647
Um, mm, I retract that offer.

46
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:52,815
Too late.

47
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,275
Art auction approved.

48
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,903
Now, if some of our
more tenured students

49
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:00,280
could follow your example, we'll
have this place back to normal

50
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:01,365
in no time.

51
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,449
JOSIE: Sorry to interrupt.

52
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:03,951
I was on my way to school.

53
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:05,369
You need to sign for this.

54
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,145
What is it?
Something from Town Hall.

55
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:17,864
It's a property tax lien.

56
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:21,760
That we have seven days to pay?!

57
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,637
(hushed murmuring)

58
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:24,661
How much?

59
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:28,541
It's $91,000...

60
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,170
...or the bank gets the school.

61
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:35,691
Over my dead body.

62
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:39,570
Screw Fundraiser Month.
Welcome to Fundraiser Day.

63
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:43,473
We're gonna do all of it
at once, right now.

64
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:47,393
What are you staring at?
Let's go.

65
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:55,026
Ah.

66
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,046
You look...

67
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,048
Frustrated? Annoyed?

68
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,759
Like a complete
and abject failure?

69
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,095
I was going to say "nice,"
with your hair like that.

70
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,638
Flattery will get you nowhere.

71
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:07,973
My official stance is that
I'm mad at you

72
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:09,349
for making me do this.

73
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,143
I am not making you do anything.

74
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,187
We are helping the school.

75
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,522
Well, I'm gonna have to
find some other way.

76
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:18,358
I'm blocked. I've got nothing.
(scoffs) Come on.

77
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:21,636
All art has something
beautiful in it.

78
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,118
Oh, okay.

79
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,536
I didn't think it was that bad.

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,164
It is very technically
proficient,

81
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:34,041
it just feels a little...

82
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:36,418
soulless.

83
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:40,172
No need to spare my feelings.
I did not think a
tribrid would be

84
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,840
so sensitive. Usually I'm not.

85
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:44,426
But I haven't made anything good

86
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,928
since Landon died,

87
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:48,597
and my only hope of
finding him was destroyed.

88
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,140
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,476
I have been blocked before, too,

90
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,586
and it also came after
a devastating loss.

91
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:59,483
What did you do
to break out of it?

92
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:03,094
Something drastic.

93
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,574
The day we met,

94
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:09,243
you told me you did not know
how to move on

95
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,827
from Landon's death.

96
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,581
I have an idea that may help.

97
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:18,085
Let me guess. It's drastic.

98
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,213
I hate everything about this.

99
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:24,132
Me, too.

100
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:27,135
You know, we really gotta
up your tie game, Doc.

101
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:29,620
And don't-don't get me
started on these shoes.

102
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,433
I know why I'm suffering
like this,

103
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,227
but why are you all dressed up?

104
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,271
I heard you were going
to the bank. I want in.

105
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,940
(scoffs) No offense,
but you're a teenager.

106
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:42,609
Not exactly the ideal
candidate for a loan.

107
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,571
Uh, a teenage vampire,
who told you I wanted you

108
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:47,781
to be able to rely on me.
Remember?

109
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:50,784
So I'm thinking
zero-percent interest

110
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:52,744
over a thousand years.

111
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:57,398
Using compulsion to get money
would be theft, and unethical.

112
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,711
(scoffs):
You think a bank doesn't use

113
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:03,171
every power at their disposal

114
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,173
to take more
than their fair share?

115
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,593
Come on, Doc, we gotta fight
fire with fire.

116
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:09,344
And burn everything down
in the process?

117
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:10,929
If that's what it takes.

118
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,890
(chuckles)
This is a human problem, Kaleb.

119
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:15,726
One, admittedly, I got us into
when I let things fall

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,228
to the wayside
while searching for Landon,

121
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,940
so I will solve this
in my own human way.

122
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,525
But if you are serious

123
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:26,278
about taking on more
responsibility around here...

124
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:27,738
Dead serious.

125
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,847
Supervise the fundraiser
while I'm gone.

126
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,453
I don't want anyone using
their power around the public,

127
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:36,955
or hatching supernatural
solutions to this mess, either.

128
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,124
So you just want me
to stop everyone from doing

129
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,876
exactly what I wanted to do.

130
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,777
Exactly.

131
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,088
ALYSSA: Hey, what's up?

132
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,465
I wasn't expecting
to hear from you.

133
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:47,716
So you didn't drop
the illusion spell?

134
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,761
Because something's wrong
with it.

135
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,554
And if anyone finds...

136
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,181
Which is why I can't come
to the magic mirror right now.

137
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:56,141
Leave a message, unless
this is Milton Greasley.

138
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,476
I'm over this phone tag.

139
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,936
I'm not taking you back,
stalker.

140
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,004
(sighs) (knock on door)

141
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:05,484
Lizzie!

142
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:08,070
I am getting ready.
Can you give me a minute?

143
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:09,946
Oh, I already gave you
one of those. In fact,

144
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,239
it's actually been 34 minutes,

145
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:12,658
since you missed
morning assembly.

146
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:14,785
No. I'm saying no now, remember?

147
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,830
I felt like sleeping in today,
and this is not a good time.

148
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:20,499
Do I need to remind you
what you missed out on

149
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,502
the last time that
you said no to me?

150
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:27,297
Once again, no, I remember that
pretty vividly.

151
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,508
I'll bet you do.
And unfortunately,

152
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:32,761
this ask is far less exciting
than sex.

153
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:36,223
And today, I am not taking no
for an answer.

154
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:37,724
Then yes.

155
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,227
Yes, yes to whatever it is.

156
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,978
Now leave, so a man
can get dressed in peace.

157
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,505
Speaking of...

158
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,591
What the hell is this?

159
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:52,656
Uh, your assignment
for Fundraiser Day.

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,140
Don't miss assembly next time.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

162
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,093
Dudes, do not do my baby
like that.

163
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:15,637
And watch the rough side
of the sponge.

164
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:17,889
Sponges don't have rough sides,
you...

165
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:21,518
Good, honest friend,
who would never hook up

166
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,603
with another man's girl.

167
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:26,022
That... Keep scrubbing.

168
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,066
All right.
Well, this is a disaster.

169
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,277
I know. He's gonna leave streaks
all over my car.

170
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,070
I'm talking about
Fundraiser Day.

171
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,822
No one is here!

172
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,782
(bird squawks)

173
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:39,411
Uh... what you want me
to do about it, Lizzie?

174
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:41,246
Two hours isn't much time
to get a whole

175
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,791
marketing campaign
dialed in. Mmm.

176
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:47,794
Okay, this isn't working.

177
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:50,297
Time to bring out the big guns.

178
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:52,674
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
What's your plan?

179
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,134
I'm gonna go and get my
grimoire.

180
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,094
There are some old,
Salem-era spells

181
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:57,971
for dispersing angry mobs.

182
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:00,599
I'm gonna try and figure out
if I can reverse one of them

183
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:02,267
and draw people here.

184
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,436
No. Your dad said no magic,
and I promised him

185
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,896
that I'd make sure of that.

186
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,147
Okay. And since when do you
and him

187
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,899
agree on that subject?

188
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,401
We don't. But he's never gonna
see that he's wrong

189
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,154
until we do it his way
and let it all burn...

190
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:15,739
(rich laughter echoing)

191
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,949
Knock it off, Lizzie.
I'm serious.

192
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:21,811
I didn't do that. I swear.

193
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:26,899
I need to find out who did.

194
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,754
I know you said this is
a drastic solution,

195
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,048
but you cannot expect me
to paint

196
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:35,091
with my dead boyfriend's
remains.

197
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,345
No, I expect you to
give him life again

198
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:40,388
in the only way you can now,
with your art.

199
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:43,391
If that's your solution, no
thanks, I'll find another way.

200
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,919
Is having him on your
nightstand forever the solution?

201
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:53,610
No, it's not.

202
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,737
You cannot move on from grief
if you are still

203
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,972
holding onto it.

204
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,229

(mischievous chuckling)

221
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,038
Hey.

222
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,664
(growling)

223
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:32,083
(speaks gibberish)

224
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,944
Oh, top o' the morning to ya.

225
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:42,510
Apparently, the pot of gold
in most leprechaun myths

226
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:45,055
isn't literal, so it
isn't our lucky day.

227
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,932
Yeah, well, his, either... soon
as Hope finds out about this,

228
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,642
she's gonna want to cut off
his lucky charms.

229
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,708
(jingling)

230
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:53,229
What the hell?

231
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,756
(sniffs, growls)
No! Those are mine.

232
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,987
No, no, don't... What?

233
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:03,698
(retching)

234
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,951
(belches, slurps)

235
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:08,036
(groans) You nasty.

236
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,747
(cackles) (sighs)

237
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,624
Guess now we know what he eats.
It makes sense.

238
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:14,417
It says here leprechauns' powers

239
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,419
include being
attracted to wealth

240
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,172
and attracting wealth.

241
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,256
(laughing)

242
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,092
Their mere presence

243
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:24,678
will entice humans into
spending indiscriminately,

244
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:26,638
which early supernatural-run
casinos used

245
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:28,682
to great effect!

246
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,708
Blah, blah, history, blah.

247
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,186
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

248
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,437
That you forgot
your dad said we can't

249
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,981
use supernatural powers?

250
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,190
Well, that's the beauty
of the situation.

251
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:38,775
We aren't.

252
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,777
He is.

253
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,112
(growls)

254
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:43,279
Classic loophole.

255
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,698
Yeah, and how do those generally

256
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:46,616
work out for us, Lizzie?
It's different

257
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,618
this time, okay? We have...

258
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,352
the luck of the Irish.

259
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,248
Plus it's a win-win-win, okay?

260
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:55,667
You can prove
my dad wrong about not

261
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:58,402
using powers while still
following his stupid rules.

262
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:03,550
And we can save the school
in the process.

263
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:05,284
(growls)

264
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,974
Did you hear something?

265
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,476
(sighs) Like I've been telling

266
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,104
all of the vampires and
the werewolves at this school,

267
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,023
I don't have
supernatural hearing

268
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,567
'cause I'm a freaking fairy.

269
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,777
Oh. (exhales)

270
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,488
Sorry, man. That was
a surprisingly deep resentment

271
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,491
I've... obviously
been repressing. Why?

272
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,452
What did you hear?

273
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,244
Cars.

274
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:32,996
Voices.

275
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,497
Lots of them.

276
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,106
If you build it, they will come.

277
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,002
Okay, fire up the hose, Wade.

278
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,587
Put the kitchen on high alert.

279
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:42,738
Tell Hope and Cleo
to start cranking out that art.

280
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:45,425
We're in business, baby.

281
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:46,593
LIZZIE: Welcome...

282
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:48,595

All right, I have $1,000.
(crowd clamoring)

284
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,391
Can I get $1,200?

285
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:55,310

MG, are you okay?!

306
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,506
Not really.

307
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,611
I know this may be
hard to believe,

308
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:48,554
but it's going even worse
than it looks.

309
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,617
Did Lizzie put you up to this?
Yeah, man!

310
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,828
At first, it was chill,
but then the bake sale

311
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,621
just... turned up.

312
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:58,748
People can't get
enough of my cookies.

313
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,376
And I literally cannot
make them fast enough.

314
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,586
Well, that's good, right?
It means we're making money.

315
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,296
In theory, but unlike me,

316
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,341
this oven has no vamp speed.

317
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:11,511
I can't be here all day
because I have some...

318
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:14,222
something to-to-to take care of.

319
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:17,350
That's unnecessarily mysterious.

320
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:20,520
But you won't be here all day.

321
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:22,397
Because I'm gonna help you.

322
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:26,049
I just need to be
at Mystic Falls High by lunch.

323
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,529
For something.

324
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,239
That's...

325
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:33,682
also unnecessarily mysterious.

326
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,202
You sure you want to cut class?

327
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:37,686
You sure you can do
this without me?

328
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,499
It is stunning.

329
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:43,835
Now I know you were lying.

330
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:46,171
You must have taken
a sculpting class.

331
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:48,047
No, not before today.

332
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,550
But I had a great teacher.

333
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:52,135
I am pretty great.

334
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,327
Mm-hmm.

335
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:04,731
I'll warm up the kiln.

336
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, no, that's okay.

337
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:08,008
Incendia.

338
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,226
CLEO: He is beautiful.

339
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,748
I didn't even do him justice.

340
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:23,708
CLEO: "Luctus."

341
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:25,359
What does it mean?

342
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,864
That it's time to let him go.

343
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,761
(door opens)
WOMAN:
I'll take it.

344
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:37,847
He looks absolutely delicious.

345
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,682
How did you get in here?
Who is he?

346
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,184
Someone I miss...

347
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,061
very much.
He'll be right in my foyer

348
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:45,587
if you ever want to come
and visit. How much?

349
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,442
It's not for sale.
This is happening really fast.

350
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,611
Everything has its price.

351
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,780
It is $91,000.

352
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,823
Done.

353
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,992
This money will save the
school, Hope.

354
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,494
This is good.

355
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:01,079
This is letting go.

356
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,538
Sorry. I can't.

357
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,915
WOMAN:
I won't take no
for an answer.

358
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,333
I simply have to have it.

359
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:06,834
No, what you have
to do is leave.

360
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:09,170
Uh...

361
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:11,280
(screams)

362
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,308
KALEB:
We're gonna get this bill
paid off in no time.

363
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:24,560
Why stop there?
There are so many

364
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,854
things at this school that need
to go back to the way they were.

365
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:28,147
Like what, exactly?

366
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:29,983
The smoothie bar.

367
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,110
That student spa
we've always dreamed of.

368
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:34,445
Okay, I've always dreamed of.

369
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:35,780
But we're on a hot streak, okay?

370
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:37,699
There is no way
I'm pulling the plug

371
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,325
until we fix everything.

372
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,869
Okay, I will
unless you tell Hope...

373
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:44,021
HOPE: Tell me what?

374
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,417
Just that another
Lizzie Saltzman-planned event

375
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,753
has blossomed
into a smashing success.

376
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,547
Speaking of smashing, um,
some woman just tried

377
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:54,632
to shank me for not
selling her my art.

378
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:57,427
That sounds
like a tough negotiation.

379
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:01,204
Not really. She was willing
to give us the $91,000.

380
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:06,894
Wow, I had no idea
that Hope was so talented.

381
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:09,022
I'm sure it was
an isolated incident.

382
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:11,774
So... back to making art.

383
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,485
You're not pissed at me for
turning down that much money?

384
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,970
Now you must be up to something.

385
00:17:19,014 --> 00:17:22,201
Hey, what's wrong with you?!
Those snickerdoodles are mine!

386
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:25,580
(shouting and clamoring)

387
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:28,982
Two... isolated incidents.

388
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,488
Get ready for a third unless
you tell me what's going on.

389
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,136
Is that what I think it is?

390
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,637
(grumbling)

391
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,223
Yep. It's a leprechaun,
all right.

392
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,725
Don't worry, he's harmless.

393
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,185
Though he does make people
act a little wacky.

394
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,103
That's not what I mean...
It's a monster.

395
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,855
A Malivore monster.

396
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:53,441
Yeah, that's making us rich.
So what's the problem?

397
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:55,234
The problem is that it's here,
which means a portal

398
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:57,070
to the prison world
must be open.

399
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:58,696
(leprechaun laughing)

400
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,074
LIZZIE: Oh, yeah, that.

401
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:03,433
(cackling)

402
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,250
How could you? How could
you keep a Malivore monster

403
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:13,169
a secret from me? I'm sorry.

404
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,879
Did I miss that wee-little
badge he's wearing

405
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,631
that says,
"Hi, Malivore sent me"?

406
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:18,299
I'm serious, Lizzie.
So am I, Hope!

407
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:20,635
Our school is in trouble.

408
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,053
So forgive me

409
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,388
for prioritizing that

410
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:25,682
over your emotional needs
for once.

411
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,435
My emotional needs?!

412
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,521
(Lizzie and Hope shouting
indistinctly)

413
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:34,440
So you regretting
enrolling here yet?

414
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:37,527
That depends... what exactly
should I know about Malivore?

415
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:40,321
Short version...
He's a super old mud dude

416
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:41,823
who ate a bunch of monsters
back in the day,

417
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:43,366
and keeps them
trapped inside of him

418
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,701
like it's another dimension.

419
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,661
But we...

420
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,162
we took care of it,
it's cool now.

421
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:49,831
He's locked in a prison world.

422
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:52,458
What exactly should I know
about prison worlds?

423
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,711
Well, you know
how prisons are messed up...

424
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,547
(shouting stops) What happened?

425
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,924
They stopped screaming.

426
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:02,009
We like that, right?

427
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,636
(crashing)

428
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,471
LIZZIE: Hope, wait! No.

429
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,849
Hey, hey, hey, I know we've
all thought about it,

430
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:10,309
but don't kill Lizzie.
You're jumping
to conclusions.

431
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,395
Okay, what if he was
just some random monster

432
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,605
who happened to walk by
right when we needed him?

433
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,566
When have we ever been
that lucky?

434
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,568
That's not a pun. Okay.

435
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,944
Ladies, the leprechaun's making

436
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,904
everyone a little wacky.
How about we all

437
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,239
just take a second to breathe?

438
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,533
BOTH: Not now, Kaleb!

439
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:27,452
Okay, I'll leave.

440
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,120
But not until you tell me
that plan for that axe.

441
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:31,581
My plan is what yours
should've been all along.

442
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,833
To get answers out of that thing
and then kill it.

443
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:35,960
So I suggest that you two
shut down Fundraiser Day,

444
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:38,045
unless you want to tell
all those people out there

445
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:40,322
that that's
a leprechaun screaming.

446
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,575
Any objections?

447
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,222
Then that's the only good
decision that you've made

448
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:49,915
all day.

449
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:58,590
So what are we doing here
exactly?

450
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:03,696
Um, maybe if you told me
what we were looking for,

451
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,281
we could pick up
the pace a little.

452
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,741
I'm moving as fast as I can.

453
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:08,784
Yeah, cool,
it's just that, you know,

454
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,996
I have this thing and I'm
pretty sure you had a thing,

455
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,958
which remains unnecessarily
mysterious to me.

456
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,879
I have a study date at lunch
with my new lab partner, Finch.

457
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:23,049
Oh, that's why
you're all dressed up.

458
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:26,093
I'm sure it's not as big
a deal as I'm making it.

459
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:28,471
There's Herba fermentum
here somewhere.

460
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,181
And it's a leavening accelerant.

461
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:31,724
Which, if you put it
in your dough,

462
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,267
it'll bake in half the time.

463
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,727
That sounds perfect.

464
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,812
You wouldn't happen
to know of a weed

465
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,399
that would help with,
I don't know... illusion spells?

466
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:42,318
Mm, not off the top
of my head. Why?

467
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,861
Bingo!

468
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:46,197
I think this is it.
Maybe it's this one.

469
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:50,034
They both look the same to me.
My Botanical Arcanum's rusty,
but I know

470
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,453
the one that we want tastes like
cinnamon and the lower school

471
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,413
has access to this part
of the garden, which means

472
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:56,606
nothing's dangerous,
so... pick one.

473
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,360
This one.

474
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:04,781
It doesn't taste like cinnamon.

475
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:09,160
If anything, it's... minty.

476
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,848
And honestly,

477
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,684
there's no need to rush.

478
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,352
My study date isn't
a real date, right?

479
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,979
Because I am not ready for that.

480
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:19,355
Okay. This... this took a turn.

481
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,773
And I don't know why

482
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:22,024
Lizzie put you
in charge of baking

483
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,317
when you're not any good at it.

484
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:24,735
MG...

485
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,279
I am so sorry.

486
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:27,405
It's okay.

487
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,407
I think that's the weed talking.

488
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:30,950
Blue Calamus.

489
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,327
Truth weed.

490
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:35,955
(sighs) Ooh. Yeah.

491
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:38,541
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

492
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,793
WOMAN: Alaric Saltzman?

493
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:42,569
Vera Lilien.

494
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:47,091
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

495
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:49,367
Lilien...
That name sounds so familiar.

496
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,307
Oh, you're Dana's mom.

497
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:55,474
Mm-hmm.

498
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:58,352
I am so sorry for your tragic

499
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:00,229
and unexpected loss.

500
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:02,315
You know, I've always said that

501
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:06,110
mountain lions are
a real problem around here.

502
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:07,612
And you are Lizzie's father.

503
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:10,031
Hmm. Well,
it appears the rotten apple

504
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:13,951
falls farther from the tall,
virile tree than I thought.

505
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:15,578
(exhales)

506
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:18,372
Don't you and your husband work
at the pharmacy?

507
00:22:18,396 --> 00:22:20,291
Dana's death was quite the blow.

508
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:22,835
Her father and I split recently.

509
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:25,254
Mm-hmm. Come with me.

510
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:26,672
WADE: Help!

511
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,865
(wild shouting) Help!

512
00:22:33,411 --> 00:22:35,014
(pounding on door)
What the hell, Wade?

513
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:37,058
The townies have
lost their minds

514
00:22:37,082 --> 00:22:39,060
and there's not enough
Wade to go around.

515
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:41,524
Can you use your vamp strength
and help a brother out, please?

516
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:45,650
Okay, I got this.

517
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:47,401
You go get a shower

518
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:48,861
and find a new shirt.

519
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,321
Fundraiser Day is cancelled.

520
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,782
(tapping, pounding)

521
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,533
Hey! Quit pounding.

522
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:56,285
I'm coming out. LIZZIE: Wait!

523
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,245
Before you compel
everyone to leave,

524
00:22:58,269 --> 00:22:59,497
I want to sell
some of my old stuff.

525
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:00,665
For crazy prices?

526
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,458
Whatever the market will bear.

527
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:04,043
Hope's right, Lizzie.
We-we gotta stop this.

528
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,045
Look, we already have
the money we need.

529
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:09,090
For the last time...
Smoothie bar!

530
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:11,509
You're acting as
crazy as the townies.

531
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,427
What is the point

532
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:15,012
of trying to save our home

533
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:16,722
if it doesn't even feel
like home anymore?

534
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:17,848
Oh, that's right.

535
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:19,475
I'm asking the wrong person,

536
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,436
because you just want
to watch it all burn.

537
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,146
Lizzie, when I say that,
I don't mean

538
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,107
I want to see this place go up
in literal flames.

539
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:27,650
It means taking a
chance to start over

540
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,009
and make this place
even better than it was.

541
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,014
(muffled shouting)

542
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,452
Open the door, Kaleb.

543
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:39,912
Did you not hear
what I just said?

544
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:41,122
Every word.

545
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,791
This was my idea...

546
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:46,276
so it's my responsibility
to shut it down.

547
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,697
(guttural screaming)

548
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,844
Oh, my God,
you are torturing it.

549
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,303
Relax. It's not what it seems.

550
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,556
Maybe not to you.

551
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,266
I suppose everyone
around here thinks

552
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,184
killing monsters is
normal. But to me,

553
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,146
every creature... supernatural,
human or otherwise...

554
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,464
Deserves to be treated
with respect.

555
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:10,693
(speaking gibberish)

556
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,445
See? He's fine.

557
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,530
Like I'm trying to tell you,
I'm not torturing him.

558
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:17,140
I will believe you
when you drop the axe.

559
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,287
My translation spells
are not working on him,

560
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:22,913
so if we're lucky,
he will lead me

561
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:24,617
straight to whatever portal
he came out of.

562
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:28,002
(growls softly)

563
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:30,045
What are you doing?

564
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,069
Letting him go.

565
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:34,091
Fly free, little butterfly.

566
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:36,201
(grunts)

567
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:46,896
HOPE: None of this
would be necessary

568
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,398
if Alyssa Chang hadn't
broken the ascendant.

569
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,358
If my time at the Salvatore
School has taught me anything...

570
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:55,070
when in doubt,
do a locator spell.

571
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,198
Sequitur.

572
00:24:57,222 --> 00:24:59,158
CLEO: How do you know

573
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:00,951
the leprechaun will lead
us back to the portal?

574
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:03,370
Because that's the way
it's always been.

575
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,955
After he gets what he wants.

576
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:06,957
Wait. He wants something?

577
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:09,001
Malivore monsters
always want something.

578
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:10,669
If he can reach our world
as a monster,

579
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,505
then I imagine I can
reach his the same way.

580
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,782
Why would you want to do
something so drastic?

581
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:20,221
(sighs) Landon.

582
00:25:20,245 --> 00:25:22,765
I knew when
I couldn't sell his bust

583
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,266
that I'm not ready
to let him go.

584
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,101
I can't rule out
that he's not in Malivore,

585
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,728
not without going there first.

586
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:29,438
And I can only do that
through the prison world,

587
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,357
with this thing called
an ascendant, which

588
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:32,817
got destroyed.

589
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,193
But if I can just
find the portal...

590
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:36,862
Hope, I understand
you are grieving,

591
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:39,698
but why would Landon be
in Malivore? He's not a monster.

592
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:41,742
Well, he's a Phoenix.

593
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,661
Was a Phoenix.

594
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:46,646
And I might have neglected to
mention that Malivore's his dad.

595
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:53,111
I know that this is all
really overwhelming.

596
00:25:54,028 --> 00:25:56,281
You don't have to help
if you don't want to.

597
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:00,743
What are friends for?

598
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:05,015
Lizzie and Kaleb said

599
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,719
leprechauns are attracted
to wealth, right?

600
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:12,898
VERA: This is a lot of money.

601
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:15,276
Not many people would
be willing to assume

602
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,112
so much personal debt in order
to save a failing business.

603
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:20,197
It's more than a business...
It's our school.

604
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:23,576
Our home. So I'm willing
to take the risk.

605
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,953
I'm not.
Your application is denied.

606
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:27,663
Why?

607
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,331
Because of some old grudge
between our daughters?

608
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,042
The simple fact is,
you don't qualify.

609
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:34,086
And to be perfectly
honest, your desperation

610
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,630
and sincerity
have significantly dampened

611
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:38,215
any joy I expected to feel.

612
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,592
Ms. Lilien,

613
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,075
there has to be something
I can do.

614
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:47,933
I suppose

615
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:51,312
I could accept a...

616
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:54,339
unique form of collateral.

617
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,634
So long as it's substantial.

618
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,195
(whispers):
Are you propositioning me?

619
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,031
No. I'm just giving
us both what we need.

620
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:04,241
It's been a little lonely
since my marriage ended.

621
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:07,310
Just think of the
children, Dr. Saltzman.

622
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:11,707
("White Rabbit" by Jefferson
Airplane plays softly)

623
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,334
MG: We should, um...
we should get going.

624
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:16,003
I thought we both
had places to be.

625
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:17,254
There's no point.

626
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:19,048
I'm already late,

627
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,342
and even entertaining
the thought

628
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:24,178
of dating Finch is just...
it's a bad idea.

629
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:26,055
Why would you say that?

630
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,557
I mean, besides being hopped up
off truth weed.

631
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,684
Because the people I love
always leave.

632
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,210
Or hurt me.

633
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:34,647
Or both.

634
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:36,565
(exhales) All right.

635
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,984
Maybe this is bad advice,

636
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:40,402
coming from someone
who's just been

637
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,321
dumped and cheated on,

638
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:45,264
but you can't let that stop you.

639
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:50,788
Believe me, I don't want to.

640
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:54,583
'Cause repressing things has
taken me to a super dark place.

641
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,086
And here's the truth:

642
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,463
I'm scared.

643
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:02,007
And I totally understand that.

644
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:04,593
But you can't let fear

645
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:07,537
stop you from being honest
with the people you care about.

646
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:10,975
Damn.

647
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,393
(soft chuckle)

648
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,311
I gotta go.

649
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:15,604
Why? Where?

650
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,231
To take my own advice.

651
00:28:17,255 --> 00:28:19,608
Maybe because of a contact high.

652
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:21,568
Thanks, Jo.

653
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:23,761
Now get to that study
date or whatever.

654
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:29,368
VERA: I don't understand

655
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:32,228
why getting to this point
has been so hard.

656
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:36,583
Here, let me help
you with that tie.

657
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:40,337
NO. Your application has also
been denied, Ms. Lilien.

658
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:41,380
Call me Vera.

659
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:42,631
(gasps) Vera.

660
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,216
I got my students
into this mess,

661
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,676
and I wanted to show them
that I could fix things

662
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,636
the right way,
and this is not the right way.

663
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,138
Ms. Lilien. (Alaric gasps)

664
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,639
An armored truck's been stolen.

665
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:51,932
And I don't know if
I'm seeing things,

666
00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:52,975
but it looked like...

667
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,476
a leprechaun.

668
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,627
(tires squealing)

669
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:01,090
(laughing)

670
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:13,704
He's in here, but...
Why a parking garage?

671
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:16,498
The leprechaun's attracted
to wealth, so...

672
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,542
there may be
a Lamborghini in here.

673
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:21,295
Should we split up?

674
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,630
Or is that against
monster-hunting rules?

675
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:25,591
No, it's actually a great idea.

676
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:27,134
You're a monster hunter now?

677
00:29:27,158 --> 00:29:28,594
Were you a sculptor
before this morning?

678
00:29:28,618 --> 00:29:29,970
Point taken.

679
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:32,931
Okay. We'll split up, but

680
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:34,683
we need him alive
to bring us to the portal.

681
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:38,377
So if you run into
any trouble, just... scream.

682
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,675
(school bell rings,
indistinct chatter)

683
00:29:50,348 --> 00:29:52,326
You know, if you're
gonna cut class,

684
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,287
coming to school kind of
defeats the whole point.

685
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,539
Have you seen Finch?
Everybody did.

686
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,166
She stormed out
of the cafeteria earlier.

687
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,250
She seemed really upset.

688
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:02,086
(sighs) That's my fault.

689
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,837
I need to see her.

690
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:05,631
I want to see her.

691
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:07,049
There's something I really
need to talk to her about.

692
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,509
She works at The Grill
most nights.

693
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,576
I used to drop Maya
off there sometimes.

694
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:14,098
I'll give you a ride.

695
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:16,475
But, like I used
to tell my sister...

696
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,102
Be careful with Finch.

697
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:20,354
There's something
different about that one.

698
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:22,231
Thank you, Ethan.

699
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:25,091
But I don't intend
to be careful at all.

700
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,279
ALYSSA:
I said I didn't want
to hear from you.

701
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:31,698
I know.
But this is an emergency.

702
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:34,076
Okay. Your persistence
has worn me down

703
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,537
and after giving it
a lot of thought...

704
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:38,288
Yes.

705
00:30:38,312 --> 00:30:40,124
I'll totally take you back.

706
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:41,458
Yes!

707
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,876
Wait, I don't even want that.

708
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,211
You cheated on me.

709
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:46,171
And you don't even
go here anymore.

710
00:30:46,195 --> 00:30:47,475
Then why are you wasting
my time?

711
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:49,508
Look at this place.

712
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,218
Mm.

713
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:54,263
Are you missing your little
imaginary action figure?

714
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,515
Too bad.
I don't do favors for exes,

715
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,058
so I dropped that illusion spell
like it was hot.

716
00:30:58,082 --> 00:31:00,060
Fine,

717
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:01,520
but did you have to make

718
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:03,605
the thing inside
the box disappear?

719
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,023
I didn't,

720
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:06,733
but I totally should have.

721
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:08,193
And just to be clear:

722
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:10,261
I didn't want you back, either.

723
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,639
Goodbye forever,
Milton Greasley.

724
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,243
Did you see it?

725
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:17,661
See what?

726
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:19,163
The leprechaun
Kaleb and I caught.

727
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,873
That Hope, for some
reason, set free.

728
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:23,709
That proceeded to eat all
of the money we made today

729
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,169
and ransacked the entire school,

730
00:31:25,193 --> 00:31:26,753
devouring expensive

731
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,338
and occasionally
supernatural artifacts.

732
00:31:28,362 --> 00:31:29,715
Did you see it?

733
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:31,633
No.

734
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:34,344
(exhales sharply)

735
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:36,621
You... and that word!

736
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:44,545
(car alarm blaring)

737
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,293
(several car alarms blaring)
Little green man,

738
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:08,236
it is just you and me.

739
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,465
(speaks indistinctly)
(alarms stop)

740
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:14,700
I will not hurt you.

741
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,709
(clattering nearby)

742
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:29,191
(cries out)

743
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,526
Oh, Headmaster Saltzman.

744
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,320
You scared me. Sorry, Cleo.

745
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,697
What are you doing here?
Are you with Hope?

746
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:38,492
We split up. It is a long story,

747
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:41,727
and probably one that will make
you angry, from what I gather.

748
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,540
But we were looking for...
A leprechaun.

749
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,210
How did you know?
Security guard
at the bank saw it,

750
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,394
along with something else
he probably wished he hadn't.

751
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:54,282
(coin jingles)

752
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:09,481
Above you!

753
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,984
(growling)

754
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:13,342
Get it off me!

755
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:19,265
(Alaric choking)

756
00:33:24,061 --> 00:33:25,539
Fo yato si.

757
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:26,581
(leprechaun gasping)

758
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,084
HOPE: Cleo, no!

759
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:32,236
Take cover. He's gonna blow.

760
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:38,492
(grunting, growling)

761
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:55,843
You girls all right?

762
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,377
Sorry I missed you earlier.

763
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:32,606
Hmm, have we met?

764
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,816
'Cause you remind me
of this girl I was supposed

765
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,193
to study with over lunch...

766
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:37,986
who should have just told me
she wasn't interested.

767
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,280
But I am interested.

768
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,699
I wanted to see you so bad
it freaked me out.

769
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:45,827
And then I got mixed up
in this weed.
Wait.

770
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,621
Are you seriously high
right now?

771
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:50,957
Soaring. But it's not
what you think.
Cool.

772
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:52,817
Because I don't touch the stuff.

773
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,505
Why are you here, Jo?

774
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:59,925
I want to get to
know you better,

775
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:01,802
but I have no idea how.

776
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:04,513
And I have all of this baggage,

777
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:06,807
and I just don't want to
mess it up.

778
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:09,935
Well, standing me up
is definitely

779
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:11,311
a weird way to show that.

780
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:15,273
Even if it was
just a study date.

781
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:19,694
But it wasn't just
a study date, right?

782
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:23,782
So let's go on a real date...

783
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:27,035

So how did your day go?

800
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:32,309
A leprechaun tried strangling me
with that thing,

801
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,352
so, you know, the usual.

802
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:37,147
Yeah, about that...

803
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:39,733
So I'm assuming Lizzie already
told you everything?

804
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:41,401
Yes. That you had nothing
to do with it,

805
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:44,196
and you tried to do
everything that I asked.

806
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,615
Huh.

807
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,619
That's unexpected,
and not necessarily true.

808
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,288
She came up with the plan,
but I went along with it.

809
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:57,125
Let my ego get in the way
of what was best for the school,

810
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,027
and now we're still deep
in the red because of it.

811
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:03,173
But that loan came through,
right?

812
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:04,883
I wish I could
tell you differently,

813
00:37:04,907 --> 00:37:06,635
but all I got from the bank
was a harsh reminder

814
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:09,346
that the human world
is just as corrupt and flawed

815
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,766
as the supernatural one,
and proof that, uh,

816
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,501
I still got it.

817
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,837
Whatever "it" is. (laughs)

818
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,776
Okay.

819
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,569
(sighs)

820
00:37:24,593 --> 00:37:26,804
So what are we gonna do
about the school, Doctor S?

821
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:32,369
Fortunately, turns out
that leprechaun

822
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:35,580
had a pot of gold after all.

823
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:38,708
(heavy Irish brogue):
Or should I say
a potbelly o' gold?

824
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:42,003
I believe these...

825
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,797
are yours.

826
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:45,298
After we pay back the townies,

827
00:37:45,322 --> 00:37:46,907
we still have plenty to spare.

828
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,846
CLEO:
I guess it is true,
money cannot buy happiness,

829
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,933
because you are clearly
still mad at me.

830
00:37:54,957 --> 00:37:57,769
I told you I wanted
the leprechaun alive.

831
00:37:57,793 --> 00:38:00,021
And the last thing I wanted
to do was kill him.

832
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:03,024
But it was going to hurt
Dr. Saltzman, and I panicked.

833
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:05,986
I didn't know he was
going to explode like that.

834
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,238
I understand. Saving someone is

835
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,723
more important than
anything else.

836
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:15,662
That was meant to help you.

837
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,581
But it is not good enough
because your obsession

838
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:19,791
with Landon is all-consuming.

839
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:22,961
You do not have room in your
life for anything else.

840
00:38:22,985 --> 00:38:24,713
In the few days I have known
you, you have not asked me

841
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:27,132
a single thing about my life.

842
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:30,886
You're right.

843
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,097
I'm sorry.

844
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:36,850
Earlier you mentioned
that you had been blocked.

845
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:39,227
What happened?

846
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,146
Something terrible.

847
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,756
It is why I hate violence.

848
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,445
My sisters were murdered.

849
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:50,947
I am the only one of us left.

850
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:53,408
That's awful, Cleo.

851
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,368
I have accepted that
there was nothing

852
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:56,995
I could do to save them.

853
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:01,333
I have figured out how
to live without them,

854
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:04,210
to move on. Let me guess.

855
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:05,670
Now it's my turn?

856
00:39:05,694 --> 00:39:07,547
I thought that is
what you wanted.

857
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,299
That was before I knew
that there was a portal;

858
00:39:09,323 --> 00:39:11,384
a way that I might be able
to reach Landon.

859
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:13,386
I'm not gonna stop until
I've exhausted

860
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,555
every possibility.

861
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:19,124
So you can take that bust away.
I'm gonna find the real him.

862
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,755
I see now that this will
not end until you do.

863
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,834
MG:
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

864
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:47,337
And stop doing that.
This is my mess.

865
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:49,964
It's okay.
There's no "I" in mess.

866
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:54,177
And ignoring the fact that
there is an "M" and an "E,"

867
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:55,512
I should help.

868
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:57,847
Did Josie give you one of them

869
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:59,641
weird herbs from the garden?

870
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,726
No.

871
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,106
Relying on the comforts
of the past is a crutch.

872
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,857
I don't need drugs...

873
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:10,426
or smoothies.

874
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:15,824
Well, while we are out
of our comfort zone,

875
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,951
maybe you could help me with
this whole other mess

876
00:40:17,975 --> 00:40:19,643
that I came to talk
to you about.

877
00:40:20,978 --> 00:40:23,206
But it's a big one.

878
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,250
Hit me with it.

879
00:40:25,274 --> 00:40:28,026
Just promise me...

880
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:32,590
Just promise that you won't
think less of me

881
00:40:32,614 --> 00:40:34,008
after I tell you.

882
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,219
That would be pretty
hypocritical.

883
00:40:36,243 --> 00:40:39,097
You've seen me at my worst,
and always only ever

884
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:43,059
thought the best of me, even
when I didn't deserve it.

885
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:46,253
Let me return the favor.

886
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:49,274
It's about the ascendant.

887
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:51,258
The one that your
backstabbing ex destroyed.

888
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:54,279
Sorry.

889
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:56,281
Leaving her in the past.

890
00:40:56,305 --> 00:40:58,182
Continue.

891
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,328
What if I...

892
00:41:02,352 --> 00:41:06,374
What if I told you...

893
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:11,296
that I actually had
the ascendant

894
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,906
this whole time?

895
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:19,161
That-that I've been
lying about it?

896
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:26,811
I'd say that...

897
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:30,815
I would have done
anything to help you.

898
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,108
Seriously.

899
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:34,652
But it's too late.

900
00:41:34,676 --> 00:41:36,386
Why?

901
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:47,815
How could you?

902
