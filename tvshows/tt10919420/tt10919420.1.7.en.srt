2
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,122
The intruder?

3
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>We haven't located him yet, sir.</i>

4
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,047
Make sure you catch him.

5
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,841
The VIPs will arrive soon.

EPISODE 7
VIPS

7
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,058
Deok-su, honey, so glad you won.

8
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,727
How...

9
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,478
how the hell...

10
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,938
What?

11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,567
You're looking at me
like you've seen a ghost. Are you okay?

12
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,659
The masked guys all called me this,
"the weakest link."

13
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,540
Like when nobody chooses you as a partner
for things when you were a kid.

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,209
Hey, this guy knows about it.

15
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,544
The weakest link!

16
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,341
And after that, they gently
escorted me back to this dorm.

17
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,263
Because...

18
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,975
they said that it's all
a part of a rule that...

19
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,977
in the old days...

20
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,064
not to let a kid turn
into some kind of an outcast, I guess.

21
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,442
Goddamn it!

22
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,236
It's amazing, isn't it?

23
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,500
Front Man speaking.

24
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,141
I'm happy to hear you enjoy the game, sir.

25
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,771
Yes, sir. The host is currently waiting
for the VIPs to arrive.

26
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,304
Are you in here right now?

27
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,431
You're good, but you made one mistake.

28
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,935
I always put the receiver down
the other way.

29
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,366
The bullet you shot was from
a Smith and Wesson M60 revolver,

30
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,285
standard issue for Korean police.

31
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,914
What's a cop doing here

32
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,875
without a partner?

33
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,589
I am sure you have lots of questions.

34
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,717
It's not too late to come out and talk.

35
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,972
I don't know how you got in,

36
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,308
but you can't leave this place
without my permission.

37
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,365
<i>We found a body.</i>

38
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,992
Where is it?

39
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,454
<i>The northern coast of the island.</i>

40
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,844
Don't worry about it.

41
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,602
He was an old man
you only knew for a few days.

42
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,650
See that man there?

43
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,652
His partner was his wife.

44
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,940
We found this police ID on him.

45
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,689
HWANG JUN-HO
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

46
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,943
<i>The VIPs have arrived.</i>

47
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,534
Incinerate the body.

48
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,625
Let...

49
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,463
Let's just stop all this.
I can't keep doing this. I can't.

50
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,386
The majority must agree.
Well, come on, let's get out.

51
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,014
Half of us, that's all we need
to end this right now.

52
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,100
Don't any of you want to leave
this horrible place?

53
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,770
Anyone who wants to go, stand up.
Let's get out of here.

54
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,779
How can you call yourselves human?

55
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,784
How many of you can continue
with this insanity

56
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,536
just for the money?

57
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,999
You just had to kill the ones
you were the closest to at this place,

58
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,542
and you're good with that

59
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,419
just to get the money?

60
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,130
So what if we stop now?

61
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,677
You think your wife will stop being dead
if we all go now?

62
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,556
And she'll forgive you
for letting her get murdered?

63
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,893
If you can't keep going,
then why are you alive right now?

64
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,187
You should've been the one
who died in there instead.

65
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,398
See that?

66
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,360
That's the price of being in here.

67
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,238
And your wife and the others
paid it with their lives.

68
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,864
- No.
- And you wanna go and leave?

69
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,255
You wanna start from the beginning again?

70
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,037
You ready to do all that, huh?

71
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,331
Starting over again
from nothing with that guilt.

72
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,585
And is everybody here
ready to do that as well?

73
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,339
Go ahead, stand up!
Let's see who thinks they are.

74
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,152
Get up and get out of here!

75
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,474
No...

76
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,675
The VIPs have arrived outside.

77
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,789
Greetings.

78
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,335
I hope your long trip here
has not been too difficult.

79
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,211
I am the Front Man.

80
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,465
I oversee all of the operations here
at this facility.

81
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,384
It is a true honor to welcome you.

82
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,803
Where is the host?

83
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,433
Regrettably, some urgent business
has prevented him from attending.

84
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,933
Seriously?

85
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,438
I find it hard to believe
the host would miss a night like tonight.

86
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,066
He asked me
to apologize on his behalf.

87
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,901
Did some problem happen here?

88
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,984
Not at all.

89
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,072
It's just a personal matter of the host.

90
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,532
The remaining games
will be held as scheduled.

91
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,744
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

92
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,079
Well, I hope not.

93
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,750
Listen, I'm willing to give anybody
some slack. That's not a problem.

94
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,922
I just have to say
that I'm a difficult man to please.

95
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,549
I hope you won't disappoint me.

96
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,386
Shall we?

97
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,219
Oh, Lord, be my shepherd, be my guide.

98
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,699
May you watch over me tonight.

99
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,618
May you give me protection and strength

100
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,662
that I need to make my way
through these routes,

101
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,497
and may you light the path
to my salvation.

102
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,791
I give myself to you, Oh Lord.

103
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,502
Please look down on me
with pity and forgiveness.

104
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,296
I pray for those who have sacrificed
themselves for me,

105
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,881
or forgive them as well.

106
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,092
Hear me, Oh Lord, help me and forgive me

107
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,010
for what I have done and what I may do.

108
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,555
I live with my heart only by your graces.

109
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,641
I am your humble servant,
and I seek repentance for my sins.

110
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,519
Oh, God, protect me and save my soul.

111
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,937
I know I'm a sinner,

112
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,064
but I seek holy absolution in your light.

113
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,152
I am dying to know what this next game is.

114
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,653
Give us a hint, will you?

115
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,908
As much as I'd like to, sir,
I'd hate to ruin the fun for everyone.

116
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,782
The games of this edition
have been amazing.

117
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,081
Right.
The contest in Korea was the best.

118
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,500
Thank you.

119
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,920
I believe this next game
will exceed your expectations.

120
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,006
Well, that's why
we came all this way.

121
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,301
Trust me. The screens
we have at home are plenty big, but...

122
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,137
nothing beats seeing with your own eyes.

123
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:44,847
No!

124
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,017
No, don't do it, you idiot! You asshole!

125
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,518
Fucking loser!

126
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,228
What are you so worked up about?

127
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,898
I put a lot of money
on that dickhead to win.

128
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,024
Oh!

129
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,942
How much did you bet?

130
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,652
- A million bucks!
- Ooh.

131
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,490
What convinced you
to bet so much on number 69?

132
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:07,578
Oh, it's, uh, such a beautiful number, 69.

133
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,122
Oh, you dirty dog.

134
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,832
Oh.

135
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,920
You can place your bets again
before the next game begins.

136
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,591
Why don't you all get some rest
in your rooms?

137
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,928
We'll come and get you
when everything's ready.

138
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,471
I'm looking forward to it.

139
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,151
So, will you bet on brain or muscle?

140
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,952
So who you're putting
your money on this time?

141
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,245
I think
I'm going muscle all the way.

142
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,539
- I still haven't decided yet.
- Number 101.

143
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,124
- What about you?
- I'm torn between a couple of them.

144
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,566
Sixty-two, I think.

145
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,626
Your shift's over.

146
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,865
<i>Player 69, eliminated.</i>

147
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,636
<i>Attention, all players.
The fifth game is about to begin.</i>

148
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,221
<i>All players,
follow the staff's instructions</i>

149
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,682
<i>and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.</i>

150
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,299
So how are your scores
so far? Bet on any winners?

151
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,343
No.

152
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,097
For some reason, I keep picking losers.

153
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,391
Now is your chance to catch up.

154
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,560
The serious betting starts in this round.

155
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,105
And how much you gonna bet?

156
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,733
I'm doubling my stakes on this round.

157
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,069
Are you sure about that?

158
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,029
You don't even know
what game it's gonna be.

159
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,409
It doesn't matter what game it is,
I trust my gut.

160
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:53,929
Goddamn it.

161
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,682
Just tell us about the next game.

162
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,309
How long are you gonna string us
along like this?

163
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,147
He's in a bad mood because of 69.
Better tell him quickly.

164
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,900
Gentlemen,
let me introduce the next game.

165
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,202
What's that thing?

166
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,123
Looks like a bridge of some sort.

167
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,083
I like the looks of it.

168
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,086
What the hell is that?

169
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,764
<i>Welcome, players, to the fifth game.</i>

170
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,041
<i>Before we begin,
please make your way down the steps</i>

171
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,127
<i>and choose one of the mannequins
that you see presented before you.</i>

172
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,922
<i>Once you've chosen,
take the corresponding vest.</i>

173
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,965
<i>They are numbered 1 through 16.</i>

174
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,427
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

175
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,971
<i>Please make your way down the steps</i>

176
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,849
<i>and choose one of the mannequins
that you see before you,</i>

177
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,518
<i>and take the corresponding vest.</i>

178
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,812
<i>They are numbered 1 through 16.</i>

179
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,275
Ooh, this is exciting.

180
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,946
Gentlemen,
this may be the deciding moment.

181
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,298
There are plenty of other variables,

182
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,642
but I think the order,
in which they compete, matters most.

183
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,535
Who are you betting on this time?

184
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,455
Ninety-six.

185
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,998
What's your reason?

186
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,668
Well, if I can't do 69,

187
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,337
I'll try 96.

188
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,236
- Good luck with that.
- How do you know this guy?

189
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,196
I didn't bring him.
I thought you brought him.

190
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,389
Me? No.

191
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,267
Oh, jeez. You kill me.

192
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,769
Oh.

193
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,531
<i>There are 16 people left,</i>

194
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,575
<i>and there are 16 numbers.</i>

195
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,552
It was on the sixth day
that God created the first man on Earth.

196
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,222
And now, I will go back
to that day God made us

197
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,600
sinless and innocent.

198
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,865
Okay. Lucky number seven, come on.

199
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,960
Mm.

200
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,235
They always take the middle numbers first.

201
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,844
Animal instinct.

202
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,724
When faced with danger,
seek refuge in the herd.

203
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,101
<i>What should I do?</i>

204
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,103
<i>The middle numbers are all taken.</i>

205
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,816
Only two choices left. Front or back?

206
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,278
I can't say I'd know
which one to choose either.

207
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,864
Shall I help them along
with their decision?

208
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,200
Sure, drop them a hint.

209
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,620
Show mercy to the miserable!

210
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,538
Okay, do it.

211
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,377
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

212
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,420
<i>The numbers you see on the mannequins</i>

213
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,882
<i>correspond to the order
in which you will be playing.</i>

214
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,884
<i>Please make your decision carefully.</i>

215
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,762
<i>The order?</i>

216
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,847
<i>That we're playing in?</i>

217
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,724
<i>Okay.</i>

218
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,479
<i>If this is the order we'd play,
then the low numbers are better.</i>

219
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:17,901
<i>It's probably gonna have a time limit
like Red Light, Green Light and Honeycomb.</i>

220
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,112
<i>It's better to get a head start.</i>

221
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,823
<i>Wait.</i>

222
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,949
<i>No.</i>

223
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,828
<i>It'd be too dangerous to go first
without knowing the game.</i>

224
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,904
<i>If I stay in the back,
I can watch the ones who go first</i>

225
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,708
<i>and make a plan like in Tug-of-War.</i>

226
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,760
<i>Sixteen.</i>

227
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,263
<i>I can't go with 16.</i>

228
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,890
<i>Whatever it is,
it's too dangerous to go last.</i>

229
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,571
<i>Number 1? That means
I'll be starting the game off.</i>

230
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,198
<i>Then should I go last?</i>

231
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,409
<i>No, that seems wrong too.</i>

232
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,039
<i>Gi-hun, pull yourself together.</i>

233
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,541
Down to two positions,

234
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,626
first and last.

235
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,171
Mm. The start and the finish.

236
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,256
Two places you really don't wanna be.

237
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,259
Going first in a life-or-death contest?

238
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,177
Very scary.

239
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,222
But recall, too, that in the first game,

240
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:34,102
most of the contestants in the back died
after running out of time, so...

241
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,314
you can't feel too comfortable
picking 16 either.

242
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,442
You bet on 96, right?

243
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,152
Yeah.

244
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,946
Pick a good one.

245
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,948
What?

246
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,911
Where are you going?

247
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,431
Excuse me.

248
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,587
Could I be number one instead?

249
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,256
As long as I can remember,

250
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,550
I've been hiding behind people
when I got scared.

251
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,761
My life has been this thing

252
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,263
that I've never really been able
to truly control.

253
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,601
And I tried to act
like I wasn't afraid, but I was.

254
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,815
And now, as always,
I'm choosing my number last

255
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,775
after everybody else here.

256
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,321
I wanna get at least one last chance
to claim ownership of my life.

257
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,824
Sir, give this chance to me.

258
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,327
Please just give me that.

259
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,170
<i>Thank you!</i>

260
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,132
<i>- Thank you!</i>
- You fuckwad!

261
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,967
Piece of shit!

262
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,137
Oh, it's really not your day, is it?

263
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,265
First, 69, and now, 96.

264
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,145
Motherfucker!

265
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,731
Son of a bitch!

266
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,901
Now, the game will begin.

267
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,513
Oh, wow. It's bigger!

268
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,058
Yeah. A lot bigger.

269
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:55,160
<i>Hello, players,
let me welcome you all to the fifth game.</i>

270
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,581
<i>The fifth game is Glass Stepping Stones.</i>

271
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,252
<i>The stepping stones before you
are made from one of two types of glass,</i>

272
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,881
<i>one will be tempered glass
and the other will be normal glass.</i>

273
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,050
<i>The tempered glass stepping stone</i>

274
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,094
<i>as strong enough
to hold the weight of two people.</i>

275
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:17,641
<i>However, the normal glass will break
even if just one person steps on it.</i>

276
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,061
<i>For this game, you will guess
which one of next two tiles</i>

277
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,980
<i>is the tile made
of the stronger tempered glass,</i>

278
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,026
<i>and only step on those
across the 18 pairs of tile.</i>

279
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,112
<i>You may then cross over
to the other side safely</i>

280
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,864
<i>and pass this game.</i>

281
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,088
That means the numbers on us...

282
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,237
Are the order in which
you will cross the bridge.

283
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,033
But then, how do I tell
which is the tempered one?

284
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,849
Scumbag.

285
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,935
Ah.

286
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,187
Bring me another scotch.

287
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,192
Hey, you!

288
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,169
I don't wanna have
to keep calling you back.

289
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,881
Sit down here.

290
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,966
I must serve the other guests, sir.

291
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,428
I'm gonna keep this one next to me.

292
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,263
Any objections?

293
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,681
Not at all.

294
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,142
- As you please.
- He's all yours.

295
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,315
<i>For this game, you will have 16 minutes.</i>

296
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,693
<i>Players must cross the bridge
within those 16 minutes.</i>

297
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,946
<i>And now, with that, let the game begin.</i>

298
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,659
<i>Each player, take off your shoes,
then go up to the tiles in order.</i>

299
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,089
Hmm.

300
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,386
Hmm.

301
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,746
- What are you doing?
- We're losing time!

302
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,872
- Hurry up and go!
- Just jump!

303
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,776
- Are you just gonna stand there?
- Hey.

304
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,359
Take your step now or I'll push your ass.

305
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,821
I'll go. I'll go, okay? I'll go.
I'll go right now.

306
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,573
And please try to choose carefully, huh.

307
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,496
You did it.

308
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,541
You picked right.

309
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:34,170
Oh! Yes, that's it.
Keep doing that one after the other.

310
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,964
- Come on.
- You got this.

311
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,527
- That's it. Go on.
- Come on.

312
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,705
He's gone.

313
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,809
Oh, no.

314
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,898
Well, that's it for 96.

315
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,484
Aw, what a shame.

316
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,572
Oh. Hmm, you've already found
some more fun.

317
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,368
What pretty eyes you have.

318
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,641
Step one was left.

319
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,352
Step two is on the right.

320
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,544
You can do it.

321
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,107
- Hey, you got this.
- Hurry the hell up and go!

322
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,800
I'm looking at 15.

323
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,861
- Stop stalling!
- The tiles ahead of me.

324
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,885
Let's go.

325
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,697
- So the probability that...
- We don't have time for this.

326
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,991
- I'll get everything right is...
- Hey, you got this.

327
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,809
...two to the power of fifteen.

328
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,145
Times that...

329
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:22,362
One in 32,768.

330
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,453
Damn it.

331
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,921
Excuse me, ma'am.

332
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,506
Do you think

333
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,927
that you could help me?
You happen to remember what he chose next?

334
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,513
I can't seem to recall which one now.

335
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,766
Oh, I don't know,
uh, it happened too quickly.

336
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,184
Think hard please.

337
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,563
Since both of our lives
depend on getting this next one.

338
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,273
Okay.

339
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,279
- The left one I think.
- Wait, no.

340
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,507
- He went right and then he went left.
- Uh, he didn't do that.

341
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,451
- He went left right away.
- No, it was right from there.

342
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,878
You, are you sure...

343
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,882
he went left first?

344
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,216
Mm-hm.

345
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,074
So he went right.

346
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,803
Number five fucked up.

347
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,747
Another fall from grace.

348
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,539
Take that mask off.

349
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,920
Take your mask off!

350
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,882
I want to see your face.

351
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,969
Yeah!

352
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,084
There are ten tiles left,

353
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,068
and 11 people still playing.

354
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,071
If they manage to step on one or two each,

355
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,782
the three of us can get across to the end.

356
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,159
That might not be the case.

357
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,204
If one of those players get scared
and starts to run down the time,

358
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,082
we are in danger at the back of the line.

359
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,323
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

360
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,200
Get up. What are you doing?

361
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,262
- You're praying right now?
- As it is in Heaven.

362
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,097
- Seriously?
- What's he doing up there?

363
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,789
Come on! Just go!

364
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,584
Hey, just get up and stop praying, okay?

365
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,627
You idiot, it's your turn!

366
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,672
You gotta go!
Everybody will die, you know!

367
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,388
No number can determine
when the Lord calls for somebody.

368
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,894
Judgment is called down to us here.

369
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,855
It's our time to face the Lord.

370
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,859
Anyway, we're all going to Hell.

371
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,944
Hurry, so I can move to the next one.

372
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:35,156
If you don't, then I might have
to push you into him, okay?

373
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,871
You want a wind-up dead, buddy?
Get that asshole to stop praying.

374
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,169
Get going, you idiot.

375
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,048
Step forward. Come on, damn it!
You'll kill us all!

376
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,409
Thank you. God bless me today.

377
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,964
Don't push me.

378
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,298
Okay?

379
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,301
Hey, come on. I got no reason to push you.

380
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,013
You gotta cross so I can. Huh?

381
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,435
It's the left.

382
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,103
It's the left one.

383
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,813
Get it together.

384
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,151
Okay.

385
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,161
Thanks so much.

386
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,968
You're doing good.
Now you just keep going.

387
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,186
I know which one of these
is the strong glass.

388
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,395
You mean it?

389
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,981
You can see the tempered glass?

390
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,316
I'm pretty sure.

391
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,777
It's in the color.

392
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,209
You don't know anything. Goddamn idiot.

393
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,237
Hey, everybody, listen!

394
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,323
Anyone wanna get across?

395
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,284
Well, you better go first then.

396
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,870
Ah, shit.

397
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,667
Oh, it's getting exciting.

398
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,838
We can't show our faces in here.

399
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,757
You're all mine.

400
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,761
But after you leave, they'll kill me.

401
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,808
If you don't do what I say,

402
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,562
I will kill you before I leave.

403
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,235
Please.

404
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,446
Take me somewhere

405
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,448
where we can be alone.

406
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,419
You're leaving
at the most exciting moment?

407
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,296
Hey, you all have fun.

408
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,675
I'm going off for a different kind of fun.

409
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,220
Mmm, the real 69, huh?

410
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,973
Bon appétit!

411
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,392
Have a good fucking time.

412
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,507
- What are you doing?
- You deaf or what, asshole?

413
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,571
I'm not going until you do.

414
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,822
Are you crazy, man?

415
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,950
But the rule is we go in order.

416
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,456
You can just kiss my ass.

417
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,168
We're in Hell here.
There's no rules in Hell.

418
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,087
You wanna go so bad? Go ahead.

419
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,172
You scumbag!

420
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,148
If you don't move up, I'll push you then.

421
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,676
Okay.

422
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,806
Well then, come on. Then do it!

423
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,432
We'll all die here together!

424
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,267
Hey, listen, everybody!

425
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,521
I'm not dying here for anyone.
So come on, let's do this!

426
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,149
Get up here and go ahead.

427
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,902
If you don't, we all die.

428
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
Your choice, dickhead.

429
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,241
Stop that bullshit, you asshole.

430
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,786
The clock is ticking. You gotta go soon.

431
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,038
You'll be waiting here
till we're all dead.

432
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,629
Oh, shit.

433
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,984
That's not the kind of face

434
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,572
you should keep behind a mask.

435
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,915
Oh.

436
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,254
If you...

437
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,257
can satisfy me

438
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,844
in five minutes,

439
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,140
I'll change your life.

440
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,821
Satisfied?

441
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,628
If you can satisfy me in five minutes,

442
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,963
I might let you live.

443
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,388
Tell me everything
you know about the game.

444
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,732
Damn it, you better go!

445
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,983
Please just go on!

446
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,693
Just go!

447
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,511
My God, you're all such idiots.

448
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,351
Man, you used to act
like such a tough guy.

449
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,061
Babe, what happened to you?

450
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,105
Are you really pulling the shit?

451
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:51,026
- Oh, man, you're pathetic.
- You're just an ugly old bitch, okay.

452
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,154
Look, I'm not moving forward. Not at all.

453
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,614
Deok-su.

454
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,201
All of these people dead
but the worst thing is...

455
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,830
I let you fuck me
in the bathroom that day.

456
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,124
Why don't you go first to die?

457
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,043
Fine. Sure.

458
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,339
You mean...

459
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,008
- Meaning you'll go?
- Yeah.

460
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,969
It's Han Mi-nyeo here.

461
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,141
You don't think that I'd be able
to do something quite as cowardly as...

462
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,851
waiting here till I die.

463
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,524
Come on then. Go ahead.

464
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,286
Good luck.

465
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,836
What are you doing?

466
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,796
You're such an idiot.

467
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,799
Did you believe I'd really die
so you could go on?

468
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,094
Let me go.

469
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,220
Remember?

470
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,097
We said we'd stick together
right to the end.

471
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,309
Crazy bitch, let me go! Damn it!

472
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,394
Get your fucking hands off me right now!

473
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,690
Goddamn it!

474
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:17,696
You betrayed me. Now you're going to die.

475
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,618
No, please.

476
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,621
I'll go first, okay? Huh?

477
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,415
Let me go, please. Please!

478
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,875
You coward.

479
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,586
Deok-su.

480
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,713
I need you to know...

481
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,675
you've got such a tiny dick.

482
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,513
You goddamn bitch!

483
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,410
Oh.

484
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,371
Now there's a poetic ending for those two.

485
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,415
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."

486
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,710
Another student of the Bard.
I had no idea.

487
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,797
Actually, it's not Shakespeare.
It's Congreve. William Congreve.

488
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,174
I like you better when you don't talk.

489
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,184
Go check the VIP room.

490
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,511
Oh!

491
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,869
Move. Quick!

492
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,788
You can't just stop.

493
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,208
Hold on. Wait, one second.
I can tell the panels apart.

494
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,545
- You can tell?
- I used to make glass for over 30 years.

495
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,047
You can't normally tell, but...

496
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:04,052
when you look at tempered glass
when it's lit from the side,

497
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,514
then you can see faint stain marks.

498
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,741
Another hint, the sound.

499
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:30,287
Tempered glass is made
at a heat over 700 degrees.

500
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,999
Pound on it with a hammer
and it rings clearer than normal glass.

501
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,210
Why wasn't all this brought up earlier?

502
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,693
- If you had led everybody from...
- Why would I?

503
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,924
The players up here
tried to kill us at every chance.

504
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,676
Hmm.

505
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,960
Can he really tell the difference?

506
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,402
I think so.

507
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,446
LONG-TERM WORK EXPERIENCE
IN GLASS MANUFACTURING

508
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,993
According to his file,
he once had a job as a glass manufacturer.

509
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,289
That was in the report?
Hah! How did I miss that?

510
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,457
I didn't catch it either.

511
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,252
Well, that's no fun.

512
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:23,340
Yup, number 13 definitely sees
something that the others can't.

513
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,760
I think he might be examining
the refraction of the light.

514
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,179
Let me adjust the settings.

515
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,039
It seems to have done the trick.

516
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,376
Yeah, he's not so confident now.

517
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,500
What's wrong?

518
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,936
What's the problem?

519
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,689
I can't tell them apart in the dark.

520
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,029
Excuse me, sir.

521
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,999
<i>The VIP has collapsed.</i>

522
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,751
Is he alive?

523
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,210
<i>He's fine.</i>

524
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,545
And the intruder?

525
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,006
<i>We're searching for him now.</i>

526
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,769
All right, which one?
You need to choose now.

527
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,146
I need to listen to the sound.

528
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,650
You got anything to throw?

529
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,071
Do... do you have anything?

530
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,224
I need another.

531
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,310
I need to hear the right one,
so I can be sure.

532
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,808
I can't tell what it is.

533
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,269
I'll pick, okay?

534
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,559
One of the dive packs is gone.

535
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,436
<i>I suspect the intruder took it.</i>

536
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,022
Start tracking it
and get the boat ready.

537
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,441
Oh! That's hard to top.

538
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,776
- Bravo!
- Bravo.

539
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,736
- Bravo!
- Yes.

539
00:52:37,305 --> 00:53:37,930
