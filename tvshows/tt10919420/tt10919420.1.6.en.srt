00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,821
Go away.

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,276
What should we do?

4
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,676
Begin the next game.

5
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,933
Sir, let me help.

6
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,331
Thanks so much.

7
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,125
You look great, sir.

8
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,716
<i>Attention.
The fourth game is about to begin.</i>

9
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,469
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

10
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.</i>

11
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,016
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

12
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,061
<i>The fourth game is about to begin.</i>

13
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,313
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,941
<i>and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.</i>

15
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,360
Players,
what you witness before you

16
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,637
is what remains of those who broke
the rules for their own benefit.

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,975
They tainted the pure and fair ideology
everything here has been built upon.

18
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,478
Each and every one of you
is considered an equal

19
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,230
within the walls of this facility.

20
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,607
You must be guaranteed
the same opportunities

21
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,194
without being disadvantaged
or facing any kind of discrimination.

22
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,199
We truly apologize for allowing
such an unacceptable incident to occur.

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

26

Front Man speaking.

27
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,575
Yes. A minor disturbance took place.

28
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,119
But it's being addressed.

29
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,247
No need to worry.

30
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,540
We'll make sure
there's no trace of the disturbance

31
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,001
by the time the VIPs arrive.

32
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,215
Yes, sir. The game will begin on time,
in line with the schedule.

33
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,111
What's wrong? Are you sad?

34
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,739
Why? Is your connection dead?

35
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,120
I'll kill that little slut.

36
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>Players,
welcome to the fourth game.</i>

37
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,004
<i>For this game, you will be playing
in teams of two.</i>

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,507
<i>Please look around and find someone
you wish to play with.</i>

39
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,801
<i>When two people agree to play together,</i>

40
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,387
<i>shake hands to show
you have become partners.</i>

41
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,556
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

42
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,476
<i>For this game, you will be playing
in teams of two.</i>

43
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,397
<i>Please look around and find someone
you wish to play with.</i>

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,816
<i>When two people agree to play together,</i>

45
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,360
<i>shake hands to show
you have become partners.</i>

46
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,446
<i>There can only be two players per team.</i>

47
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,656
<i>You will have ten minutes
to find your partner.</i>

48
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,319
Hey, handsome.

49
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,654
Let's do this, huh?

50
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,948
I'm better than you think.

51
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,409
And I'm stronger than most guys too.

52
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,331
Guess what? I know how to con
just about anybody I see.

53
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,085
I'm not a genius,
but I still got it work out. Huh?

54
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,216
Hey, let me play with you.

55
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,510
Then I'll be your dream girl
all night long.

56
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,848
I'll do anything you tell me.
I'm not a regular girl.

57
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,100
Hmm?

58
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,226
Hmm?

59
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,818
You're pretending that you do not want me
on your team. Is that it?

60
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,611
Why? Can't decide?

61
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,488
Want me to choose instead, huh?

62
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,365
Stop embarrassing yourself.

63
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,283
No one will want to play
with you like this.

64
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,662
And you should all be honest.

65
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,624
You don't want a girl to team up with
or an old guy.

66
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,668
Of course we don't. We could die.

67
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,254
We already almost die
in the previous round.

68
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,380
This man is right.

69
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,926
And it was Adam's rib the Lord used
to make Eve after all.

70
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,304
And that's the reason
that we're choosing men.

71
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,725
- They played different roles than women.
- You idiot.

72
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,353
We're not playing in Eden right now.

73
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,606
Uh, hold on a second.

74
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,989
Why? You want a girl?

75
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,587
You're all idiots.

76
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,967
You two, you're making a big mistake,
and you're going to regret it.

77
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,475
- Sang-woo, let's...
- Ali, let's join forces.

78
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,480
Most of these games here,
you need to be strong or smart to win.

79
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,065
And I think if we're a team, we'll...

80
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,818
we'll beat a lot of the others out there.

81
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,869
Uh, uh, no, no, no, no, no.

82
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,454
Uh, it's okay, really, it's...

83
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,873
Uh, you two will make
a great team together.

84
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,500
I'll find someone to play with.

85
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,662
Let's make this work.

86
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,907
Sir...

87
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,117
Sorry, but, um...

88
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,620
You know it's just, um...

89
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,831
- Uh...
- You should go put this on.

90
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,170
Just in case people here...

91
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,384
Well, they might look down on you
for missing it.

92
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,782
You and me...

93
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,075
We'll be the best team.

94
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,373
Hey.

95
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,253
Wanna do this?

96
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,841
Why should I?

97
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,344
I can't picture you going around here
and begging these jerks.

98
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,679
Hmm? Embarrassing.

99
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,515
What matters is winning.
Embarrassing or not.

100
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,891
Then play with me.

101
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,685
I'll make sure that you win.

102
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,811
What will you do?

103
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,146
Whatever it takes.

104
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,483
What do you see in me?

105
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,485
Well, I wanted to ask you that.

106
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,991
You were someone who looked like
they would come with me.

107
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,410
That's how I feel.

108
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,757
I promise, okay?
There's no option left here.

109
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,717
I teach Math at a high school.

110
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,178
And I can run too. Soccer every day.

111
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,141
Everyone was asking,
but I held out so you and I could win.

112
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,143
'Cause you and me would be great together.

113
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,314
The... the thing is...

114
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,775
...we don't know which game
we're playing, so...

115
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,277
Hey, choose me so it can just be done.

116
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,406
At this rate, nobody will be left for you,
and you won't continue.

117
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,241
You know,

118
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,870
since the man who'd been cheating
is gone, there's an uneven number.

119
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,165
Once everyone is in pairs,
there'll be one person.

120
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,918
And what happens to that one?

121
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,127
What do you think?

122
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,129
They'll be out and they'll get killed.

123
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,840
I would guess that old man there.

124
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,226
Stop dragging this out.

125
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,269
Let's play together.

126
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,537
Hey, old man.

127
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,081
Wanna do this together?

128
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,104
<i>The time for finding
a partner is now over.</i>

129
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,047
You guys,
you're all making a big mistake.

130
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,134
Do you really think you can win
without me on your team?

131
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,512
It's me, Han Mi-nyeo!

132
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:06,517
I've made suckers out of everyone there is
from Dongducheon to Gangnam!

133
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,685
Guys...

134
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,357
What if you have to play <i>Gonggi</i>
or Elastics?

135
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,650
I'm an expert in those.

136
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,070
Babe, please, play with me.
Boys aren't very good at those.

137
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,947
- Hey. Get off.
- Come back!

138
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,951
- Hey, come on, be my partner.
- Oh.

139
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,911
Let's show everyone with a dick
they're wrong!

140
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,722
- Let her go.
- After us, we need to stick together.

141
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,933
- My gosh!
- I work well with women too!

142
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,501
- I'll be really good! I'll be...
- Stop it!

143
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,631
- Hey, don't trust this scumbag.
- Okay, okay.

144
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,634
He's a jerk. He's just gonna throw you
under the bus.

145
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,736
- Okay, sure.
- Look at me.

146
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,929
- That dead doctor and him worked together.
- Okay.

147
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,055
He played you.

148
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,018
He just wanted to save his own ass,
so he kept it secret from you all.

149
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,603
Tell me if I'm wrong, you jerk!

150
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,146
He was with him, guards!

151
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,606
- Hey.
- He deserves to die too!

152
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,357
Let... let go, bitch!

153
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,548
What? Hey, hold on a second.

154
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,176
Why is the room empty?

155
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,470
I still need a partner.

156
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,639
Hold on. Where did they go?

157
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,432
Who... who took my partner?

158
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,310
What's going on here? You can't do this!

159
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,686
Hey, I need a partner!

160
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,897
Let me go! Please!

161
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,441
Bring my partner here, you jerks!

162
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,693
Where's my partner?

163
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,988
I'm so sick of that whore.

164
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,282
It's nice to think
she won't be in my way again.

165
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,284
And, uh...

166
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,162
what she said about you in there,

167
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,331
you working with the doctor...

168
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,208
It's nothing.

169
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,503
That brat was so desperate,
she said whatever she could.

170
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,007
<i>Attention.
All players, please follow the staff</i>

171
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,134
<i>to your designated positions for the game.</i>

172
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,776
Ali.

173
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,946
Look at me. No one can stop us
if we work together.

174
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,617
I think you and I
could really win the money.

175
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,995
All right, let's do this and get out.

176
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,832
That money is ours
to give to both our families.

177
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,292
Let's do it.

178
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,756
You know, when I was a kid,

179
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,510
I live in a neighborhood just like this.

180
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,928
So did I.

181
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,429
And you know something?

182
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,231
- Our alleyway looked very similar.
- Really?

183
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,272
<i>Players,
please take one bag each</i>

184
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,982
<i>from the staff member before you.</i>

185
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,657
<i>There should be a set of ten marbles
in each bag.</i>

186
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,868
<i>Please check to confirm the number.</i>

187
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,623
It's marbles.

188
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,917
Old man, we're gonna be playing with this.

189
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,544
- Hmm.
- Are you familiar with it?

190
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,380
Ah, yes, very familiar.

191
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,550
Used to have a lot as a kid. Ah!

192
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,969
Oh, yes, back in the day.

193
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,848
And you know, I was pretty good.

194
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,434
Not too bad myself.

195
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,727
- Ah, that's good news.
- Yeah.

196
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,104
I'm glad it's not just about our strength.

197
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,483
That means you and I are...

198
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,194
<i>gganbu</i> now, pretty great.

199
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,570
<i>Gganbu</i>, huh?

200
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:50,908
I thought you said you played this before.
<i>Gganbu</i>, come on, you know.

201
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,117
It's a good friend.

202
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,244
One who you trust a lot.

203
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,038
You share things with them, you see?

204
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,040
- Ah!
- Your marbles, everything.

205
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,459
A <i>gganbu.</i> I remember now.

206
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,253
I had one in my town too.
Used to do everything with him.

207
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,298
Okay, we are <i>gganbu.</i>

208
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,967
Yes.

209
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,389
Should we do this to make it official?

210
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,266
Yeah, buddy. Like this.

211
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,813
- You and me, sir... Oh, no, <i>gganbu,</i> man.
- Yeah? Mm.

212
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,190
We'll go around this whole town,
and take all the marbles.

213
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,824
<i>In this game,
using your set of ten marbles,</i>

214
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,244
<i>you will play the game of your choice
with your partner.</i>

215
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,373
<i>The player who manages to take
all ten marbles from their partner wins.</i>

216
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,501
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

217
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,587
<i>Using your set of ten marbles,</i>

218
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,215
<i>play the game of your choice
with your partner.</i>

219
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,594
<i>The player who manages to take
all ten marbles from their partner wins.</i>

220
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,596
Oh, boy.

221
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,433
Shit, man.

222
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,524
Sang-woo.

223
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,906
How pretty.

224
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,910
Sir, excuse me.

225
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,290
<i>You will have 30 minutes for this game.</i>

226
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,208
<i>Let the game begins.</i>

227
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,627
Uh, sir, come back.

228
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Let's start.

229
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,074
That means one of us ends up dead,
doesn't it?

230
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,494
So both of us should do nothing then?
So we should just die?

231
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,790
Or one of us dies so the other can go on.

232
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,096
You haven't played before, right?

233
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,595
Since the Korean War,
nothing has been this sad.

234
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,679
Tragic.

235
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,475
What should we play then?

236
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,519
Wow. You're so cold.

237
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,729
As cold as ice.

238
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,692
So you a spy from the North or what?

239
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,486
Hey, stop the dumbshit, girl.

240
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,739
What game are we gonna play?

241
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,744
You tell me.

242
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,623
These boomers know all these games.

243
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,002
Ten marbles,
then we can create our own game.

244
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,172
Hmm. I'll try to come up with one.

245
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,094
We must be close.

246
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,597
Yes, it was somewhere around here, huh.

247
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,061
Come on, let's play. Sir, we need to, huh?
Come, let's play this right now.

248
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,063
This is so strange.

249
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,359
It should be here. This is the alley.

250
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,029
Where... My house, where did it go?

251
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,322
Sir, come back.

252
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,456
So you guess if I'm holding even or odd.
Which one you think is in here.

253
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,875
That all makes sense to you?

254
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,710
Even or odd?

255
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,212
What's that?

256
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,593
Odd is like one, three, five.

257
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,139
And even is two, four, six.

258
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,348
Understand?

259
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,481
Just think it through.
Then you wager a few of your own.

260
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,818
Odd.

261
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,787
Open your hand.

262
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,713
Ah, shit.

263
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,050
I should have added another one.

264
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,888
Stop giggling, asshole.

265
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,100
Hey, old man,
who are you calling asshole, huh?

266
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,063
You really think I'm your minion
just 'cause I call you "boss" a few times?

267
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,232
- You wanna die, you bastard?
- You wanna show me?

268
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,609
Ooh! So, how are you gonna do it?

269
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:40,072
Hmm? You can't resort to violence,
you puny little idiot dog.

270
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,747
Sir, we have to play now.
We gotta start right now.

271
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,624
Play what?

272
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,627
With our marbles. Let's go.

273
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,671
Why should I?

274
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,757
Look around you. Everybody else is too.

275
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,136
We gotta do this.

276
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,930
No.

277
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,850
That game is for little children.

278
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,521
No. Sir, come back here.

279
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,067
So let's...

280
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,903
end the game in one round.

281
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,159
All or nothing. A simple bet.

282
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,708
Don't tell me that you would
rather do what they are?

283
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,460
Watch.

284
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,880
- Bullseye! Yes.
- Ah, damn it.

285
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,093
- My turn.
- Okay.

286
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,095
Playing what then?

287
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,972
Why are you in such a hurry?

288
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,599
You're just dying to kill me, huh?

289
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,315
We're just playing one round here.

290
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,151
And we got time left too.

291
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,862
Let's wait till the end.

292
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,364
What are we gonna do before then?

293
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,490
Talk.

294
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,452
About what, though?

295
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,414
Things we never told anybody about
I guess.

296
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,336
One of us is gonna die here, so...

297
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,922
doesn't matter what we tell each other.

298
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,800
No one can really embarrass
themselves anymore.

299
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,676
Okay?

300
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,056
Even.

301
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,443
What's your wager?

302
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,655
Two.

303
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,092
You're up now.

304
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,281
I don't want to do this with you, sir.

305
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,930
Can I stop?

306
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,572
I would like to play with someone else...

307
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,435
Shut up and keep playing with me. Come on.

308
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,146
Sir, he's not in his right mind, sir.

309
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,606
I think he's got dementia.

310
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,691
That does mean that he's out or...

311
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,152
He's not gonna play.
So that means he forfeited, right? Huh?

312
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,905
Ah, shit.

313
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,869
Just one little game, okay?
Here, it'll be...

314
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,788
It'll be so much fun, sir.

315
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,374
No. I'd better go home now.

316
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:43,672
I know my house is nearby.
It's somewhere down this alley.

317
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,758
Shit! Goddamn it!

318
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,553
Will you please just pull yourself
together, old man?

319
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,889
They'll kill us both
if we don't get started soon!

320
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,828
You got that thing in your head,
so I bet you don't care what happens here,

321
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,187
but I won't just sit here and die, okay?

322
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,689
Listen, I can't die!

323
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,899
I need to get out of here.

324
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,651
Don't yell at me.

325
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,738
All right, I will, but don't yell.

326
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:19,332
...12, 13, 14, 15. Bam, okay.

327
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,503
We're playing something else.

328
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,298
No way. I'm not gonna stop now.

329
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,093
We already did things how you suggested.

330
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,138
I should get a chance to choose.

331
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,266
No.

332
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,228
Goddamn it.

333
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,316
You people said we're equals.
What is this?

334
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,068
I think we should play
a new game here, huh?

335
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,113
Request accepted.

336
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,206
What do you wanna play then, huh?

337
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,583
Even.

338
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,508
Do it. Show me.

339
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,165
You asshole.

340
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,795
You gotta be cheating.

341
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,714
Uh, Sang-woo, why would I do that to you?

342
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,675
How are you winning like this every round?

343
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,385
You keep beating me. How's that?

344
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,841
The odds should be 50-50.
That means you're cheating!

345
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,766
I didn't. No!
Sir, I wouldn't do that to you.

346
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,395
You jerk! You pretended not to know
how this works!

347
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,272
You said you haven't done this before!

348
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,275
How did you do it, huh? Spill it!

349
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,951
Why did you come here from the North?

350
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,328
I thought things were good over here.

351
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,666
And so?

352
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,794
Were you right?

353
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,594
Your family, are they here with you?

354
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,683
Just my brother.

355
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,810
Your parents?

356
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,985
My father got shot trying to swim
across the border and drowned.

357
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,236
Our mother...

358
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,950
she was hiding in China and got sent back
once the immigration agents found her.

359
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,080
Where is your brother now then?

360
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,544
In a shelter.

361
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,008
Even.

362
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,896
Odd. Even. Odd. Even.

363
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,023
So did I win?

364
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,276
What's your wager?

365
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,825
Oh...

366
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,836
We take turns throwing marbles

367
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,215
till you make a shot that lands
in the hole I dug over there.

368
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:56,716
Then what happens?

369
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,387
What happens is that person
gets to take everything on the ground.

370
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,806
Ah...

371
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,767
You mean, you want a way
to turn this around, huh.

372
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,520
- What? You scared?
- Not a chance.

373
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,605
I'm not worried at all.

374
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,777
I'm pretty good
at getting things in the holes, huh.

375
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,238
You sure about this, hmm?

376
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,996
If you win the money and get out of here,
what's your plan then?

377
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,641
I did this to get a house
where I could be with my brother first.

378
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,186
Then I'll get our mother out of the North.

379
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,340
Hey, with a price that big,
you can do a whole lot more than that.

380
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,467
You gotta want something else too.

381
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,636
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

382
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,473
Jeju Island.

383
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,808
Jeju Island?

384
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,770
There was a thing about it on TV.

385
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,898
It looked exotic.
It didn't look like Korea at all.

386
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,275
Hey.

387
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,944
Don't you think
you should dream bigger, huh?

388
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:02,240
Do Hawaii. Hold on, go to the Maldives
for a while instead.

389
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,908
And have a mojito too.

390
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,120
Mojito?

391
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,788
Like the movie.

392
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,457
Lee Byung-hun's in it.

393
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,585
"Go to mojito
and have a glass of Maldives."

394
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,503
Really?

395
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,466
Oh, no, we gotta fix that then.

396
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,717
Well, once we're out of here,

397
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,970
we'll have a girls' night out
and make mojitos and everything, okay?

398
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,311
Oh.

399
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,523
We can't both get out of here.

400
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,163
God, I'm so sorry, Ali.

401
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,166
I know you won't cheat.

402
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,252
But I can't die this way, I beg you.

403
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,005
They'll kill my family

404
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,634
if I don't get out of here.

405
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,637
Sorry, Sang-woo. No.

406
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,264
I'm so sorry.

407
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,934
I have to think of my family.

408
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,852
Hey, Ali. Hey.

409
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,896
Hey, come on, if you help me,

410
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,898
then there's a way
that both of us could live.

411
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,026
You only got this far 'cause I was there.

412
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,655
Like when I gave the bus fare to you and...

413
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,907
I'm the one who got the team
through Tug-of-War,

414
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,117
we kept watch at night together.

415
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,494
And just before this begin,

416
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,764
you and I swore
that we leave here together, right, Ali?

417
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,291
Listen, Ali, please.

418
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,169
Trust me, help me
and I'll make sure we get out of here.

419
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,170
Huh?

420
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,300
Okay. What do we do?

421
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,887
What is it? It might be odd.

422
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,809
On the other hand, it could be even.

423
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,647
- That must be it.
- Come on, hurry up and go.

424
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,899
Odd.

425
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,415
Look at that. I won again.

426
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,458
How many are in yours?

427
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,335
Uh...

428
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,631
Oh, shit.

429
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,050
Oh, shit.

430
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,650
I, uh...

431
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,569
I still have one.

432
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,237
I still have one more.

433
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,019
Yeah!

434
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,065
Goddamn it.

435
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,192
Okay, here's what I think.

436
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,362
I think there are gonna be teams out there
who can't decide the winner either.

437
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,322
Mm. Why not?

438
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,449
Think about how you win.

439
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:35,161
Remember the rules. Thirty minutes
to determine who will win or lose.

440
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,081
So think about it.

441
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,884
Some teams aren't gonna have a winner
when time is finally up, right?

442
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,711
You win and you lose,
and things just keep going on like that.

443
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,838
That means not every team
will have a winner.

444
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,799
What will they do?
Eliminate all those teams?

445
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,677
Makes no sense.
They have to decide who won. Don't they?

446
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,970
Yeah.

447
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,058
We'll play again.
We'll be working together.

448
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,395
We're teammates.
So we'll just add up everything.

449
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,064
Our team will go play other teams
with all 20.

450
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,567
You and I can play as a team

451
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,696
just like we planned to from the start.

452
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,366
You and I will get out of here.

453
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,709
<i>Player 414, eliminated.</i>

454
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,004
Is that what you want?

455
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,673
You want them to do that to me?

456
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,970
<i>Player 2, eliminated.</i>

457
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,764
You ever have to see anyone die
before those?

458
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,602
Once, we have this plague
go through my town when I was a kid.

459
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,275
As time went on, more and more towns
got sick and died.

460
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,280
Soldiers started carrying the dead
into piles and lit them on fire.

461
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,534
That's how my grandpa, grandma
and older brother all died.

462
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,995
They burned together.

463
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,291
Damn. Your stories are
a bit too dark even for me.

464
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,543
And you?

465
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,463
What have you seen?

466
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,803
<i>Player 130, eliminated.</i>

467
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,680
First body I saw...

468
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,598
my mother's.

469
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,061
One day, I came back from school,

470
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,481
and my mom was lying there,
dead on the floor.

471
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,817
And next to her...

472
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,613
was my so-called dad with a knife.

473
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,575
The next body that I saw...

474
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,704
that was my dad's.

475
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,459
And the person standing there
holding the knife...

476
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,169
that was me.

477
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,715
He was a goddamn pastor too.

478
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,054
And when he hit her and...

479
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,975
did the things he did to me,
he would talk to God.

480
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,021
He'd always ask for forgiveness.

481
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,483
He didn't pray on that day
after he killed her.

482
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,780
I was too mad he even forgot, I guess.

483
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,211
<i>Player 40, eliminated.</i>

484
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,428
Even.

485
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,016
No, hold on. That's not what...
Wait a minute.

486
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,352
Just give me a second.

487
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,438
Odd.

488
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,858
Odd.

489
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,291
Which one did you just say?

490
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,255
What?

491
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,010
Can you repeat...

492
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,305
what you said just now?

493
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,852
Even.

494
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,646
I said...

495
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,356
even.

496
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,279
Oh.

497
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,282
I lost this one.

498
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,376
Oh.

499
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,100
We both can win this round? Are you sure?

500
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,477
Hmm.

501
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,437
You're positive?

502
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,523
Just hear me out first
and then turn me down if you like.

503
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,235
I mean it. Here.

504
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,363
Let me just give you this
to hold on to, okay?

505
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,617
So you won't have any guilt
around my death.

506
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,953
Your plan...

507
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,288
what is it?

508
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,375
<i>Player 68, eliminated.</i>

509
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,460
Well, it will depend
on who we're going against.

510
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,983
We need to know which teams will be here
after the round ends.

511
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,465
We better split up to get an idea

512
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,468
how all the other teams are doing
to be prepared.

513
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,428
Let's look for one
that seem too young or old,

514
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,181
and check only teams that are still
playing games at this point.

515
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,976
- Young or old?
- Yeah.

516
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,394
That's what we need.

517
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,085
Like someone who looks your same age

518
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,941
or someone who seems like
they're older than 50.

519
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,172
You go up a few blocks from here,
then meet up back up with me later, okay?

520
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,281
Okay, Sang-woo.

521
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,497
- Ali.
- Huh?

522
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,791
Your pouch there.

523
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,295
It's too dangerous to keep it out.

524
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,130
These people are bound to go crazy
before the end.

525
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,549
Who knows what'll happen then?

526
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,052
Lose it and we'll both die. You got that?

527
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,140
Here. I'll make sure that it's safe, okay?

528
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,746
What are you gonna do
if you win all that money and get out?

529
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,165
I don't know what I would do.

530
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,336
Someone was waiting

531
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,921
at the prison the day I got out.

532
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,717
I thought he was a creditor
who came to collect my dad's debt.

533
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,552
But he pulled out a card.

534
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,721
That weird card.

535
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,267
I had nowhere else to go, so I...

536
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,023
never thought about what I'd do
if I got the money.

537
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,903
Go with you to Jeju Island?

538
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,077
Sorry.

539
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,287
I forgot again.

540

<i>Player 229, eliminated.</i>

541

Oh, damn it.

542
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,590
Fuck.

543
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,302
Goddamn it.

544
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,709
I thought that was in. Damn it.

545
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,338
So you're all out?

546
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,759
Look at that.

547
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,679
One more right here.

548
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,103

549
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,523
Nice knowing you.

550
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,931
That blue that went in,
that's mine, asshole!

551
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,391
Shit.

552
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,477
It was nice knowing you, you shithead.

553
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,028
Damn it!

554
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,408
Okay.

555
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,328
Oh. Oh.

Here.

560
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,307
How's that?

561
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,892
It feels safer like that, doesn't it?

562
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,938
Yeah.

563
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,066
When the timer says three minutes,
come and meet up with me here.

564

Then I'll tell you what we do next.

565
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,073

We've got three each.

569
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,594
Yeah, but, um, what was your guess?

570
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,263
Huh?

571
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,270
Oh, yeah. But which one did I guess?

572
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,940
You said even was your guess.

573
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,775
Did I...

574
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,111
Did I say that?

575
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,614
Yeah.

576
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,454
That means...

577
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,457

What day is it? The 24th?

595
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,308
I was going to buy him a toy robot
for his birthday.

596

This year, I need to get him a gift.
I completely forgot last year.

I have 20 marbles.

605

whatever game to get our opponent
to give us theirs,

and the players cannot acquire them
using violence.

to the wall, wins.

Don't have one. That's it.

00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,294
Who should go first then?

627
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,462
It should be your turn.

628
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,257
Since your number is lower.

629

Two, four, six, eight. Nineteen.

Nineteen.

I lost. You won.

648
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,835
Stop. Why the hell
would you try to do that?

649
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,047
Hey, butter fingers, what else can I say?

650
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,883
What you said

651
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,011
making sure that I won.
Is that what this is?

652
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,766
You think I'll be thankful
that you did this, huh?

653
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,601
Take another throw.

654
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,770
And I still wouldn't be able to win.

655
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,981
Ugh. Just let me lose
this thing in style, okay?

656
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,110
Ji-yeong, that's bullshit!
Stop acting cool and just do a real throw!

657
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,489
I have nothing.

658
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,199
What?

659
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,661
You got a reason to get out of this place,

660
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,123
but I don't.

661
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,170
I thought hard about what I'd do.

662
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,134
If I were the one who got out
since you asked me earlier.

663
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,139
No matter how hard I thought, though,
I got nothing.

664
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,603
The one who should have a reason
to get back out there...

665
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,856
that's what's right.

666
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,322
You can do it. Don't die in here, okay?

667
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,241
And go...

668
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,703
And go meet your mother.

669
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,831
Go get your brother too.

670
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,835
And go to Jeju Island.

671
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,591
Sang-woo.

672
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,344
Sang-woo, where are you?

673
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,264
Sang-woo? Sang-woo, hello?

674
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,767
I'm done with this side.

675
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,186
Sang-woo!

676
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,647
Sang-woo!

677
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,650
<i>Player 199, eliminated.</i>

678
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,077
Kang Sae-byeok!

679
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,127
I'm honored...

680
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,965
that we were partners.

681
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,847
<i>Player 240, eliminated.</i>

682
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,613
Sir, please. Let's just...
let's just play one more time, huh?

683
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,365
Come on, one more round.

684
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,534
Oh.

685
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,910
Oh, shit.

686
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,203
It's this one.

687
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,624
Yes, this is it.

688
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,502
My wife and I had this one here.

689
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:56,214
I raised my son right in here.

690
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:03,221
Yes. I even had a nice little pond
right here in the front yard.

691
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,724
Sir, please,
you have one marble left.

692
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,809
We're running out of time, sir.

693
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,314
And I, I would come home from work,

694
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,819
and see my son, his friends
were always here and they would all play,

695
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,863
and they wouldn't even know I was here.

696
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,406
You need to get it together!

697
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,992
Get it together and play with me again
right now, understood?

698
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,871
I would hide and I'd go
just behind the utility pole there

699
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:31,124
and take a peek at all of them playing
and just watching.

700
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,377
They would always have so much fun.

701
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,837
Sir, please.

702
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,174
Try to snap out of it, sir.

703
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,930
Oh, God. Sir, I'm begging you.

704
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:54,940
Why don't we do one more and bet it all?

705
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,735
What?

706
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,489
Everything that I still got,

707
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,700
and everything that you'd...

708
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,871
You can't possibly mean that.

709
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,208
You're gonna take yours and bet it all,

710
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:17,295
and I'll do the same
with everything that I still got here.

711
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,924
Okay? Keeps everything fair.

712
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,636
I'll wager all I got just to get your one?

713
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,473
What kind of nonsense is this?

714
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,309
There's no sense at all!

715
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,104
So then...

716
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,024
that's what you did this whole time.

717
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:43,530
Does tricking your friend like that
make sense to you?

718
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,354
Take it.

719
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,608
It's yours anyway.

720
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,280
We are...

721
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,741
<i>gganbu</i>, aren't we?

722
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,493
Don't you remember?

723
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,873
When you and I swore
that we were <i>gganbu</i> buddies.

724
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:41,546
<i>Gganbu</i> always share everything
with each other no matter what.

725
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,514
Thank you.

726
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,518
You made all this...

727
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,397
a good experience.

728
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,525
What a great way to go.

729
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,070
Really.

730
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,368
It's okay.

731
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,579
Hey.

732
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,290
Everything's okay.

733
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,674
Mm.

734
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,426
It will be okay.

735
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,439
Hey, I remember my name now.

736
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:45,110
My name is Il-nam.

737
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,821
