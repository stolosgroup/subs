Sang-woo.

12
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,925
You helped me. Thank you.

13
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,598
And you did too.

14
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,227
You saved my life out there.

15
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,397
You're alive. That is what matters.

[door clanking]

18
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,765
[masked manager] You have all made it
through the first game.

19
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,040
Congratulations.

20
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,184
- You're moving on.
- [sighs]

21
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,961
I will now announce the results
of the first game.

[masked manager] Out of 456 players,
255 were eliminated,

27
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,812
and 201 players successfully
completed the first game.

31
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,488
[sobs]
Listen. I'm so sorry.

32
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,240
I swear I will pay what I owe.

33
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,035
I'll do it, I'll pay it all.
[crying]

34
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,454
Please, sir.
[sobs]

35
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,957
I have a child.

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,001
Oh! So young,

37
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:52,422
I need to register,
and I still need to name my child, sir.

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,840
[cries]

39
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,719
- [woman 1] Please, sir, let me leave.
- [woman 2] Please. I'm so sorry.

40
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,972
Sir, I'm begging you.
Let me leave and I swear

41
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,474
I'll find a way to pay it all.

42
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,952
- Let me go home.
- [woman 3] Me too.

43
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,146
I can't keep going.
Sir, please, I can't go on.

44
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,149
- [players clamor]
- [man 1] Please let me go home.

45
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,235
[masked manager]
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

46
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,614
We are not trying to hurt you
or collect your debts.

47
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,826
Let me remind you
that we're here to give you a chance.

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,911
[man 2] A chance?

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,871
We play some kids games.

50
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,333
And you shoot us.
You want me to choose that?

51
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,418
That's some chance.

52
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,795
We may be in debt, sir...
[cries]

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,714
...but that doesn't justify killing us all.

54
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,175
- [masked manager] This is just a game.
- [all murmur]

55
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,658
Killing everyone out there was a...

56
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,470
game to you, huh?

57
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,514
They were simply eliminated
for breaking the rules of the game.

58
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,808
If you just follow the rules,

59
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,562
you can leave this place safely
with the prize money we promised.

60
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,023
Just keep your damn money. I don't care!

61
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,902
Let me just go home. That's all I want.

62
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,446
- [indistinct chatter]
- [man 3] Let us leave. Let us go.

[masked manager] Consent form clause 1.

64
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,451
A player is not allowed to stop playing.

65
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,162
Come on! You think
you'll get away with this, huh?

66
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,373
[Player 119] The police will come.

67
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,418
They'll bust in here any minute now.
They'll be here since we all disappeared.

68
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,253
Yeah.

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,425
And I bet they have
everybody's phones tracked here already.

70
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,303
Look at all your hostages.
You're doomed if you don't let us go!

71
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,304
- We're all dead!
- [gunshot]

72

Consent form clause 2.

75
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,526
A player who refuses to play
will be eliminated.

76
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,945
[Sang-woo] Consent form clause 3.

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,448
If all the players agreed to stop playing,

78
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,659
the games are allowed to end.

79
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,493
Or am I wrong?

80
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,444
[masked manager] You are correct.

81
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,962
So let's vote on ending this.

82
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,090
If the majority wishes
to leave this place,

83
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,509
then everyone gets to go home, right?

84
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,556
All right, as you wish.

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,517
We will take a vote to decide
on the termination of the game.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,436
[players muttering]

87
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,023
Before we vote,

88
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,068
let me announce the prize money
for the game as previously promised.

89

[chiptune music stops]

96
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:09,702
[masked manager] A total of 255 players
were eliminated during the first game.

97
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,371
A hundred million won
is at stake per player.

98
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:17,627
Therefore, 25.5 billion won of prize money
has been accumulated so far.

99
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,089
If you wish to give up on playing,
the 25.5 billion won

100
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,925
will be sent to the bereaved families
of the late players,

101
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,384
100 million won each.

102
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,888
However, you will all return home
empty-handed.

103
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,058
Uh, sir...

104
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,063
So then, if we can complete all six games,

105
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,524
how much do we get?

106
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,943
[masked manager]
Since there were 456 players,

107
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,113
the total prize money is 45.6 billion won.

108
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,574
And with that,
we will now begin the voting.

109
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,746
As you can see,
there are two buttons in front of you.

110
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,500
If you wish to continue playing,
press the green button with an O.

111
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,210
If you wish to stop playing,

112
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,088
then please press the red button
with the X instead.

113
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,048
After you finish voting,

114
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,676
move to the other side
of the white line and wait.

115
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,471
Voting will be done in reverse order
of the numbers on your chests.

116
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,808
Player 456, please cast your vote.

00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,640
We have to leave.

140
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,368
We can't keep putting up
with this insanity.

141
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,018
[Player 212] So what if we leave?

142
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,771
Tell me, what changes?

143
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,025
Just as bad out there
as it is in here, goddamn it.

[scoffs]

145

She's right!

146
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,365
If we stop right now,
that only helps the ones who are dead.

147
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,285
They'll get a 100 million won and not us.

148
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,288
We made it through! They're out!
That money is ours.

149
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,332
Please! Think about
what just happened out there.

Come on, let's go!
[whimpers]

Where am I supposed to go, huh?

00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,382
Out there, I don't stand a chance.
I do in here.

00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,176
No, I've got nothing out there.

154
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,388
Come on, let's finish this thing!

155
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,933
I'd rather stay and keep on trying in here
than go back to the bullshit out there.

156
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,228
You jerk! You got some kind of death wish?
Go die alone!

157

Don't drag everybody else
into this, you little shit!

We will not condone any kind of act

Wait, that's for kids.

- Is that what they made you play?
- Yes.

- And they forced adults to do it?
- I know how it sounds.

321
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,024
And then they shot everyone
who got caught?

do you want me to say it?

00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,764
[officer 2] Mister.

324
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,160
So where did they do it?
Where's the place they were killed?

325
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,395
They had me knocked unconscious,
so how could I know?

326
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,998
I said I don't have any freaking clue.

327
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,541
Then give us the killer's description.

328
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,805
They all had these masks on
the whole time we were there.

329
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,979
[officer 2] Then, wait,
how did you manage to get out?

330
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,364
Hey, look, the players came together
and put it to a vote.

331
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,450
- And since the majority wanted to leave...
- Hold on, okay?

332
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,119
You said you wanted to stop playing,

333
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,080
and the killers, they told you,
"Sure, you can go." Just like that?

334
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,666
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

335
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,960
And what made you want to go there?

336
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,547
Well, they...

337
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,302
- they promised we would get money, so...
- [officer 2] Money?

338
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,388
Yeah.

339
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,551
- We're talking tens of billions of won.
- [chuckles]

340
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,312
Okay. Let me just sum up
everything you've told us so far.

341
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,479
Just so I understand.

342
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,683
You went to play kids' games

343
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,733
because someone told you
you'd get all that cash.

344
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,919
So then they had you play
some Red Light, Green Light,

345
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,695
and they shot everyone who got caught.

346
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,448
But when you said you wanted to go,
they said, "Okay, just go,"

347
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,701
and you don't know what they look like
or where this all took place.

348
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,036
Is that everything, mister?

349
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,871
Yeah.

350
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,999
What's your name, sir?

351
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,668
I live in Ssangmun-dong.
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

352
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,047
Seong Gi-hun, you got someone
who's taking care of you?

353
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,092
If you want me to help, we can call around
and get you to a local medical center.

354
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,260
What do you take me for?

355
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,888
Look, I'm a tax-paying citizen
of Ssangmun-dong. Got it?

356
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,099
Here's their number.
It's on a business card.

357
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,143
Call and see what they say! Jeez!

358
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,271

363
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,923
- [woman] <i>Hello?</i>
- Uh...

364
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,052
Hello, yes, sorry for bothering you.
Uh, my bad.

365
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,638
Um, would you mind if I ask you something?

366
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,764
[woman] <i>Who is this?</i>

367
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,408
- Well, I...
- [whispers] Hey, you're not a cop, okay?

368
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,977
Uh... Uh, sorry to call so early.

369
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,564
Could I come play in those games there?

370
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,775
[woman] <i>Games?</i>

371
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,362
Uh, yeah. See,
games are my thing, you know.

372
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,072
I'll play all the games you ask me to.

373
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,955
- I'll do the best...
- [woman] <i>Okay. Hold on.</i>

374
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,785
<i>Who the heck are you?</i>

375
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,246
<i>And why are you calling me this early
with this nonsense?</i>

376
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,624
<i>If you wanna play games,
go to an Internet cafe.</i>

377
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,626
<i>What's wrong with you,
you freaking pervert?</i>

378
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,507
[sniffles]

379
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,936
[Gi-hun] You dialed
the wrong number! Let go!

380
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,407
- Officer, don't do this. Please.
- We're sorry, mister. You better go home.

381
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,600
You sure you dialed the right number, huh?
Better be sure you did!

382
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,770
You'll see.
Look, I'll call and put you on the line.

383
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,523
The right number's on my phone
from the call that I made already.

384
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,733
[whispers]
Fuck this guy.

<i>Please check the number...</i>

390
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,837
Who was that? Was he drunk?

391
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,672
Some crazy hobo guy.

392
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,758
Everything's crazy around here today.

393
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,926
You, get a grip. Wanna go back in?

394
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,849
Well, I'm out. Have a good one.

395
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,311
[officer 2] Here. Goodbye.

[birds chirping]

Hey, Ma.

398

It's your son.

399
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,534
Hmm.

400
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,331
Ma?

401
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,463
Where are you?

402
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,300

to reach is currently unavailable.</i>

Where'd you go?
You left the door open and everything.

405
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
[Gi-hun] Sang-woo.

406
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,823
What are you doing here?

407
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,866
[sighs]

408
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,453
[both sigh]

409
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,086
Is it because of your debt?

410
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,422
Shh...

411
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,593
Hey, come on, you're still
Ssangmun-dong's own pride and joy.

412
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,430
You're still the genius who got accepted
to SNU Business School. So don't worry.

413
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,557
You'll make money again.

414
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,601
Go tell your mom all about it
and make a fresh start.

[scoffs]

416
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,938
Just make...

417
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,649
six billion won?

418
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,776
Six billion?

419
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,238
I thought it was 600 million won.

420
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,074
They don't know everything there is.

421
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,704
And all those stocks that guy said
that you lost, you did that for real?

422
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,747
It wasn't just stocks now.

423
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,294
[inhales]
There was futures too.

424
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,420
Excuse me?

425
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:25,964
You bet on your future?

426
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,695
[Gi-hun] What kind of bet was it
that you used that much money?

427
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,722
- Did you get a girlfriend?
- Doesn't mean that future.

428
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,767

Just forget it.

Hey, file for personal bankruptcy then.

Whatever they call it.

433
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,238
I heard you won't have to pay
your debts off if you do that.

434
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,908
I used my own mother's house
as financial collateral.

435
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,617
And her shop.

436
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,412

Yeah, this is he.

24-HOUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

- [doctor] She's diabetic.

444
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,731
- [sighs]
- She left it untreated, and it got worse.

445
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,031
She had to be in a lot of pain recently.
You didn't know?

446
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,076
Will you be able to treat her for it?

447
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,788
In the worst case,
she might need to have her feet amputated.

448
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:44,417
Let's keep her here for now
and see how things go with treatment.

[Gi-hun] Ma.

Ma!

453
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,977
Mom, where are you going?

454
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,396
He said you need to stay here.

455
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm okay.

456
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,774
But you're not okay.

457
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,068
Hey, Mom, you can't walk around like that.

458
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,070
- Look, just stop it.
- [breathing heavily]

459
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,197
You haven't been home in days now,

460
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,491
out doing whatever it is
you're doing lately,

461
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,618
but now you're a good son, huh?

462
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,537
Mom, don't be like this, okay?

463
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,539
You know how bad this thing could get?

464
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,793
Tell me. Say I stay here
and they treat me,

465
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,296
who's going to pay the rent in that case?

466
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,967
Also, do you know how much it costs
to be in the hospital,

467
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,845
not to mention how much all the drugs are?

468
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,596
The insurance will help pay for them.

469
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,474
Insurance? Help us?

470
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,393
You canceled all that.

471
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:48,023
Remember, you ended it
and used up all the cash we had.

472
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,692
Will you please just get a grip?

473
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,319
Goodness.

Let's stop. I'm too tired.

477
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,956
I'm too tired to go on.
Stop arguing with me.

478

00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,592
Damn it. I'll get what you need.

482
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,386
I'll get all the money you need.
[sniffs]

483
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,725
Hello, Ma.

484
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,980
Heading over to his apartment right now.

485
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,568
I'm sure he's fine, okay?

486
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,571
He dodges our calls all the time.
You know what he's like.

487
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,660
I can call everyone who might know places
he's hold up in before.

488
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,413
If I can't reach him then,

489
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,458
then I'll go report him missing tomorrow.

490
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,630
I'm a police officer.
Have you forgotten that?

491
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,924
I will find him.

492
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,885
[young officer] Yes, Mom.
Don't worry too much.

[distant dog barking]

494
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,508
[young officer] How long
has it been since he came by?

495
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,143
Well, I don't bother tenants every day.

496
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,979
Still, I mean,
his rent was due a week ago.

497
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,482
I've stopped by every day since then,

498
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,985
he was never here, though,
and never picked up his phone.

499
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,738
There.

500
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,866
That's right.
Think you could pay his rent?

501
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,996
Otherwise, you'll have to come
move all of his things out.

502
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,543
I'll take a look now
and pay his rent later.

503

[landlord giggles]

around here today.

Hey, I got ice cream, everyone.

What? No ice cream for you, little man?

514
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,248
How did you get your face like that?

515
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,959
Did you get into a fight?

516
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,632
If you're not gonna talk to me,

517
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,132
I guess I'll just go.

518
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,849
Wait. I don't wanna stay here, okay?

519
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,770
Where's Mom? You said she would come soon.

520
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,148
You told me that we'd be together.

521
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,651
that I just had to wait a month.

522

Cheol.

00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,618
- Listen...
- All the kids told me you lied.

524
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,870
They said I'd never leave and...

525
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,290
They said I'd get abandoned here.

526
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,712
They're wrong.

I swear, okay?
I'll make sure that they do.

531
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,477
Don't worry. Listen, we'll all live
under the same roof next year, okay?

What do you need his name for,
Detective Hwang?

538
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,629
I saw that he looked familiar to me.

I think I know the guy
like to a family friend or something.

Really?

Let me think about it.

- Ssangmun-dong is where he lives, right?

Look at what working here
did to my body, sir.

Go and ask the rest of my employees
if they got their paychecks yet.

I'm so damn broke. I need a doctor.

You said you would pay us.
Where did it all go?

for all our hard work out there.

Sir, please give me my money back.

You little shit, don't touch me.

00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,232
[Ali] I saw you have money.

577
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,733
- Shut up!
- [Ali] My money!

578
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,193
Give it to me!

579
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,487
- Let me go, son of a bitch!
- [both grunting]

[man] I completely understand
what your situation is like.

589
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,761
But you know, it's...

590
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,557
A broker can't be tracked down
once they've fled with all of their money.

591
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,934
You aren't the only victim.

592
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,313
There's some who went all the way
to Dandong to try and catch this one guy,

593
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,816
they got caught by the Chinese police,

594
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,235
almost got dragged all the way back North.

595
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,571
My options, what are they? What do I do?

596
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,701
[sighs]
Get another broker and try it all again.

597
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,995
And I'm sure you already know,

598
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,790
but you're going to need
to start the process over again.

599
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,043
How much is it?

600
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,502
[sighs]

601
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,881
We're gonna start by finding out
your parents location again.

602
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,926
And security around the border
is now much tighter,

603
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,596
so the price for helping them
cross the river shot up.

604
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,139
So how much then?

605
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,099
[inhales sharply]

606
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,351
So you'll want...

607
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,147
at least 40 million.

608
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,440
[glass clinks]

609
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,275
Forty million.

610
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,028
You're only paying
to get them to China, though.

611
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,871
If you want to get them to the South then...

612
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,739
[screams]

613

614
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,286
Damn it.
[whimpers]

615
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,609
I trusted you and brought my money here
like you told me.

616
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,959
That money is something
I risked my own life to get.

617
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,127
[whimpers]

618
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,670
Hey. Uh...

619
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,298
I had no idea.
[whimpers]

620
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:56,302
I didn't know those people
would just run off with all your money.

621
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,678
Please, I swear.

622
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,264
[breathing shakily]

623
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,100
Sure.

624
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,519
I'll get your money.

625
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,731
- You pull anything on me...
- [whimpers]

626
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,484
...I'll rip your fucking throat wide open,
and that's that.

627
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,903
You got it?

628
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,822

SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

633
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,679
[Sang-woo's mom] So,
have you been eating all right over there?

634
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,807
[Sang-woo] <i>Yes, I've been eating well,
so don't worry.</i>

635
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,894
I doubt that greasy American food
is doing all that much for you.

636
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,397
- Tell me what you're eating.

So when are you coming back?

so I'm not sure.</i>

Excuse me.</i>

I'll take three squids,

Ah, yes. Wait just a minute.

Sang-woo, there's a customer here.

- Okay.

way too expensive.</i>

Is he married yet?

666

Not yet. He's single.

668

I know someone he might like.

Well, the man's standards

[detective] Hi there. Excuse me.

Are you Mr. Cho Sang-woo's mother?

673
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,334
Uh, yeah. Cho Sang-woo.
Yes, he's my son, sir.

674
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,253
Do you know where your son
happens to be now?

675
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,546
On business in the United States. Uh...

676
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,132
- Why do you ask, sir?
- Well, we're the police.

677
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,387
I'm afraid that Mr. Cho Sang-woo
has a warrant out for his arrest.

678
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,515
He's charged with forgery,
embezzlement, crimes that are all...

some form of financial fraud.

I know that my son
wouldn't do anything illegal. So...

Listen, I'm sure you love him a lot.

686

If he contacts you,
just tell him to come to us.

687

If he keeps avoiding us like this,

it's gonna look bad.

00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,402
time's almost out as it is.

797
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,528
I don't want...

798
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,739
to sit around waiting to die.

799
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,157
That sounds pathetic.

800
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,244
And who knows

801
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:10,207
I still could go and win the whole thing.

802
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,293
When we played Red Light, Green Light,

803
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,964
I got to the line even before you did.

804
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,632
How could you wanna go there?

805
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,219
But as soon as I got back here,

806
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:27,975
I got some harsh reminders.
Yeah, what they say is true.

807
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,813
Out here, the torture is worse.

808
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,440
[chuckles]

809
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,236
[somber music]

810
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,197
[thunder rumbles]

811
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,784
[fanfare music playing in the carnival]

812
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,579
[thug] Hey, boss!

813
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,707
What took you so long?

814
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,917
All these stupid drunks
got into a huge fight

815
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,961
as I was about to leave the bar
and head here.

816
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,505
Ah, you know how it goes.
[chuckles]

817
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,633
Something about a Friday night
always brings out the weirdos.

818
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,719
- The money?
- Oh.

819
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,140
I couldn't get more on short notice.

820
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,434
I'll make sure the rest
will come in soon, okay?

821
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,605
And anyways, the Big Boss sent out
all the boys to find you

822
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,149
Incheon and Ilsan,
the whole damn place had eyes.

823
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,275
[scoffs]

824
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,027
Where have you been hiding?

825
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,197
We better not discuss that out here.
Did you drive here?

826
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,991
Yeah, this way.

827
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,246
[engine revs]

828
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:36,168
So this is the invitation from that whole
Red Light, Green Light game, huh?

829
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,586
Yeah.

830
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,088
This one came yesterday.

831
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,466
They're starting up again.

832
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:48,055
So then, we go on Tuesday.
Gather all the boys and meet us there.

833
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,265
Get some guns for us too.

834
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,685
- Guns?
- They've got guns, yeah.

835
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,313
Still, the pickup is only one guy.

836
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,441
We'll beat up those masked shitheads,

837
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,777
and then we break in
and take all the cash.

838
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,364
I don't know. How am I supposed to know
how much of that is true?

839
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:09,159
You bastard. Come on,
tell me what you're getting at.

840
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,744
Sorry, boss.

841
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,501
So they've got tens of billions of won
up in a huge piggy bank up there.

842
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,462
As long as we hit them
with everything we got,

843
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,675
no more dealing with those stupid drunks
at bars to make barely anything, assholes.

844
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,758
[chuckles]

845
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,469
Uh, boss, hold on.

846
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,933
All the guys... you went into hiding
because you mess with the Big Boss.

847
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,477
At this point, all of Incheon knows.

848
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,479
Ahh!

849
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,274
I doubt I'd be able to convince anyone.

850
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,775
Hey, look here, you jerk.

851
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,152
We're gonna do this
so I can get the money I owe him.

852
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,155
So...

853
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,702
in the Philippines, how did you lose
so much money at the casino?

854
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,788
How did you know that?

855
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,708
Boss, you should've known not to go
pushing your luck, you know.

856
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,251
You little piece of shit.

857
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,133
Deok-su.

858
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,259
"Deok-su"?

859
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,844
- [laughs]
- [car horn honks]

860
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,178
[tires screeching]

861
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:14,474
The guys from the casino
came here looking for you.

862
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:19,521
They'll take your liver, your kidneys,
and your eyes for the money you owe.

863
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,897
[laughs]

864
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,191
And now you're gonna die,
you fucking asshole!

865
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,735
[cackles]

866
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,655

[man chokes]

00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,587
[tense music continues]

871
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,133
Hey! Welcome to Korea!

872
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,009
Welcome!

873
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,346
I killed Deok-su, okay?

874
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,390
Come on! Come at me, you bastards.

875
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,852
- [goon 1] Hey!
- [goon 2] Go! Kill Deok-su!

876
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,937
[goon 3] Get him!

877
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,857
[splashes]

878
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,277
[Ga-yeong's mom] Money?

879
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,445
[Gi-hun] Yeah.

880
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,490
[Ga-yeong's mom] How much?

881
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,160
[Gi-hun] About...

882
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,788
two million won.

883
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,915
[Ga-yeong's mom] Two million won?

884
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,503
Yeah.

885
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,010
You think you can come here
and ask for that?

886
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:36,348
You never paid child support
or any alimony or help us with anything.

887
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,684
And now you're asking us
to give you money?

888
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,606
I'm sorry. It's for... my mom.

889
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,941
She was in the hospital.

890
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,820
[sighs]

891
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,197
And how bad is it?

892
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,283
She has diabetes.

893
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,870
[inhales sharply]
She needs surgery.

894
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,667
[sighs deeply]

895
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,921
[Gi-hun clicks tongue]

896
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,464
Well, I'm broke.

897
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,633
Things have been hard.
[exhales]

898
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,387
[Gi-hun clicks tongue]

899
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,764
Please, I'm begging you.

900
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,518
Mom was always really good to you.

901
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,395
Look how desperate I was to ask you.

902
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,356
And I'll give it back.

903
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,942
I really am broke.

904
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,319
I just get money from my husband.

905
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,031
Well, then could you,
could you ask him for it?

906
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,199
You crazy?

907
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,453
Hey.
[scoffs]

908
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,206
And what am I supposed to tell him
it's for if he asks, huh?

909
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,793
[sighs deeply]

910
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,087
Out. Now.

911
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,256
- Hey.
- The kids' dad will be here soon.

912
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,632
- Go.
- Hey.

913
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,927
What the hell do you think
you're doing calling him her dad?

914
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,264
- I'm her real father, okay?
- Oh, yeah? Tell me more.

915
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,059
Go ahead. Why don't you tell me
what you did to deserve to be her dad?

916
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,896
You... Were you there when she was born?
Didn't think so.

917
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,398
[shaky breath]
You know that...

918
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,859
- I told you all that, okay.
- [sighs]

919
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,360
And you know why I couldn't go.

920
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,570
Someone collapsed at work.

921
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,697
Yeah, well, I fainted too.
[sobs]

922
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,242
I was alone and had to crawl
just to get myself over to the hospital.

923
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,496
- And if I'd been any later, she'd be dead!
- No, I watched that guy die!

924
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,789
With my own eyes!

925
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,958
But no hospital, though. He couldn't go!

926
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,085
[door lock beeping]

927
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,046
- [door lock chimes]
- [door opens]

928
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,548
Honey, we're home.

929
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,803
[Ga-yeong's mom] You're home early.

930
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,262
[door lock chimes]

931
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,388
Um, hi, Dad.

932
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,104
Hi, Mom!

933
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:53,193
Come on in here, guys.
He stopped by to see Ga-yeong.

934
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,402
Um...

935
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,489
And now that I saw her, I'll get going.

936
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,701
You're going?

937
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,495
Yeah, I have an important meeting
to go to.

938
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,580
Ga-yeong, bye now.

939
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,582
- I'll see you soon.
- Hmm.

940
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,959
[door rattles]

941
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,316
- [Gi-hun] How do you open...
- Here.

942
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,738
- [door chiming]
- [Gi-hun] Thanks.

943
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,302
[door lock chimes]

944
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,426
[Ga-yeong's stepdad]
Why did he come here this time?

945
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,573
- Why did you let him in the house?
- [Ga-yeong's mom] I'm sorry.

946
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:29,187
I was coming back from the market,
and he was waiting at the front door.

947
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,482
[rain pouring]

948
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,531
[Ga-yeong's stepdad] Wait.

949
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,790
What is that?

950
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,084
You needed money.

951
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,213
[sighs]

952
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,598
Thanks so much.

953
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,268
Uh, I swear I'll pay you back.

954
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,911
[Ga-yeong's stepdad] You don't have to.

955
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,441
Instead, you can stop trying
to contact our family.

956
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,653
It's tough for Ga-yeong, but...

957
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,114
we're moving to the US soon.

958
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,241
If you just keep showing up...
[grunts]

959
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,285
You asshole!

960
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,621
Do you think money solves everything?

961

[Gi-hun breathing heavily]

Seong Gi-hun?

966
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,039
Yeah?

967
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,127
Hwang Jun-ho, police.

968
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,965
You recently made a report
at the station, right?

969
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,345
You said a group abducted people
and make them play games.

970
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,554
And you also said...

971
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,974
some players were killed too.

972
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,018
Oh, all that? Yeah, I just made that up.

973
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,646
Yeah, a story I made up when I was drunk.

974
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,524
They sent a card to my brother

975
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,443
just like the one you had, sir.

976
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,322
He went missing a few days ago.

977
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,201
I just found it, I don't know.

978
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,870
I saw it on the street
and just put it in my pocket.

979
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:51,997
Mr. Seong.

980
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,666
You can help me.

981
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,961
I need to get him back.

982

[tense music]

983
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,134
Why would you think...

984
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,305
that I will be useful to you
or anybody else?
