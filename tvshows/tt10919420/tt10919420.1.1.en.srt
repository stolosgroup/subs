- Ga-yeong, I got your present right here.

[Gi-hun chuckles]

00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,259
[Gi-hun] Ah...

00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,764
Uh...

321
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,103
You know why, huh?
These days, even women go to war.

322
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,229
Uh-huh.

323
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,772
I mean, when you finally get older,

324
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,817
there's not gonna be that kind
of discrimination like we got now.

325
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,194
And you'll need to get used to this
pretty soon, you know.

326
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,780
[clacking]

Ah.
[chuckles]

328
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,829
Oh, plus, it's a lighter.
[laughs]

329
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,999
Looks like the real deal, doesn't it?
[chuckles]

[laughs awkwardly]

331
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,378
I think you'll get in trouble
with Mom again

332
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,839
if she saw me holding this.

333
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,215
Is that right?

334
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,053
I'll keep it then, just till you get
a little bit older. Okay?

335
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,846
Hey, don't smoke of it, though.

336
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
Oh, come on, I'm clean now.

All right. All right.

340
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,026
I'll make sure I'll stop smoking for real.

341
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,696
And you'll see next year, huh,
I'll get an awesome present for you, okay?

342
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,865
Ga-yeong, I swear.

343
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,201
Next year?

344
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,827
Last year, you had a birthday.

345
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,454
This one came right around, right?

346
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,914
And the next one will be quick.

347
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,458
Um, Dad?

348
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,794
Hmm? Shoot.

349
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,882
Nothing.
[nervous chuckle]

350
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,262
Okay. Come on, come on.
Have more <i>tteokbokki</i>.

351
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,599
Excuse me, sir, one more order, okay?

352
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,518
And mix it with some of that in.

[Ga-yeong's mom]
Why did you bring her back so late?

356
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,495
She's not dressed for the cold.

357
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,081
Oh, she got sleepy, I carried her.

358
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,917
We're ten minutes late at most. Okay?

359
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,752
I said I'd drive down
to get her, didn't I?

360
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
It's her birthday. Let's not yell.

- Oh.
- Hey, Ga-yeong, hey, get down.

363
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,095
I'll carry her to the elevator
if you don't mind, okay?

364
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,471
She can walk on her own.

and it flips over,

403
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,646
I get a 100,000 won?

And if I can flip yours, you will give me
the exact same amount of money.

Your name, Seong Gi-hun. 47 years old.

You attended Daehan Technical High School.

Worked at Dragon Motors,

The company laid you off ten years ago.

00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,923
Opened a chicken shop,
and then a small snack bar.

Both of them failed,
you're working as a chauffeur right now.

00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,344
You've been divorced
for about three years,

and your daughter is ten years old.

473
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,432
A hundred and sixty million won owed
just to loan sharks,

00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,185
and you owe 250 more to the bank.

What about both of your parents?

640
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,362
Do they get nice food cooked
by their daughter-in-law all day long?

Huh?

The doctor said there's a...

645
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,377
a lump inside over here.
Growing every day.

646
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,963
Your... your head?

647
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,173

This is what I get?

You took more from me
than whatever I might possibly owe.

662

If all of that's true,
how come you ran then?

663

Well, I didn't. I went independent.

there's something that me and this...

What's your problem with this girl, 101?

697

Yeah, I'll bet that,
that you're a thug who preys on girls

698
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,250
that takes advantage of them.

699
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
Did you tell her to rob me like that?

700
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,938

- Get away! Hey!

[masked manager] I would like to extend
a heartfelt welcome to you all.

711
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,590
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

712
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:02,553
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

713
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,014
[man 3] And why should we believe that?

714
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,142
Y-You took all our stuff
and put us to sleep coming here,

715
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,186
and then you brought us
to this strange warehouse.

716
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,481
Now you're saying you'll pay us
if we go and play a few games?

717
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,399
You really expect us to buy that?

718
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,753
[masked manager]
We reluctantly took all of those measures

719
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,863
to maintain confidentiality
as we brought you here.

720
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,242
We'll return everything
once the games are over.

721
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,329
You all... you all have masks.
Why are you wearing those things?

722
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,373
[masked manager]
We do not disclose the faces

and personal information of our staff
to any of the participants.

724
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,713
It's a measure we take
to ensure fair games and confidentiality.

725
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,090
Please understand.

726
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,092
Well, I don't believe you one bit.
You got that?

727
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,928
You tricked us. We were kidnapped.

728
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,305
You can make as many excuses as you want

729
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,683
to make sure nobody knows
you broke the law in here.

730
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,604
If you're going to make up for that,
then we're gonna need something more.

Former team leader
of Team Two at Joy Investments.

Siphoned money off
from his clients' balances,

then invested it in derivatives

Every person standing here in this room

You all have debts that you can't pay off.

745
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,021
When we first went to see each of you,
not a single one of you trusted us.

746
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,107
But as you all know, we played a game,

747
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,818
and as we promised,
gave you money when you won.

748

And suddenly, everyone here trusted us.

in this game of your own free will.

So this is it.

I'll give you one last chance to choose.

752
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,752
Will you go back to living your old
and depressing lives

getting chased by your creditors?
