EPISODE 8
FRONT MAN

3
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,212
Why'd you do that?

4
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,049
What the hell did you expect, huh?

5
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,843
Why go up and push that guy?

6
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,763
You got lucky waiting
in the back of the line.

7
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,224
Must have forgotten how things are here.

8
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,854
What if that guy ended up wasting our time
on that one step like that criminal?

9
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,981
Would you have done nothing?

10
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,482
But he was on the last tile.

11
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,610
He would move to the next one soon.

12
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,820
How can you know that, huh?

13
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,949
That last guy could tell
the tempered glass apart the whole time,

14
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,493
but he watched all
those poor bastards out there die.

15
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,747
The only reason you and I even made it
is 'cause he could tell the tiles apart.

16
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,250
Come on! Just stop it with this bullshit.

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,460
That guy is not the reason
that I'm still here, okay?

18
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,421
I'll tell you the reason.

19
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,799
It's that I'm willing to do
almost anything to win this.

20
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,676
Stop with the excuses. I'm not buying it.

21
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,488
You still killed someone.
His bullet is in your hands.

22
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,638
Get it together, huh.

23
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,893
We'll be killing everyone
if we want that money.

24
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,228
Think about it for just one second.

25
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,888
You should be happy that there's someone
who's not afraid to get his hands dirty.

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,820
And if it were me on that tile?

27
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,698
Come on!

28
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,575
Gi-hun!

29
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,788
Your life is so damn pathetic,
and here's why.

30
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,501
It's because you always gotta open
your mouth and ask something idiotic.

31
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,339
Because you're a nosy-ass idiot
who's too slow to keep it shut.

32
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,801
Someone who always has to get into trouble
but somehow can't tell he's in it.

33
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,388
Okay.

34
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,267
That's right.
That's how I got caught in all this.

35
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,397
Because I was slow, crazy incompetent.

36
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,211
Just a dimwit who lives off his mother,
but you're with me in this place.

37
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,402
Isn't that interesting?

38
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,738
Why is that?

39
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,243
Ssangmun-dong's golden child,
the genius Cho Sang-woo,

40
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,619
who went to SNU was here?

41
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,038
Rolling around this shithole,

42
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,374
slamming with us, simpletons, huh!

43
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,127
Is it my fault that you're here?

44
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,811
Players, we sincerely
congratulate and commend you all

45
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,730
for successfully making it
through the first five games.

46
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,527
The three of you are now the finalists

47
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,364
and as such, we have prepared
a special gift for each of you.

48
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,158
Before we reveal the gift,

49
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,745
please take a moment to change
into the outfits we have brought.

50
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,291
Bring him to me alive.

51
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,907
JUNE 29, MONDAY

52
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,410
CHIEF

53
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,165
- <i>Jun-ho!</i>
- It's me, Chief.

54
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,310
- <i>Where the hell are you?</i>
- Can you hear me all right, sir?

55
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,230
- <i>I haven't seen or heard from you in days!</i>
- Just hold on, I'll explain it later.

56
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,107
- <i>Who the hell do you think you are?</i>
- Look, I'm somewhere southwest

57
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,215
- of the mainland.
<i>- What?</i>

58
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,591
Can you try to locate my signal?

59
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,236
- Put a whole team together for this.
<i>- What?</i>

60
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,886
<i>- A whole team?</i>
- I need backup.

61
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,514
You gotta get a whole squad.
The police, coast guard, everyone.

62
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,277
<i>What did you say?
I can't hear you!</i>

63
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,619
Let me send over a couple of things, okay,
and take a look.

64
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,287
<i>- Slow it down...</i>
- I'll call you again soon.

65
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,312
<i>What did you do...</i>

66
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,661
Tonight's feast
is prepared as a token of gratitude

67
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,622
for the sacrifice and effort
that you finalists have made,

68
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:05,253
and to encourage you all to perform
even more splendidly in the final game.

69
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,089
Now please relax and enjoy your feast.

70
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,795
RE-SEND

71
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,846
He's over there.

72
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,953
Ah.

73
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,964
Police. Put down your weapons,
you got that?

74
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,719
We already know everything about you all.

75
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,679
The coast guard will be here soon.

76
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,474
I don't know.

77
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,769
Have the Korean police
ever been quick to act?

78
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,524
And besides, you barely get
any signal around here.

79
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,026
I don't know what you tried to send,

80
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,320
but I doubt it went through.

81
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,740
Come and turn yourself in.
You'll get a plea bargain with that.

82
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,910
If you drop your gun right now
and hand over the phone,

83
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,162
I might let you live.

84
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,956
Stop right there.

85
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,585
That gun of yours holds five bullets.

86
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,964
But for police regulations,

87
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,176
one chamber must remain empty,
and one must be filled with a blank.

88
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,138
That leaves three live rounds.

89
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,765
You've already used one to kill a man

90
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,560
and another one to break the lock.

91
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,899
Which means that there's only
one bullet left in your gun.

92
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,663
One bullet is more than enough
to kill you.

93
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,703
<i>Give up.</i>

94
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,291
I warned you.

95
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,334
Take another step and...

96
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,930
This is over.

97
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,808
Now come with me.

98
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,398
Do as I say.

99
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,025
Or you die.

100
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,954
Who the hell...

101
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,747
are you?

102
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,810
In-ho.

103
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,855
Let's go.

104
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,818
Make this easy.

105
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,675
Brother...

106
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,762
In-ho, why?

107
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,360
Sae-byeok.

108
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,365
It's all right.

109
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,160
I didn't come here to kill you.

110
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,079
You've been dozing off.

111
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,998
I'd have killed you already
if I wanted to.

112
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,548
I have this with me
because of Sang-woo there.

113
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,552
Protection, you know.

114
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,872
You're not holding up too well, huh?

115
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,085
No, it's okay. I feel fine.

116
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,254
So how come you barely touched
your food earlier?

117
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,550
It wasn't very well cooked, that's all.

118
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,389
Stop lying, please.

119
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,768
And if I'm hurt?

120
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,396
Are you gonna try to treat it?

121
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,194
You need to think about yourself.

122
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,405
Just leave me. I'll be okay.

123
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,077
Hey, Kang Sae-byeok.

124
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,580
We should stick together.

125
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,874
We can beat him.

126
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,918
Whatever the game,

127
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,171
we'll help each other get through this
as teammates.

128
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,555
Show that psychopath what we can do.

129
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,107
Share all that prize money
and just run away.

130
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,662
And do you know what you're gonna do
with all that money once we get out?

131
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,039
I'd pay my debt off first.

132
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,796
And buy a nice clean store
in the city for my mom.

133
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,220
She always hoped to run a, a real store,
not just the kind of little stall.

134
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,764
And I would...

135
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,229
finally start being a dad to my girl...

136
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,277
for once in my life.

137
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,321
How old is your daughter?

138
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,198
She's ten.

139
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,619
That's also how old my little brother is.

140
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,499
And where is your brother staying now?

141
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,585
In orphanage.

142
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,342
I promised that
he'd get out of there soon.

143
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,304
Our mother is stuck in the North
right now.

144
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,852
I said I'd get her once I was able
to make enough money,

145
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,479
and I'll get us all a house.

146
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,234
There's so much in there. I think
even with half, you'll have plenty.

147
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,864
Hey, Gi-hun.

148
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,829
I think you and I should make a deal.

149
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,087
What kind of deal?

150
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,176
Just in case either of us...

151
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,597
can actually make it out
of this hellhole somehow,

152
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,559
we'll look after
each other's loved ones, okay?

153
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,148
Don't say that. Come on.

154
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,571
We'll beat Sang-woo,
and then, we'll get out of here together.

155
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,745
I still want you to swear, though.

156
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,713
I need you to swear
that you'll look after him.

157
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,341
Shh.

158
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,506
Don't do it.

159
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,844
That isn't you.

160
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,430
You're a good person at heart.

161

Hey.

162
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,703
Hey, what's wrong?

163
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,914
Hey, you're... you're...

You're...

165
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,709
What happened? When?

166
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,170
When did you get hurt?

167
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,712
Shit.

168
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,133

169
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,054
I think I wanna go.
I'd like to go home now.

170
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,850
Hey, hold on, Sae-byeok. Stay here.

171
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,187
Don't let yourself go.
Just keep on holding this.

172
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,189
I'll go get someone, okay?

173
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,239
Hey, hey! We need help.

174
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,824

182
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,383
Somebody out there, please, answer me!

183
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,267
Oh. Hey!

184
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,645
Could you please get a doctor?
She's lost a lot of blood.

185
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,355
Hurry! Please.

186
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,107
She's...

187
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:34,889
Sae-byeok.

188
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,147
Sae... Sae-byeok.

189
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,940
Sae-byeok.

190
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,692
No.

191
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,321
Oh, no. Oh, Sae-byeok.

192

Oh, no. Sae-byeok, no.
