[Gi-hun] Are you all right?

You're here.

Yeah.

59
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,425
I got scared.
I thought you were gone for good.

00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,972
Hey. I won't die so easily, you know.

62
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,807
- I know you won't.
- [Player 1 chuckles]

63
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,731
I stopped playing because of you,
and I'm back because of what you said.

00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,395
I'm actually sort of partial to you.

67
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,948
[Player 1] A lot of people
decided to come back.

68
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,577
[sighs]
You're right. Hmm.

69
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,996
- Yeah.
- I guess everybody's desperate.

70
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,956
- Oh.
- Huh?

71
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,877
There, look. That's the woman who couldn't
name her kid. She came back too.

72
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,961
[Player 1] You're right.

73
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,173
Think she named her kid yet?

74
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,674
I don't know.

75
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,758
[Sang-woo] Gi-hun.

76
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,176
Oh, Sang-woo.

77
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,224
So you're here.
I didn't think I'd see you.

78
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,643
[clicks tongue]

79
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,020
Neither did I.
[awkward chuckle]

80
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,397
And you?

81
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,192
Your mom, did you see her?

82
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,529
[Ali] Hey, good sirs.

83
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,447
[Gi-hun] Oh. Hey.

84
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,157
It's my angel.

85
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,159
I'm happy to see both of you.
I hope we make it.

86
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,452
[Gi-hun sighs]

87
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,871
Thanks for the bus fare, sir.
It meant so much to me.

88
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,540
What, you gave him the bus fare?

89
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,792
Because he said that
he'd walk Yeouido to Ansan.

90
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,461
[chuckles]
That's so heartwarming.

91
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,334
We're like a bunch of soldiers
at training camp, huh?

92
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,341
- [Gi-hun laughs]
- A training camp is what?

93
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,345
You know, it's like the army
shooting guns.

94
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh! Soldiers all training together?

95
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,139
Uh-huh.

96
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,891
Wait a minute.

97
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,854
Since we're on the subject now,
you should join me.

98
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,940
We should just form our own team,
don't you think?

99
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,193
You're right. Who knows what game
they'll have us play next.

100
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,530
It wouldn't hurt to be in a group
so we're ready for anything.

101
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,575
Hey, you should join up with us.

102
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,119
I mean, we already know he's crazy strong.

103
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,121
You saw it.

104
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,040
He lifted me up with one hand
like it was nothing at all.

105
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,461
You mean... that you... I can join you?

106
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,257
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, so then,
you'll be the new recruit.

107
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,634
He's the skilled corporal,
and that means I'm a sergeant.

108
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,554
Oh, man. Thank you, sir.
[chuckles]

109
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,117
- Please just drop the "sir," will you?
- [Player 1] Excuse me.

110
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:04,854
If you don't mind,
can I join up with all of you?

111
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,063
Yeah, of course.

112
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,733
And you can be the... Hold on...

113
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,069
So you can be the old major
who's been in the army his entire life.

114
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,904
- Thanks so much.
- [both laugh]

115
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,659
Yeah. Quite a team we got going here.
Damn! Let's do this.

116
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,411
[chuckles]

117
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,247
I'll take you in again
and look past everything.

118
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,207
Come and join us.

119
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,086
We were a good team
for a while out there, huh?

120
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,921
Are you actually serious?

121
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,592
I mean, everybody out there
is still looking for you.

122
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,135
Stop with the act.

123
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,596
It doesn't matter how tough you are,

124
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,432
you're not going to win in this place.
Not on your own.

125
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,727
Didn't you notice?
[chuckles]

126
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,687
Those jerks with masks came in

127
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,491
and removed the beds
of the people who died.

128
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,400
Make one mistake out there,
and yours is next.

129
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,484
[chuckles]

130
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,904
Worry about your own ass, okay?

131
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,656
[men laugh]

132
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,824
- [Deok-su sighs]
- [Player 67] Don't join him.

133
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,035
This guy's a dumb dumbass.

134
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,371
He liked to pick
all of his little minions' pockets

135
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,458
just so he could fill up his own.

136
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,087
He got bold enough one day
to go after his head honcho's pockets,

137
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
but now he's in here.

138
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,256
'Cause he was stupid and got caught.

139
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,843
You know what people in my hometown
would call you, huh?

140
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,848
A damn revolutionary asshole.

141
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,933
[men laugh]

142
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,185
You communist little bitch, I'm gonna...

143
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,771
[grunts]
Excuse me.

144
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,773
Am I interrupting you?

145
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,483
Sorry.

146
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,776
What is it?

147
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,859
Oh, boy.

148
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,862
You're really good looking.

149
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,739
[chuckles]

150
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,823
[scoffs]

151
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,451
Come on, let me join you guys.

152
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,535
Join what?

153
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,704
I'll be your teammate.

154
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,540
[men chuckle]

155
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,084
Tell me what you're good at?

156
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,253
Everything, except the things I can't do.

157
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,298
And I'm certainly better
than some skinny girl.

158
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,801
- A lot better.
- [men exclaim]

159
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,428
You mean, you're that good?

160
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,974
How about it?

161
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,017
Plenty of empty beds.

This brings back old memories.

185
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,391
Do you remember eating lunches
like this too?

186
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,475
Of course.

187
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,563
My wife was always in the kitchen
every morning.

188
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,276
She'd pack lunches just like these ones
for me and my kids.

[chuckles]

I wish the rice was piping hot.

191
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,116
At least they could've
warmed it up a little.

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,244
[grumbles]
All we need is a stove.

Remember doing that?

194
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,333
The little briquette stove we had
in our elementary school classroom.

195
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,793
We'd stick our lunch boxes on it.

196
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,087
It'd get burning hot on us too,

197
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,838
and the rice'd get all scorched. Hmm?

198

Gi-hun.

199
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,926
Hmm?

200
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,928
Let's try to stay on the subject.

201
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,138
How about putting your mind
to what the game could be?

202
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,766
[Player 1] Mm.

203
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,849
Hey.

204
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,103
No one can figure that out.

205
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,146
We'll find out when it's time.

206
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,651
You know, considering the last one
that we did,

207
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:25,990
I think that there'll be another old game
kids played, just like I used to.

208
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,616
I'll bet you right there.

209
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,217
Think of all the ones they could choose.

210
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,996

and Tag, <i>Don Katsu,</i> Freeze Tag.

213
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,005
And for girls, there's <i>Gonggi</i>, Elastics,
Cat's Cradle and...

214
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,799
And what else?

215
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,510
I don't know how to play those.

216
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,597
You don't know any of the games I listed?

217
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,433
Hey, listen to me.

218
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,643
All those games are easy to learn.

219
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,437
And we'll teach them to you.

Huh?

488
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,005

Not yet.

What do you think it could be?

494
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,032
Should we play this together?

495
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,119
That could be dangerous.

496
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,914
At this point, we don't know anything.

497
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,517
I think it would put us at a disadvantage
if we just choose one.

498
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,668
You think?

499
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,336
There's this saying in investing.

500
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,505
"Try not to keep your eggs
in the same basket."

Listen to him.

503
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,511
He was first in his class
in SNU Business School.

504
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,222
And in my hometown,
he was a genius. A prodigy.

505
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,599
Really? Is that so?

506
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,768
Well then, he is an incredible guy, huh?

507
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,331
- Are you kidding me?
- [both chuckle]

508

00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,610
[Gi-hun] Who should go where?

What about you?

513

515
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,751
- A circle, you mean?
- Yeah.

516
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,140
It looks just like the moon
where I'm from.

[Gi-hun sighs, clicks tongue]

00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,598
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

522
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,064
- Uh, then I'm choosing the umbrella.
- [Sang-woo] Hmm?

523
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,648
You sure?

524
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,150
Why?

525
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,447
Oh, growing up, I'd always lose
my umbrella so my mom would get angry.

526
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,824
So then, she gave me broken ones
to bring to school.

527
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,036
I always wanted her to get me
one of those good umbrellas

528
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,121
- like the other kids.
- Mm-hm.

529
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,875
Um, don't want the star?
Or do you wanna switch with me?

530
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,462
Oh, no, the star sounds great.
[clears throat]

Good with me.

Besides, nobody really sees
many stars these days.

Great, let's get moving.

534

Once we know what we're up against,
let's set up a strategy together.

[Player 1] Sure.
