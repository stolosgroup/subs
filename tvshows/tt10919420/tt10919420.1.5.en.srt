Get yourselves together and listen!

5
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,063
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,983
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,026
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,570
There's no way I'll do that!

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,988
We might as well try!

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,823
[Mi-nyeo] No way! I can't do it!

11
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,575
Move up or you'll die!

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,201

[woman] Hey, dude.

46
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,259
Who you think you're praying to, huh?

47
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,594
To God?

[mumbling prayers]

49

[sighs]

51
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:13,109
The reason you're still breathing
and thanking that nice God of yours...

52
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,320
is that old man there.

53
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,783
And that guy over there who came up
with that awesome last-minute trick.

54
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,243
[man continues praying]

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,579
You know if there's anybody
that you should be thanking

56
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,040
it's them, not God.

57
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,628
You sad lost soul.

58
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,148
What would you say about everybody
who was nailed to the cross

59
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,465
for our salvation today?

60
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,469
They sacrificed themselves for us.
We are here, thanks to their blood.

61
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,931
I pray to the Lord
on behalf of all us sinners.

62
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,641
I gave thanks for their sacrifice.

63
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,851
God made a decision to help our team win.

64
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,478
That's why we're all here.

65
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,604
Bullshit.

66
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,649

Oh!

69
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,489
If we say some prayers,
do we all get to go to heaven?

70
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,367
I should really pray too
if that's how easy it is.

71
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,619
Our God who art in Heaven,

72
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,996
we worked as a team
to send people to your side.

73
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,915
And we sent a bunch of them today.

74
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,918
And please help us
with a whole lot more to be with you.

75
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,201
- And I hope that from now on...

00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,761
Or you mean that guy?

79
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,096
Everyone.

What's your name, huh?

83
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,121
Why do you care about that?

84
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,498
So I can use your name, duh!

85
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,666
It doesn't matter.

86
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,835
[chuckles]
So secretive.

87
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,587
Listen, okay.

88
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,715
Just leave me alone.

89
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,343
Well, you're the one
who asked me to join you guys.

90
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,311
[Player 278] Did you see that bald guy
wet his pants like a little baby?

91
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,397
[laughs]
Kids just keep blaming him how...

[masked man 1] He's not breathing.
Go get that doctor.

105
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,384
You know what? I really thought
we were going to die out there.

106
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,804
And then, as soon as we're all
leaning back, I felt so powerful.

107
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,389
Like, "Whoa! It works. Is this real?"

108
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,349
Hey, old man, how do you know that?

109
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,433
[chuckles]

110
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,395
- As a kid, I would always...
- Oh, you copied that one thing.

111
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,772
From that movie. What's it called?

112
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,524
The guy who dodges bullets like this.

113
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,607
- Right?
<i>- Matrix.</i>

Hmm.

Hey, when you got to Korea,
is all you did watch movies?

116
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,703
And our man...

117

"Everybody, three steps up when I signal."
[gasps]

118
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,293
Oh. My God, I can't believe
how cool that was.

119
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,628
How did you come up with it
under all that pressure?

120
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,255
Earlier, you were the one who said no.

121
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,508
Yeah?
[scoffs]

122
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,260
Was that what you heard?

123
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,553
[Ali] You cried and said,

124
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,931
"But that's the edge.
There's no way I'll go."

125
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,015
Like that.

126
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,686
Hey, you. You got a visa? I bet you don't.

127
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,605
You're an illegal alien.

[sighs]
Hey, boys, how about it?

129
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,109
Why keep the strange foreigner
when we could just ditch him?

130
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,487
Our team's more secure that way, huh?

131
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,740
Guess I'd better do some major
restructuring while I'm here.

132
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,492
Who's captain here, guys?

133
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,079
Mr. Brains, you've been captain, right?

134
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,708
There's no captain. We're all equal here.

135
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,877
Ah! That's great.

136
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,713
Building an egalitarian society!

137
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,174
Damn, guys.

138
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,551
I gotta say this is quite a change
from that huge asshole

139
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,179
who just bosses you around
and pretend he's king.

140
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,389
Oh, about that, grandma,
why did you get kicked out?

141
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,935
Grandma?

142
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,270
Don't you ever call me that!

143
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,024
Here, Han Mi-nyeo.

144
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,318
Got it? Mi-nyeo. That's my name.

145
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,738
And I didn't get kicked out.

146
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,740
I made the decision to go, all right?

147
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,327
Those crazy thugs there?
You can't lock me in with that crew.

148
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,850
[Sang-woo] They only got rid of you,

149
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,997
then they only wound up with male players.

150
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,707
Right before the game at that.

151
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,794
You know, it's almost like
they knew about it ahead of time.

<i>Please return to your assigned beds
and prepare for lights-out.</i>

156
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,952
[Sang-woo] Another fight
could break out like last night.

157
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,102
We should make a plan.

158
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,895
What can we do, huh?

159
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,855
We've got three girls and old man and us.

160
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,607
Our team is the weakest one in here.

161
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,503
We should choose a weak team
and go after them first.

162
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,527
[scoffs]

163
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,240
For a resident priest,
you sure are bloodthirsty.

164
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,992
I mean, everybody's hands are bloody.

We're all sinners,
but we're still here, aren't we?

166
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,750
Attacking is our best option.
So I think that's our plan.

167
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,627
During the fight last night,

168
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,256
the man in the bed
in front of me got killed.

169
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,248
And the person he thought
was on his side broke his neck.

170
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,263
Do you trust me then?

171
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,183
I don't trust one person here.

172
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,480
All right.

173
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,983
I think let's still do something.

174
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,776
Before the lights go out,

175
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,361
let's create a barricade.

176
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,406
It might be good to make sure
that we have cover.

177
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,699

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,110
Nice.

186
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,295
But do you think these will do anything?

187
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,533

We can get through all of this easily.

You're not worried at all?

Those scumbags you got
on your side over there?

191

once the fighting starts to happen,

197
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,186
you'll be the first person I'd go for.

198
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,358
You're the strongest person here.

So who's our first target, huh?

205
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,297
Let's take the night off.

206
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,049
How come?

207
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,765

Sure.

210
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,350
Hey.

211
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,687
Cut that out. We all need to rest tonight.

[Gi-hun] They'll shut off the lights soon.

00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,618
They might not all come right away.

226
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,787
So we better swap out who's gonna
keep watch, just to be safe, I think.

227
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,955
No, two of us should watch.

228
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,250
A pair can keep each other awake.

229
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,337
Just one person might go leave
and betray our team.

be first watch then.

You don't really sleep a lot
when you're old.

Excuse me, but are we just
supposed to trust

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,601
an old man like you
to not sleep on the job all night?

236
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,356
[inhales]
Let me go first.

237
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,277
I'm not tired yet.

238
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,279
I'll go with you.

Then I'll be next.

240

You wake me up the second you get tired.

241
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,913
Then why don't I join you on second watch?

242
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,332
Assuming that's okay with you.

I saved this earlier
when they gave it to us for supper.

256
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,431
So I could give it to you.

Give it to me. What'd I do?

We couldn't make the delivery last night.

00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,689
I'm just barely escaping death
every damn day.

330
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,775
[dark music]

331
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,663
[Number 28] That's why we tell you
what the games are beforehand

332
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,623
and gave that extra food.

333
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,875
[exhales sharply]

334
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,922
[dark music]

[gasps, coughs]

337
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:47,978
Gi-hun.

338
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,146
Huh? Sang-woo.

339
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,523
- You ready to switch?
- Ah...

340
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,026
Okay.

341
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,945
[Gi-hun grunts, panting]

342
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,532
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

343
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,410
Looked like you were having
a nightmare just now.

344
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,288
Oh, no, no. It's all good.

345
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,373
[Deok-su] Hey.

346
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,960
What are you doing up?

347
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,924
I can't keep my eyes shut.
[sighs]

348
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,010
Well, you should really try
to get some rest.

349
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,137
I'll keep everybody safe tonight.

350
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,683
- Glad you got our backs tonight, kid.
- [man chuckles]

351
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,104
Heard from the doctor yet?

352
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,524
[man] No. This is weird.
He's taking too long.

353
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,822
[doctor] Hold this.

354
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,621
[masked man 1] We're in a hurry.
Maybe I should try working on those?

355
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:51,083
I bet I could do it
if you teach me a few tricks.

356
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,627
Yeah. You think all of this
is so simple, huh.

357
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,051
[masked man 2] I saw on the news
doctors don't always perform surgeries.

358
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,424
Sometimes it's the office managers
or nurse's aides.

359
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,384
[cackles]

360
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,678
And some of them are better
than the doctors are.

361
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,888
You think you know so much?
Then how about you try?

362
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,771
[masked man 2] Who would have thought
a quack who killed his own patient

363
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,811
would still be so proud about his work?

364
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,606
If you were so good, how come you ruined
the eyes you pulled out last time?

365
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,775
Those Chinese guys busted my ass!

366
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,402
Listen, I'll tell you what went wrong.

367
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,004
That thing was still alive
when I got here.

368
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,698
How'd you expect me to operate
with all of that struggling?

369
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,533
[Number 28] We don't have time for this.

370
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,326
The boat will be here soon.

371
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,911
[inhales, exhales]

372
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,997
[tense music]

373
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,878
[fireworks crackling]

374
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,095
- [tense music]
- [man yelps]

375
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,642
[men clamoring]

376
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,568
[dark music]

377
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,205
[faint screaming]

378
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,752
- Gi-hun.
- [gasps]

379
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,754
[grunts]

380
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,428
[faint screaming]

381
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,694
- [Player 1] Hey.
- [faint screaming stops]

382
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,144
[Player 1 breathing heavily]

383
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,230
So, uh, what's going on? Are you okay?

384
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,777
I thought you were sleeping
with your eyes open.

385
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,987
[sighs]
Um...

386
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,740
Thinking of the old days.

387
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,283
The old days, huh?

388
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,163
I worked at this place once
where we went on strike.

389
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,334
Had a barricade just like this one.

390
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,504
What did you do
when you were working there?

391
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,672
I used to make parts for cars.

392
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,133
Hmm. Ah.

393
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,094
Why did you strike?

394
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,347
They fired a bunch of us all at once.

395
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,307
[inhales deeply, sighs]

396
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,476
I've been employed there
more than a decade.

397
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,314
I bet it wasn't easy.

398
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,736
- [Player 1 sighs]
- [Gi-hun exhales deeply]

399
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,488
I had a kid on the way too.

400
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,699
I couldn't afford to get fired like that.

401
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,826
[deep inhale]

402
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,788
Our bosses said we couldn't stay.
I had no other option.

403
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,501
[Gi-hun] They ruined the company
and held us responsible.

404
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,504
[sighs]
It made me furious.

405
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,508
And everyone same as now...
[inhales]

406
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,845
...all kept watching in pairs until morning.

407
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,930
That way, no one could kick us all out.

408
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,974
[Player 1 sighs]

409
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,852
And we were all so scared.

410
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,021
Police might come any second.

411
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,108
I remember. I heard about it back then.

412
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:08,155
There was a huge strike.
Some car company. That's right.

413
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,827
I think the news turned it
into this crazy story.

414
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,956
[Player 1] That was it.
Someone died there too, right?

415
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,625
Mmm.
[Player 1 sighs]

416
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,586
I'm sorry.

417
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,838
My goodness.

418
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,631
I don't know...

419
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,092
why I said all of that.

420
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,760
[Player 1] Mmm.

421
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,388
[somber music]

422
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,473
[grunts]
Oh.

423
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,726
[groans]

424
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,895
[Player 1 grunts]

425
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,439
[groans]

426
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,191
Do you need help, sir?

427
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,194
- [Player 1 moans]
- What's going on?

428
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,779
- [grunts]
- Oh.

429
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,116
- You're burning up.
- No, no, it's fine. I'm fine.

430
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,577
[masked man 1]
I nearly pissed myself that night.

431
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,997
I thought the thing was dead,
but then it shot up like a zombie.

432
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,750
It started glaring at me
with one of its eyes popping out.

433
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,711
[sighs]
I saw it in my dream last night.

434
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,588
[masked man 2] Everyone who got eliminated

435
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,216
in Red Light, Green Light
was shot by a sniper rifle.

436
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,967
We could hardly salvage anything.

437
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,180
That zombie looked promising.
At least before we saw inside.

438
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,391
[Number 28] I almost died
making the delivery that day.

439
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,645
But we didn't even get full price
because it only had one kidney.

440
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,064
It's my fault the zombie
was missing a kidney?

441
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,483
[Number 28] Hopefully,
this guy is all right.

442
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,196
Most people who came here either signed
away their bodies or are terminally ill.

443
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,073
This one better be worth it.

444
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,454
- [Gi-hun] Here. Lie down.
- [groaning]

445
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,456
[Gi-hun] Wait right here.

446
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,751
Okay. We need to lower your fever.
Hold on.

447
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,503
- [grunts]
- [cloth tearing]

448
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,298
Ah, shit.

449
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,716
[Sae-byeok] Here. Use this.

450
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,263
[panting]

451
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,804
[Jun-ho] <i>So what happened...</i>

452
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,355
to that zombie?

453
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,441
[Number 28]
What do you think happened to it?

454
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,445
We were in a hurry,
so I beat it to death with that.

455
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,660
[masked man 1] Hold on.
Why do you need to ask?

456
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,161
You were there for the whole thing.

457
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,413
[masked man 2] What the hell?

458
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,163
Don't you remember?

459
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,128
[Jun-ho] Back then...

460
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,381
I was a bit out of it.

461
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,966
[masked man 2] You were out of it?

462
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,220
You got rid of the body
with your own hands.

463
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,098
Number 29.

464
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,144
- You haven't been...
- [doctor] This is my operating room, okay?

465
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,857
Stop chatting and do what I say,
so I can actually do some work!

466
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,652
Just let me work in peace, okay?
[pants]

467
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,862
If you don't shut up,

468
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,665
I'll cut right through his liver
and kidneys just like this! Damn it!

469
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,534
[doctor huffing]

470
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,458
[Player 1 breathing heavily]

471
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,254
Thank you, friend.

472
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,673
[sighs]

473
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,717
[clicks tongue]

474
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,552
Just you rest now.

475
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,597
After all, we can't...

476
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,308
start the next game without you.

477
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,561
[Gi-hun exhales]

478
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,192
[Gi-hun sighs]

479
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,070
You should go and rest.

480
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,739
I can handle this alone.
[groans]

481
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,283
We agreed to do pairs.

482
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,994
And I'm already awake now.

483
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,166
Thanks so much.

484
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,296
For this.

485
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,550
[Sae-byeok] It wasn't for free.

486
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,553
You can pay me back tomorrow.

487
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,433

- [plastic rustles]
- [zips]

491
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,239
[masked man 1] Hurry up.

492
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,522
[masked man 2]
They're all in great condition this time.

493
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,034
Make sure you get full price.

494
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,871
[tense music]

495
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,088
[Number 28] Pick up the pace.
The boat's already here.

496
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,095
[tense music continues]

497
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,314
[doctor] All right, I'm done.

498
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,774
What game is up next?

499
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,317
[masked man 1] We don't know yet.

500
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,278
What'd you say?

501
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,155
Bullshit.

502
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,238
[masked man 1]
We haven't been told what it is yet.

503
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,867
You better go and ask your boss.

504
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,411
There must be somebody up there
you can go ask.

505
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,639
[masked man 2] If he knew,
he would've told us already.

506
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,499
- I'm sure there's a reason.
- It sounds like that's on you.

507
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,502
I did everything you said to.

508
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,796
Go tell them to find out this second!

509
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,381
[masked man 2] Go back and wait!

510
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,258
I'll tell you before the next game begins.

511
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,261
This is a bunch of bullshit!

512
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,099
[eerie music]

513
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,782
[Number 28] What are you doing?

514
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,865
Pull.

515
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:53,249

[tense music]

522
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,304
- [masked man 1] Calm down.
- Tell me what the game is,

523
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,413
or else I'm gonna end up
getting killed tonight!

524
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,750
This isn't the way to handle things.
Give us more time.

525
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,002
I'm not giving you
any more time, assholes!

526
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,065
- [masked man 1] Then what do you suggest?
- Check what's next and come back.

527
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,382
[masked man 2 grunts]

528
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,633
[doctor] And you...

529
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,094
you'll be staying right here
until he returns, okay?

530
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,513
[masked man 1]
It'll be more dangerous if we stay here.

531
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,473
We have to get back
before morning roll call!

532
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,725
I don't care about any of that shit!

533
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,688
No, I'm not going anywhere
until I know what it is.

534
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,482
[masked man 2] Fine, okay. Calm down.

535
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,944
Go up and find out what the game is.

536
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,446
[masked man 1] Okay.

537
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,907
[doctor breathing heavily]

538
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,035
[masked man 2] Wait!

539
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,122
You have to take the key.

540
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,458
The key to upstairs
is in my right side pocket.

541
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,253
Don't try to pull something.

542
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,546
[masked man 2] I'm not.

543
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,048
He needs it to get into the control room.

544
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,843
If you don't trust me,
you can throw it to him yourself.

[Number 28] Don't touch it.

553
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:13,848
It's a bomb. They made this passage
so the VIPs could escape in an emergency.

554
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,475
And once they're all out,

555
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,936
they set that off
and blow the entire place.

556
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,022
[Jun-ho] The VIPs? Who are they?

557
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,524
[Number 28] That's as much as I know.

[light switch clanks]

00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,172
[Number 28] Number 29.

00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,278

[Number 28] Why do you wanna know
who the VIPs are?

575
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,192
[Jun-ho] I was just grateful

576
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,821
for our diving equipment and this passage.

577
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,365
They prepared it all for us.

578
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,743
[Number 28] Not only are you more curious,

579
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,661
but your voice seems to have changed.

580
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,246
Let me see your face.

581
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,042
[Jun-ho] Do you have to do this?

582
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,713
[Number 28] Do you wanna die?

583
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,852
- Who are you?
- [gun cocks]

584
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,530
- [knife clanks]
- Now show me yours.

585
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,825
Do you wanna die?

00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,388
Stay away!

[huffing]

591
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,309
[masked man 1] Calm down.
We can still fix this.

592
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,644
How will you do that?

593
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,188
Using that gun?

594
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,606
[masked man 1] Think about it.

595
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,358
Why would I kill you anyway?

596
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,276
That'll only complicate things.

597
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,070
It's complicated already.

598
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,239
I had to kill your friend.

599
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,782
[masked man 1] He wasn't a friend.

600
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:22,161
Look, listen.
I can throw bodies in the incinerator.

601
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,539
The guy you killed, I'll just cremate him.

602
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,708
It's a huge problem
when a player goes missing,

603
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,586
but when it's soldier,
no one cares about that.

604
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,296
[heavy breathing]

605
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,257
[Jun-ho] Who I am

606
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,468
doesn't matter right now, you got that?

607
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,310
Now, what matters is the identity
of the man that you murdered here.

608
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,647
The one you've been calling a zombie.

609
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,526
With the one kidney, the one you put
on the table who woke up.

610
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,696
You know where that other kidney went?

611
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,739
In here.

612
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,867
It's in here.

613
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,371
- He was my brother.
- [trembling breath]

614
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,874
- He gave me that kidney.
- No, no, wait!

615
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,501
[shaky breathing]

616
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,961
It was a girl.

617
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,254
Not a man.

618
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,630
I'm not lying.

619
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,714
[masked man 1]
I'll find out what the next game is.

620
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,468
If you make a bigger scene and get caught,

621
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,637
we'll both die for nothing.

622
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,930
Trust me.

623
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,725
We still have a chance.

624
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,186
How can I trust someone like you, scumbag?

625
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,980
[doctor panting]

626

[exhales]

627
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,704
[masked man 1] Look.

628
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,540
Now you see, we're all the same here.

629
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,336
[doctor panting]

630
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,054
All right.

631
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,641
You just need to go back quietly.

632
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,685
If you go back before your bedtime is up...

633
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,730
you and I can live through this.

634
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,652
[metal thuds]

635
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,820
[doctor breathing heavily]

636
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,572
[doctor] Then what do I have to do?

637
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,370
Listen, doctor.

638
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,378
Let's get you washed up
before anything else.

639
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,506
- [gunshot]
- [man yelps]

640
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,260
I'm not lying!

641
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,762
It was a girl.

642
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,514
It sounds like bullshit.

643
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,183
Before we operated on her,

644
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,561
we took turns having sex
with the girl, okay?

645
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,981
Would we have done that to a guy?

646
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,192
Go check the list,
if you still don't trust me.

647
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,987
- What list?
- There's a list of all the players

648
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,697
with all their info as well.

649

the room the leader is in.

653
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,791
Leader?

654
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,209
[Number 28] You've seen him.

655
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,378
His mask isn't the same.

[chuckles]

658
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:30,391
And so, you and I
will find your brother, okay?

659
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,353
And I'll give you all the money I got
selling organs!

660
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,485
- Once we're a team, we'll be, uh...

[Front Man] Whether you sell
the dead bodies' organs

665
00:38:56,792 --> 00:39:00,212
or eat them or whatever,
I don't give a damn.

666
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,550
However, you ruined the most important
aspect of this place.

667

[man breathing shakily]

668

Equality.

669
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,143
Everyone is equal
while they play this game.

670
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,356
Here, every player gets to play
a fair game under the same conditions.

671
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,693
These people suffered from inequality
and discrimination out in the world,

672
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,906
and we're giving them one last chance
to fight fair and win.

673
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,785
But you broke that principle.

[Front Man] There's one more.

696
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,580
The one who killed this one.

697
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,409
[masked man 3]
He could've escaped to the sea already.

698
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,338
[Front Man] No oxygen tanks are missing.

699

He's still here somewhere.

700
