2
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,617
Thank you.

3
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>- Gi-hun, wait.</i>
- Huh?

4
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,717
Nothing.

5
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,929
You saved me.

6
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,013
What?

7
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,768
You're the reason
I got through this round.

8
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,287
- Sirs, you made it!
- Oh.

9
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,253
I'm glad you made it.

10
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,797
I was really worried.

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,175
It will take a whole lot more
killing Gi-hun. Hah!

12
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,594
I got Ssangmun-dong running
through this heart, huh?

13
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,972
Are you holding up all right here, mister?

14
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,474
I'm okay. Yes.

15
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,435
All thanks to your sharp thinking.

16
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,813
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,856
I was wrong to suggest separating.

18
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,610
Ah, don't say that.

19
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,238
How could you know what it was?

20
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,198
Choosing the umbrella was my call.

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,951
- Don't worry, okay?
- Mm.

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,203
Yeah, the whole team made it.

23
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>Attention, players.</i>

24
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,668
<i>I will now announce
the results of the second game.</i>

25
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,591
<i>Out of the 187 players who participated,</i>

26
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,011
<i>79 players were eliminated.</i>

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:40,368
<i>The prize money accumulated this round
is 7.9 billion won.</i>

28
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:46,833
<i>The total prize money accumulated so far
is now 34.8 billion won.</i>

EPISODE 4
STICK TO THE TEAM

30
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,220
<i>Attention.
Your mealtime begins now.</i>

31
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,224
<i>All players, please form a line
in the center of the room.</i>

32
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,491
This is all we get?

33
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,958
Asshole.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,295
I came just close to dying.

35
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,924
And what do I get for all of that?
An egg for a meal.

36
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,562
Are they kidding us with this shit?

37
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,485
Hey. Sorry, I'm coming through.

38
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,986
Coming through.

39
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,488
Excuse me. Thank you.

40
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,782
Excuse me.

41
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,160
Hey, miss, what are you doing, huh?

42
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,583
Shut your mouth and grab an egg.

43
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,482
Uh, I didn't get anything.

44
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,692
Where's the rest?

45
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,403
Hey, we didn't get our meals either.

46
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,488
One, two, three, four, five.

47
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,948
Five meals are missing, sir.

48
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,593
We prepared food
for the exact number of players.

49
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,868
Then where is ours?

50
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,745
Please, sir, we need to eat!

51
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,790
- It was prepared for the exact number.
- Excuse me.

52
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,835
It was them. They...

53
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,090
skip the line and got seconds. I saw it.

54
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,179
Hey, what's the matter, everybody? Jeez.

55
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,473
You never see a guy eat before,
is that it?

56
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,434
Shit.

57
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,873
Who do you think you are?

58
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,565
That's my food you just ate.

59
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,943
Ah. So, uh, is this yours?

60
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,862
Is your name on it?

61
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,323
'Cause I sure don't see anything.

62
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,161
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,746
Give me that.

64
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,040
Give it back. It's mine.

65
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,333
Give it back to me!

66
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,048
You little shit, goddamn it.

67
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,717
Why did you break it, you jerk?
How was this, huh?

68
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,597
How come a scrawny guy like you
is so greedy about food?

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,015
You piece of shit!

70
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,770
Hey, listen up. You should learn to share.

71
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,147
Is it too hard, you dumbass?

72
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,234
You bastard!
What the hell? You shithead.

73
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,112
Shit.

74
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,547
Hey, you okay? Hey, wake up.

75
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,141
He's gone.

76
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,486
Uh, hello, guards.

77
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,781
Can someone do something?

78
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,286
Hey, didn't you hear that?

79
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,665
A person died.

80
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,959
That man there just died.

81
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,047
Look, that man was killed.

82
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,842
That bastard...
That bastard just killed him.

83
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,097
He just killed someone over there!

84
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,559
He just died!

85
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,978
Can't you hear me, huh?

86
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,148
<i>Help us now!</i>

87
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>A man just died!</i>

88
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,444
<i>We shouldn't be
killing each other like this!</i>

89
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,616
<i>Player 271, eliminated.</i>

90
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,773
You there.

91
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,983
Why aren't you doing your job?

92
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,323
I'm sorry, sir.

93
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,076
How may I be of service?

94
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,064
Did you forget the rules?

95
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,167
You do not speak
unless your superior allows you to.

96
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,130
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

97
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,632
<i>- Lights-out in 30 minutes.</i>
- Hurry! It'll be bedtime soon.

98
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,658
<i>Please return to the quarters now.</i>

99
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,747
We can't fall asleep tonight, okay?

100
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,125
Who knows what someone else may try.

101
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,297
Look at them. It looks like
they're planning something.

102
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,049
If they try to attack someone,

103
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,094
let's group together and fight them.

104
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,180
Come to our side if anything goes wrong.

105
00:09:59,098 --> 00:09:59,974
Okay, I will.

106
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,978
Sir, wake up.

107
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,858
Wake up, sir.

108
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,113
Sorry, but you really can't go to sleep
after lights-out, understand?

109
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,740
Why?

110
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,868
We gotta keep an eye out.
It will be dangerous.

111
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,120
And we'll come here if anything goes down.

112
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,331
Uh. Okay.

113
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,675
Hey, pickpocket.

114
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,596
Are you okay?

115
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,516
It looked like you and that thug
really had it out for each other.

116
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,019
So what?

117
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,106
Tonight, if anything happens,
we'll all meet in my bed right there.

118
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,484
Are you in?

119
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,199
I don't trust people.

120
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,203
And that's twice as true for anyone
who'd end up in here. Got it?

121
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,038
You think that's how it works, huh?

122
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,210
Listen, you don't trust people here
because you can.

123
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,630
You do it because
you don't have anybody else.

124
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,598
Where is the delivery team?

125
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,823
Number 28,
why are you alone?

126
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,845
Number 29 didn't show up.

127
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,886
- Was there an accident?
- I don't know.

128
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,037
Then you'll need to deliver this alone.

129
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,332
I can't go underwater
by myself. It's too dangerous.

130
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,834
Enough! Tell me now.

131
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,961
The next game, what is it?

132
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,472
Are you sure?

133
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,852
If I get eliminated,
then I can't do all of this.

134
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,354
Worry about that
after you survive the night.

135
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,564
What's tonight?

136
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,166
Fighting will break out.

137
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,195
We gave you less food on purpose
to make you all fight each other.

138
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,490
Weeding out the weaklings
before the next game begins.

139
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,783
It's all part of the game.

140
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,467
You know we can't
protect you when you're in there.

141
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,622
Go back to the players
and find a way to live.

142
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,416
Way to live?

143
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,099
Stick with the strongest.

144
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,086
That's the only way you'll live.

145
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,409
You're a strong team.

146
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,553
Let me join.

147
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,805
Why should we?

148
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,310
Tell us, what are you good at?

149
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,561
I'm a doctor out there.

150
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,563
You might need me.

151
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,647
So?

152
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,193
You're gonna come give me a shot
if I get sick?

153
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,742
Go sit somewhere in the corner,
come lights-out.

154
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,786
Don't breathe or make a noise.

155
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,121
If I hear you breathe...

156
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,417
then I'll come for you.

157
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,634
I know what the next game is.

158
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,323
<i>Players,
lights-out in two minutes.</i>

159
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,562
<i>Attention, staff.
The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

160
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>Will all managers, soldiers and workers,</i>

161
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,317
<i>please make your way
to your designated locations.</i>

162
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,571
<i>Let me repeat the instruction.</i>

163
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,366
<i>Will all managers, soldiers and workers,</i>

164
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,369

168
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,203
You saw us, huh?

169
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,544
Do it.

170
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,868
Ah!

171
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,043
You asshole!

172
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,648
- Gi-hun, are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks, Sang-woo.

173
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,584
Where's the old man?

174
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,961
- I'm not sure.
- Gi-hun.

175
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,438
- He's not here.
- Oh, no.

176
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,359
Hey, old man! Are you there?

177
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,860
Old man!

178
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,049
Let me out!

179
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,575
You're here.

180
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,784
Like you said.

181
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,724
Hey, Ssangmun-dong, what are you doing?

182
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,311
We're just helping cull the herd.

183
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,813
She's our teammate, you got that?

184
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,108
Teammate?

185
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,196
All of you, stop this.

186
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,366
I'm... I... I'm scared.

187
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,871
We are all gonna die in here!

188
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,752
Everyone, every single one of us
is going to die!

189
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,339
<i>Please. I'm so scared.</i>

190
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,926
<i>Stop this madness!</i>

191
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,237
- End it.
<i>- If you keep this going,</i>

192
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,639
<i>then we're all going to die in here!</i>

193
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,216
Drop your weapon.

194
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,434
Turn around.

195
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,496
<i>Player 277, eliminated.
Player 74, eliminated.</i>

196
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,307
<i>Player 198, eliminated.</i>

<i>Player 87, eliminated.</i>

<i>- Player 301, eliminated.</i>

200
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,800
<i>- Player 416, eliminated.</i>
- We don't use our names in this place.

201
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,094
<i>Player 361, eliminated.</i>

202

<i>Player 328, eliminated.</i>

<i>Player 239, eliminated.</i>

209
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,970
Are you all right?

210
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,264
Huh?

211
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,642
All of the... That was dangerous.
When did you get up there?

212
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,645
We were worried about you, sir,
when you disappeared.

213
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,856
Nobody here got hurt so that's good.

214
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,572
Uh, well, at this point,
we should know what to call each other.

215
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,533
Why don't we go around
and tell each other our names now.

216
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,494
I know your name already, though.

217
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,453
Ssangmun-dong.

218
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,874
Ssangmun-dong is just my hometown.

219
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,043
The name is Seong Gi-hun.

220
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,878
Seong Gi-hun of Ssangmun-dong.

221
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,507
So then, what about your name?

222
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,091
Ali.

223
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,094
Ali Abdul.

224
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,720
And where are you from?

225
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,013
Pakistan.

226
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,098
Pakistan?

227
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,974
Where is that?

228
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,142
North of India.

229
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,310
He's right.

230
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,606
Of course, he is.
This man here went to SNU...

231
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,941
Cho Sang-woo.

232
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,369
Come on, really?

233
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,956
We're all teammates here now.

234
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,836
We should really know about each other,
build up a little trust, okay?

235
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,006
Kang Sae-byeok.

236
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,174
Sae-byeok?

237
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,343
That's a pretty name.

238
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,512
Though I'm not sure how well it fits.

239
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,807
And what is your name, sir?
If you don't mind.

240
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,351
What?

241
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,688
My name?

242
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,398
Oh.

243
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,109
It...

244
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,156
Uh...

245
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,367
Let me think.

246
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,289
Hold on, it...

247
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,958
So...

248
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,335
It...

249
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,546
They call me...

250
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,631
It's okay.

251
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,426
Hey, old man, you must be
really shook up today.

252
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,595
You know when I'm stressed,

253
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,597
my home address
slips right out of my head.

254
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,724
Along with my social security.

255
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,436
It'll be okay
once you get some rest.

256
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,779
Damn it.

257
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,324
That hurts. Doctor, my ass.

258
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,952
I'm almost done here.

259
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,873
Thankfully, it didn't go in too far.
You'll be fine.

260
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,752
Outside, I'll be able to treat it
at the hospital, okay?

261
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,880
Pretentious dickhead.

262
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,550
You must have lost your practice
to be in this place.

263
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,969
I will get out of here.

264
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,514
With that money.

265
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,895
Those bastards.

266
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,441
Why they make it so we could kill
other players and then end it like this?

267
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,026
Games will be over.

268
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,296
We could've ended this whole thing
right there and then.

269
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,822
If we kill everyone else,
what happens to us?

270
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,785
And won't we get to...

271
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,079
take all that money?

272
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,960
We'll be able to try and kill them again
as long as we don't die.

273
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,255
Right, Doc? In the next game.

274
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,134
All done.

275
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,638
I guess this is why everyone says

276
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,015
you really should have a doctor
in your family.

277
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,037
We got rid of quite a few.

278
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:09,192
Players down from 107 to 80,
that means we killed 27?

279
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,404
Right, old man?

280
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,197
"Old man"?

281
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,116
You're gonna call me that?

282
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,951
You seem way older than me.

283
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,077
Oh, yeah?

284
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,912
Tell me how old do I look?

285
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,996
Forty-nine.

286
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,710
Oh, please. I guess I shouldn't have
lent you that lighter then, huh?

287
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,793
Thirty-nine?

288
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,421
Old man, one more chance.

289
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,215
Uh...

290
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,425
Nineteen?

291
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,555
Bingo.

292
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,892
You're a quick learner.

293
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,857
But what's my...

294
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,358
reward for guessing?

295
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,655
I'll go think about it
in the restroom, okay?

296
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,626
I'm going to the bathroom too.

297
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,343
Old man.

298
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,514
You and that doctor are hiding something.

299
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,686
There's nothing to hide.

300
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,325
Old man.

301
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,286
Do you...

302
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,083
swear to stick together right to the end?

303
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,379
Just tell me that you will.

304
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,007
Okay. I promise you.

305
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,095
Together, you and I will get out of here.

306
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,734
What's your name, old man?

307
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,947
Why?

308
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,325
I just wanna know it.

309
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,041
Deok-su.

310
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,128
Jang Deok-su.

311
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,067
Deok-su.

312
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,114
You betray me...

313
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,076
I'll kill you, okay?

314
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,834
You're the reason that I think...

315
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,420
I might die tonight.

316
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,023
<i>Attention, staff,
it's now time for you to go to sleep.</i>

317
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,401
<i>Congratulations on a good day's work.</i>

318
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,667
SHAPES, RANK, MASKED LEADER,
GUN MASSACRE,

319
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,338
RIOT, ABETTING MURDER, MY BROTHER

320
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,569
<i>Morse code?</i>

321
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,909
<i>Number 29.</i>

322
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,934
Hey, old man.

323
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,145
Huh?

324
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,772
Did you stay up all night?

325
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,359
I thought they would attack again
or something.

326
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,070
Old man, but you must be
so exhausted already.

327
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,865
It's all right.

328
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,244
You don't really need that much sleep
when you're old.

329
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,874
And I didn't help
when they went after everyone

330
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,252
but keeping night watch,
well, I can do that.

331
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,010
<i>Attention, players.
The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

332
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,970
<i>Please follow the staff's instructions</i>

333
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,556
<i>and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.</i>

334
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,683
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

335
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,852
<i>The third game will begin momentarily.</i>

336
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:27,528
<i>Beginning head count now.
Please wait in front of your door.</i>

337
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,203
<i>Head count complete.</i>

338
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,429
<i>Players,
welcome to the third game.</i>

339
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,891
<i>For this game, you will play in teams.</i>

340
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,688
<i>All players, please divide yourselves
into teams of ten people.</i>

341
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:06,275
<i>Your time limit will be ten minutes.
Ten minutes.</i>

342
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,070
<i>Let me repeat the instructions.</i>

343
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,240
<i>For this game, you will play in teams.</i>

344
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:17,161
<i>All players, please divide yourselves
into teams of ten people.</i>

345
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,082
<i>Your time limit will be ten minutes.
Ten minutes.</i>

346
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,752
We need to get a bunch of men
who are well built.

347
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,087
Oh, okay.

348
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,631
What about the girl?

349
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,520
Something that has teams of ten players.

350
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,106
So maybe it's Tail Tag
or Why Did You Come to My House?

351
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,609
Tail Tag means running is involved.

352
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,821
Or it might just end up
being simply based on luck.

353
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,699
What do you think?

354
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,661
Our team already has a girl
and an older guy.

355
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,342
I'm thinking we better get more men first.

356
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,877
What if they make us play <i>Gonggi</i>
or Elastics? Then, what do we do?

357
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,604
Girls are usually the good ones at that...

358
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,715
That's true, but when it really comes
down to it, usually men are better.

359
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,593
It's our lives we're betting on right now.

360
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,220
And we gotta win.

361
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,561
Five more people are needed.

362
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,439
I see that we each
bring one guy to join us.

363
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,690
Okay?

364
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,410
Don't let them see.

365
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,580
You'll seem weaker.

366
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,473
Boss, excuse me.
Look, this guy wants to join us.

367
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,101
Hey, go find more guys.

368
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,664
Sir?

369
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,959
Got a team yet? Are you taken?

370
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,293
Huh? Uh, no.

371
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,421
Come join ours then, sir. We have a team.

372
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,549
Well, the thing is, though,

373
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:39,137
so I can't join unless she does, too.

374
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,637
Would you let her?

375
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,182
Oh, I'm sorry.

376
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,309
Our team already has too many girls.

377
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,942
Excuse me. Still picking who to join in?
You should come with us.

378
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,326
Excuse me, sir.

379
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,790
If you're not on a team yet,
perhaps you would like to join ours?

380
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,373
<i>Let's team up next time.</i>

381
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,682
<i>Babe, wait!</i>

382
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,895
I don't get it.
Come on, you're just joking.

383
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,522
My team is full. I'm sorry.

384
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,150
We've got ten already.

385
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,822
Old man. No, please, you can't do this.

386
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,491
I'm sorry.

387
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,701
I'll do anything.

388
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,995
Babe, I swear I'll do better.

389
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,414
Uh, I'm good at everything.
You know that's true.

390
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,832
Just listen, okay?

391
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,169
Let's split up just for this game,
all right?

392
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,880
Then meet up with the next one, huh?

393
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,882
But...

394
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,343
do we really need to, though?

395
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,721
You said we'd do this together.

396
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,556
Babe.

397
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,934
Can you really do this alone?

398
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,604
I need you, old man. Can't you see that?

399
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,314
Get off!

400
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,651
God, this bitch is so pathetic.
Get your hands off me.

401
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,278
And stop calling me "babe"
and "old man," huh!

402
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,242
Call me that one more fucking time,
and I'll cut your goddamn throat out!

403
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,002
You asshole.

404
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,005
Just stop it. You were using me.

405
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,634
Jang Deok-su.

406
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,136
Goddamn you, scumbag.

407
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,432
You betrayed me,
you're dead now. Got that?

408
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,684
Oh, I'm so scared...

409
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,519
Ms. Han Mi-nyeo.

410
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,897
Well then, best of luck to you, huh?

411
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,987
She's not worth it anyways.

412
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,034
What do you want?

413
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,619
Play with us.

414
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,209
One.

415
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:17,877
Two.

416
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,337
Three.

417
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,257
Four.

418
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,926
Five.

419
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,511
Six.

420
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,054
Seven.

421
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,098
Eight.

422
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,476
Nine? Um...

423
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,147
Wait, did someone not bring anyone?

424
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,398
It was me. I didn't.

425
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,445
What about you? Who brought you here?

426
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,863
Her.

427
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,618
I said to bring only men back here,
didn't I?

428
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,371
This doesn't sound good.

429
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,749
You want me to go?

430
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,500
I'll go now.

431
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,793
No, wait. Hold on.

432
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,713
It's okay. Stay where you are.

433
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,842
We don't even know what we're doing yet.

434
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,470
And the time's almost over.

435
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,140
At this point, let's just find
one more team and be done.

436
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,601
We put together a weak team,
who would want to join it?

437
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,395
That means that once the timer's done,

438
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,239
we'll end up with anyone
that got kicked out.

439
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,233
Well, nobody kicked me out, huh!

440
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,153
I'll play with you
as a special deal here, okay?

441
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,572
Man, you guys lucked out today. Yikes!

442
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,617
I'll be way more help
than either of these wimpy little girls.

443
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,746
Plus, I'm good at everything
except the things that I can't do.

444
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,252
<i>The time for forming your teams is over.</i>

445
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,297
<i>All players, please line up
with your teammates</i>

446
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,549
<i>- at the entrance to the game hall.</i>
- Hold on.

447
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,655
We're not gonna stay in here, though?

448
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:25,756
I would now like
to welcome you all to the third game.

449
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,301
Today's game is Tug-of-War.

450
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,556
In order to win, you must pull the rope
towards your platform

451
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,434
in an attempt to
drop your opponents down below.

452
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,656
Now, I will draw numbers to decide
which two teams will play first.

453
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,909
Everyone, please sit down.

454
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,668
First, the team
that will play on the left tower.

455
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,508
Team One. Team One, please stand up.

456
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:17,016
And now, the team that will play
on the right tower.

457
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,270
Team Seven.

458
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,439
Team Seven, please stand up.

459
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,284
Teams One and Seven
will be the first teams to play.

460
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,830
Will both teams please go to your towers.

461
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,099
Get them!

462
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,982
Oh! Oh, shit!

463
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,486
Shit!

464
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,534
Get them!

465
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,954
<i>The following players, Player 245,</i>

466
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:48,334
<i>Player 120, Player 37, Player 408,</i>

467
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,921
<i>Player 27, Player 273, Player 58,</i>

468
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:59,428
<i>Player 243, Player 327,
and Player 241 are eliminated.</i>

469
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,884
I will now draw
the teams for the next round.

470
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,967
Team Four.

471
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,516
Team Five.

472
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,863
Damn it.

473
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,990
All men.

474
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,827
Team Four and Team Five,
please go to your towers.

475
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,879
Oh, man. I was looking forward
to killing you guys.

476
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,052
Come on. Don't lose your spirit.

477
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,057
Tug-of-War needs more
than just raw strength.

478
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,436
Well then, what it's about, huh?
We just go out and speak to them?

479
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,522
All you need is a good strategy
in Tug-of-War

480
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,149
and combined with good teamwork,

481
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,277
you'll be able to win
when you are against stronger teams.

482
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,404
Only one thing can help us now.

483
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,288
It's the Lord himself, I know it.

484
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,492
You can barely stay standing, old man.

485
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,827
So shut up and keep
all your strength, okay?

486
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,123
Wait a minute,
let's hear what the old man says.

487
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,795
Okay, when I was young,
we always like Tug-of-War.

488
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,881
It's a game I know well.

489
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,051
And back then, I would always win,

490
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,931
<i>even if there was a wrestler
on the other team,</i>

491
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,601
<i>and it seemed the odds
were stuck against us.</i>

492
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,064
<i>Listen closely,</i>

493
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:01,151
<i>and I'll tell you how my team and I
were able to win</i>

494
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,570
<i>even when it seemed impossible.</i>

495
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,119
<i>First off, having a good leader
is very important.</i>

496
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,830
<i>The person is at the front</i>

497
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,668
<i>and keeps an eye on
how the other team is performing.</i>

498
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,797
<i>And the rest of the team focuses
on the back of their leader's head</i>

499
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,423
<i>and follows their lead.</i>

500
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,803
<i>If the leader seems weak or looks like
their spirit is beginning to falter,</i>

501
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,806
<i>then the game is already over.</i>

502
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,018
<i>And then at the end of the rope,</i>

503
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,230
<i>you'll need to have someone strong
and dependable</i>

504
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,898
<i>like the anchor of a ship.</i>

505
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:45,404
<i>After that, it's all about
how you arrange the rest of your team.</i>

506
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,156
<i>If one player is
on the right side of the rope,</i>

507
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,452
<i>then the next one should be on the left,
all the way down the rope.</i>

508
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:58,917
<i>Both of your feet
should be facing straight forward,</i>

509
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,379
<i>and then, hold the rope in your armpits.</i>

510
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,717
<i>That way, everyone can put in
all of their strength.</i>

511
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:12,139
<i>Finally, and this is absolutely
the most important thing.</i>

512
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,143
<i>Once the game begins,
for the first ten seconds...</i>

513
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,229
<i>...you have to hold your ground.</i>

514
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:23,275
<i>You should lean back,
practically lie down.</i>

515
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,112
<i>Push your lower abdomen up to the sky,
as hard as you can.</i>

516
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,781
<i>And throw your head back to the point</i>

517
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,368
<i>where you can almost see the groin
of the person behind you.</i>

518
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:38,206
<i>If you do that, the other team
won't be able to pull us to their side.</i>

519
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,168
<i>Just hold like this for ten seconds.</i>

520
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:45,005
<i>Then the opposing team
will start to get frustrated</i>

521
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,966
<i>because they are thinking,
"Why won't they budge?"</i>

522
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,803
<i>Because they believed
that they were much stronger.</i>

523
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,723
<i>If you can hold out for that long,</i>

524
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,810
<i>you will be able to catch a moment
in your opponents' hold,</i>

525
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,271
<i>and their rhythm breaks.</i>

526
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,399
Now's our chance!

527
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,174
Pull it together!

528
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,703
We're losing! Goddamn it! Do something!

529
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,293
Get yourselves together and listen!

530
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,797
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

531
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,758
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

532
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,760
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

533
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,303
There's no way I'll do that!

534
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,763
We might as well try!

535
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,515
No way! I can't do it!

536
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,183
Move up or you'll die!

537
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,935
On count of three!

538
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,854
One! Two!

539
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,647
Three!

539
00:50:26,305 --> 00:51:26,159
