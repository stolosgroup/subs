EPISODE 9
ONE LUCKY DAY

3
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,388
Player 218 and Player 456,

4
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,057
welcome to the final game.

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,855
Before we begin, we'll flip a coin
to decide who plays offense or defense.

6
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,275
Please choose a shape. Triangle or square.

7
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,903
Triangle.

8
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,277
It's triangle.

9
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,291
Please choose either offense or defense.

10
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,006
Offense.

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,634
Player 456 will play offense.

12
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,719
Player 218 will defend.

13
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,110
For the final game,
you'll both be playing Squid Game.

14
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,864
Squid Game.

15
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,826
What an odd name.

16
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,454
It was originally
a children's game

17
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,500
- that was played in Korea many years ago.
- Hmm.

18
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,628
Let me explain
the rules of Squid Game.

19
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,923
One, the attacker must enter
the squid shape court,

20
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,593
run past the defense, and then tap
the area inside the squid's head

21
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,262
with his foot to secure the win.

22
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,765
Two, the defender must block
the attacker's advance

23
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,810
and force them outside
of the court's bounds in order to win.

24
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,187
Three, if a situation arises,

25
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,774
in which either player is unable
to continue playing the game,

26
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,985
the last one standing will be the winner.

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,244
A player's unable to continue.

28
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,581
Could you explain that?

29
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,293
That would be
referring to the player's death.

30
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,423
And now, with that, let the game begin.

31
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,472
<i>Among all the games
that kids played back then,</i>

32
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,975
<i>it was the most physical and violent.</i>

33
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,810
So any kind of violence is allowed?

34
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,854
Sure. There are no restrictions.

35
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,386
Why is he hopping on one foot?

36
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,932
The attacker
is given a handicap.

37
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,519
He can only hop on one foot
until he crosses the squid's neck.

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,064
Oh, so the defender tries to block him.

39
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,232
Yes.

40
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,609
That's the first challenge of this game.

41
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,698
We always used to play this as kids.

42
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,493
When we cross...

43
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,663
do you remember what we used to call it?

44
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,890
Shut up. Who cares about all that?

45
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,178
Inspector royal.

46
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,392
"Inspector royal," we called it.

47
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,877
Mm. It sounds so romantic.

48
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,587
What's it mean?

49
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:01,175
"Good rain
knows the best time to fall."

50
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,427
Du Fu.

51
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,477
I put an end to her suffering.

52
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,188
You know she would have died anyway.

53
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,691
That's bullshit. Stop lying.

54
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,068
She could've survived.

55
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,404
They would've treated her.

56
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,948
I know what you're like, okay?

57
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,409
You're the reason that I had to kill her.

58
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,913
I knew you two would stop all this,
so she didn't die in there.

59
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,708
Was that it?

60
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,390
You killed someone because this might end?

61
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,462
Yeah!

62
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,050
You and that girl would have been
the majority you needed to get out!

63
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,510
Going home without a single cent.
I couldn't do that!

64
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,598
She's the one who stopped me.

65
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,935
'Cause I was gonna kill you with this.

66
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,025
It's over.

67
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,489
I won't let you leave here
with that money.

68
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,000
You bastard!

69
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,748
Die!

70
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,085
Die!

71
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,839
Get up! Get up! Get up!

72
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,978
You recognized it?

73
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,828
It's the damn place where they made us
play Red Light, Green Light.

74
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,236
So many people played with us,
but now they're dead.

75
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,279
Everyone except for us, Gi-hun.

76
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,116
We...

77
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,246
we've already come too far
to end this now.

78
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,076
So it was you that killed them.

79
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,079
You... you killed everyone!

80
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,790
You killed them.

81
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,751
You're the one who killed them.

82
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,477
This game is over.

83
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,562
Yep, that about wraps it up.

84
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,305
I can't.

85
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,815
I wanna end here.

86
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,117
What is he doing?

87
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,011
- What the hell?
- What's going on?

88
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,703
Clause Three of the agreement.

89
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,998
The players are able to end the game when...

90
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,126
the majority agrees.

91
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,548
So if we both give up now,

92
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,634
you have to end it, right?

93
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,558
Player 456 wants to stop the game.

94
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,936
He's giving up the prize money

95
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,731
right... right here
at the very edge of victory?

96
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,817
No fucking way.

97
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,034
Sang-woo.

98
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,496
I just thought...

99
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,500
how they used to call our names when...

100
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,838
our moms had made supper for us.

101
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,718
That won't happen again.

102
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,349
Let's go.

103
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,107
Let's go together.

104
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,790
Gi-hun.

105
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,878
I'm sorry.

106
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,765
Sang-woo!

107
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,101
Sang-woo...

108
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,687
Gi-hun.

109
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,150
No, Sang-woo. Don't talk.

110
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,819
- My mother, go help her.
- Don't talk, Sang-woo.

111
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,741
You have to help her.

112
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,118
Ah... No. Don't...

113
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,287
Sang-woo, don't...

114
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,290
Oh, no!

115
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,134
No! Sang-woo, no...

116
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,598
You should celebrate.

117
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,225
That was quite the game there.

118
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,643
Why?

119
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,443
Why did you do it? How can you?

120
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,279
You bet on horses.

121
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,992
It's the same here but...

122
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,202
we bet on humans.

123
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,040
You're our horses.

124
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,293
I did not expect you to finish your race.

125
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,714
Who are you?

126
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,635
It was a dream. Just think of it that way.

127
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,972
And it really wasn't a bad one
for you, either.

128
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,974
Who are you?

129
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,774
Who are you?

130
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,695
Who are you?

131
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,867
Who are you?

132
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,162
Who are...

133
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,752
Believe in Jesus or burn in Hell!

134
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,797
You fool who deny the Lord's existence,

135
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,048
repent now!

136
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,968
The day of judgment is upon us!

137
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,137
Followers go to Heaven,
non-believers burn in Hell!

138
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,600
The only thing waiting for you
in the afterlife will be fire and pain!

139
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,436
Let us repent
and kneel down before the Lord!

140
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,691
Save yourself from Hell
by making Jesus your lord!

141
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,414
BELIEVE IN JESUS

142
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,599
Jesus. Praise the Lord.

Are you...

153
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,799
What happened? What's going on?

154
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,221
Did you get into another fight
while drinking?

155
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,726
Hold on. Wait right here.

156
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,992
Here's some mackerel.
I know your mother may want it.

157
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,750
She came down with something, I think.
She hasn't come out to work.

158
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,503
And it's been a few days
since she's answered her phone.

159
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,630
I should've stopped by to check on her.

160
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,967
I just don't know what's wrong with me.
I mean, I, uh...

161
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,141
It's all right.

162
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,603
Give your mom any cash you got.
She needs it more than I do.

163
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,821
Gi-hun.

164
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,618
By any chance...

165
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,663
have you heard anything recently

166
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,874
from Sang-woo?

167
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,589
Never mind.

168
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,050
You should go.

169
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,782
Hey, Ma.

170
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,826
I'm home.

171
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,215
Hey, Ma.

172
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,808
Mom, are you asleep?

173
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,103
Hey, Ma.

174
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,817
Mom, I'm home.

175
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
Come on.

176
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,746
I came home, Ma.

177
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,543
Hey, Ma.

178
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,674
Just, just open your eyes.

179
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,053
Come on.

180
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,983
I'm home now, Mom.

181
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,113
I got some money for us now.

182
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:49,052
1 YEAR LATER

183
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,893
We've got a real barista
working for us here,

184
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,603
and he can make you a cup as well.

185
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,145
I'm not sure if you'd like it that much.

186
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,649
Why am I here to see you?

187
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,570
Uh, sorry, you had to take the trip here.

188
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,364
I wanted to have a car
sent out to you, but...

189
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,866
Why am I here? What's wrong?

190
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,994
Uh, well...

191
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,876
So you see, you created your account here
quite a while ago and...

192
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,671
and you haven't made that much effort
to contact us since.

193
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,384
What do you mean?

194
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,597
Did I do something wrong?

195
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,224
Huh?

196
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,187
Uh, uh, no. It's nothing like that, sir.

197
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,318
Uh, you've got all your money set up
in a normal savings account.

198
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,613
You weren't earning
all that much interest on it.

199
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:37,494
And recently, our bank began offering
these consultations for VIPs

200
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,829
looking to expand their financial assets.

201
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,249
I wanted to let you know
that we're here to help.

202
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,585
I'm sure you're keeping busy.
I just wanted to say...

203
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:49,172
Oh. I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

204
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,677
Could you help me out with something else?

205
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,929
Okay, what can we do?

206
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,518
Please spare me just 10,000 won?

207
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,144
What?

208
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,981
Uh...

209
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,192
All right, yeah. Here, let me just...

210
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,989
Um...

211
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,232
Excuse me.

212
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,112
Would you buy some flowers?

213
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,198
Please, mister.

214
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:02,120
I need to get rid of them tonight
or they'll end up wilting away.

215
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,004
Thank you, mister.

216
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,840
I appreciate it.

217
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,800
Uh, here.

218
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,428
Have a good night.

219
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,097
DECEMBER 24, 11:30 P.M.
SKY BUILDING, 7TH FLOOR

220
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,932
FROM YOUR GGANBU

221
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,295
Pour some water in there.

222
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,471
Please, Gi-hun.

223
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,203
Who are you?

224
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,916
You explain this.

225
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,178
You see him?

226
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,389
That man down there?

227
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,518
He must be drunk...

228
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,231
because he's been sitting there for hours.

229
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,609
He looks homeless too

230
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,320
if I had to guess.

231
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,904
You...

232
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,785
Were you the one who's behind it?

233
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,789
He's going to freeze to death
if he stays out there any longer.

234
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,960
And no one is going over
to help or anything.

235
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,004
Why the hell did you do it?

236
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,925
Would you help out that guy?

237
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,218
Answer me!

238
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,555
Why did you do that to us?

239
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,601
You think that you will stop walking

240
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:41,566
and help that disgusting, stinking drunk,
little piece of trash, huh?

241
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,089
Show me who you are!

242
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,154
Why did I get to live and no one else?

243
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,739
Listen.

244
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,491
Let's play something tonight.

245
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,579
That man out there...

246
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,249
if he remains out there until midnight,

247
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,918
I win.

248
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,629
If anyone...

249
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,758
goes to help the drunk before then,

250
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,719
in that case, you win.

251
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,348
Cut the crap, okay?

252
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,727
I could easily snap your neck right here.

253
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,480
If you do that,

254
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:24,150
then you won't get to hear
my explanation for all this.

255
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,987
Play this game with me and...

256
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,114
I'll give you the...

257
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,825
answer to your question.

258
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,942
And if I win...

259
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,446
...then I'll kill you
without a second thought.

260
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,576
What will you... bet on it with then?

261
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Anything.

262
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,875
It doesn't matter.
You might as well take everything I have.

263
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,889
So then...

264
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,475
who are you?

265
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,893
I earn...

266
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,522
a living, lending out money.

267
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,150
You give money to people for a living...

268
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,779
...and you get rich doing it?

269
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,865
Money.

270
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,868
You know what making money is like.

271
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,955
It's not simple to do.

272
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,624
So then...

273
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,754
was any of what you said true

274
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,590
or was it all just a lie?

275
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,427
Oh Il-nam.

276
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,972
Is that even your real name, huh?

277
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,557
It is.

278
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,726
Yes, that's real.

279
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,021
Oh Il-nam.

280
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,523
That tumor's also real.

281
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,944
And it also had gotten larger too.
That's true.

282
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,864
And the house

283
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,701
I used to live with my family in

284
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,207
was almost exactly like that one
in the alley. That's all true.

285
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,738
Can you still...

286
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,992
trust anybody to be good

287
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,287
even after everything you've been through?

288
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,832
Why did you send a card?

289
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,251
I heard that

290
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,296
all the money you won
is just sitting there

291
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,050
and that you are still living
like you used to.

292
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,348
Is it all just because you feel guilty?

293
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,772
Guilt? Shut up.

294
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,653
You don't feel any guilt
for what you did, do you?

295
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,280
It's yours now.

296
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,116
That cash is your reward

297
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,161
for your hard work and luck.

298
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:07,498
And you have every right to use it now.

299
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,209
Life goes by quick.

300
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,213
In one minute...

301
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,550
gone in a blink.

302
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,397
Why did you do
something like this?

303
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,318
Do you know

304
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,447
what someone who doesn't have any money

305
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,952
has in common with someone
with too much money

306
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,121
to know what to do with?

307
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,960
Living is...

308
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,963
no fun for either of them.

309
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,510
If you have too much money, then it...

310
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,642
doesn't matter what you buy,
or eat, or drink, or whatever.

311
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:13,397
Everything, well, it all gets boring.

312
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,818
All of my clients,

313
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:23,616
started to eventually say
the exact same things whenever we talked.

314
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,993
Everybody felt...

315
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:31,249
that there was no joy
in their lives anymore.

316
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,963
And so, we decided to get together.

317
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,508
We did a little bit of thinking.

318
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,679
What could we all do to...

319
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,224
finally have some fun?

320
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,433
Some fun?

321
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,773
You put us through all of that

322
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,734
so you can have fun?

323
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,361
It seems...

324
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,491
that you forgot how... no one had to play,

325
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,954
and you... all put your signatures
on the agreement.

326
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,586
And that you all made your decision
to come back on your own.

327
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,559
Well, he's still out there.

328
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,854
It looks like you've run out of luck.

329
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,317
Tell me...

330
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:46,157
you still trust... in humanity being good?

331
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,160
I wanna know...

332
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,371
I wanna know why you joined us?

333
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,709
Oh, well, in my childhood

334
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,588
I always had

335
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,384
so much fun out doing things
with all of my friends.

336
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,014
We'd lose track of time for hours.

337
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,267
I wanted to just...

338
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,479
feel something

339
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,566
just one last time before I die.

340
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:26,906
And you are not going to get that feeling
if you are just going to spectate.

341
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,326
And I desperately wanted that.

342
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,203
And so...

343
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,582
did playing do that then?

344
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,793
Hell yeah.

345
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,922
You asked why I let you live.

346
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,299
By joining...

347
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,929
and playing with you...

348
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,848
I got that chance to...

349
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,643
feel again.

350
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,895
Thanks to you...

351
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,191
I got to remember

352
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,070
all these things that I had...

353
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,573
forgotten long ago.

354
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,662
It had been such a long time...

355
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,666
since I...

356
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,587
was able to have that much fun.

357
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,402
Look at that.

358
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,780
There's someone who cares.

359
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,825
You saw that, didn't you?

360
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,080
You saw that you lost.

361
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,368
And our guests,
greet them for me, all right?

362
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,329
Of course, sir,
but why not do it yourself?

363
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:28,587
Because I know that I'm not going to have
as much fun watching as playing.

364
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,254
INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT
RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY

365
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,864
<i>The country's reported
household debt is rapidly on the rise,</i>

<i>topping the current global average.</i>

367

<i>Last third quarter, the Bank of Korea and

<i>...reported that the GDP...</i>

370
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,458
Holy moly! Your hair, sir, grew out.

371
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,168
Uh, what you're getting done today?

372
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,129
Did you want a shorter cut?

373
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:13,173
Or keep it longer
so we can perm it like that, huh?

374
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,360
<i>...Bank for international Settlements.</i>

<i>The biggest increase in the world

376
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,348
<i>The reason for the steep rise
in Korea's reported household debt</i>

377
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,017
<i>is due, at least in part,</i>

378
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,936
<i>to the lifted government restrictions
on financial loans.</i>

MINJI HAIR SALON

380
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,968
You must be Cheol.

381
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,226
The family resemblance is there.

382
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,483
Sir, do you know...

383
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,944
my sister very well?

384
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,783
I know her.

385
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,245
We're good friends.

386
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,666
Does that mean you know
where she is right now?

387
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,013
Is this the boy?

388
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,933
Yeah.

389
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,062
Tell me your name, sweetie.

390
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,439
It's Cheol.

391
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,817
Kang Cheol.

392
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,777
Kang Cheol?

393
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,987
How cool!
That's a manly name you have there.

394
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,491
And you look so tough and strong.

395
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,910
Take care of him, please.

396
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,494
Okay.

397
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:10,332
It'll be nice to have
a little extra company around

398
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,834
for dinner for a change.

399
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,211
Don't worry about me. Have a good trip.

400
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:15,753
Thanks.

401
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,102
Cheol, have you had dinner yet?

402
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,772
Here, come. Come and take a seat.
Come on now.

403
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,857
Have a fish bun.

404
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,526
Here you go.

405
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,823
Oh, goodness! That jacket
is way too light for this cold.

406
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,533
Wait, don't you have a warmer jacket?

407
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,849
IT'S THE MONEY I OWE SANG-WOO

<i>You have arrived

<i>This is Incheon Airport Terminal One.</i>

412
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,057
Hey,
daddy's almost at the airport now.

413
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,434
I'll be boarding the flight soon.

414
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,564
Of course, of course, I got you a present.

415
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,109
No way. It's a secret.

416
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,904
I'll show it to you in person.

417
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,160
Hold on, Ga-yeong.

418
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,248
Ga-yeong, I'm gonna call you back
once I get there, okay?

419
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,709
I'll be there soon, honey.

420
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,763
Let's play again. Right now!

421
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,480
What the hell are you doing?

422
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,150
Give me back that card!

423
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,527
- Oh!
- No. You don't.

424
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,571
You don't go!

Listen carefully.

I'm not a horse.

437
