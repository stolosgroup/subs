4
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,365
Good job, kid.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,334
- All right.

6
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,903
Here you go.

7
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,609
You know where to go?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,344
- Get to it.

10
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,650
- This is never what I wanted.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,619
Never where I thought I'd be.

12
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,922
But then I'd never been
anywhere else.

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,393
A little further,
past that tree.

14
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,596
Even when they sent me away,

15
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,632
they just sent me
right back here.

18
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,457
- Every member of my family
fights this fight

19
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:30,891
in one way or another.

20
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,162
And so does every family
who calls Kingstown home.

21
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,665
So do a lot of families
who will never call it home,

22
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,900
but they live here anyway.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,603
Waiting.
Always waiting.

24
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,738
- You drop somethin'?

25
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:48,509
- Now it's up to me to keep
the rats in the cage content.

26
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,181
And the keepers
from becoming rats, themselves.

28
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,960
- This is a company town

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,697
and the business
is incarceration.

30
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,833
Seven prisons
in a 10-mile radius.

31
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,937
20,000 lost souls
with no hope, no future.

32
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,276
And I'm their link to a world
that doesn't want them.

33
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,512
I'm the life raft.

34
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,616
I'm the mayor of Kingstown.

36
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,083
- Now he's got all these
fucking guards hangin' out

37
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,552
around his cell like a bunch
of fuckin' vultures.

38
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,221
I told you last week
to get him fuckin' transferred.

39
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,624
- Do I look like
the warden to you?

40
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,225
He hit a fuckin' guard.

41
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,094
- So help me, if any
of these bastards punks my kid-

42
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,096
- You'll what?

43
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,332
What are you gonna do, Walter?

44
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,200
Huh?
Just 'cause you pay us,

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,902
you think you can
talk to him like that?

46
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,537
Is that it?

47
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,539
Who the fuck do ya think
you're talkin' to?

48
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,611
- The mayor.
- Yeah, you're fuckin' right.

49
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,145
- I'm sorry.

50
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,880
- Look, we had your kid
in protection, right?

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,116
But he's got a big fuckin' mouth
and not much common sense,

52
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,150
so what do you want?

53
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,585
- He's in Ad Seg.

54
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,086
Believe me, that's
the safest place he can be.

55
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,456
Your kid fractured
that guard's jaw.

56
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,224
But when they
throw the book at him,

57
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,360
they don't want some
beat-to-shit 17-year-old

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,129
in front of that judge,
so, he's fine for now.

59
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,064
But he's gotta understand
and you've gotta understand,

60
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,133
he's gettin' another five years
on that sentence.

61
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,501
And he's gotta come to grips
with the fact

62
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,036
that his only protection
is with the whites,

63
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,671
and he's gonna
have to play ball to get it.

64
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,239
And that means
he keeps his mouth shut

65
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,274
and he does
what he's supposed to do.

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,043
Because if he doesn't,
he's gonna end up

67
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,011
somebody's girl
for the next decade.

68
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,047
Be sure to
make that clear to him.

69
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,483
- Sorry. He's my son.

70
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,251
- Well, maybe next time
don't have him cookin' up meth

71
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:47,621
in the Caraway campground.
How 'bout that?

72
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,889
- Look, tell you what.

73
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,123
You tell him to rope a sheet.

74
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,359
If it looks like
they're gonna punk him,

75
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,160
you have him noose up
before bed check.

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,395
They'll put him
on suicide watch.

77
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,097
It'll keep him
on the warden's radar.

78
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,233
- Okay.
- Let's go.

79
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,510
Jackass.

80
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,379
We got a meet
at the Carriage House.

81
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,146
You wanna bring this up?

82
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,582
- That kid's gotten
all the fuckin' help

83
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,083
we're gonna give him.
- Good.

with somethin'
I gotta hear right now?

87
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,392
- No more than usual.
- Good.

88
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,894
Then we're gonna
be back in an hour.

89
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,531
- Oh wait, um,
remember Milo Center?

90
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,065
His wife's here.

91
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,835
- What does she want?
- Wouldn't tell me.

92
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,704
- All right.

93
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,207
You go on,
I'll see what this is.

94
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,475
- You sure?

95
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,844
- Yeah, if she's here
Milo sent her.

96
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,246
- Okay.

- How's Milo?
- Good. Ya know, counting.

100
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,633
- It's a little early for that.

101
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,435
- He's an optimist.

102
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:11,772
- Well, tell me.
What can I do for him?

103
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,274
- He needs something moved.
Could you close that?

104
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,910
- [siren wailing]

105
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,512
- No one can hear us out there.

106
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,482
- I don't mind the smoke.
Please.

107
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,722
- [door closes]

108
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,527
- All right.

109
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,529
- I leave for Estonia
tomorrow night

110
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,799
and I must take it with me.
- It?

111
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,801
Well, I gotta know
what I'm pickin' up.

112
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,270
- From that thing.

113
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,372
You know.

114
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:49,342
- All of it?
- He said 10,000 for you.

115
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,281
- This is a little outside
of what we do.

116
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,349
I'm gonna have to hear
from Milo.

117
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,085
Make sure that you're not
cookin' this up yourself.

118
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,252
No offense.

119
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,622
- He said
he could call after 3:00.

120
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,891
- Have you got the where
and all that?

121
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,300
Oh, a map.

122
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,635
Is there gonna be
an X on the ground?

123
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,970
Or maybe he has
a GPS coordinate, or-

124
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,439
- Milo said no electronics.

125
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,376
He would like you to make a copy
and I keep this one.

126
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,947
- [buzzes buzzer]

127
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,600
- Thank you.
This is far.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,569
- County took the land.

129
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,204
They will auction it off
next month.

130
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,842
- Is there anyone out there?
- Milo said no.

131
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,845
- All right.
We'll get it tonight.

132
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,613
- Thank you.

133
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,750
So tomorrow?

134
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,987
Thanks, Mitch.

135
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:20,000
- Damn, there's some fine-ass
women in this motherfucker.

- *

137
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,451
- This place, 20,000 inmates

138
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,254
and 40,000 people
to babysit them,

139
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,725
feed them, teach them.

140
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,827
And when they get out,
employ them

141
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,731
or convince them to leave
'cause this place is full.

142
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,304
- Oh, hi honey.
- Any for me?

143
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,907
- Big booth.
- Okay, thanks.

144
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,409
- I'm not takin'
this shit any more.

145
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,077
You show up
and do your fuckin' job.

146
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,512
- Hey.
- Hey man, what's up?

147
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,815
- How are ya?
- Good to see ya buddy.

148
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,549
- I need coffee.

149
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,985
Thanks, I'm dyin' here.

150
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,488
Thank you.

151
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,225
I saw um, I saw your ex
the other day.

152
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,760
- Oh f--
If there was any justice,

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,162
she was ridin' the brass pole
at the Elephant, please tell me.

154
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,396
- Nah, man,
Agnes does not

155
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,832
have the temperament
to be strippin'.

156
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,366
- [trio laughs]

157
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,935
- She was with that douchebag

158
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,603
from the public defender's
office, that prick.

159
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,304
- Oh God, I hope she marries
that fuck soon.

160
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,507
- Yeah, she thought
you had no money.

161
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,143
- Hey, you gonna deal with
both of my family functions.

162
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,679
- No, no, that's you.
- Not me, no, no, no, nope.

163
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,247
- All right, what do we got?
Jim?

164
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,250
- Um, my fuckin' family.
- Uh-huh.

165
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,186
- My nephew, Sam.
- What? He just started.

166
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,520
- Mm-hmm.
- Three months ago?

167
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,357
- And they got him pretty good.
- Who?

168
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,259
- The blacks.
- How?

169
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,461
- I don't know.
Somethin' about

170
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,529
one of them
always joking with him,

171
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,634
buddying up, asking him
to mail a letter home.

172
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,370
Some other bullshit about
another guard blockin' his mail.

173
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,873
He did it.
- What a cherry.

174
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,308
Geez, didn't you prep him
any better than this?

175
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,543
- But he's fuckin' 22, Mike.

176
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,613
He thinks these pieces of shit
are his brothers.

177
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,149
These kids, they don't,
they don't get it, man.

178
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,550
They just, they don't see it.

179
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,219
- Yeah, well,
they fuckin' got him now.

180
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,856
Okay?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,395
Who's the inmate?

182
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,864
- This piece of shit.

183
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,969
- He got a gang outside?
- Yeah, he's Crip.

184
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:41,074
- Okay, well, there ya go.
That's good news, right?

185
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,310
There's always
this sanction thing.

186
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,578
We're fine, right?
And the inmate's

187
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,048
not tryin' to put your nephew
in his pocket, right?

188
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,516
You know, all right, look.

189
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,219
If your nephew sent a letter
to any guy in the juice,

190
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,553
then I'll get the thing back.

191
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,188
But we're gonna have
to make a trade for it.

192
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,224
So is swing shift
the best time to launch a ball?

193
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,226
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And look, everybody's onboard.

194
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:02,129
All right, it's not like we all,
we all haven't been there.

195
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,898
- Just make sure there's no
Rambos in the turrets, okay?

196
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,199
If I get this letter,
they're gonna pick

197
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,836
the day and the time.
So, we got to be ready.

198
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,871
For somethin' like this,
I'm sure it's gonna be tarred.

199
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,706
Just make sure we have
our people in the yard.

200
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,942
Okay? No fuckin' subs.
- It's not a problem.

201
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,410
Our whole fuckin' unit
runs the place, except SIS.

202
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,678
It's fine, Mike.

203
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,147
- I don't want any sweeps,
none of that shit

204
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,850
'cause I gotta let everybody
know of this, all right?

205
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:27,087
Your nephew, gonna have a target
on his back for a while.

206
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,524
- Once we get this handled,
we'll put him up in a tower.

207
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,760
Okay? He'll be fine.

208
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,127
- Yeah, well,
I don't know about that

209
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,462
because he'll probably wanna
start shootin' people

210
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,630
left, right and center.
- [laughter]

211
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,467
- As long as he shoots
the right fool.

212
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,804
- Hey, I'll handle it.

213
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,472
Okay?
- Yeah.

214
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,639
- Let's go.
- Thanks, Mike.

215
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,941
Best to the mayor, all right?
- Yeah.

216
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,544
- Hey Mike,
is this gonna cost him with you?

217
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,882
- Absolutely.

218
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,362
- Well, even today,
the textbooks will teach you

219
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,765
that it was a war
over state's rights.

220
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,567
The result is the same.
And it was.

221
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,404
It was a war
over state's rights.

222
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,672
It was over
a state's right to decide

223
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,209
its own position on slavery.

224
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,778
So, this was a war

225
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:29,549
fought for the freedom
to choose slavery.

226
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,786
And the only time
in recorded history

227
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,622
that the oppressors
fought each other

228
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,725
over the rights
of the oppressed.

229
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:43,730
It was the most formative event
in this nation's history.

230
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,367
But the catharsis
of that union victory

231
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:51,571
and the freedom of the slaves,
it was short lived.

232
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,674
A decade later,
a new Union army

233
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,145
made up of mostly
imprisoned Confederate soldiers

234
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,614
and immigrants
reignited the genocide

235
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,485
begun by Columbus
some 400 years earlier.

236
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,021
There's a wonderful-
- [bell rings]

237
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,490
- Okay, read the first two
chapters.

238
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,359
I'll see you all tomorrow.

239
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,793
- All right, ladies.
Take your books.

240
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,263
Leave your pencils.
We'll start here.

241
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,443
- My grandparents
are from Pine Ridge.

242
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,812
That's where I was raised.

243
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,515
- You're a long way from home.

244
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,151
Do you know this?
- No.

245
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,287
- Well, it might speak to you.

246
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,455
It's about how your family
came to live on Pine Ridge

247
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,724
in the first place.

248
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,528
- Um, I was wondering.

249
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,163
I got a cousin coming here

250
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,601
and I was hoping
you'd ask the mayor.

251
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:58,505
I don't have any money,
but it's nothing.

252
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,773
If I hadn't
gotten written up for-

253
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,644
- Don't ever, ever,

254
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,049
mention my sons to me again.

255
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,652
Is that clear?

256
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,387
- I didn't mean
to be disrespectful.

257
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:17,024
- Get the fuck outta here.

258
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,705
- *

259
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,514
- [phone ringing]

260
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,784
- Yeah.
- All right, what happened?

261
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,287
- It's a problem.
- How big a problem?

262
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,022
- Like a seven.

263
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,757
- You gotta start on it
right now?

264
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,325
- Uh, well, I should.

265
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,095
- You near the lake?
- Yeah, I'm passing it.

266
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,664
- Good, so am I.
Meet me at the beach.

267
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,769
- [ship horn blows]

268
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,475
- Milo buried his take
on some land north of here.

269
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,510
We gotta go get it.

270
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,579
- Great.

271
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,382
- It's a hassle, but it's worth
10 for our trouble.

272
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,220
- Yeah.
Gonna need Kyle.

273
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,456
- He's not on duty.
- Tell him to pick up a shift.

274
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,697
- How was Ed?

275
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,466
- Tim Weaver's nephew
got hooked.

276
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,668
Mailed a letter
to some low-level Crip.

277
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,904
I don't know
if it was sanctioned.

278
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,077
- [seagulls squawking]

279
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,479
- Fuckin' Mondays.

280
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,018
[laughs] Fuckin' Mondays.

281
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,255
Fuck it, get in the car.
Let's go see Bunny.

282
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,656
- All right.

283
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,805
- *

284
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,319
- Why are y'all
dressed like cops?

285
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,554
- Why are you dressed

286
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,256
like you're mannin'
a weather station?

287
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,824
- You're a funny motherfucker,
Mitch.

288
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,826
- It is hot as hell up in here
for October though, right?

289
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,528
- Take your parka off.
Enjoy autumn, fuck.

290
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,030
- What the fuck
you want me to do?

291
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,198
Sit behind a desk?
Nah-uh,

292
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,233
this coat holds all of my shit.

293
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,402
- Can we get five minutes
with you?

294
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,104
- You,
go chill by the front door.

295
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:47,874
You, go get me a uh, a snowcone.

296
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,442
- Where I gonna
find you a snowcone?

297
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,578
- The 7-11, fool.
- That's a Slurpie.

298
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,680
You gotta get a snowcone
from a snowcone truck.

299
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,915
I could get you a Blizzard.
Got them Blizzards at the Q.

300
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,650
- Yeah, you are dressed
for a blizzard.

301
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,619
- Motherfucker, go get me
some cold, frozen shit.

302
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,621
I don't care where it from,
aight?

303
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,524
- Aight.
- Fruit flavored.

304
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:09,596
I'm sorry, do I speak Spanish
or some shit like that?

305
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,598
Damn.

306
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,266
What y'all doin' down here?

307
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,634
- Well, one of your guys,
he hooked a guard.

308
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,002
Clean kid, real green.

309
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,271
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
my boy got that letter.

310
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,673
So, what, y'all wanna trade?
- Sure.

311
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,842
- What you got?
I mean, I fish a good catch.

312
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,877
They, they can milk
that fool forever.

313
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,914
- Ah, it's Tim Weaver's nephew,

314
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,450

315
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,585

get your son shot in the yard.

But I gotta move some product,

as much as anyone. I mean,
Tim's wired pretty tight.

324
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,573
Everyone's on his side.
This is free money for you.

325
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,542
It was a good catch. Your guy
just picked the wrong kid.

326
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,278
I'm just here to warn you,
but come on.

You sent my boy $500 with tar
and coke all over that shit.

You're either my bitch out there

I'm a criminal, baby.

You understand me?

369
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,048
Or the DA's gonna be

No, I pick you up.

I don't kneed it?
- Nope.

You let it sit overnight.
Time does the work.

387
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:54,073
Why did you pick up a shift?

388
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,044
- Ma, don't start, okay?

389
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:01,080
- Your brothers are involved,
I'm sure.

390
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,683
- What aren't they involved in?

391
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,486
I gotta go.
- Be careful.

392
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,324
- Why would you say that to me?
- Well,

393
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,628
if your brothers are involved,
then you should be careful.

394

00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,976
Can I make a mold of it
out of candle wax?

404
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,546
And this guy, he starts thinkin'
about it, didn't you?

405
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,815
You sick son of a bitch.
He starts thinkin' about it.

406
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,917
Then the next thing you know.

407
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,119
Kyle, hey, man.

408
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,722

00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,925
Come here,
this guy's just never-

411
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,793
- No, no, no. Just do
what you gotta do on that.

412
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,128
- Come on,
we can look the other way.

413
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,362
I don't mind
givin' the guy a chance,

414
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,832
but not on a chance
he keeps stealin' shit.

415
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,033
- Well, then take him then.

416
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,400
Artie's gonna like it,
I'm tellin' you.

417
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,269
- Artie can go fuck himself.
We're doin' him a favor.

418
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,404
This kid's an embarrassment
and you know it.

419
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,041
- Yeah.

420
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,278
Jesus Christ.

421
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,683
- So, what's this emergency?
- Dig somethin' up with Mike.

422
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,251
- What?
- You remember Milo?

423
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,953
- Oh, we're not keepin'
that promise, are we?

424
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,154
- Yes, we are.

425
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,556
He buried it
up in Cottonwood Canyon.

426
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:51,991
- Hey, that's county.
- Those crooks up there

427
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,793
aren't gonna give you
any jurisdictional BS.

428
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,027
- Well, what do you need me for?

429
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,729
- If they do,
if anyone should show up,

430
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,230
you tell 'em
you're workin' on a tip.

431
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,634
It paid off and the department
gets a feather in its cap.

432
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,937
- And Milo's okay with that?
- That's the risk.

433
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,040
- A great way to spend
my night off, Mitch, thank you.

434
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,375
- I don't wanna
fuckin' go either.

435
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,143
Come on, let's go.
- What the fuck are you wearin'?

436
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,745
- Come on, he didn't tell you
where we're goin'?

437
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,313
- No.
- Bear country.

438
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,982
- Not in here.
Get the fuck outta my car.

439
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,283
- You're not takin' me?
- No.

440
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,651
- Fuck.

441
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,053
- Let's go, you fucker.
- Hey, you got an extra pair?

442
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,689
- Hey.
- What?

443
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,791
- Go straight to the office and
then right into the safe, yeah?

444
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,059
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on.

445
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,227
- That bear's gonna
shoot you dead

446
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:32,364
and you got loafers on.
You are fucked.

00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,227
- * My seat is reclined

469
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,596
- * Don't know what
she got on her mind *

470
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:41,267
- * All black, Johnny Cash
with the swag *

471
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,971
* Matte black,
white walls on the lag *

472
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,776
* Well dressed,
throw some wax on my stache *

473
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,412
* All black,
you can call me Johnny Cash *

474
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,514
- * Johnny Cash *
- * Johnny Cash

475
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,350
- * Johnny Cash
- * Johnny Cash

476
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,524
- How'd it go with the troopers?

477
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,260
- Ah, they said it'd be
a couple of weeks, so.

478
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,897
- But it went well, right?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

479
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:13,232
I mean,
it's basically a demotion.

480
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,734
So, I was expectin' it,
you know.

481
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,969
- Yeah, fuck you.
It's way better pay, man.

482
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,305
More important, it's your
fuckin' ticket outta here.

483
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,973
This shithole.

484
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,076
- Yeah, well,
here's all I know.

485
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,578
- Yeah, here's all
anybody knows, bub.

486
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,015
- Hey, look over there.

487
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,683
- Well, you know, if you hate it
so much,

488
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,518
why don't you fuckin' leave?

489
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,087
- I'm a felon with no skills.

490
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,757
Where the hell am I gonna go?

491
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,259
This way.

492
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:45,164
I was lookin' at this school
in Wyoming.

493
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,600
And they teach you
to cook in these Dutch ovens.

494
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,402
And it's kinda like
camp cooking, right?

495
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,670
But what's great about it,

496
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,841
it's 100% job placement
when you finish.

497
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,010
So, I figure, you know,
spend a year cooking,

498
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,713
just fishing trips,
hunting trips.

499
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:05,151
No one to answer to but a fire.
No consequences, but what?

500
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,754
A bad meal maybe, right?

501
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:10,222
- Well, you never
made one of those.

502
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,824
How's the pay?

503
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,560
- It's garbage,
but how much you need?

504
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,862
I don't need shit.

505
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,030
- Yeah,
but you're no cowboy, Mike.

506
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,066
I mean, no disrespect
to your cabin,

507
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,468
but you got runnin' water
and lights.

508
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:23,770
- Fuck you.
The only reason

509
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,272
why I don't do it?
Grizzlies, man.

510
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,874
Fuckin' grizzlies.

511
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,976
- Oh, you and the bears, man.
- Dude, all the fuckin' bears.

512
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:33,212
I know my fuckin' place
in the food chain, brother.

513
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:37,817
Yes, this is it.

514
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,921
- This is it?
- We did just do it, cut fence.

515
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,389
There's supposed to be
a rock here.

516
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,924
Hand me that.

517
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:48,360
A rock's on
the other side of this shit.

518
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,165
Oh, fuck, here it is.

519
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,236
There's a rock.

520
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,172
- Got it?
- Yep.

521
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,744
- Oh yeah.

522
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,889
- Two hundred grand
in the fuckin' ground.

523
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,960
There it is, son of a bitch.

524
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,899
All right.

525
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,002
I'm glad it's not
a fucking body.

526
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,506
- Well, I gotta say, Mike.
That was pretty anti-climactic.

527
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,242
- Yeah, that's how I like it.

528
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,045
Let's go home.

529
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:40,746
- Roger that.

530
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,922
- *

531
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:54,426
- SINGER: * Who could ever
take your place? *

532
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,765
* Oh, yeah

533
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,937
* Now I tried to tell ya,
baby *

534
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,840
* There ain't

535
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,377
* Nothin' we can do

536
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,914
* Cause I'm no good for you

537
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,986
- Let's go to the jungle room.

538
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,621
- You have to pay upfront.

539
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:26,158
A hundred fifty, three songs.

540
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,862
- I know the rules.
- I have to tell you.

541
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,565
Three songs.

542
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,937
I can be nude,
but you can't touch me.

543
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:43,142
Or you can touch me
and I keep my dress on.

544
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,747
- Which do you want?

545
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:52,251
- Touch me.

546
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,722
- Let's go.

547
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,460
- * Now, I tried
to tell ya, baby *

548
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:08,100
* There ain't
nothin' we can do *

549
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:12,504
- *

550
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,952
- * Is it my turn
to wish you were lying here? *

551
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:30,422
* I tend to dream you
when I'm not sleeping *

552
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,959
* Ooh

553
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:36,695
* Is it my turn
to totally understand? *

554
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:39,898
* To watch you
walk out of my life *

555
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,568
* And not do a damn thing

556
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,736
* Woah...

557
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,107
* So take every little
piece of my heart *

558
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,876
* Yeah...

559
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:54,913
* Take every little
piece of my soul *

560
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,882
* Yeah...

561
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,987
* Take every little bitty
piece of my mind *

562
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:06,392
- [both panting]

563
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,161
- *

564
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,832
- [breathing heavily]

565
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:19,105
- *

566
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,375
- * No, you're never
gonna get it *

567
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,543
* Ow

568
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:25,644
* Never, never gonna get it

569
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,013
* No, not this time

570
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,347
* No, you're
never gonna get it *

571
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,515
* My love

572
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,750
* Never, ever gonna get it

573
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,252
* No, you're
never gonna get it *

574
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:34,520
* Ow

575
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,687
* Never, never gonna get it

576
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,323
* Not this time

577
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,325
- That's it, I'm good.

578
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,396
I'm gonna see you again.

579
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,432
- Hey.

580
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:49,435
I don't want you to go.

581
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:52,338
- I gotta go.

582
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,842
- * Now you're talkin'
like you never changed *

583
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,744
* The more you talk

584
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,480
* The more things
sound the same *

585
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,948
* What makes you think

586
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:06,818
* You can just walk back
into her life? *

587
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,123
* We got a good thing

588
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,491
* I just sit back

589
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,328
* And watch you make
a fool of yourself *

590
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,999
- *

591
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,841
- All right,
I'm runnin' two sets.

592
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,443
The first set
will dissolve on its own.

593
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,080
And I'll take out
the top layer in 10 days.

594
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,315
- No concussion?
- No, I don't think so.

595
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,884
But if you feel any dizziness
or nausea,

596
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,353
I want you
to tell me immediately.

597
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,490
- You feel up to walking me
through what happened?

598
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:51,363
- Uh, yeah, he uh,

599
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,932
he's been giving me
a lot of lip for a while.

600
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,168
Nothin' that crossed the line,

601
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:59,238
but I instructed him
to enter his cell.

602
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:03,109
He stepped toward me.
Told me to make him.

603
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:06,745
I told him to step back.
He didn't.

604
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:10,015
I pushed him.
He grabbed me.

605
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,019
I don't know, maybe a headbutt.

606
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,122
It was all pretty nuts.

607
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,056
I managed to
retrieve my nightstick

608
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,293
and deliver a straight thrust
that stepped him back.

609
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,396
Struck him again.

610
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,266
He pulled me down.
I called out.

611
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,273
- Well, son, your first mistake
was allowing him into your space

612
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,243
and not calling for backup then.

613
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,212
We've all made our mistakes.

614
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:44,283
That club is a last resort.
What is your first resort?

615
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,386
- Pepper spray?
- Distance, son.

616
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:50,689
What kind of shape
is what's his name?

617
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,459
- Darryl Johnson, 2-6-4-0-7-5.

618
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:57,829
He's ah,
you know he assaulted a guard.

619
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,265
He got it pretty rough.

620
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,032
- He's en route
to Kingstown General.

621
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,202
We x-rayed him.
Two skull fractures,

622
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:06,205
multiple facial fractures
and lacerations.

623
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:08,106
He was stable when he left,
but brain swelling

624
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,642
is gonna be
the real hurdle here.

625
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,844
- Is Darryl affiliated?

626
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,246
- He's a Crip.

00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:17,048
- All right,
let's put Sam in a tower.

628
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,984
We'll look into Darryl's cell,

work some transfers.

You're gonna be

00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,456
for a while, son, a long while.

632
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:28,527
Now, it's not a punishment.
It's for your protection.

633

with all of the bondage
that's happening is really good.

644
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:06,758
- I know you from earlier,
from the mayor's office.

645
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,160
That's what I meant.

- I was there.

649
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:28,246
Why do they call him the mayor?

650
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,949
- Because he runs the city.

651
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,586
- I wonder what
the real mayor thinks of that.

652
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,222
- The real mayor knows it too.

Looks like the motherlode,

I gotta start my real shift
in an hour.

In SEAL training?

Oh my God, thank you.

And let's get you a coffee here.
How's that?

Finally, finally.

- Well, it should be
in the safe.

wanna steal from,

705

but that's between you and him.

What the hell, Bunny?

- And one of your guards
worked my boy good.

He on life support at General,
Mike.

anything about that, okay?

But we never
fuckin' break a deal.

Do you understand?
Never with anybody, ever.

What the fuck?
Maybe fuckin' decaf next time.

And we'll fix it.
But look at me.

The only way
this shit works for anyone

That way we can trust you, okay?

A fuckin' box.
That's my fuckin' cousin, Mike.

Those maniacs just tried

Ya know, gettin' this letter's

00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,041
She was raped, strangled

785
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,609
and this motherfucker's prints
are there too.

786
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,778
This guy should put up a goddamn
billboard, Mike.

787
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:48,346
I don't know.
I just know

788
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,816
that I'm not gonna be able to
hide the fuckin' link on this.

789
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,350
- Is it a secret there?

790
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,419
- Yeah, it's common knowledge
and it's public knowledge.

791
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,321
But if the state, feds, and the
fuckin' news pick up on this.

792
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:57,722
Mike, I just need you
to make sure

793
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,558
it just all stays with Mitch.
- Yep, yeah.

794
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,027
- Mike, you don't
need to see it.

795
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:03,461
All right.
You just don't need to see it.

796
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,196
It's not gonna fuckin' do
anything for you.

797
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,698
We got this fucker.
- I-I've gotta see it.

798
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,467
- We got this guy,
SWAT's at his house right now.

799
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,269
We're gonna fuckin' go there.
- It's my brother.

800
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,938
I gotta see it.
Just let me see it.

801
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:14,172
- All right,
don't touch anything.

802
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,173
- Fine.
- Everybody's watchin' on this.

803
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,775
- Fine.
- Let's make some room.

804
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:37,528

805
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,785
- [camera clicking]

806
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:05,656
- *

807
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,369
- I mean, how else
could it end?

808
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:53,905
For you too.

809
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,743
When you help these parasites.

810
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:03,581
You hold it together
for everyone else.

811
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,426
It's fuckin' inevitable.

812
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:22,833
Ya know, I always knew
that this would happen.

813
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:30,441
I just thought
it would happen to you.

814
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,626
- And so the United States Army

815
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:51,262
moved the Cherokee further west.

816
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,599
And this particular group,
some 1,600 people

817
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,568
were pushed to a new home
in a territory

818
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,738
that would become known
as Oklahoma.

819
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,375
Upon reaching the banks
of the Mississippi

820
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,145
where steamboats
would ferry them across,

821
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:09,347
a dilemma arose.

822
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:12,217
Every Cherokee family
keeps at least one dog,

823
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:15,420
sometimes two or three
to aid in hunting,

824
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,956
tracking game, protection,

825
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,392
but to the Cherokee a dog

826
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:24,529
is more than an aide
or a companion.

827
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:29,367
It is a spirit helper,
an ancestor,

828
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:33,338
a friend.

829
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,175
Well, the ferry captains
wouldn't allow the dogs

830
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:38,909
on board the boats,

831
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:44,415
so, they pushed off,
leaving 3,000 dogs

832
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:47,718
pacing the banks
of the Mississippi.

833
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,888
When the boat
was a hundred yards out,

834
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:53,324
almost in unison,

835
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,694
the dogs began howling in agony.

836
00:49:57,128 --> 00:50:01,366
The Cherokees started crying,
calling to the captains.

837
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:03,000
Turn back.

838
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,439
The dogs hearing the pleas
of their families howled louder

839
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:11,942
until one dog could stand
the separation no more

840
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,345
and leapt into the river.

841
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:18,883
Another dog followed
and another, and another.

842
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:22,787
And soon 3,000 dogs
were churning the waters,

843
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:27,692
fighting the current,
but the current was too strong.

844
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:32,763
And one by one, they began
to disappear under the waters.

845
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,934
Until there was
just one dog left.

846
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:41,839
Strong, unwavering,

847
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,877
the dog fought the current
and disappeared under the water

848
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,814
and then reappeared
further downstream.

849
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:55,019
The people screamed for him,
begging him to succeed.

850
00:50:56,954 --> 00:50:59,290
Until at last,

851
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:02,627
too tired and no strength left,

852
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:06,497
he disappeared into the waters
of the river.

853
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:10,801
And the people
fell to their knees and wept.

854
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,005
- [knock on door]

855
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:21,011

have a word with you outside?

No.
- He in there?

859
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,767
- Mike, you know how this works.
Come on, no way. No way.

860
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,570
- Where is he? Come on.
I need this.

861
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,072
Just give me this.
- Mike, it's not gonna happen.

862
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:51,942
Mike, there's no way.
- It's for Mitch.

863
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,078
- Mike, look, Mike.

864
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,547
- If he goes to prison,
I can't fuckin' touch him.

865
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,583
You understand that?
We don't work with the mafia.

866
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,151
That fucker's gonna
sit in prison with his feet up

867
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:03,188
for the rest of his fuckin' life
laughin' about this shit.

868
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:04,622
- He won't.

869
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:08,293
- Mike, I give you my word,
if he's alone in there,

870
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:11,061
he will never
get off that couch.

871
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,531
You hear me?
- Okay.

872
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,667
- Don't worry, Mike.

873
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,969
I do this shit for a livin',
brother.

874
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,240
Come on boys, let's go.
- We got ya.

876
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:52,603
- Here's what you will do.
Pick up the pistol.

877
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:56,106
Do it.

878
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,142
Come on, grab that gun.

879
00:52:58,142 --> 00:52:59,977
No, no, no, not by the barrel,
by the handle.

880
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:02,680
You've seen too many movies,

881
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:06,617
All right, good man.
Now point it toward the ceiling.

00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:09,454
Yeah.

883
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:14,925
And bring the muzzle down
slowly in my direction.

00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,927

- And who has the money?

- The police.

- Can you get it?

895
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,816
- Nope.

Now, listen to me.
They killed Milo's wife.

899
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,369
They found the map.

900
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:06,637
Then they killed
my fuckin' brother.

901
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,807
Mitch was off limits.
And you know it.

Everyone knew it.

If Milo wants to blame us
for this shit,

I'll have him killed in his cell
before midnight.

Everything my brother gave you,

00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,256

because you don't

943
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:17,641
make much money
that it's noble?

Mitch, God rest his soul.
How I loved him.

945
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:30,320
Was arrogant and lazy.
I know why he did it.

946
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:35,459
For the attention, the power.

947
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,795
But for the life of me,

948
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:40,898
I'll never understand
why you do it.

949
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:43,500
You hate it.

950
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:47,637
You hate this town.
You have no friends.

951
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:51,408
And all you've done
since you were a little boy

952
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:54,078
is dream of leaving.

953
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,915
And here you are.

954
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:01,718
- What am I supposed to do, Ma?

955
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,623
I don't know how to leave.

956
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:12,029
- Michael, you just go.

957
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,340

963
01:03:29,706 --> 01:03:32,609
- Hi, I was hoping
you could help me.

964
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:35,545
My daughter,
she's in the woman's prison

965
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,647
and she wasn't...

966
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,017
It doesn't matter.
She's in real trouble.

967
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:41,551
I told her to
talk to the guards,

968
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,954
but she said to come see you.

969
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:46,924
- You got the wrong guy, ma'am.

970
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:51,328
- Are you not the mayor?
- That was my brother.

971
01:03:52,897 --> 01:03:55,132
- I'm sorry to read that
in the newspaper.

972
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:56,934
- Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.

973
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:59,536
- My daughter,
she said to see you.

974
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,171
She said that
you're the mayor now.

975
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:04,408
- I'm sorry, but she's wrong.
She's wrong.

976
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:07,844
- But, then what do I do?

977
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,813
- I don't know.
- Sir,

978
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:12,749
you don't understand, sir.
Please.

979
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,652
I don't know
what they're gonna do to her.

980
01:04:16,053 --> 01:04:19,289
I don't know
what she will do to me.

981
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:25,595
- Mike, this isn't for you.
Okay? Let's go.

982
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:28,298
Let's go.
Come on, man.

983
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,970
Mike.

984
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:42,846
- What's her name?

985
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:50,454
- *

986
01:04:57,361 --> 01:05:00,364
- MALE ANNOUNCER: Next time,
on "Mayor of Kingstown."

987
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:02,432
- There's not one reason
for you to take this on.

988
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,368
- MIKE: [unintelligible]

989
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:05,602
A lot of them.

990
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,004
- Mitch wouldn't do
it that way, Mike.

991
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,372
It's a big risk.

992
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:09,673
- We had an arrangement
with your brother.

993
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,441
We're here to decide if
you would be interested

994
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:13,410
in being a paid informant.

995
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,744
- Mike, where you at?

996
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,613
You a friend of me or
are you friend of them?

997
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,784
- I used to be friends
with Ian and his brother.

998
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:24,054
Well, I guess Ian
sent someone else.

999
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:25,322
Where is Iris?
