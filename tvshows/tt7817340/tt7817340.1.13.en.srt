1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,548
- Previously on New Amsterdam.
<i>- His name was Muhammad.</i>

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:04,306
<i>He asked me to marry him.</i>

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,741
- Broke up?
- Brain aneurysm.

4
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:08,043
I still miss him.

5
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:09,276
I told you about the songs I'm writing,

6
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,377
well, I'd love to make a demo.

7
00:00:10,412 --> 00:00:11,879
I was wondering if you could...

8
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:13,113
Give you money?

9
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:15,049
Don't think it's a good idea.

10
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,885
I have plans with Ella.

11
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:20,854
- Ella?
- Thanks for introducing us.

12
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:24,458
I've been taking a little bit
more Adderall than prescribed.

13
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:28,862
I think that I need to report
an impaired physician.

14
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,169
Don't forget to go over the rib.

15
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,972
The vein, the artery,
and the nerve run under, okay?

16
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:15,860
What you got?

17
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,345
EMS notification,
diabetic coma on the way.

18
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,013
Ooh, sounds interesting.

19
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,582
I thought you had a VIP patient?

20
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:24,017
Ah, that's after my shift.
I've got time to take one more.

21
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:25,444
Of course you do.

22
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:29,907
Allison Medrano, 68-year-old
fishing boat captain

23
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:31,169
with Type II diabetes.

24
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,926
Rescued by Coast Guard, unconscious.

25
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,595
Finger stick blood sugar, 745.

26
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,897
She's received ten units
sub q times four,

27
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,132
but she's still unresponsive.

28
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,200
Found these in her pocket.

29
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:44,204
Diabetes meds prescribed by
a Dr. Jessica Medrano.

30
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,473
She's a primary care doctor here.

31
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,975
This could be her mom.

32
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,409
Let's page Max and Dr. Medrano,

33
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,645
and let's get her into Trauma One.

34

35
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:11,598
What are you doing?

36
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,160
Do you see that man?

37
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:18,163
He's my son.

38
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:21,909
And you hiding all the way
over here because...

39
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:23,477
If you believe two people are together

40
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,579
for the wrong reason,
it's your responsibility to...

41
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,514
Oh, no, no. See... no, no, nope, nope.

42
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,082
I'm gonna stop you right there.

43
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,984
See, as a rule, I don't do family drama.

44
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,020
So, if you wanna talk about that,

45
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:34,588
I recommend you talk to Iggy.

46
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,257
Iggy is busy all day,
and there is no family drama.

47
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:38,592
Then why are you hiding?

48
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,495
Because I need to see if my son is...

49
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,630
No, no. No family drama, man.

50
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:45,966
Look, my only advice for you:

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,601
stay out of your boy's dating life.

52
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,606
- Hey, you want a coffee, Vijay?
- Ooh.

53
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,511
Blood PH of 7.19.

54
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,046
Blood sugar still over 700.

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,681
Injecting ten more units of insulin.

56
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,351
- Mom.
- Hey.

57
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:05,875
Can I get some water?

58
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,688
Absolutely. Uh, Casey?

59
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,323
On it.

60
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,992
Ms. Medrano, you're at
New Amsterdam Hospital,

61
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,494
and I will be happy to answer
any questions you might have.

62
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,663
Where's my boat?

63
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,298
Except for that one.

64
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,566
I... I don't know what that means.

65
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,068
She's captain of a fishing boat.

66
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:22,569
Seriously?

67
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:25,239
What, you expecting
a peg leg and a parrot?

68
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:28,141
No, but, uh, that'd be cool.

69
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,177
I just didn't realize there
were any of you left

70
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,314
in New York City.

71
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:34,214
There's not.
Industry moved on; she didn't.

72
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:35,649
Huh.

73
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,551
Fishing boat captain in New York City,

74
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:40,320
that... that's a throwback.

75
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,023
- What an interesting job.
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,159
Excuse me.

77
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:50,530
He does that sometimes.

78
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:56,169
Nourishment Consultant,
Media Distribution Officer,

79
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,404
pneumatic tube repair?

80
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,572
What do these people even do?

81
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,173
Aren't you the Medical Director?

82
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,174
Aren't you supposed to know?

83
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,110
Oh.

84
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:04,411
Hello.

85
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,048
<i>Has anyone here ever met a Chiropodist?</i>

86
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,583
Of course you haven't,
because they don't exist.

87
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,052
But 100 years ago,
there was a whole department

88
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,254
full of 'em cutting people's toenails.

89
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:16,423
But the field evolved and Chiropody was

90
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,791
absorbed into Podiatry.

91
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,060
Chiropodists became obsolete.

92
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,095
Why are we talking about Chiropodists?

93
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,263
Because you're firing us?

94
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:25,032
No.

95
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:27,434
We're talking about
Chiropodists not just because

96
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,470
it's a really fun word to say,
but because I'm willing to bet

97
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,139
that right here, at New Amsterdam,

98
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:33,206
there are people here whose jobs

99
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:35,208
are obsolete, bogus, wasted.

100
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:37,210
Jobs that aren't really jobs at all.

101
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,379
But just because your job is obsolete,

102
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,315
doesn't mean you are.

103
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,283
- Wait, are you firing us?
- No.

104
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:46,053
I wanna find people whose
talents are being wasted

105
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:47,387
and give them meaningful work.

106
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,389
I wanna give them jobs that matter.

107
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:52,159
Every time a patient walks out our doors,

108
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:54,461
our people should feel like
they contributed to

109
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,662
that patient's success.

110
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:57,431
And no...

111
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,232
I am not firing anybody.

112
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,468
Every department is gonna
try this experiment,

113
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,570
just for one day, stop working.

114
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,673
Just sit there, stand there,
don't do anything.

115
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,475
And if nobody misses what you do

116
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,178
or needs you to do something
for one whole day,

117
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:13,113
then your job may be obsolete.

118
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,282
Clearly not talking about those people.

119
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:19,419
But if it is you, come to me.
I wanna find you a new job.

120
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:22,756
A job that inspires you,
a job that makes a difference,

121
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,259
a job that makes you an integral part of

122
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:28,295
New Amsterdam's mission.

123
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,269
Dr. Panthaki?

124
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,071
Dr. Sharpe.

125
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,273
Fancy meeting you here.

126
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:42,609
Yeah, well, no.

127
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,777
No?

128
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,445
I came here to see a patient,

129
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,847
and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.

130
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,103
I walked by your office,

131
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:50,784
but they said you were on
the floor, so here I am,

132
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:54,187
casually bumping into you,
accidentally on purpose.

133
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:55,655
I see.

134
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,291
I can also accidentally on purpose leave.

135
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:01,928
No, I'm glad that you decided
to stop by...

136
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,664
Accidentally on purpose.

137
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,202
And would you consider
joining me on an adventure?

138
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:10,637
An adventure?

139
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,738
It's a small adventure.

140
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,340
Do you like Radiohead?

141
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,641
Yes.

142
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,476
Love them.

143
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:18,745
Then we'll need to be on
a train from Penn Station

144
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,147
in a few hours.

145
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,149
Why? Where are we going?

146
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,817
Philadelphia.

147
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,152
So we'd be staying overnight?

148
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:29,122
We would be.

149
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,425
You know, yeah, no,

150
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,294
I can't do that right now... with you.

151
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,028
Okay.

152
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,599
I mean, I want to eventually, I'm just...

153
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:42,369
Helen, I'll make you a bootleg.

154
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,279
Well, I'm still not 100% sure
as to why Ms. Medrano

155
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,603
collapsed on the ship.

156
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:56,349
Did her blood sugar spike
before or after the fall?

157
00:06:56,384 --> 00:06:57,717
That's the million dollar question.

158
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,220
So, this must be some VIP
for you to drag me

159
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,755
all the way up here.

160
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,156
It is.

161
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:06,593
So, who's the patient?

162
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,863
You are.

163
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:19,547
Yeah... hey, uh, Dora...

164
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,686
Hold on.

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,456
I just wanna take in this
momentous occasion.

166
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,557
What occasion?

167
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:31,126
The day you chased after me.

168
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,628
I wanna remember everything:
what I was wearing,

169
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:34,863
where I was standing...

170
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:36,298
You haven't texted me.

171
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:37,548
- Nope.
- Or paged me.

172
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,767
Did you miss me?

173
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:39,963
Well, I just figured by now
people would...

174
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:42,163
People would admit that they
were getting paid to not work?

175
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:43,296
That's not exactly...

176
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,657
And that they would ask you for work,

177
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:46,443
when they could just keep on
doing nothing?

178
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:48,576
That's not really in
the spirit of what I'm trying...

179
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,645
If it was me, no way I'd tell you.

180
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,280
Max...

181
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:56,167
What's going on with, um, you know?

182
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,053
She's with Iggy.

183
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:04,519
I think I'm gonna be sick.

184
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:06,754
You did the right thing.

185
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:07,989
As a doctor, sure.

186
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,158
But as a friend, I absolutely did not.

187
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:14,996
You absolutely did,
as a doctor and as a friend.

188
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,708
All right.

189
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:28,509
Feel free to sit.

190
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,078
I'm fine.

191
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:32,814
Okay.

192
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:37,518
All right.

193
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:41,122
So, it says here you went to
Whitman College.

194
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:43,091
Yep.

195
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,884
All the way up in
Walla Walla, Washington, huh?

196
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,196
Did you like it?

197
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,554
Loved it.

198
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,931
Why there?

199
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:55,136
Well, I guess it's because
I thought that they would

200
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,939
prepare me for a career in
lifesaving medicine.

201
00:08:57,973 --> 00:08:59,974
One which I would love to
get back to right now,

202
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,275
unless you're gonna tell me
what this all about.

203
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:04,812
Okay.

204
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:08,049
Somebody reported that you have
a problem with Adderall.

205
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,619
Sharpe.

206
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:13,721
I'm not at liberty to discuss
that with you.

207
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,205
Please.

208
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,925
So, do you?

209
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,594
Do I what?

210
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:21,229
Do you have a problem with Adderall?

211
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:24,506
- No.
- Okay.

212
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:27,592
Do you have any idea why someone
would suggest that you do?

213
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:30,938
Look, I spoke to Sharpe about
a personal matter,

214
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:32,607
a minor personal matter,

215
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:35,510
and she has blown it way out of
proportion.

216
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:39,147
Right, well, can you tell me
about the personal matter?

217
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,815
No.

218
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:43,685
Why not?

219
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:45,286
Because it's personal.

220
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,755
And because quite frankly,
this whole ambush

221
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,157
is unbelievably insulting,

222
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:50,958
and I'm done pretending like it isn't.

223
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,593
I wouldn't do that.

224
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,868
I have been empowered by
the hospital to determine

225
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:03,104
if you've been operating
as an impaired physician.

226
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,975
And if you have a problem with Adderall,

227
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,610
I will tell Max and he'll
report it to the medical board.

228
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:15,056
So, what, if I leave, I'm suspended?

229
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:19,020
No, if you leave, you're fired.

230
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:25,827
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Dr. Goodwin.

231
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,962
- I need a consult.
- What's the case?

232
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:30,565
Allison Medrano, let's just call
her a "non-compliant diabetic."

233
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,133
Hemoglobin A1C off the chart?

234
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,668
Yeah, and I wanna make sure
her collapse wasn't due to

235
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:35,036
a silent heart attack.

236
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,204
Okay, I'll stop by after the rounds.

237
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,462
- Thank you.
- Oh, by the way,

238
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:38,675
heard about your speech this morning.

239
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,277
You got someone for me
in your department?

240
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,243
No, everyone in
my department's on overdrive.

241
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,745
But did you know there's a guy
in the basement

242
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,747
- who still prints X-rays?
- X-rays...

243
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:47,248
went digital a decade ago.

244
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:49,884
Well, that's why you should check on him.

245
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,092
Hello?

246
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,061
Need an X-ray?

247
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:01,696
Does that thing still work?

248
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,265
What, the XR-180? Oh, yeah.

249
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:07,025
And I like to keep it
nice and shiny, just in case.

250
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,270
When was the last time someone ordered

251
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:11,196
an old-fashioned X-ray from you?

252
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,010
Uh, 2008... give or take.

253
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:20,681
So, you just been down here since 2008?

254
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,833
Doing what?

255
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:28,022
- Am I about to get fired?
- Do you like your job?

256
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:30,925
Um, I used to.

257
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,961
I loved it, actually.
Everybody needed me.

258
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,863
Docs used to say nobody handled

259
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:38,099
radiograph paper better than I did.

260
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,101
I'm Max Goodwin,
I'm the Medical Director here.

261
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:43,137
Aw, nuts. I am gonna get fired.

262
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:46,274
No, no, I'd liked to find you a new job.

263
00:11:46,308 --> 00:11:49,877
A job that makes you feel needed again.

264
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,312
Would you be interested?

265
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,696
It's like you can see right through me.

266
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:58,219
- It's an X-ray joke.
- X-ray joke.

267
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,421
It's great. So what do you say?

268
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:03,458
You know, with technology
being what it is

269
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,793
and me being as old as I am,

270
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:10,164
I think I'm just gonna
ride it out until retirement.

271
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:11,399
I mean,

272
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,346
if you're not firing me.

273
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,303
Rohan.

274
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,907
Pappa.

275
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:21,242
You came all the way down here

276
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:23,344
and won't say nothing to your father?

277
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:25,012
I didn't wanna bother you.

278
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:27,448
Bother? No, no.

279
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:30,852
I wanna apologize to you, beta.

280
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:32,193
For what?

281
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:35,756
I know I've hurt your feelings before,

282
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:39,126
when I refused to support your music.

283
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,128
I should have been
more supportive of you.

284
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:47,041
That doesn't mean that you use
Ella to get back at me.

285
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,036
What?

286
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:50,371
Yeah, she doesn't need to be dragged into

287
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:51,772
our family business.

288
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:53,040
Is that what you think is going on?

289
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:54,108
That I'm using her?

290
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:56,110
I am trying to protect her.

291
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,879
Excuse me.

292
00:12:57,913 --> 00:13:00,047
I'm hanging out with Ella
because I actually like her,

293
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:01,849
not that it's any of your business.

294
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:03,284
I think you are misunderstanding me.

295
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,286
No, I'm understanding you just fine.

296
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:09,957
And I know it's hard for you
to comprehend, Pappa,

297
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,493
but the reason I could stay
sober for a year

298
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:16,063
was that I didn't have to deal with this.

299
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:17,207
I...

300
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,101
I didn't have to deal with you.

301
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:36,217
Jessica, you should move back
to Sheepshead Bay.

302
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,220
Mom, I'd love to, but my job is here.

303
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:41,556
You know, most parents would be
proud their kid's a doctor.

304
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,092
Well, there's something
to be said about tradition.

305
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,161
Our family has a tradition...

306
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:50,131
Of diabetes, heart disease,
and lung cancer.

307
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,267
People gotta die of something.

308
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:56,537
Allison Medrano,
I need you to get back inside.

309
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:57,939
Who the hell are you?

310
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:00,241
- Your doctor.
- Since when?

311
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:04,111
Well, since you had to be
evaluated for heart disease.

312
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:05,711
- Dr. Medrano.
- Dr. Reynolds,

313
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,348
thank you for taking care of my mom.

314
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:09,116
I don't need taking care of.

315
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,551
We're gonna do a full work-up,

316
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:13,020
but I need you to get back
inside first, all right?

317
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:15,356
Yeah, yeah.

318
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,457
- Mom.
- Jeez...

319
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,528
Mom!

320
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,129
Hold on. Hold on.

321
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:23,397
I need a stretcher out here!

322
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:24,865
Okay.

323
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:36,143
You get what's ironic about this.

324
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:38,446
No. Help me out.

325
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,248
I have a prescription for Adderall.

326
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:42,583
I mean, the risk would be

327
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:45,219
in me not taking my medication.

328
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,122
You know, I'd be, like, mid-appendectomy

329
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:49,924
getting distracted by how the appendix

330
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,541
looks like a giant shrimp.

331
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,129
So, you find it ironic
that you've been placed

332
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:57,431
in jeopardy by a tool that
helps you succeed?

333
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,132
No. No, I find it ironic

334
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,634
that I'm being persecuted by

335
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,836
a psychiatrist for taking a medication

336
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,404
prescribed by a psychiatrist.

337
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,343
That was harsh; I know
you're not persecuting me.

338
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,012
It's okay. It's fine.

339
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,312
It's just...

340
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,349
I've got ADHD.

341
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:19,919
I've taken Adderall,
as prescribed, since I was 12.

342
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:21,454
It's a non-issue.

343
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,289
Yeah.

344
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:25,425
And you've never taken more
than your prescribed dose?

345
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,463
I'm sure I have doubled up
by accident, okay?

346
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:34,792
Double shifts, the days,
they can just run in together.

347
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,138
But you've never taken it
just to, you know,

348
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,139
just to get through the day?

349
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,140
No.

350
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,757
Hard no.

351
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:44,844
You sure about that?

352
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,114
You can't run an ED
propped up on pills, okay?

353
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,141
It's unethical and I wouldn't do it.

354
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:53,486
So, your drug use has never
led to the harm of a patient?

355
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:55,488
Oh, you know what? I've killed thousands.

356
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:58,124
I just... I get high and I start
stabbing people

357
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,525
with my scalpel.

358
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,362
This isn't personal, Bloom.
I'm not trying to insult you.

359
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,197
You're asking me if I've ever

360
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,332
risked a patient's life
because I'm stoned.

361
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,368
Yeah, and you haven't
answered the question.

362
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:11,638
Because if I had,
we wouldn't be here right now.

363
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,140
I would have turned in my license, okay?

364
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:21,114
No, I have never harmed
a patient because of Adderall.

365
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,693
Do you remember LaDavius Powell?

366
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,940
LaDavius Powell? That ring a bell?

367
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,267
It's a patient of yours that came in,

368
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:43,103
allergic to Cephilicam.

369
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:45,105
You prescribed it anyway.

370
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,506
If your nurse hadn't have
caught the mistake...

371
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,509
No, that's not the whole story, so...

372
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,177
No?

373
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,721
Earlier you assumed

374
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,423
that it was one single doctor

375
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:06,092
that voiced concern. That's not the case.

376
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:11,347
Multiple people have complained
that you're having problems.

377
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:15,235
You're making mistakes on
your patient reports.

378
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,771
Your reaction time has slipped.
Your behavior has been erratic.

379
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,108
And this mistake you made
with LaDavius Powell could have

380
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:24,344
very easily cost him his life.

381
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,784
And now you've sat there
and looked me in the eyes,

382
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:32,052
and you've lied to me about it.

383
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,124
What part of the story am I missing?

384
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,592
What have I got wrong?

385
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:45,214
You said, in your own words,

386
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,636
if your drug use ever led to
the harm of a patient,

387
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,805
you would turn in your license.

388
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,078
So what are you waiting for?

389
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,516
<i>Dr. Hayek to pediatrics.</i>

390
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,218
<i>Dr. Hayek to pediatrics.</i>

391
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,453
It's okay. I've got this.

392
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,088
Right.

393
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,126
Oh, boy, she was smoking,

394
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,561
collapsed with a blood sugar of over 700.

395
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,302
It took 100 units of insulin
to bring her back.

396
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:21,688
So, it's the high blood sugar.

397
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,586
Well, we still don't know
why it keeps spiking.

398
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,270
What if it's the smoking?

399
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,593
Yeah, smoking's bad for you.

400
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:31,894
What if she has a carcinoid tumor

401
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,653
that's being stimulated by nicotine?

402
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:36,112
Just now when she collapsed,
she was smoking.

403
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:38,726
On the boat when she collapsed,
she was smoking.

404
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:40,810
What if the nicotine from
the cigarettes is

405
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:42,278
squeezing the tumor, making it kick out

406
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,437
huge amounts of glucagon,
and that is what is driving

407
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,783
the blood sugar through the roof?

408
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:49,093
Well, I did a CT on Al's abdomen
and her chest and no tumor.

409
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,120
But all of her symptoms point to it.

410
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:52,889
Except it's not there.

411
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,783
So do exploratory surgery and find it.

412
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,793
Who does exploratory surgery anymore?

413
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:01,457
We do when we know something's wrong.

414
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:06,055
Mr. Harris...

415
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,515
Uh, you're from
the Med Co-Op Group, right?

416
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,132
Actually, I'm just... uh,

417
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,909
I've been here for nine years.

418
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,310
I kept you waiting that long?

419
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:18,114
No. I heard your speech today.

420
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:21,117
I think I've got one of those
obsolete jobs.

421
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:25,848
So, uh, what's your job?

422
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,140
- To sit there.
- Ah.

423
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:28,758
Before the arm showed up,

424
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,326
I sat in a booth and checked badges.

425
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,195
I was the guy you said good morning to,

426
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,263
asked about the traffic
down from Westchester.

427
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,799
Always packed on the FDR,
no matter what time of day.

428
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:40,036
But go down 2nd Ave before
7:00 a.m., not so bad.

429
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,217
Good to know.

430
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:44,040
But since the arm,
people don't even notice me.

431
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:46,676
And I wanna do more than
just sit in a chair all day.

432
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,177
I <i>know</i> I can do more.

433
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,947
See, you're exactly who I'm looking for.

434
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,315
Uh... Oh, Dr. Goodwin...

435
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,501
No, you are the reason
I started this search.

436
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,808
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

437
00:19:55,842 --> 00:19:57,787
- You're in her way.
- Oh, sorry.

438
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,121
So what's my new job gonna be?

439
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,290
I have no idea.

440
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:15,448
So now what?

441
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:18,774
Well, now I'd like to hear
about your life before

442
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,409
your Adderall use began.

443
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:26,949
Are you seriously asking me
to talk about my childhood?

444
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:30,045
Or I could just file my report right now.

445
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:36,225
Fine.

446
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,333
Well, my mom was a disaster,
my sister, worse,

447
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,202
and my dad was a saint.

448
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:47,772
There ya go.

449
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:50,339
There you go.

450
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,613
Okay, well, how was your mom a disaster?

451
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:03,285
She was an alcoholic.

452
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:06,791
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:08,991
Yeah, well,

454
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,492
boo-hoo, right?

455
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,049
She was, uh...

456
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,201
She was a part of this... this tacky

457
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,806
nouveau riche Upper East Side crowd.

458
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,840
Everybody knew she drank.

459
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:29,445
But it didn't matter,
'cause Jeanie was so fun.

460
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,048
Her parties were fabulous.

461
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,818
Yeah, but then the party ended, right?

462
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:36,862
Yeah.

463
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,155
That it did.

464
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,745
Then she'd start complaining...

465
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:50,751
About how Mr. Benson
wouldn't flirt with her,

466
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,970
or the Dover sole was dry,
always something.

467
00:21:57,874 --> 00:21:59,301
And she'd get mean.

468
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,978
- Was there physical abuse?
- No.

469
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:09,972
Would she get sick after she drank?

470
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,400
Yeah?

471
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,059
Who'd take her to bed? Who'd clean up?

472
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:19,947
That'd be me.

473
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:23,265
What about your sister, she help?

474
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,869
I didn't need help.

475
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:28,370
Someone had to clean her up,
so I cleaned her up.

476
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,792
How old were you
the first time that happened?

477
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:34,944
I don't know.

478
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,345
Ballpark.

479
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:43,025
- Seven, maybe.
- Wow.

480
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:45,988
You've been taking care of
people long before

481
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:47,856
you became an ED doctor, huh?

482
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,561
Yeah.

483
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:54,897
Well, that's the silver lining of having

484
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,932
Hurricane Jeanie for a mom.

485
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:00,821
You learn how to be good in a crisis.

486
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:03,205
Yeah, I bet.

487
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:12,081
Sounds like your dad left you
in quite a tricky situation.

488
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,484
I didn't say that.

489
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,186
No?

490
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,121
You didn't say much about him at all.

491
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:22,424
My dad... my dad took

492
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:25,961
a two-bit dermatology practice
and he turned it into

493
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:27,681
a million dollar business.

494
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,432
That's amazing.

495
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:32,353
Yeah, he was gone a lot,

496
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,039
but when I called, he always answered.

497
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:38,974
Every time.

498
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:43,012
So, uh, you can dial back
the Freudian horse-crap, okay?

499
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,947
There's nothing Freudian about saying

500
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:46,325
that he neglected you.

501
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,018
He was amazing dad.

502
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:52,831
He wasn't the alcoholic.

503
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:56,458
He wasn't the one pissing on the carpet.

504
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:58,527
He wasn't the one vomiting on himself.

505
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:01,497
No, he was the one who left
a second-grader alone

506
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:02,925
to deal with it.

507
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,035
Because he knew what you already told me:

508
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,103
someone always has to clean it up.

509
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,208
You just described him as
an emotionally-closed off

510
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,011
workaholic who was in
complete denial that

511
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,180
his personal life was on fire.

512
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,384
Who does that sound like?

513
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:35,886
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Yeah?

514
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,731
I've been emailing the powers
that be at New Amsterdamear.

515
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:39,153
About my useless job for years.

516
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:40,687
And nothing, no response.

517
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:42,122
I don't even feel bad about
taking a paycheck

518
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:43,890
for doing nothing anymore,
but you should know that

519
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:45,358
because I tried to contact someone,

520
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,127
New Amsterdam legally
can't take that money back.

521
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:48,928
I wouldn't even try,
but what's your obsolete job?

522
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:50,296
- Tech.
- Cool.

523
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:51,370
- In the accounting department.
- Ah.

524
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:53,172
Whenever FlashPay has any
kind of software update,

525
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:54,793
it's my job to install it on
every single computer

526
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,844
throughout the whole hospital.

527
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:57,152
That sounds like a very important job.

528
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:58,553
It was five years ago,

529
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:59,988
when New Amsterdam still used FlashPay.

530
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:01,890
Now only one person in
the whole hospital uses it.

531
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:03,224
Who's that?

532
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:04,659
Me, when I update it on
all the computers.

533
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,406
- I'll find you a new job.
- Great.

534
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:08,830
- So, what'll that be?
- No idea.

535
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,701
Systolic 140; pulse ox 97.

536
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,145
- Popcorn on a stick.
- Lap sponge.

537
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:21,906
Wet wrap the whole tip.

538
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,441
You see anything?

539
00:25:25,043 --> 00:25:26,343
Nothing.

540
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:28,145
We visualized the entire abdomen.

541
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,413
Yeah.

542
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:31,726
I can't believe we let
Dr. Goodwin talk us into this.

543
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,852
He thought a carcinoid tumor
fit all her symptoms.

544
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:37,421
Well, he was wrong.

545
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:40,257
Fresh ESU pencil on the tray.

546
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,065
I'm gonna run the bowel.

547
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:46,197
- All 23 feet of it?
- Yep.

548
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,333
Then you're crazier than he is.

549
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:00,482
- Hey, man of the hour.
- I...

550
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:02,279
Your son is the sweetest,

551
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:03,481
We have been having the best time.

552
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:06,183
We're gonna go to Battery Park tonight.

553
00:26:06,218 --> 00:26:07,716
Yes...

554
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,187
About Rohan...

555
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:15,292
It appears I may have hurt
my son's feelings this morning.

556
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:17,294
Oh.

557
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:21,065
Unintentionally, of course,
but I wanted to clear things up

558
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,040
before you heard his side of the story.

559
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:24,303
There are sides?

560
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:30,241
Not exactly, it's just I was
looking out for you, you see?

561
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:34,145
Uh trying to... protect you.

562
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,578
Why would I need protecting?

563
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:42,186
I was concerned that my son
had taken an interest in you

564
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,129
simply to... to hurt me.

565
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,572
Why would you think that?

566
00:26:52,597 --> 00:26:55,222
Because of a disagreement we had.

567
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:58,903
Or because you don't think
your son could be interested in

568
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:00,204
someone like me?

569
00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:02,006
Oh, well, no, I... I just...

570
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,908
Because you actually thought
the only reason Rohan

571
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:05,376
would ever be interested in me

572
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,077
is if he was using me to get back at you?

573
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:09,046
No, that's not what I meant.

574
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,182
Well, you must have meant it
on some level

575
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,017
or you wouldn't have said it.

576
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:14,285
I fear there has been

577
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,853
a profound misunderstanding here...

578
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:19,456
No, I think I heard you loud and clear.

579
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:21,625
Hi, welcome to Pain de Vie. Excuse me.

580
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,562
Hi, um, I'll get a small latte.

581
00:27:24,596 --> 00:27:27,865
- Sure, is whole milk okay?
- Yeah.

582
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,668
And can I get two muffins?

583
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:39,766
You know this is why no one
likes therapists.

584
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,646
You're taking my life and you're...

585
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:44,548
You're twisting it around.

586
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:47,585
Okay, well, then help me out.
Tell me a different story.

587
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,286
Help me understand.

588
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:51,222
All right, how 'bout this?

589
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:55,059
Dad saved himself from
an impossible situation.

590
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:57,294
No, he was not perfect,

591
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:59,745
but I never doubted that he loved me.

592
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:02,166
So you can come at me all day,

593
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,935
but I'm not blaming him for my mistakes.

594
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,637
I'm not blaming him for
your mistakes, either.

595
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:09,273
He did the best he could
for as long as he could.

596
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,626
Did you hear me? I'm not
blaming him for your mistakes.

597
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:14,078
Okay, so why the hell are we
still talking about this?

598
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,446
Because you went to Whitman College

599
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,181
in Walla Walla, Washington.

600
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:18,682
You literally could have gone
anywhere else,

601
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:21,058
but you went all the way
across the country.

602
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:24,421
Family psychological histories
are a lot like genetic ones,

603
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:26,357
and you have the gene for running.

604
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:28,065
So I'm asking you...

605
00:28:29,394 --> 00:28:31,095
What are you running from?

606
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:44,414
You're right. I'm like my dad.

607
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,708
We both ran.

608
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:50,295
And yeah, he was running from my mom.

609
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:55,586
But I am not running from,
I am running to.

610
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:59,679
I'm an ED doctor.

611
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:02,293
I run to crisis.

612
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:05,162
I mean, I run to help people.

613
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:06,563
And yeah, you know what?

614
00:29:06,598 --> 00:29:08,565
My childhood, it sucked.

615
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:10,467
But it made me who I am.

616
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:14,338
And this hospital is lucky to have me.

617
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:25,249
Okay.

618
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,518
Thank you for that.

619
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:35,693
Do you think you can get
your Adderall under control?

620
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,729
Yes.

621
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:40,531
And do you think that practicing medicine

622
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:42,366
is the best thing for your recovery?

623
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:45,892
I know it is.

624
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,694
Okay then.

625
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:58,521
Get back out there.

626
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:02,868
You're clear.

627
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,055
Go show 'em how it's done.

628
00:30:36,421 --> 00:30:37,621
Lauren?

629
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:44,261
Lauren.

630
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:49,199
I didn't know what else to do.

631
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:55,439
No problem.

632
00:30:55,473 --> 00:30:57,141
I was cleared.

633
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:08,975
Clevidipine infusion rate:
1 milligram per hour.

634
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,042
Balfour retractor standing by.

635
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:14,511
She is so stubborn.

636
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,755
Show me a kid who doesn't think
their parents are stubborn.

637
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,050
She's overweight, diabetic,
and spends most of her time

638
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:22,553
chain-smoking, eating
fried foods, and drinking.

639
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:25,356
And she has no intention
of ever changing.

640
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,524
That's problematic.

641
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:30,080
That's a recipe for disaster.

642
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:34,231
I'm the only one telling her to stop.

643
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:36,734
The rest of her buddies
out in Sheepshead Bay,

644
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:38,630
they all have the same bad habits.

645
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:41,205
Maybe they all need a little attention.

646
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:43,140
They need a swift kick in the pants.

647
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:49,600
You know, I got out there often as I can,

648
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,060
prescribe them what they need,
but it's just...

649
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,647
It's not enough.

650
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:57,857
Found it.

651
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:02,934
Yeah, I can feel an abnormal
nodule right here.

652
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,629
I'm gonna cut it out,
send it to pathology.

653
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:10,501
Is it crazy I'm happy
Dr. Reynolds found a tumor

654
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:11,635
in my mom's bowel?

655
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:13,665
No, you're not crazy.

656
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:17,408
Come with me, you gave me an idea.

657
00:32:23,782 --> 00:32:25,989
- Thank you all for coming.
- He is canning us.

658
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:27,083
Hmm?

659
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:28,223
It's just like that scene in "Goodfellas"

660
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:29,769
when they tell Joe Pesci
he's gonna get made

661
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:31,059
and he's all excited and dressed up,

662
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:32,352
and then he goes in the room, and whack!

663
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:35,759
- They whack him.
- I am not whacking you.

664
00:32:35,794 --> 00:32:38,529
I'm hiring you, all of you.

665
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:40,631
We're opening a new clinic
in Sheepshead Bay.

666
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:42,800
And since you're all on payroll already,

667
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:45,337
this will actually be the first
profitable thing I've done.

668
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:46,470
Sheepshead Bay?

669
00:32:46,504 --> 00:32:48,090
New Amsterdam runs satellite clinics

670
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:50,062
all over the city,
but we've neglected this part

671
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,642
of Brooklyn and the people
who live there,

672
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:54,478
and that ends today with your help.

673
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:56,680
Sounds great, but I'm kinda over

674
00:32:56,714 --> 00:32:58,816
the parking attendant thing.

675
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,485
Good, because you'll be
running our reception area.

676
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,363
Greeting people,
making sure they feel at ease.

677
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:05,489
That I can do.

678
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:07,973
Anna, you'll be installing
our new computer systems.

679
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,107
- Linux or DOS?
- No idea.

680
00:33:10,142 --> 00:33:12,830
And Jessica, you'll be
caring for the community

681
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:14,832
who raised you and who needs you now.

682
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:17,201
Thank you, Max.

683
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:19,636
Hello? I hope I'm not too late.

684
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:23,207
Everyone, meet our new
radiology department.

685
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,190
You're gonna need the suture kit.

686
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:42,526
Yeah.

687
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:41,229
Ask me again.

688
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,694
What are you running from?

689
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,335
I told my mom that I was going to NYU.

690
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:07,811
That I'd be here in town, close by.

691
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:13,136
Dad had died the year before,
and things had gotten...

692
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,901
I didn't even tell her that
I applied to Whitman.

693
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:21,759
I didn't tell Vanessa, my sister.

694
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:26,357
And I knew...

695
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:33,369
I knew that they wouldn't be
okay without me.

696
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:36,785
I mean, I protected Vanessa.

697
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:40,580
She thought I was a rock star.

698
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:43,458
But she was 12...

699
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:48,752
I mean, I couldn't... I couldn't
take her with me.

700
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,758
I wanted to,

701
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:55,092
but I knew if I didn't go...

702
00:35:56,627 --> 00:35:58,561
Then I was never gonna get out.

703
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:08,158
One night, I... I tucked her up in bed...

704
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,144
And I left.

705
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,074
I, um...

706
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:19,783
I left my little sister.

707
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:27,357
She's in rehab now, again.

708
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:28,592
Fourth time.

709
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,527
That is not on you.

710
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,806
I could have saved her, you know?

711
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,575
I mean, I could have saved my mom.

712
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:37,009
You were a kid, that is not your job.

713
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:38,175
Then whose was it?

714
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:42,481
I mean, I was all they had,
and then I just... I just left.

715
00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:45,478
Listen to me.

716
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:48,454
There are people all over the world

717
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:50,108
with families just like yours.

718
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:52,110
All over the world.

719
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:55,780
And many of them, most of them,

720
00:36:56,463 --> 00:36:58,331
they never get out.

721
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,035
You saved the only person
that you could save.

722
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,804
You did not fail.

723
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:07,625
What you did was an act of
incredible strength.

724
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:12,922
I don't feel strong.

725
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,652
You only have to be strong
enough to do one more thing.

726
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:29,063
I need help.

727
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,697
Okay.

728
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:35,427
We can do that.

729
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:36,919
Okay?

730
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,708
Were you, uh,

731
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:44,877
were you really clearing me
to go back to work?

732
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:48,614
And let a drug addict loose in the ED?

733
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:50,829
God, no.

734
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,795
You kidding me?

735
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:22,575
Hey.

736
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:25,078
Hey.

737
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:29,165
I wasn't expecting to see you.

738
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:31,891
Because I cut you off at the knees?

739
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:35,728
I came on too strong.
It's a personality defect.

740
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:38,764
No, you didn't, and it's not.

741
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:42,568
It was spontaneous and fun

742
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:44,904
and completely lovely.

743
00:38:46,573 --> 00:38:50,442
And that's what made it
utterly terrifying for me.

744
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:57,817
I haven't wanted to take
a chance on something...

745
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:01,787
um, on someone in a really long time.

746
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:05,491
I mean, I used to be
a person who took chances,

747
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:06,992
and I really wanna be that person again.

748
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,247
You don't have to explain.

749
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,895
No, I want to.

750
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,931
You make me want to.

751
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:17,603
I... I have baggage.

752
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:21,926
And it comes with me wherever I go.

753
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:28,641
And to be honest, I'm so tired
of dragging it around with me.

754
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:32,895
Is that an overnight bag?

755
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,981
Yes.

756
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:38,624
I have literally brought
my baggage with me.

757
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:42,194
But only 'cause there's

758
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:44,063
a Radiohead concert in Philadelphia.

759
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:47,493
Any interest in going with me?

760
00:39:57,544 --> 00:40:01,544
Of all the windows in all the
hallways in this hospital,

761
00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:03,649
you had to stand in front of mine.

762
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:06,218
Get your own window.

763
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:08,608
I needed your advice today, my friend,

764
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:11,991
but you were busy.

765
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:14,160
Yeah, I mean, that happens sometimes.

766
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,665
As a result, I managed to lose

767
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,194
my only friend

768
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:24,203
and my only son.

769
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:26,812
I'm sure it's not that bad.

770
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,244
It is that bad.

771
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,288
Oh.

772
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,214
Okay, sorry.

773
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,719
So what do I do now?

774
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:47,726
Iggy, I need you to help me.

775
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:51,682
Okay.

776
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,712
How's the VIP?

777
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:10,749
Not feeling very important.

778
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:13,719
Well, you are,

779
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:16,856
to me, to everyone.

780
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:24,663
It's gonna be hard,
but... when you make it...

781
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:27,593
Your job's gonna be right here
waiting for you.

782
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:32,705
My job means everything to me, Max.

783
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:36,673
I know the feeling.
