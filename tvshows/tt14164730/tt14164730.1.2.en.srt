James Lindsay, huh?

00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,628
Jim.

8
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,635
- Shame on you!
- Thank you, everyone.

9
00:00:18,677 --> 00:00:21,388
Gonna need a new knife
and a big-ass gun.

10
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,556
All right.

11
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:23,682
No body, no pattern,

12
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:24,850
no case.

13
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,476
You're not from around here.

14
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:28,228
Taking the first bus out
tomorrow.

15

A-Are you Dexter Morgan?

00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,481
- Harrison.
- <i>You can't.</i>

17

Jim.

21

My dad, he is gonna rain down

22
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,543
a world of pain on you, man!

23
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,169

You got big.

33
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,753
Happens.

34
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,260
If you're cold,
I can put some more wood on.

35
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,428
I'm fine.

36
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,308
You hungry?

37
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,770
I could whip up
some blueberry pancakes.

38
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,229
You used to love those.

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,150
Yeah, I'm not five anymore.

40
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,154
Maybe a sandwich.

41
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,199
One sandwich, coming right up.

42
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,519
Must've been a long trip.

43
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,897
Yeah.

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,993
Yeah, we got second place

45
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,120
at the Harvest Fest Tournament
last year.

46
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:53,623
Cool.

47
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,645
So...

48
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,025
You're not dead.

49
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,610
<i>He's owed an explanation.</i>

50
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:29,659
<i>But the only one
is that his father is a monster.</i>

51
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,036
I'm sure this is hard.

52
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,162
This?

53
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,329
No.

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,044
Growing up without a dad,
that was hard.

55
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,671
And opening up that letter,

56
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:46,051
finding out you let me believe
you were dead all those years...

57
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,219
that was brutal.

58
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,764
- Hannah showed you the letter?
- No.

59
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:53,016
I found it when she died.

60
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:54,893
Hannah died?

61
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,396
How?

62
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,148
Cancer.

63
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,108
Pancreatic.

64
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:09,949
I didn't know.

65
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,243
When did she die?

66
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,578
Three years ago.

67
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:15,413
What happened to you?

68
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,831
Where have you been?

69
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,085
A social worker
put me on a plane

70
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,337
from Buenos Aires to Miami.

71
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:26,341
I bounced around a bunch
of shitty foster homes.

72
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,717
No one wants a teenager.

73
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,845
And finally I decided
to find you.

74
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,891
Mm.

75
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,769
The return address
got me that town in Oregon.

76
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,562
And I found where you worked.

77
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:41,231
Also found that you'd left.

78
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,733
That's when it got
a little harder

79
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:46,027
to track down Jim Lindsay.

80
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,780
You know how many Jim Lindsays
there are on the Internet?

81
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,782
<i>It's kind of the point.</i>

82
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,952
Then I found
a shot of you on Instagram.

83
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,122
Pictures don't lie.

84
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,290
Some Fred guy
on some bowling team...

85
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,335
bragging on you bowling a 300.

86
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,004
Right here in Iron Lake.

87
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,510
So why all this Jim bullshit?

88
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:12,679
What happened to Dexter Morgan?

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,264
<i>He killed dozens of people,</i>

90
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:16,975
<i>got your mother
and your aunt killed, too.</i>

91
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,811
It's not who I am anymore.

92
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,940
Dexter had to die.

93
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:25,984
What are you talking about?

94
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,987
It's a long story.

95
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,408
We should get some rest,

96
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,451
and I'll tell you everything
in the morning.

97
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:36,828
I promise.

98
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,290
Uh, you want my room?
I can take the couch.

99
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,624
The couch is fine.

100
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,001
Well, if you need
anything else...

101
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,752
Where's the bathroom?

102
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,921
Stop.

103
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,883
You're not listening!

104
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,886
I need him here.

105
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,721
It'll keep me
from killing again.

106
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,850
You selfish psycho.

107
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:47,232
You emotionally handicapped,
crazy fuck.

108
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:52,070
If by some goddamn miracle
you don't end up killing him,

109
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,241
you will sure as shit
fuck him up.

110
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,811
<i>I'm not gonna fuck him up.</i>

111
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,870
Let's get back
to the daily routine.

112
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,243
<i>This is what happens</i>

113
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,829
<i>when I give in
to my dark passenger.</i>

114
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,997
<i>But I can fix this.</i>

115
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,089
<i>Teenagers sleep till noon,
right?</i>

116
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:24,699
<i>Well, this is one storm of fuck.</i>

117
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,345
Matt Caldwell disappeared in
the woods near here last night.

118
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:47,472
Oh.

119
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,973
That's not good.

120
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,642
Your place is close to
all the public hunting grounds,

121
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,688
so I was hoping we could set up
base camp for the search here.

122
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,856
Yeah. Of course.

123
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,317
- Whatever you need.
- Don't worry, Jimmy.

124
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,402
Dude probably got wasted
and skipped the hunt.

125
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:02,987
We'll get a call he's
sleeping it off in some motel

126
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,447
and be out of here by lunch.

127
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,490
Or he could be out there,
freezing to death.

128
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,325
You can set up by the firepit.

129
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,285
The searchers can stay warm.

130
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,786
I'll get some coffee going

131
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,246
and breakfast, too, if you want.

132
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:13,831
You're a godsend.

133
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,333
By the firepit, guys!

134
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,084
Okay, guys!

135
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,669
Let's unload the tables,
set up the tents.

136
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,171
Let's move quickly!

137
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,340
You mind if I use
your kitchen table for a sec?

138
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,551
Got to mark this up,
and I'd love some Earl Grey.

139
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,182
Oh, wait.

140
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,477
What's going on?

141
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,231
Jim? And this is...?

142
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,149
Harrison.

143
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,568
I'm Jim's son.

144
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:44,987
Son?

145
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,155
<i>Add that to the list</i>

146
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:47,532
<i>of things I need to clean up.</i>

147
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,034
Welcome to Iron Lake, Harrison.

148
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,536
I'm Angela.

149
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,496
It's really nice to meet you.

150
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,717
Yo, Jimbo!

151
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,803
Wood's gonna rot if you
don't cover it with a good tarp.

152
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:11,806
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

153
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:13,391
Well, hell, Jim,
you got 'em at your own store.

154
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,475
Just pick up a good canvas one.

155
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:16,060
As long as there's wax on it.

156
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,186
Or a polyurethane one, yeah?

157
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,063
Thanks for the tip, Teddy.

158
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,065
So, you came here by yourself?

159
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,233
It's no big deal.

160
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,568
Used to moving around a lot.

161
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,819
Your mother wasn't worried?

162
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:27,363
What are you two talking about?

163
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:30,324
Mom. That she passed away.

164
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,455
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

165
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,749
Mm. Um...

166
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,085
Then, of course,
when that happened,

167
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,672
I came up here to be with Jim.

168
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,467
So, you're here for good?

169
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:51,262
- Well, you'll love Iron Lake.
- Actually, we haven't...

170
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,389
really talked about it yet,
but...

171
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,974
You should meet
my daughter Audrey.

172
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:56,851
She's about your age.

173
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,285
Thanks for covering for me.

174
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,454
Didn't do it for you.

175
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,956
Just didn't want a cop
all up in my business.

176
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,793
<i>Huh. Like father, like son.</i>

177
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,464
You'll each be assigned into
groups of four and given a grid.

178
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,215
Search for any sign of Matt.

179
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,717
We'll do two-hour shifts,

180
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,302
then we'll return
to base camp to warm up

181
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,470
and pick a new grid.

182
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,764
- Oh, a-and stay hydrated.
- Okay.

183
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:36,307
Let's get a move on.

184
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:39,769
We'll keep
the store closed today, Jim,

185
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,479
but if anybody needs supplies,
feel free to make a run.

186
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,855
- Sure thing.
- Teddy.

187
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:44,523
- Get the drone in the air.
- On it!

188
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,941
<i>A drone. Perfect.</i>

189
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:47,318
Hey.

190
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,152
You didn't include
any Seneca land

191
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,528
in your search area.

192
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,155
I mean, the last thing we need

193
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,658
is a bunch of townsfolk
trampling reservation land.

194
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,451
I asked Abraham Brown
to organize the search

195
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:56,869
on their side.
They're already in the woods.

196
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,120
Copy that.

197
00:13:58,162 --> 00:13:59,163
<i>That deer was killed</i>

198
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,331
<i>on Seneca land.</i>

199
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,707
<i>They're gonna find it soon.</i>

200
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:04,085
<i>If I missed a blood trail
to my own cabin,</i>

201
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:06,170
- <i>what else did I miss?</i>
- Hey.

202
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,505
I was thinking Harrison and I

203
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,298
can take that area
into the woods.

204
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,758
We got it covered, Jim.

205
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,343
No, we want to help.

206
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,678
The terrain gets rough.

207
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,513
My RTV will
get through it faster.

208
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,623
Okay.

209
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:17,514
Fine.

210
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,434
You and your son can take it.

211
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,353
<i>Ouch.</i>

212
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,940
That thing police-grade?

213
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,316
Of course.

214
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:29,527
Built-in mapping software?

215
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,405
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

216
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,494
Oh, crap.

217
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:41,038
<i>I might get away
with this after all.</i>

218
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,373
Sorry, boss!

219
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,208
- What now?
- Logan.

220
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,876
Get the search teams launched.

221
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,586
- Yes, boss.
- I'll be back.

222
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:48,796
Yep.

223
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,005
Jesus.

224
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,553
Fucking champagne.

225
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,334
<i>Do you have an appointment?</i>

226
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,307
You're-you're kind of
swerving a lot.

227
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,893
I'm just avoiding rocks.

228
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:28,312
<i>Usually blood sets
my teeth on edge.</i>

229
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,980
<i>Now it's giving me whiplash.</i>

230
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,607
So, uh...

231
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,651
you and the police chief, huh?

232
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,820
I've only been in Iron Lake
for a couple of years.

233
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,490
This whole Angela thing
is recent.

234
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:45,955
So-so, why here?

235
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:49,291
You... do you, like,
hate nice weather?

236
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,420
No, it's quiet, peaceful.

237
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:54,839
No crime.

238
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,341
<i>No temptations
from the outside world.</i>

239
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,843
No crime?

240
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,553
What, y-you think
this missing guy

241
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:03,305
just, like, got lost out here?

242
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,475
Probably.

243
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,270
People get lost in these woods
all the time.

244
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:11,355
Wh-What is that?

245
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,582
You know what,
this could be a crime scene.

246
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,376
That deer was shot
on Seneca land.

247
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,504
It's against the law
to kill them.

248
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,506
We need to tell Angela.

249
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,884
My phone won't work out here.

250
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,344
- Can you drive the RTV?
- Yeah, I should be fine.

251
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:44,722
All right, just follow the trail
back, and get them here

252
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,473
as fast as you can.

253
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,726
I'll make sure
no one disturbs the scene.

254
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,363
<i>Got to find the source
of that blood trail.</i>

255
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:13,042
Beautiful, isn't it?

256
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,462
Gauguin's <i>A Farm in Brittany.</i>

257
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:20,758
Well, look at you.

258
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,093
Chief, if you're here
to apologize

259
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,511
about that little protest
yesterday...

260
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:25,846
We've got a hunter
who disappeared

261
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,806
in the woods last night.
We're searching

262
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:30,309
on foot, but we have
over 100 square miles to cover.

263
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:32,436
You need my helicopter.

264
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,938
It would really help.

265
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,356
Then it's yours.

266
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:37,566
My pilot was an Army Ranger.
He-he knows the area.

267
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,902
I'll have him coordinate
with your office.

268
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,111
Thank you.

269
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,363
Mm-hmm.

270
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:43,572
I'll be going.

271
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:45,449
Oh, hold on.

272
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,618
That young woman yesterday, the
one who was leading the protest,

273
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,037
uh, she by any chance
your daughter?

274
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,872
Audrey.

275
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:55,125
Hmm. Unfortunately,
her generation

276
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,753
sees the world
only in binary terms.

277
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:59,630
Black and white, good and evil.

278
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,423
And that, uh...

279
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:03,133
climate change-denying oil baron

280
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,345
persona that people are
all too happy to pin on me,

281
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:09,473
it ignores all of the good I do.

282
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,267
All of my charity work,
including to the Seneca people.

283
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:15,104
The supplies I donate every year
to keep that,

284
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,314
uh, reservation
medical clinic running,

285
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,775
the food during the holidays.

286
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,986
It's very much appreciated.

287
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,779
Mm-hmm.

288
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,449
We'll get that bird
up in the air for you.

289
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:30,035
<i>The mystery is,
where did I screw up?</i>

290
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:32,371
They always say
killers return to the scene

291
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:34,415
of their crime,
but this is fucking ridiculous.

292
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:41,839
It's not fucking funny!

293
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:10,868
Mystery solved.

294
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,040
You think Windexing that rock

295
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,291
is gonna solve
your fucking problem?

296
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,333
Yes.

297
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,252
Yes, I do.

298
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:22,379
He has your brain.
He's smart enough to know

299
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,381
that people don't fake
their fucking death

300
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,758
if they have nothing to hide!

301
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,594
Who the fuck do you think
you're fooling?!

302
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,392
I told you, the Matt thing was
a one-time screwup.

303
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,394
What the actual fuck
do you think you're doing?

304
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,229
Harrison's been here one day,
and you have him

305
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,774
in the woods looking
for a man you killed?

306
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:44,359
He'd be so much better off
without you.

307
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:47,196
<i>He's my son.</i>

308
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:49,031
<i>I lost him once.</i>

309
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:51,241
<i>I won't lose him again.</i>

310
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,888
<i>Once again, I have to stay
a step ahead of everyone.</i>

311
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,182
<i>With Matt's help,</i>

312
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:16,767
<i>I can do that.</i>

313
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,603
<i>Thanks... dude.</i>

314
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,956
<i>Perfect.</i>

315
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,836
<i>More people to mess up
the crime scene.</i>

316
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:57,641
Hey, Jim.

317
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,977
White buck.

318
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,146
Left here to rot.

319
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,399
Such a waste.

320
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,193
None of us would have done
something like this.

321
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:14,074
You think maybe
Matt Caldwell would?

322
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,452
He was hunting out here.
It could explain

323
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:18,745
why we can't find him.

324
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:19,746
We need to secure the perimeter.

325
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,832
You got it, boss.

326
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,460
This is bullshit, Angela.

327
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:27,462
I'm betting
the Caldwell kid did this,

328
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:29,173
then panicked and ran.

329
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,008
The highway is just a couple
of klicks in that direction.

330
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,843
He could've hitched
and ran out of town.

331
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,970
It's plausible.

332
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:37,181
But there's no evidence
tying Matt to this deer.

333
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,516
So we'll process the scene,

334
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,060
which you're all trampling
right now, so please back up.

335
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:44,897
<i>Shit. Why does my girlfriend</i>

336
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:46,231
<i>have to be such a good cop?</i>

337
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:48,692
For now,
the search for Matt goes on,

338
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,986
including here on Seneca land.

339
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,363
Even after he did this?

340
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,407
If he did this.

341
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:57,910
Pretty amazing
how the entire town

342
00:22:57,951 --> 00:23:00,037
turns out for a Caldwell.

343
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,123
When one of our girls
goes missing...

344
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,542
"Runaways always come back."

345
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,879
After Iris,
you of all people should know.

346
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,757
Things are different
in Iron Lake now.

347
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,971
Sooner or later,

348
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:21,058
you're gonna have
to pick a side.

349
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:31,026
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

350
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:33,528
Harrison was great, by the way.

351
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:36,907
Good job.

352
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,408
It's no big deal.

353
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,744
Logan, let's get
the processing kit.

354
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,704
Let's see what we can find.

355
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:45,916
Officer coming through!

356
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,961
Looks like the slug's
still in the carcass.

357
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,879
There's no exit wound.

358
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:53,257
I sold Matt a rifle and bullets
a couple of days ago.

359
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,467
I could bring in
some of the ammo,

360
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:58,720
the same stuff, to the station,
see if it's a match.

361
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:01,473
Oh, my God! I just found this

362
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:04,268
about a mile down the trail,
right before I got to the...

363
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,269
The highway.

364
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,853
<i>Thank you, Fred Jr.</i>

365
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,563
<i>You magnificent outdoorsman.</i>

366
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:10,107
Told you.

367
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,192
Chickenshit cut and ran.

368
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,694
How long you been a cop again?

369
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,113
Two weeks... and a half.

370
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,532
Look, this may not even be
Matt's glove.

371
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:20,575
Someone could've dropped it
a month ago.

372
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,619
Matt had gloves like that
when he was in the store.

373
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,121
<i>Indeed, he did.</i>

374
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,956
I mean, there are
smudges of blood on this.

375
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,457
Let's get this
and the deer back to town.

376
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,334
We'll test the blood.
We'll see if it matches.

377
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,547
Well...

378
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:36,049
thanks to you,
we got some real leads.

379
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:37,884
Not bad for your very first
crime scene.

380
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:39,970
Just lucky we stumbled on it.

381
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,221
You can use my deer sled

382
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:42,973
to get it back to town
if you want.

383
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,308
If you don't stop being
so helpful, Jim,

384
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,809
I'm gonna have to deputize you.

385
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,645
Y-You guys bring this deer
back to your place,

386
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,939
and we'll take it from there.

387
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:52,482
Harrison,
the high school just got out,

388
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,693
so the students are
joining the search.

389
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:57,321
Maybe you can meet
some kids your own age.

390
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,989
That'd be great.

391
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,657
We'll see you back there.

392
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,993
Okay.

393
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,121
Why aren't you a cop anymore?

394
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:08,332
Technically,
I wasn't actually a cop.

395
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,876
Well, Mom said you were a cop.

396
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,836
And you had to be better
than these guys.

397
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,796
Maybe.

398
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:17,299
But being at those crime scenes

399
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,676
day after day,

400
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,678
it just got to be too much.

401
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,513
I'm happier now.

402
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,848
Selling night crawlers?

403
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,433
Really?

404
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,543
- Hey, here, take my hat.
- I'm good.

405
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,383
You doing okay with all this?

406
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,259
It's fine.

407
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:03,637
Kind of cool, actually.

408
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:05,055
Yo, Coach!

409
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,473
Okay, everyone.

410
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:07,808
Do exactly
what the officers tell you.

411
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,935
Yo, Zach. Scott. What's up?

412
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:12,646
<i>Vete.</i>

413
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,441
Go. <i>Y ten cuidado.</i>

414
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,865
Hey, you want to help me
with the goats?

415
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:25,575
Uh, yeah, sure.

416
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,167
You're good with animals.

417
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:37,254
We had a goat back in Argentina.

418
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,048
Sheep and chickens, too.

419
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,884
I miss 'em. You okay?

420
00:26:42,926 --> 00:26:44,761
What's the black one's name?

421
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,764
Uh... I've just

422
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,433
been calling him Goat.

423
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,769
Haven't gotten around
to properly naming him, I guess.

424
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:55,856
What was your goat's name?

425
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:57,858
Vincent.

426
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:59,776
Vincent van Goat.

427
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,653
Ha.

428
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:05,991
Well, Harrison,
meet Vincent van Goat II.

429
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:16,168
I got to head to the shop

430
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:18,295
and check on those bullets
I sold Matt.

431
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,385
If you want, you can just hang

432
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,053
inside the cabin
until I get back.

433
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,847
I know how awkward

434
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:31,141
it can be, meeting new people.

435
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,646
It was hard for me
in high school, too.

436
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,774
Yeah, I survived the last
ten years without you, Jim.

437
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:42,235
I think I can go two more hours.

438
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:07,719
Well, he's not
an awkward-as-fuck

439
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:09,804
budding serial killer
like you were.

440
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:11,765
Does that mean you're gonna
start laughing at me again?

441
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,016
I don't know, you tell me.

442
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,726
I know he shouldn't be
around you.

443
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:16,228
Around this version of me.

444
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:18,063
Jim Lindsay, he's safe.

445
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:19,397
You're starting
to sound an awful lot

446
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,525
- like the old Dexter to me.
- I'm not.

447
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,026
You are.

448
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,403
You fucking love that you're
getting away with murder.

449
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:27,197
You can't wait to kill again.

450
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,741
You are a fucking serial killer!

451
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,368
You are gonna fail this boy

452
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,036
a thousand different ways
because of it!

453
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,539
Stop!

454
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,469
<i>Peace.</i>

455
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,429
<i>I wish.</i>

456
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,393
I guess you met my mom.

457
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,561
The cop.

458
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,229
Chief of police.

459
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,897
The one dating your dad.

460
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,774
That part I figured out,

461
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,360
which-which makes this
not awkward at all.

462
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:07,320
Yeah. Don't worry.

463
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,281
Knowing my mom,
it won't last long.

464
00:29:09,322 --> 00:29:11,366
She's pretty much married
to her job.

465
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:17,247
You want to come
on the search with us?

466
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,627
Sure.

467
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:26,423
Hey, guys.

468
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:30,302
Zach and Scott.

469
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:32,137
They're smarter than they look.

470
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:33,888
Well, Zach is.

471
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,056
Duh.

472
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:37,517
Me Scott.

473
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,644
Harrison.

474
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,131
Appreciate this, Gig.

475
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:51,508
Glad to help.

476
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,097
Hey.

477
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:58,682
It's not a big deal.

478
00:30:58,723 --> 00:30:59,849
A lot of folks get queasy
at the sight of blood.

479
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,851
- Yeah, it gets to me every time.
- Yeah.

480
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,353
Looks like the shooter
didn't know what he was doing

481
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,021
or was a piss-poor shot.

482
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,190
Deer's got a shattered shoulder,

483
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,109
uh, bone splinter everywhere.

484
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,277
You feel the slug?

485
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:14,280
Yep.

486
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,330
What do you think?

487
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:24,374
Looks like a hollow-point
seven Mag to me.

488
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,043
The bullets I sold Matt were...

489
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,712
160-grain hollow-point

490
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,880
seven-millimeter
Remington Magnums.

491
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,007
The plot thins.

492
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,427
Looks like there's
some striation on the base.

493
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,387
We might be able to match it
to Matt's gun when we find it.

494
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,264
Thanks, Gig.

495
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:41,349
Looks like my work's done here.

496
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:42,934
I better get back to Harrison.

497
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:44,894
Harrison's with Audrey
on the search. They're fine.

498
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,771
You and I, on the other hand,
need to talk.

499
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:48,898
<i>"We need to talk."
Words you never want to hear</i>

500
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,025
<i>from your doctor
or your girlfriend.</i>

501
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,115
Cool shirt.

502
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:58,450
You mean her "myew" shirt?

503
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:00,160
Wh-What does it even mean?

504
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:02,245
Married monsters in...

505
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,998
Missing and Murdered
Indigenous Women.

506
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,083
Oh. Fuck.

507
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,918
Hey, yo. It's just up here.

508
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,712
Where?

509
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,088
Sorry you ended up in Iron Lake.

510
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,590
Sucks here.

511
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,925
I think I'm just
passing through, actually.

512
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,343
Yeah?

513
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:20,430
Well, lucky you.

514
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:25,351
- So, where...?
- So, what is it...?

515
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:27,228
You go.

516
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,272
Uh, I was gonna ask,

517
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,441
what's it like being
the police chief's daughter?

518
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,151
So much fun.

519
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:34,444
She never checks up on me.

520
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,112
Never assumes
I've been murdered

521
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,322
when she hasn't heard
from me for, like, ten minutes.

522
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:39,991
It's great.

523
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,951
That kind of reminds me
of my stepmom.

524
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,412
My dad, not so much.

525
00:32:44,454 --> 00:32:46,623
Oh, and you live
with your stepmom?

526
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,917
Yo, this is it!

527
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,049
Shit, hide!

528
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,479
That had to be Olsen.

529
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,606
Who's that?

530
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:14,025
Petrochemical
billionaire asshole.

531
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,987
Aren't we supposed to be
looking for this Matt guy?

532
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,156
The whole town and
the reservation are searching.

533
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,991
They even got a helicopter.

534
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,409
They don't need us.

535
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,828
And Matt Caldwell's
an entitled prick,

536
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,163
so fuck him. We're gonna party.

537
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,791
Hold up.

538
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,043
They put new locks
on the cabin doors.

539
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:35,797
Leave it to me.

540
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,177
Son of a...

541
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,137
I got it.

542
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:47,100
Give me a sec.

543
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,535
Mom is really not gonna
like you.

544
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,969
<i>Here it comes.</i>

545
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,846
<i>The moment
the girlfriend tells me</i>

546
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:27,223
<i>I'm too closed-off,
that it's not gonna work out.</i>

547
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,850
I'm thrilled Harrison is here.

548
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:30,685
<i>Then again...</i>

549
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:31,853
You are?

550
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,605
Yeah.

551
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,066
I know you've been private
about your past.

552
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,735
It's okay.

553
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,570
Everyone has secrets.

554
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:42,697
Ange, I never meant
for it to be a secret.

555
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,365
It's fine.
We all have things

556
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:45,533
we keep from each other,
right?

557
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,660
For instance...

558
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,413
I'm not Audrey's birth mother.

559
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,582
Oh.

560
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:53,875
You adopted her?

561
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,043
Yeah.

562
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:57,921
Did you ever look
for the birth mom?

563
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:00,757
I've spent pretty much
my entire adult life

564
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,592
looking for missing women.

565
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,428
But one who abandons
her own baby?

566
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,097
Fuck her.

567
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:17,774
You could have shared your
Harrison situation with me.

568
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:21,903
This whole time, I've been
struggling with Audrey,

569
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,614
thinking I couldn't share
that part of my life with you.

570
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,699
But now Harrison's here,

571
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,077
and maybe that's
an opportunity for us, too.

572
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:31,120
We can talk parenting...

573
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,624
the pressures,
the worry, the guilt.

574
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,253
So that's me,

575
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:41,089
sharing,

576
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,466
giving you

577
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,801
an opening to share back.

578
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,552
- Right.
- 'Cause that's...

579
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:48,012
that's how it works.

580
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:53,851
I don't know that
I can always be the father

581
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:55,937
Harrison needs me to be.

582
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:58,106
I feel that way
about being a mom every day.

583
00:35:58,147 --> 00:36:00,024
- You do?
- Yeah.

584
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,819
But it doesn't matter
because Audrey needs me.

585
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,655
Just like Harrison needs you.

586
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,991
So the good news is,

587
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,995
all you really have
to do is just...

588
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,413
show up.

589
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:14,914
Show up?

590
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,749
You make it sound so easy.

591
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,459
Also gonna have
to enroll him in school.

592
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:19,836
Obviously.

593
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,046
And get him
some real winter clothes.

594
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:24,507
And he's probably gonna
need a car.

595
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,844
College apps are coming up,
so add tutors and exam prep.

596
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,762
<i>Harrison's been here
less than a day,</i>

597
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,639
<i>and now I'm talking
about college prep.</i>

598
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,100
Just wait till
he starts dating.

599
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:42,692
Maybe just start
with a cot or something.

600
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,819
A cot. I can do that.

601
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:46,195
Okay.

602
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,031
Don't worry.

603
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,992
Harrison's gonna love it here.

604
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:54,662
In fact, I bet Audrey
and her friends

605
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:56,622
are taking great care
of him right now.

606
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:03,504
No, I'm good.

607
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,256
Scott?

608
00:37:05,298 --> 00:37:08,551
So, what are you, like,
straight edge or something, man?

609
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,011
Don't think
that's a thing anymore.

610
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:12,930
Wait. Are you a Mormon?

611
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:15,141
I kind of have
a history with drugs.

612
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:17,435
I got clean
a couple years ago, though.

613
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:22,190
Whoa. Anyone want a kick-ass
Roaring Forks beach towel?

614
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,649
No.

615
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:25,526
So, where are you
headed after this?

616
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:28,154
Uh, I-I just got up here
from Florida.

617
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:29,864
- Is that where your mom lives?
- Stepmom.

618
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:32,033
Um, actually, my mom died
when I was really young,

619
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:35,161
and my stepmom died of cancer
a couple years ago.

620
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:37,330
I'm so sorry.

621
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:41,084
- Was your mom sick?
- What?

622
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,669
You said your stepmom died
of cancer,

623
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:45,671
so how'd your real mom die?

624
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:47,924
You know what?

625
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,759
I shouldn't have asked.

626
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,260
It's none of our business.

627
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,097
No, it's fine.

628
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,725
I'm freezing.

629
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,268
I'm gonna go get
some wood for the fire.

630
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,529
Well, that's on you.

631
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,156
- You made that worse.
- Either way, dude's weird.

632
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:13,825
And we're trapped

633
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:15,743
in an abandoned cabin
in the woods with him.

634
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:17,120
Stop watching slasher films.

635
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,913
Just saying
we know nothing about him.

636
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:21,040
But we can.

637
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,668
Sick.

638
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,086
That's fucked-up.

639
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:27,213
Relax.

640
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:29,173
Just making sure he doesn't have
a fucking manifesto in here

641
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:31,592
- or some shit.
- Okay, no manifesto, so stop.

642
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:34,470
We got an artist here.

643
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,432
So he's actually good
at something,

644
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:40,560
- unlike the two of you.
- We're good at stuff.

645
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:42,228
Pinning half-naked guys to mats.

646
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,272
Wrestling is
an Olympic sport, Audrey.

647
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,606
So is Ping-Pong.

648
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:47,483
What the fuck
are you guys doing?

649
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,735
Stop. Put that away.

650
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,242
Shit.

651
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,830
Got the wood.

652
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,708
Cool. Thanks.

653
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,830
Where the fuck is my phone?

654
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,806
Hello?

655
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,517
Hello?!

656
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,061
Is anyone there?

657
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,065
Hey! Let me the fuck out!

658
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,318
What the fuck is...?!

659
00:40:26,332 --> 00:40:27,792
Oh.

660
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:34,590
Thank you.

661
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,758
- There you go.
- <i>I hide the blood.</i>

662
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,385
<i>I plant a glove.</i>

663
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:39,262
<i>I match the bullet
in the deer to Matt's gun.</i>

664
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,722
<i>All to get the good people
of Iron Lake off my land.</i>

665
00:40:41,764 --> 00:40:45,309
<i>And yet here I am,
feeding them hamburgers.</i>

666
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:49,063
<i>If I prayed,
I'd pray for this to be over.</i>

667
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,614
Everyone!

668
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,825
We do not think Matt Caldwell
is in these woods,

669
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:02,868
so we are shutting down
the search!

670
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,745
<i>Wow, prayer answered.</i>

671
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,957
- So the glove was a match?
- Matt's friend

672
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,375
confirmed it was his.

673
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,793
And the smudges on it
were deer blood.

674
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,254
So he did shoot that deer.

675
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:16,048
And then probably fled
to avoid prosecution.

676
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,217
I'm guessing he's halfway
to New York by now.

677
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:19,969
Great job cracking the case.

678
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,805
<i>And completely buying
into my narrative.</i>

679
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,432
It's not closed yet.

680
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:25,641
We're still trying
to get in touch with his dad.

681
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,643
Take the compliment.

682
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,353
Thank you.

683
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:32,148
And I'm glad
the idiot's all right.

684
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,316
I mean, last thing
this town needed

685
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,276
was finding a body
in the woods.

686
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:36,485
Yeah.

687
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,863
So, we'll be out
of your hair soon.

688
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:40,531
And when Harrison is settled,

689
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:42,158
you should bring him
over for dinner.

690
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,703
I'll make my grandmother's
hulled corn soup.

691
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:47,038
I'm sure he'd love that.

692
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:49,957
But...

693
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,209
it'll have to be after Audrey's
done being grounded.

694
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:55,171
What?
Are you kidding me?

695
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,505
So you didn't just spend
the entire afternoon hanging out

696
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,215
at the Roaring Forks
Summer Camp?

697
00:41:58,257 --> 00:42:00,551
What? No way.

698
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:02,053
That's-that's crazy.

699
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:05,181
Scott, you're literally wearing
a Roaring Forks T-shirt

700
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,516
that's two sizes too small
right now.

701
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,143
Shit.

702
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:11,145
Who cares?
Matt Caldwell's an asshole.

703
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:12,605
Audrey!

704
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:14,357
And since everyone's packing up,

705
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,026
I'm guessing you found him
and he's fine?

706
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,945
Not the point.
I didn't know where you were.

707
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:21,197
It's dangerous out there.

708
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,199
- You have no idea.
- <i>Nó'yëh,</i> stop.

709
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,617
I've heard it all before.

710
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,702
How many times
do I have to tell you?

711
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,081
I'm not Iris.

712
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,710
Get in the SUV.
We're going home.

713
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,545
- Let's go, Zach.
- Well...

714
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,340
I kind of don't want
to get arrested, so...

715
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,050
She's not gonna arrest you.

716
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:44,929
She only acts like a crazed,
overbearing dictator with me.

717
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,101
Come on, Zach.

718
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,733
Sorry you and Harrison
had to see that.

719
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,403
Parenting's just learning
as you go, right?

720
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,321
It'll be okay.

721
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:04,865
Thanks.

722
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:18,045
It's just a few things,

723
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:20,840
in case you decide
you want to stay.

724
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,426
I'm not sure.

725
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:26,762
I-I didn't come here
for all this.

726
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,722
I came here for answers.

727
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:33,269
Ask me whatever you want.

728
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,606
Why did you leave us?

729
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:40,609
Was it because of
what you wrote in the letter?

730
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,445
What I wrote?

731
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,629
"Reach out to me if Harrison
shows any dark tendencies."

732
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:05,718
Dark tendencies?

733
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,345
What does that mean?

734
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:11,307
What was so wrong with me
that-that you not only left

735
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,143
but faked your own death
to hide from me?

736
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,936
- It wasn't you.
- But...

737
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:18,772
"Dark tendencies"?

738
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:20,399
Wh-What did you see in me?

739
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:23,277
Nothing bad.
You were perfect.

740
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:25,321
You were this sweet, smart,

741
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:28,741
trusting little boy
with a huge heart.

742
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,497
It wasn't you I was scared of.

743
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,666
It was me.

744
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:46,091
I've always had...

745
00:44:48,594 --> 00:44:50,387
...my demons.

746
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:54,225
And I was scared
that I'd mess you up,

747
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:56,519
that I'd pass that on.

748
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,687
And so...

749
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,523
I went away.

750
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:03,108
Because of what I am,
not because of who you are.

751
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,735
I-I-I don't understand.

752
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:08,197
I was in a dark place
after I lost your mom.

753
00:45:09,323 --> 00:45:10,824
And then Aunt Deb,

754
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:13,160
and all that death.

755
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:16,413
I got lost.

756
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:22,211
And I thought you would thrive

757
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,755
in Argentina with Hannah.

758
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,884
She was always so good
with you.

759
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,344
Walking away from you

760
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:33,097
is the hardest thing
I've ever done.

761
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:37,268
And I regret it
so much now, because...

762
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:41,730
I never imagined
you'd be left alone.

763
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,364
After Hannah told me
you were dead,

764
00:45:50,406 --> 00:45:54,410
I-I kept a photo
of you by my bed.

765
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,537
I would look at it every night.

766
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:01,417
And for a long time,
I cried myself to sleep.

767
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:05,087
And then I found that letter.

768
00:46:06,922 --> 00:46:09,049
I...

769
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:11,385
I was so angry.

770
00:46:11,427 --> 00:46:13,637
Of course you were.

771
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,727
But maybe I can be there
for you now.

772
00:46:22,563 --> 00:46:24,356
Do-do you really mean that?

773
00:46:24,398 --> 00:46:26,734
If you're willing to risk the
chance that I'll screw you up.

774
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:29,862
Stop acting like
you're such an evil person.

775
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:32,281
I-I don't remember a lot,

776
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:35,784
but all of my memories
of you are good.

777
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:39,204
The... the worst thing
you ever did was...

778
00:46:39,246 --> 00:46:41,206
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

779
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,293
...leave me.

780
00:46:48,464 --> 00:46:51,175
So, yeah, I'll stay.

781
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:53,969
For a while.

782
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,721
Great.

783
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,308
In the morning, we can talk

784
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,768
about getting you
set up at school.

785
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:04,146
But not over
blueberry pancakes.

786
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,273
I mean, regular pancakes

787
00:47:06,315 --> 00:47:08,192
wouldn't be completely
out of the question.

788
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:10,861
Regular pancakes sound good.

789
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:39,848
Ugh. How did you know
this is exactly what I need?

790
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,600
Lucky guess.

791
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,692
You don't have to enjoy
the win so much.

792
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,945
You smug fuck.

793
00:48:10,546 --> 00:48:12,840
Angela.

794
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:15,759
I came as soon as I...
as I could.

795
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:17,469
What's going on?

796
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:19,596
Did you find him?
Tell me he's okay.

797
00:48:19,638 --> 00:48:21,890
Kurt, we've been trying
to contact you for hours.

798
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,226
We found evidence that Matt
may have committed a crime.

799
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,353
What?

800
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:28,772
What... what crime?

801
00:48:28,814 --> 00:48:31,275
Killing an animal
on reservation land.

802
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:33,610
Evidence points to him
fleeing the area.

803
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:35,654
- What are you talking about?
- My son and I

804
00:48:35,696 --> 00:48:38,574
found a dead white deer,
Mr. Caldwell.

805
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:42,161
Matt killed it, realized
he screwed up and left town.

806
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:44,747
No. No, no, no, no, no.
He would've called me

807
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,749
if he was in trouble.
He always does.

808
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,209
And a poaching fine
isn't gonna scare him.

809
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:51,086
It's not just poaching, Kurt.

810
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,590
Matt killed a white buck
on reservation land.

811
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,925
And I'm telling you
that he would've called me.

812
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,761
He's out there.

813
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,181
Look, I know Matt's not perfect

814
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:03,474
and he's made mistakes in life,

815
00:49:03,515 --> 00:49:05,642
but he doesn't deserve
to freeze to death

816
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:07,561
in the woods tonight, 'cause
that's what's gonna happen

817
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:08,812
if you call the search off.

818
00:49:08,854 --> 00:49:10,397
Kurt, can we talk
about this inside?

819
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:12,232
No, goddamn it!
My son has disappeared,

820
00:49:12,274 --> 00:49:14,026
and we need to find him now.

821
00:49:16,028 --> 00:49:18,655
Everybody!

822
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:20,991
Hey.

823
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:24,828
I need...

824
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,581
I need you to stand up for me,
for my family.

825
00:49:27,623 --> 00:49:30,417
Same way we've stood up for you.

826
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:33,378
I mean,
we-we've donated the trucks

827
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,422
to the volunteer
fire department.

828
00:49:35,464 --> 00:49:38,008
Uh, we sponsor the Harvest Fest
every year.

829
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,720
I mean, Fred, when-when your
dad's store's roof fell in,

830
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:43,931
who fronted him
for the repairs, huh?

831
00:49:43,972 --> 00:49:45,557
Right.

832
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,059
I mean, come on.
Half your kids grew up

833
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,061
working at my truck stop.

834
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:53,148
This is Iron Lake.

835
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,650
We look out for each other.

836
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,822
So, please, I'm begging you.

837
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,741
Do not give up on my son now.

838
00:50:02,783 --> 00:50:04,660
Now, when he needs us the most.

839
00:50:07,246 --> 00:50:10,666
Okay. We'll keep going
through the night.

840
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,960
Thank you, Angela.

841
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:14,169
Thank you so much.

842
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:17,631
Whatever resources you need,
anything at all.

843
00:50:17,673 --> 00:50:18,882
Means the world to me.

844
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:21,009
Okay. We're going back in.

845
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,679
Stay in your groups
and bundle up.

846
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,348
It's gonna be
a long, cold night.

847
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,189
So... I guess we'll be
here a little bit longer.

848
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,858
That's not a problem.

849
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,526
This your boy, Jim?

850
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,737
Yes. Harrison,
this is, uh, Kurt Caldwell.

851
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:42,197
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Caldwell.

852
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,324
Likewise.

853
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:46,994
Matt's out there.
I know it.

854
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:51,248
I'm gonna find him,
if it's the last thing I do.

855
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,292
No stone will go unturned.

856
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:58,213
<i>Well, maybe some stones
will go unturned.</i>

857
