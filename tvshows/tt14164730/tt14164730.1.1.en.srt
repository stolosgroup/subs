"Passenger" by Iggy Pop

3
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,239
I am a passenger

4
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,869
And I ride, and I ride

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,414
I ride through the
city's backsides

6
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,418
I see the stars
come out of the sky

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,088
Yeah,
they're bright in a hollow sky

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,549
You know it looks
so good tonight

9
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,852
I am the passenger

10
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,314
I look through my
window so bright

11
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,734
I see the stars come out tonight

12
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,196
I see the bright and hollow sky

13
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,866
Over the city's ripped-back sky

14
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,286
And everything
looks good tonight

15
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,752
Singin' la-la,
la-la, la-la-la-la,

16
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,089
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,300
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

18
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,477
Oh,
want to dance? Want to dance?

19
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,356
It's on the floor.

20
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,579
Are you ready for tonight?

21
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,710
Great.

22
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,795
If you say so.

23
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,556
It's real cold today.

24
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,767
You're the one that
picked this place.

25
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,374
dramatic music

26
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,310
Home isn't my way

27
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,645
Home I'll never be

28
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,482
Burn out the day

29
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,529
Burn out the night

30
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,240
I can't see no reason...

31
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,622
I'm livin' for givin' the devil

32
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,875
His due

33
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,503
And I'm burnin', I'm burnin'

34
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,839
I'm burnin' for you...

35
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,012
I'm burnin',
I'm burnin', I'm burnin'

36
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,036
License and registration,
please.

37
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,871
Sure.

38
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,542
There you go.
Thank you.

39
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,213
James Lindsay, huh?

40
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,923
Jim.

41
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,008
Is there a problem, Officer?

42
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,891
I'm gonna need you to
step out of the vehicle, sir.

43
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,564
Okay.

44
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,235
Turn around.

45
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,404
Hands on the truck.

46
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,295
You have the right
to remain silent.

47
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,798
I can make noise
if I want to though, right?

48
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,471
Chief Bishop,
Chief Bishop, come in.

49
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,307
Oh, what the fuck. Keep going.

50
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,268
Okay.
Let them find someone else.

51
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,687
Chief Bishop?

52
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,022
Angela.

53
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,608
Mrs. Gross' sheep got
loose on the Steiner property.

54
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,902
They're eating his
winter plantings.

55
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,195
 Oh, fuck.

56
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,449
I'm in the middle of something,
uh...

57
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,659
...can
Logan take care of it?

58
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,744
Logan's at the church.

59
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,956
The pecan pies were stolen
from the potluck supper.

60
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,875
Obviously can't
pull him off that.

61
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,877
Uh-huh.

62
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,629
Obviously. Um, what about Teddy?

63
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,716
It's week two, do you think
he can handle a sheep crisis?

64
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,636
Teddy's out of commission.

65
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,388
He just got his
wisdom teeth pulled.

66
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,474
Should I let Mr. Steiner know

67
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,476
you're en route?

68
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,230
Sure, Esther.

69
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,817
This is me en route.

70
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,572
It's okay. You can pull me
over again some other time.

71
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm sorry.

72
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,409
You can swing
by the station later.

73
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,536
Okay, sure thing.

74

"King of a One Horse
Town" by Dan Auerbach

75
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,132
Every day is just
a little white lie

76
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,346
Telling myself I'm gettin' by

77
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,893
I just stay in this room and cry

78
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,813
The snow,
it covers up the ground

79
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,569
And I can't hear a single sound

80
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,534
I'd turn off the TV,
go for a drive

81
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,539
But I can't see
there's any signs of life

82
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,167
Except this Christmas
tree with blinking lights...

83
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,461
Hey, Jimmy, morning.

84
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,004
You coming line dancing tonight?

85
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,673
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it,
Pastor Brian.

86
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,425
Hey, I'm sorry about those pies.

87
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,386
Now how could you possibly
know about that already?

88
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,971
Uh... small town.

89
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,764
Thank the Good Lord.

90
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,102
Scared if I jump in the
ocean I might drown...

91
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,980
Morning, Zach.
Morning, Mr. Lindsay.

92
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,606
Becca. Scott.
Hi, Mr. Lindsay.

93
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,191
Hey, Mr. Lindsay.
 Hey, you coming

94
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,401
to the match next week?

95
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,944
I'm sure gonna try.

96
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,071
Go Hawks.

97
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,284
Sup, Jimbo?
How are you and Angela doing?

98
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,202
Doing all right?
Yeah, as far as I know.

99
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,662
Why? What have you heard?

100
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,706
Only good things,
Jim. Only good things.

101
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,877
Edward Olsen
heading up to his chalet.

102
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,964
Rich asshole season begins...

103
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,841
now.

104
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,926
Yep.

105
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,448
suspenseful music

106
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,502
Hey, Gig.

107
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,962
You got my stuff.

108
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,049
There you go.

109
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,513
You're a lifesaver, Jimmy.

110
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,482
gentle music

111
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,529
Please
tell me you have

112
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,072
a strawberry cream
cheese sweet roll in there?

113
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,200
The boss speaketh
and so it shall be done...

114
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,868
...eth.

115
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,870
I don't know what
I would do without you, Jim.

116
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,665
-Well...
-Mmm!

117
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,875
Oh, it's so good.

118
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,836
Just so you know, it's going
to be a stress-y kind of week.

119
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,546
Brian and I are adopting.

120
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,047
It's so much pressure.

121
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,049
Wow. Yeah, I can only imagine.

122
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,719
Brian wants to
call him Garfield.

123
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,512
I mean,
who names a dog after a cat?

124
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,723
Evidently Brian does.

125
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,475
I think this pup looks
more like a Gromit, don't you?

126
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,645
On this one,
I think I'm basically Switzerland.

127
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,064
Smart man.

128
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,657
And here we go.

129
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,744
Just the guy I want to see.

130
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,165
Jim.
How can I help you?

131
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,834
Oh,I just rolled into town
with my posse.

132
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,253
Gonna do a little hunting.
Gonna need a new knife

133
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,005
and a big-ass gun.

134
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,090
All right,
you looking for a skinning knife,

135
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,592
or a--
Oh, this one.

136
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,635
This one's perfect.
Okay.

137
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,433
Wow.

138
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,103
Hey! Easy there!

139
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,438
Is there a problem?

140
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,440
I-I kind of have a
thing about blood.

141
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,317
Oh. Ooh!

142
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,695
Anyway, uh,
how about that rifle?

143
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,907
The Remington
783 will do the job.

144
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,950
It's got a good scope,
solid construction.

145
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,994
You drop it a dozen times,
it'll still shoot straight.

146
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,538
Yeah, yeah, I hear you,
man. Here's the thing.

147
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,457
Uh, my friend Bill over there?

148
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,375
Yeah?

149
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,794
He's already got that one,

150
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,462
and I want a gun
that's going to make his

151
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,631
one look like a Super Soaker.

152
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,133
Ah.
So...

153
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,469
That one.

154
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,930
I want that one.
You sure? 

155
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,556
It's gonna set you back $9,000.

156
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,809
I got a nice Christmas
bonus at Morgan Stanley.

157
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,977
O... kay.

158
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,731
Ah...

159
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,234
You know,
this is way more firepower

160
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,319
than anything you need
hunting around here.

161
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,112
Oh, yeah? What do you hunt?

162
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,990
Me? I don't anymore.

163
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,661
I haven't killed any animals
since... I was a teenager.

164
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,705
Look at you, Saint... uh, Jim.

165
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,666
Yeah, I'll take it.

166
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,209
Not a problem.

167
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,712
Just gonna need some ID

168
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,965
for the federal
background check.

169
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,967
Dude, really?

170
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,301
How long you been working here?

171
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,970
Mm, a couple years?

172
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,974
That's me, up on the wall.

173
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,518
I was on Fred Senior's Little
League team when I was six.

174
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,895
Nice.
 Yo, Matt!

175
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,939
We need this stuff?
No, no, I got a ton

176
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,399
of that in my dad's mud room.

177
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,444
Speaking of my dad,
he bought me my first rifle

178
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,822
in this very store
when I was ten.

179
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,328
What the actual fuck, man?

180
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,956
It happens sometimes.
It's just a 24-hour hold

181
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,626
while the FBI checks
on your record.

182
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,670
So... same time tomorrow?

183
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,381
Well, dude,
just sell me the gun.

184
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,633
I got to
follow procedure.

185
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,219
Neither of us want Fred
to lose his business, right?

186
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,847
Oh, yeah. Oh, okay, Eagle Scout.

187
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,517
You know, you break a rule,

188
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,896
sometimes you might
even have a little fun.

189
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,695
Oh, fuck it, whatever.

190
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,488
Means I get to
start drinking earlier.

191
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,157
Taking this though.

192
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,367
Okay.

193
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,419
Got to keep your guard up dude!
Whoa!

194
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,880
Damn it, Matt,
I almost shit myself.

195
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,298
So fucking...

196
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,841
Come on,
let's get out of here.

197
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,718
Let's get our swerve on!

198
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,595
First round's on you.

199
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,765
Thanks for shopping
at Fred's Fish & Game.

200
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,934
Jim.

201
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,106
low, somber music

202
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,705
Jim, I heard a red flag
came up on Matt Caldwell.

203
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,832
Seems like trouble
follows Caldwell the Lesser

204
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,334
wherever he goes.

205
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,169
There really are no
secrets in this town.

206
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,213
Ange is in a meeting.

207
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,180
Hey, Teddy. How you feeling?

208
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,932
 Been better.

209
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,433
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim,
can you give me a hand with these?

210
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,852
Evidence from the
Congregational church theft.

211
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,605
Keeping Iron Lake
safe one pie at a time.

212
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,024
You're welcome very much.

213
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,276
Logan,
you've known Matt since forever.

214
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,778
What do you think
he could have done

215
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,405
to flag the FBI on a
gun background check?

216
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,531
He tried to buy
a rifle at Fred's.

217
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,491
I'm sure it's just a formality.

218
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,159
These pies smell amazing.

219
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,661
Matt
Caldwell's a good guy.

220
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,579
Kicking some major
ass on Wall Street.

221
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,249
I mean, he likes to hang,
drink, gamble.

222
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,667
Fight or two in high school.

223
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,252
But, no, yeah, he's a good guy.

224
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,921
I bet it was that boat
crash out in Ohio.

225
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,298
No. No way. Matt
wasn't even driving.

226
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,843
Five people died.
 Shit.

227
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,177
Matt was in
the hospital for weeks.

228
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,470
Shattered femur,

229
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,347
major surgery.

230
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,474
That whole thing was
just a really tragic accident.

231
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,145
In fact,
I bet his record is spotless.

232
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,443
Okay, maybe a few spots.

233
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,570
Is there any progress on
putting up that stop sign

234
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,447
over by Louis's Package Store?

235
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,450
That's an accident
waiting to happen.

236
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,784
That's all I'm saying.

237
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,660
Thanks for your time,
Dennis.

238
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,661
I will let you know

239
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,829
if anything else turns up.

240
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,748
Sure thing.

241
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,207
See ya, folks.

242
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,377
So, no good, huh?

243
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,004
The same as always.

244
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,339
No body, no pattern,

245
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,841
no case.

246
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,011
And no funding.

247
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,180
Until one of these
women turns up dead.

248
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,392
Hey, my money's on you.

249
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,812
Line dancing tonight?

250
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,105
What time?

251
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,691
Oh.
 Oh.

252
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,026
I thought it was more
of a-a group thing.

253
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,403
My bad. You two have fun.

254
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,821
See you tonight.

255
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,199
Bye.

256
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,117
lighthearted music

257
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,456
Sorry.

258
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,291
Mad dash. Thought
you'd appreciate

259
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,709
seeing your girlfriend
in something other

260
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,586
than a state-issued
uniform.

261
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,129
You look cute in that uniform.

262
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,423
Oh. That's why I like you,
Jim Lindsay.

263
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,431
Once I had a love
and it was a gas

264
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,644
Soon turned out
had a heart of glass

265
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,563
Seemed like the real thing
Aw, Esther.

266
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,358
She never misses a chance to
break out that rhinestone skirt.

267
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,653
Mistrust, love's gone behind

268
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm gonna get you that drink.

269
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,991
Hola, Ramón.
¿Cómo están Lydia y los niños?

270
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,494
Mi familia es genial.
Gracias a Dios.

271
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,162
What's up, Jim?
Hey, Ramon.

272
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,747
You're working
on a school night?

273
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,582
School has finals all week.

274
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,251
Ergo,
I don't have to grade anything.

275
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,211
So, picking up some extra
shifts before the holidays.

276
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,629
Got it.

277
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,048
Chivas,
rocks. IPA. And a veggie nachos?

278
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,091
Am I that predictable?

279
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,634
Want to shake it up?

280
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,302
I got a pickleback special.
 No.

281
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,471
We're good. Uh,
just put it on my tab.

282
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,558
No need. Matt Caldwell's
buying everyone a round.

283
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,811
Yo! It's Jim! Jim!

284
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,480
Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim!

285
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,899
Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim!

286
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,693
Put it on my tab anyway.

287
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,944
Okay.

288
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,195
Chivas, rocks. IPA.

289
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,447
Nachos.
Yeah.

290
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,951
Chug. Give me
the fucking bottle.

291
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,580
Last thing that guy
needs is more liquor.

292
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,874
Or more firepower.

293
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,709
You know the messed-up part?

294
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,752
FBI gets backed up and half
the flags clear automatically.

295
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,255
People fall through
the cracks all the time.

296
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,594
You're off the clock.
Let's not talk about work.

297
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,928
Let's dance.

298
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,972
Can't let Esther
and Alan show us up.

299
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,433
Lost inside

300
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,059
Adorable illusion
Ooh.

301
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,437
Yeah. 
- And I cannot hide

302
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,105
I'm the one you're using

303
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,024
Yeah.

304
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,987
Cruising, yeah

305
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,880
Iron Lake's about
two miles that way, my man.

306
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,882
low, somber music

307
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,771
In your mind

308
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,273
A secret waits inside

309
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,944
A place that you can't find

310
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,029
Jim!

311
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,073
Look at you,
getting all extracurricular

312
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,116
on a Tuesday night. Now
we're talkin'.

313
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,202
Hey, Matt.
I'm having a party tomorrow

314
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,954
at my dad's place.
You should come.

315
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,706
I'll, uh... see.

316
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,583
Great.

317
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,876
Hey, listen.

318
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,545
I was thinking.

319
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,215
Why don't we get out of here?

320
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,259
You could open up your shop,
give me that rifle.

321
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,594
My guys and I,
we want to go hunting in the morning.

322
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,721
If your background check clears,
you can come and pick it up

323
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,348
at the store in the
morning.

324
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,267
I'm sure your buds are
gonna be really impressed

325
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,685
with the size of your gun.

326
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,903
Man.

327
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,406
This Eagle Scout loves
his rules!

328
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,865
Eh...
You know what?

329
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,285
Why don't you come
to the party anyway?

330
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,953
You never know.

331
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,290
Maybe you'll even
enjoy yourself.

332
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,627
Find a way somehow

333
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,630
Girlfriend's a cop, huh?

334
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,800
Should probably come stag.

335
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,303
There's gonna be a
lot of red flags there,

336
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,388
if you know what I mean.

337
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:52,311
Release me to the night

338
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,354
Oh, oh

339
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,647
How much is a plain burger,

340
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,107
without cheese or anything?

341
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,108
$7.50.

342
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,609
What if I don't get fries?

343
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,153
Doesn't come with fries, honey.

344
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,905
Hey, Tess.

345
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,283
Put it on my tab. Fries, too.

346
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,952
Are you sure, ma'am?

347
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,329
I'm extra sure if you
don't call me "ma'am."

348
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,164
You got it.

349
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,666
Thanks. Seriously.

350
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,502
You're not from around here.

351
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,838
Taking the first
bus out tomorrow.

352
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,590
Just got to make
sure I got the fare.

353
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,136
Just take this.

354
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,679
Just in case.

355
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,348
And if you need a
place to stay tonight,

356
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,433
Desiree over there,

357
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,602
she runs a shelter
just down the road.

358
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,188
I'm good.

359
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,856
But wow.

360
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,191
Thanks.

361
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,162
Who was that?

362
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,538
Lost kid.

363
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,582
My brand of community outreach.

364
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,043
Besides,
who checks my petty cash vouchers?

365
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,212
Mm, that'd be me.

366
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,588
That was kind of you.

367
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,135
Hey,
you want to get out of here?

368
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,513
You can pull me over
by the old Solly farm.

369
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,390
Mmm.

370
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,521
Uh, it's my smart doorbell.

371
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:21,024
Audrey's got way
too many kids over.

372
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,567
Oh, aren't you glad they
didn't have these things

373
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,027
when we were younger?

374
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,821
You better believe it.

375
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,739
Time to be a mom.

376
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,074
Okay.
 Even...

377
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,077
when
you're off the clock,

378
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,162
you're on the clock.

379
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,667
Mmm.

380
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,339
No, seriously.
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

381
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,924
Uh... take that one!

382
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,094
All right.

383
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,769
 Mmm.

384
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,861
low, ominous music

385
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,278
Beautiful.

386
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,463
low, ominous music

387
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,196
I have the feeling

388
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,490
I'm being watched.

389
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,700
And I have a feeling
you're letting this Matt prick

390
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,536
get to you, brother.

391
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,290
It's been almost ten years.

392
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,837
Stick to your routine.

393
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,633
You're right.

394
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,302
Routine, routine, routine.

395
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,059
"Haunted When the Minutes
Drag" by Love and Rockets

396
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,568
The word that would
best describe this feeling

397
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,071
Would be "haunted"

398
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,995
I touch the clothes
you left behind

399
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,497
That still retain
your shape and lines

400
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,916
Still haunted

401
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,715
I trace the outline of your eyes

402
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,593
We're in the mirror hypnotized

403
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,428
I'm haunted

404
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,268
I find a solitary hair

405
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,104
Gone and still I reminisce

406
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,273
I'm haunted

407
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,778
Haunted by your soul

408
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,779
All right.

409
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:55,780
I got you a couple options.

410
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,865
What do you think?

411
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,782
Orange.

412
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,910
The good stuff.

413
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,704
Oh. Hey, Jim, how much d--

414
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,042
Lunch.

415
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,714
Drilling is killing!

416
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,549
 Louder!

417
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,760
Save the planet!

418
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,262
Shame on you!

419
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,474
Save the planet!

420
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,560
Shame on you!

421
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,813
Drilling is killing!

422
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,025
Save the planet!

423
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,111
Shame on you!

424
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,281
Drilling is killing!

425
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,576
Save the planet!

426
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,121
Shame on you!

427
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,083
Drilling is killing!

428
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,628
Save the planet!
Wait, what is all this?

429
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,838
Everyone's favorite
petro-billionaire decided

430
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,174
to close down the Tavern
for his annual board meeting.

431
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,593
My tuna sandwich is in there.

432
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,762
Poor baby.
Save the planet!

433
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,807
Audrey?
 Shame on you!

434
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,183
Excuse me.

435
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,060
Don't you have a test today?

436
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,104
What good's math if people like
Edward Olsen destroy the planet?

437
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,189
Well, I know that someone
isn't getting their tuna sandwich

438
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,441
anytime soon.
Shame on you!

439
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,529
Drilling is killing!

440
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,280
Shame on you!
Thank you, everyone,

441
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,199
for waiting so patiently.

442
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,701
Sorry, my meeting ran long.

443
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,452
We brought you some,
uh, cocoa to warm you up.

444
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,246
Please, enjoy.

445
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,543
It's encouraging to see
young people with such gusto.

446
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,086
I mean that.

447
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,463
You keep fighting for
what you believe in, guys.

448
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,716
That's what makes this
country great, right?

449
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,593
Save the planet!

450
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,304
Shame on you!

451
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,142
Drilling is killing!

452
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,395
Save the planet!

453
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,565
Shame on you!

454
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,735
Drilling is killing!

455
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,988
Save the planet!

456
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,074
Shame on you!

457
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,705
Hey, Jim!

458
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,834
Matt Caldwell's been cleared.

459
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,502
He wants the gun dropped
off at his dad's lodge.

460
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,505
Should we really
sell him that gun?

461
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,424
Nine grand? Uh,
yeah.

462
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,842
It's called
commerce. I'm into it.

463
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,218
Right.
Plus,

464
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,470
Matt's dad's been
a real friend to us

465
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,596
for years, so...

466
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,307
I'm not comfortable
delivering the gun.

467
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,600
Can't you do it?

468
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,226
Brian and I are
picking up Garfield.

469
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,104
Yeah,
I lost the name battle.

470
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,606
Happy husband, happy life.

471
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,608
Jimmy,

472
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,318
I really need you
to deliver this gun.

473
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,121
Shit.

474
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,748
A big party.

475
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,794
You know the drill
You know the drill

476
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,129
And I'm-a drip,
I'm-a spit You know the drill

477
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,924
You know I got the toolie
on a 100-can bouill-ion

478
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,425
I don't even use the AC

479
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,760
No way.

480
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,137
He really made you
bring that thing here?

481
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,890
Man,
that guy always has to one-up me.

482
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,558
Text back, she all alone...

483
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,478
Bill. Uh,
I was with Matt at the store.

484
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,146
Right.

485
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,148
I just have some, uh,
paperwork for him.

486
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,692
Come on. Yo.

487
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,986
Actually,
I just need a signature.

488
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,655
Then I'm out of here.

489
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,282
I don't know why Matt
throws these things.

490
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,661
He always ends up holed up in,
uh, some bedroom anyways.

491
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,996
Yo. It's me.

492
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,414
Whoa.

493
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,543
Sorry.

494
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,627
My bad.

495
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,216
Uh, do you think maybe he
could just pop out for a minute or...

496
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,301
Fuck this.

497
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,678
I need a straightener.

498
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,849
Come on, man. Get in here.

499
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,038
Uh, no, I'm good, thanks.

500
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,042
I brought her here.
You know that?

501
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,044
Of course she ends up with him.

502
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,380
It's always the fucking same.

503
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,841
Okay. 

504
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,845
You know what they call me?

505
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,680
Bill?

506
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,807
Dickface.
Oh.

507
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,226
Because of the scar.
Oh, yeah.

508
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,520
Looks like a dick.

509
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,772
You know who never gets laid?

510
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,190
Dickface.

511
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,692
Bingo.

512
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,235
You gonna finish this or what?

513
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,739
No, actually,
I think I'm just gonna...

514
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,033
I never should've gotten
on that fucking boat.

515
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,409
You know the drill
You know the drill

516
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,744
You know the drill

517
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,913
low, ominous music

518
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,333
You talking about that accident?

519
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,044
I told Matt to stop.

520
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,131
What do you mean you told Matt?

521
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,466
He wasn't driving.

522
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,761
Right.

523
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,763
That's right.

524
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,850
You know what?

525
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,603
Fuck it and fuck him.

526
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,855
I-I covered for him, man.

527
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,566
I lied at my trial so...

528
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,444
so that he could go free
and-and bang my girlfriends?

529
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,614
I can't believe that
I was...

530
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,868
That two grand a week
and-and a goddamn Rolex

531
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,578
was worth taking the fall.

532
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,121
And his fucking dad

533
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,040
had to sell two fucking
trucks to cover me

534
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,292
and those cops out
in Ohio.

535
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,919
Hope it was worth it!

536
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,630
Well, if Matt was driving,
why didn't he stop?

537
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,799
Because he was playing chicken.

538
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,677
Except Matt was wasted.

539
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,304
He hated that guy.

540
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,640
Lost half a mil on some
deal because of him.

541
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,643
You want to know the worst part?

542
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,020
Uh...

543
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,605
Not really.

544
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,816
The other guy gave up.

545
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,234
Turned the boat away.

546
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,319
Totally yielded.

547
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,489
And Matt just drove right
fucking into him anyway.

548
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,338
Hey.

549
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,340
Uh...

550
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,301
this all stays between us, huh?

551
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,513
See, I-I really need that two
grand a week.

552
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,268
You're looking at the guy
where secrets go to die.

553
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,236
What the
fuck are you doing to me?

554
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,071
I'm-a get it right now

555
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,617
Oh, God. Mr. Lindsay.

556
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,246
Please don't tell my dad.

557
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,331
I won't, Becca.

558
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,417
If you leave right now.

559
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,047
My man Jim!

560
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,507
You bring
that gun?

561
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,014
You want a hit?

562
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,182
No, thanks.

563
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,267
Uh... just need a signature.

564
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,518
Oh, come on.

565
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,187
Life is short, dude.

566
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,066
low, tense music

567
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,695
Uh, cash or check?

568
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,405
A check?

569
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,074
What is this, 1985?

570
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,910
Relax, I already Venmo'd Fred.

571
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,245
Ah. Okay.

572
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,000
Uh...

573
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,420
"The owner is prohibited
from operating the weapon

574
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,839
while intoxicated--"
Little late for that. 

575
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,137
Uh...

576
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,266
Mm.

577
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,232
Oh-ho!

578
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,402
Oh, sweetheart.

579
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,279
At last...

580
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,658
...you are mine.

581
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,244
Oh!

582
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,165
low, sinister music

583
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,046
You all right, Jim?

584
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,174
Jim?

585
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,639
Thanks for shopping
at Fred's Fish & Game.

586
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,911
low, ominous music

587
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,071
What the hell are you doing?

588
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,075
A-Are you Dexter Morgan?

589
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,703
It's me.

590
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,704
Harrison.

591
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,001
Harrison?
You can't.

592
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,170
Everyone close to you dies.

593
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,339
That's why we're here.

594
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,054
I don't know who
you're talking about.

595
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,390
W-But...

596
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,309
but y-you look just
like I remember.

597
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,062
Just have one of those faces,
I guess.

598
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,026
If you don't want me,
fucking say it.

599
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,198
Doakes.

600
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,950
LaGuerta.

601
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,869
Rita.

602
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,714
low, tense music

603
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,431
Me.

604
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,438
Everyone.

605
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,530
Sorry I'm not the
guy you're looking for.

606
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,952
But if-if you want to
maybe try the town shelter,

607
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,078
it's right on Main Street.

608
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,746
I know the owner, Desiree.

609
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,541
Just tell her Jim Lindsay
sent you and she'll take you in.

610
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:17,086
Whatever you decide,
I'm not gonna...

611
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,715
...report you or anything.

612
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,634
You seem like a good kid.

613
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,095
So...

614
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,849
Um... 

615
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,477
The next bus out of town is,
uh, tomorrow night.

616
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,021
It's 7:45.

617
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,320
I hope you find whoever
you're looking for.

618
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,429
soft, gentle music

619
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,326
You did the right thing.

620
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,078
He'll be safer with Hannah.

621
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,829
It's okay.

622
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,498
I'm glad I went first, Dexter.

623
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,251
I hate to see you like this.

624
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,044
If you had died first,

625
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,798
I would have been lost
in the world without you.

626
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,637
You're a changed man.

627
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,932
Almost ten years without a kill.

628
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,227
And I love you for it.

629
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,770
"All Right" by Sigur Rós

630
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,395
I want him

631
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:47,648
To know

632
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:56,907
What I have done

633
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,955
I want him

634
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,083
Please, please,
please, please, please.

635
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,254
It's bad

636
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,928
I want him

637
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,098
To know

638
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,438
What I have

639
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,232
Done

640
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,697
I want him

641
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,034
To know

642
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,454
Right now

643
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,799
Maybe

644
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,176
It's time

645
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,513
Tomorrow

646
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,724
Or maybe

647
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,818
 Yes!

648
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,029
Bagged me a white fucking buck!

649
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,615
You see that, man?! Holy shit.

650
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,033
I almost tagged you, dude.

651
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,498
Check this out.

652
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,627
You see what I did there,
uh, Jim?

653
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,933
low, ominous music

654
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,414
It's been a long time.

655
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:18,090
But if I'm gonna do this,
I need to do it right.

656
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,219
First rule of the code...

657
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,598
...don't get caught.

658
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,083
bright, energetic music

659
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,619
Sorry about the mess.

660
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,455
I'm out of practice.

661
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,941
Uh...

662
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,486
Huh?

663
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,378
What the fuck, dude?

664
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,966
What...

665
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,551
Hey.

666
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,594
Don't bother struggling.

667
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,180
I'm no Eagle Scout,
but I do know my knots.

668
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,682
What are you doing?

669
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,602
Let's talk
about what you did.

670
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,563
You mean the deer?

671
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,690
He didn't do anything wrong.

672
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,651
He was perfect.

673
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,862
He didn't deserve that.

674
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,364
But as bad as that was,
that's not the worst thing you've done.

675
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,199
You're fucking crazy, man.

676
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,784
Arguably, but not the point.

677
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,870
Then what is?
Tell me what you did!

678
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,875
Own it.

679
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,043
Or?

680
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,305
Or I'll fucking kill you.
What, you're just gonna

681
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,849
fucking execute me
or some shit like that?

682
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,350
Wouldn't be the first time.
You think you can get away

683
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,685
with that?

684
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,687
Again, not the first time.

685
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,689
Wait, you...

686
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,733
You're a serial killer?

687
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,903
I was.

688
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,906
But, you know what,

689
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,157
you're right. Who are
we fucking kidding?

690
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,034
It's not so much that I was.

691
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,454
It's that I am.

692
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:39,458
Okay,
ok-okay, okay. Um...

693
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,210
This is about the boat,
right? Hmm?

694
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,962
Yeah,
the part where you were driving.

695
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,422
The part where the
other guy yielded.

696
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,174
The part where you
rammed him anyway.

697
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,301
The part where five people died

698
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,428
because of you!
All right, all right! Huh.

699
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,014
I did everything you said on the boat,
okay? It's true.

700
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,183
I admit it. I was wrong.

701
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,267
I was wrong!

702
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,769
Just please,

703
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,813
please--
You shot my deer!

704
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,900
And you almost... killed... me!

705
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,737
I promise! I promise,
I will never do anything like it again.

706
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,530
I-I-I swear to you.

707
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,616
I promised the same
thing and look at me now.

708
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,743
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

709
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,079
You don't understand!
It's not my fault!

710
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,705
It's not my fault!

711
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,249
Okay? My mom
died when I was eight!

712
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,627
My dad, he was never around.
He was always working!

713
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:28,715
I-I-I-I had-
I had a sh-shitty childhood,
okay?!

714
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,345
You're blaming this
on bad parenting?

715
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,389
It's true. It's not my fault,
okay?

716
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,765
I didn't have anyone.

717
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,309
I had-I had nothing.

718
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,062
I had no compass. I-I
was just...

719
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,564
You know, I lost both my
parents when I was young, too.

720
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,989
I wouldn't have
had any direction

721
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,657
if it wasn't for Harry.

722
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,327
Who's Harry?

723
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,830
He adopted me.

724
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,415
Th-Then you understand.

725
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,667
You get it.

726
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,961
So you're
not gonna kill me!

727
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,425
We're past the point
of no return on that one.

728
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,222
You know what?

729
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,934
Fuck you, man.

730
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,769
My dad...

731
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,313
he is gonna   destroy   you!

732
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,940
He knows everybody in this town.

733
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,109
They love him. They
would do anything for him.

734
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,944
And when he finds
out what you did to me,

735
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,030
he is gonna find you

736
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,491
and he is gonna rain down

737
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,869
a world of pain on you, man!

738
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,872
You have no idea what
you're doing!

739
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,915
Like you said...

740
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,709
life is short...

741
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,710
dude.

742
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,019
Tonight's the night.

743
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,730
pulsing, tense music

744
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,733
Hello, Dexter Morgan.

745
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,243
Hey, you.
I thought

746
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,079
you were coming to the
Christmas Tree Festival.

747
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,331
Fox got in the henhouse.

748
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,708
It's kind of a mess here.

749
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,710
Oh. Sorry.

750
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,421
Well... we'll miss you.

751
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,840
See you tomorrow?

752
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,841
You bet.

753
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,426
Can't wait.

754
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,889
So...

755
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,099
no Jim.

756
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,934
I'm sorry.

757
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,521
I don't need
trophies anymore.

758
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,942
I may be a monster,
but I'm an evolving monster.

759
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,945
God rest ye merry gentlemen

760
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,656
Let nothing you dismay

761
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,074
Remember Christ

762
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,201
What to do with you?

763
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,037
Was born on Christmas Day

764
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,038
To save us all

765
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,499
Not exactly Miami Bay,

766
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,084
but it does have a hole in it.

767
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,503
Gone astray, oh

768
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,881
Tidings of comfort and joy

769
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,383
Comfort and joy

770
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,426
Oh, tidings

771
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,138
Of comfort and joy

772
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,140
What the
fuck are you doing?

773
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,643
Not listening to you.

774
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,311
All you within

775
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,980
This place

776
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,399
And with true love
and brotherhood

777
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,069
Each other now embrace

778
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,738
This holy tide of Christmas

779
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,157
Doth bring

780
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,409
My life has always been...

781
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,244
truth-adjacent.

782
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,329
Of comfort and joy

783
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,540
But, starting now,
there will be one less lie.

784
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,668
Oh, tidings of comfort

785
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,295
And joy

786
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,595
That's nice.

787
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,762
 Got the tickets?
 Here,

788
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,264
I got them.
Yeah.

789
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,474
We make a stop in Albany,
right?

790
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,977
Uh, yeah, yeah.

791
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,187
Yeah.

792
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,355
Go ahead.
 No, no.

793
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,734
gentle, somber music

794
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,616
I thought you might need this.

795
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,964
You know, after Miami...

796
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,638
...could never get
used to this damn cold.

797
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,901
I thought you didn't know me.

798
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,617
You were right.

799
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,747
I'm Dexter Morgan.

800
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,586
Your father.

801
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,801
Come home.

802
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,015
Please.

803
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,230
My father protected me.

804
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,149
Taught me.

805
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,443
Kept me alive.

806
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:25,864
And that's exactly what
I'm going to do for my son.

807
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,992
low, ominous music

808
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,972
slow, somber music

808
00:55:51,305 --> 00:56:51,269
