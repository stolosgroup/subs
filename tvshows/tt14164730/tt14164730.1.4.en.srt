I can't believe
Molly Park is in Iron Lake.

3
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:09,594
She's a podcaster?

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,846
It's only, like,
the most popular

5
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:12,594
true crime podcast
out there.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,196
You're into true crime?

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,751
I'll text you my top five.

8
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:18,063
Yeah, man, look at this shit.

9
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:20,047
Who's Ethan?

10
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,038
That ball sack over there.

11
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,603
I've always fantasized

12
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:25,313
about hurting Zach like that.

13
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:26,209
Leave Ethan alone.

14
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,044
But you actually did it.

Reservation
Land Management

16
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,424
has footage of Matt Caldwell
shooting that deer.

17
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:36,386
Somebody committed an attack,
then tried to cover it up.

18
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,336
We're looking at foul play.

19
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,945
Search dogs?

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,352
You have to move Matt's body.

21
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:43,118
Those dogs are gonna
walk a straight line

22
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:45,203
from the crime scene
to your firepit.

23
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,738
- Did you hear my news?
- No. What's the news?

24
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,740
He's alive.

25
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,035
Matty's alive.

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,164
That's unbelievable.

28
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,795
What's your theory?

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,590
He couldn't face that
his son was dead,

30
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,428
so he had some
sort of delusion.

31
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:20,180
I don't think so.
He's lying.

32
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,858
- Why?
- He doesn't trust the cops.

33
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:25,522
Wants to take matters
into his own hands.

34
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:26,561
That's what you would do.

35
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,229
Kurt's nothing like me.

36
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:31,819
Do you remember how
enraged he was

37
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,686
when he saw the video
of the other person

38
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:35,654
out there in the woods?

39
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,123
Yeah, he thought
it was a Seneca.

40
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:44,788
He thinks that Johnny Bullhorn
murdered Matt

41
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:48,458
for shooting the deer,

42
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:52,171
and Angela is protecting him.

43
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:58,843
So he gets Angela
to close down the case,

44
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,513
waits for things to cool off...

45
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:03,932
and bam, he kills Johnny.

46
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:05,684
Kurt goes to jail.

47
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:11,272
All because of... you.

48
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:14,484
- It could be worse.
- Worse?

49
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,778
Once the small-town cops
are out of the way,

50
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:19,447
Kurt does due diligence
onto Johnny,

51
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,408
and he realizes
he couldn't have done it.

52
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:25,140
So he keeps digging

53
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:27,414
all the way...

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,462
...to his son's real killer.

55
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,390
Hey there.

56
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,142
Did you hear the news?

57
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:48,351
About Matt?

58
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,145
Can you believe it?

59
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,647
I was right in the first place.
He just skipped town.

60
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,524
Yeah.

61
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,192
Well, who'd you hear it from?

62
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,612
Uh... Kurt.

63
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,281
You talked to Kurt?

64
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:03,658
Yeah, it was late,
so I had to get groceries

65
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:07,787
for Harrison at that 24-hour
market in Moose Creek.

66
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:10,866
And on my way home, I saw Kurt
coming out of The Tavern.

67
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,292
He looked like he'd had
one too many,

68
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:15,837
so I gave him a ride home.
He was celebrating.

69
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,130
Hey, Chief!

70
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:20,717
You were right all along.

71
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,302
Um, I got to go.

72
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,832
I'll talk to you later.
I love you.

73
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,098
Okay. Love you, too.

74
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,564
Morning, buddy.

75
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,150
- You want some breakfast?
- I got it.

76
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,530
Made the team.

77
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:44,866
Coach Logan says
I have to gain five pounds

78
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,076
before the first match.

79
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,204
That's great.
You're making friends.

80
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:53,417
Eh. Most of the guys
on the team are fuck-nuggets.

81
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,253
What?

82
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,047
Your Aunt Deb used to
say that.

83
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,490
Fuck-nuggets.

84
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,259
Oh, yeah.

85
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,638
I wasn't sure what you
remembered. Like, if anything.

86
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:10,183
I don't, much.
Except for the swears.

87
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,311
But, yeah, she was fun.

88
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:16,648
Yes. She was.

89
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,238
You want some of this?

90
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,698
I'd rather put out
a campfire with my face.

91
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:30,078
That was always one of
my favorites.

92
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,038
You miss her?

93
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:35,250
Oh, she's in my thoughts
all the time.

94
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,381
Got to go.

95
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,972
- Later, Dad.
- See you.

96
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,741
Hey.

97
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,661
Ah. Matt always did
keep us on our toes.

98
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,163
Yeah, he really outdid
himself this time, huh?

99
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,999
- Hey, Mr. Caldwell.
- Hey.

100
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,709
Oh. What a relief.

101
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:18,817
- Mm.
- You can say that again.

102
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,356
You know, I knew Matty
would be all right,

103
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,754
he always is,
but I got to tell you,

104
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:22,999
he had me worried this time.

105
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,961
Yeah. Me, too. Me, too.

106
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,845
Oh, hey. Okay.

107
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,014
And what time was this?

108
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,432
Around ten.

109
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:33,766
And you said it was FaceTime,

110
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,018
so did you see where he was?

111
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,021
Looked like a hotel room.

112
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,648
He said he was in New York City.

113
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,110
Did he look injured at all?

114
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:45,653
Injured?

115
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,363
We found his blood in the woods.

116
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,365
Right. Right. Um...

117
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,951
I didn't see any injury. No.

118
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,203
Did he tell you what happened,

119
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,081
or who the other person was
out there? Anything?

120
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:59,500
You know, I-I didn't
think to ask.

121
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:01,377
I mean, I was just very relieved

122
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,541
that my son was alive,
you know?

123
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:06,632
What he put you through,

124
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,701
what... the whole... what
he put the whole town through,

125
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:09,903
it's definitely not okay.

126
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,943
No, it's not.
He owes me a call.

127
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,474
Sure.

128
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,100
I've tried his cell
a number of times.

129
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:17,685
It just goes
straight to voice mail.

130
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,355
So if-if you could help me
get ahold of him...

131
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,274
Look, Chief, if this is about
him killing that white deer

132
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:25,360
on tribal land,
I will pay the fine.

133
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:26,819
You know I'm always good for it.

134
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,318
I'm always cleaning up
his messes.

135
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:29,655
It's not my jurisdiction.

136
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,158
I just need help closing
the missing person's case

137
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:35,536
and clearing up who assaulted
whom in the woods.

138
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,748
Okay, look, I didn't want
to have to get into this,

139
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,584
but, uh, when I saw him
on FaceTime,

140
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,503
he looked like he was
high on something,

141
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:45,088
like he hadn't slept in days.

142
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,215
And he does this sometimes.
He goes on benders.

143
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:51,010
And I won't hear from him
for weeks, or even months.

144
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,762
Well, you heard from him
last night.

145
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,098
Yeah, 'cause he wanted money,
which I wouldn't give him.

146
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,600
I'll try, but-but I'm not
gonna promise anything.

147
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,436
He didn't answer the ten
phone calls I made before that,

148
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,313
or the two after.

149
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:04,607
Man, he acts like a teenager,

150
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,317
but he's a,
he's a 30-year-old man,

151
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:09,279
and at some point you got
to let 'em go, right?

152
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:13,408
No, no.

153
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,034
She's just
out of this meeting now.

154
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:16,369
Right. We can talk
about it. Yeah, yeah.

155
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,335
But we should probably
schedule it

156
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,434
- at another...
- Hi.

157
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,623
Oh, oh, look, I-I'm sorry,
I told her it was

158
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,474
inappropriate for her
to visit me here, so...

159
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,061
Visit you?

160
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,587
Well, you know, we-we...
we've met once before.

161
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:28,881
We-we had a couple of drinks,
and we slept together,

162
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,759
and he was amazing.
Wow, that's some, like, real

163
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:33,344
- Carrie from Homeland shit.
- Uh...

164
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,720
Does it have anything
to do with the case?

165
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:35,972
I know you're a reporter.

166
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,140
I'm not a reporter.

167
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,058
I'm a podcaster.
Print is dead.

168
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,643
I have a real aversion to liars.

169
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,395
Oh, no, I wasn't lying.

170
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,439
I said I was here to help with
the search, and I was.

171
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:45,815
And you're doing a story
about it.

172
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,800
A rich, white,
entitled cisgender guy

173
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,486
illegally shoots
a rare white buck

174
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,572
on reservation land,
and then up and disappears?

175
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:55,741
Of course I am. Was that his dad
you were talking to?

176
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,785
- Well, the story's over, so...
- Have you talked to Matt?

177
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:59,662
It's weird, right?

178
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,456
I mean, the guy evades
law enforcement

179
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,082
and a town full of
concerned citizens.

180
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,584
Finally pops his head up,

181
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,586
and he can't even bother
to answer his cell phone?

182
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,921
- I've been trying him also.
- Okay. You need to leave now.

183
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,465
Do you think that he
attacked someone in the woods?

184
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:11,883
Or do you think his dad
is covering for him,

185
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,509
for some odd, strange...

186
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,095
If you don't leave,
I'm going to arrest you

187
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:18,379
for interfering
with an investigation.

188
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,436
Right. We don't want that.

189
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,813
Call me when you're off. Mm.

190
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,732
Mm-hmm.

191
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:33,446
Okay. I-I...
I just thought that...

192
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,906
Run Matt's credit cards.

193
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,033
I did that a few days ago.
There's no hits.

194
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,576
But you don't buy
what Molly said about...

195
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,578
I don't give a shit
what Molly said.

196
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:42,705
But I do care
about what Kurt said.

197
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,124
Matt is staying at a hotel
in New York.

198
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,252
Run his cards.

199
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:06,020
Poor bastard.

200
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:07,813
I get that he's upset,

201
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,942
but why did he lie
about his son being alive?

202
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,787
Hi-hi, and welcome
to Merry Fucking Kill.

203
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,958
I'm Molly Park, and do I have
a doozy of an episode for you.

204
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,961
Today, I'm doing
the creepy-as-fuck

205
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,214
and truly terrifying
Trinity Killer.

206
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:18,301
Spoiler alert,
he didn't kill in threes.

207
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:21,053
He killed in fucking fours.

208
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:25,766
Let's talk about kill cycle
number one: Lady in the Water.

209
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,812
Trinity would find a young
woman, break into her house,

210
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,690
and then slaughter her
with a straight razor.

211
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:36,360
He left them soaking
in a pool of their own plasma.

212
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,197
The police are finally hip
to his M.O., but, of course,

213
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,783
they don't get it together
fast enough to stop him

214
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:45,202
from one final cut.

215
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:47,288
For this one, he goes rogue.

216
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:50,499
Still a woman,
but this chick is a mother.

217
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,711
A gorgeous,
girl-next-door beauty

218
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:56,297
with a picture-perfect family.

219
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:58,174
And this is the real
fucked-up part.

220
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,010
She has a young baby,

221
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,764
who is in the fucking room
when she dies,

222
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,516
crawling in a pool
of his mother's blood.

223
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,812
How fucked-up is that kid now?
Am I right?

224
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,282
He's usually very friendly.

225
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,034
Maybe he can smell my goats.

226
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,328
I think he's just aggressive
because he hates his name.

227
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,163
I don't know.
I'm new at this.

228
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:32,541
Maybe I got to go empty the dog.
Okay. I'll be back.

229
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,711
Come on, Garfield.

230
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,270
Jim, did you get the alert?

231
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:54,939
Yeah, what's going on?

232
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:56,607
I'm getting to the scene now.

233
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:58,734
All I know is,
there are multiple injuries,

234
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,112
and Harrison is involved.

235
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,343
Stay back, please.

236
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,268
- Jim. Jim!
- Where's my son?

237
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,592
They're working on him
inside. This way.

238
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:41,277
Harrison, are you okay?

239
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,279
Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.

240
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,448
Fortunately the stab
wound isn't very deep.

241
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,241
Who stabbed you?

242
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,036
It's-it's... it's not,
it's not that bad.

243
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,748
Harrison, when Tess
found you and Ethan,

244
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,000
she said that you told her
something about

245
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,626
a planned school shooting.

246
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,630
Uh, yeah, that's-that's how
this all started.

247
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,675
Uh, Ethan asked me
to meet him backstage.

248
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,053
And-and then, um,
when we were alone, he,

249
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,389
he told me he wanted to get
revenge on all these kids

250
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,975
that have been bullying him.

251
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,729
He was just gonna
bring guns to school

252
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,231
- and open fire.
- Why did he tell you that?

253
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:22,777
He, um...

254
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:24,653
Because he wanted me
to do it with him.

255
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,822
And what happened next?

256
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,408
I told him,
I mean, I-I get it.

257
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:33,245
I mean, feeling angry
and-and feeling bullied.

258
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,955
But I said, "There's
got to be some other way

259
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,916
we can handle it." I tried
to get him to come with me

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,295
to talk to a teacher,
or get him some help, you know?

261
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:46,342
But, um, that's when he pulled
a knife out of his backpack.

262
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:51,598
He just came right at me
and stabbed me.

263
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:58,521
Logan,
check the backpack.

264
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,481
On it.

265
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,236
And then what happened?

266
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,627
Well, it, it all
happened so fast.

267
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,400
I mean, I-I just,
I was really scared,

268
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,534
and I just, like, tackled him

269
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,619
and the knife came out
of his hands, and-and

270
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,329
I-I got to it first,
then I-I was,

271
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:17,748
I was waving it in front of me,
telling him to stop,

272
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:20,960
but he just kept charging at me,
like he was crazy, you know?

273
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,212
And...
And that's, um,

274
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,713
that's when I got his leg.

275
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,882
I-I think I... I think I cut him
really bad.

276
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,427
He was... he was bleeding so
much, I could... I could see it

277
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:32,721
soaking through his jeans,
and, um...

278
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,723
then he passed out.

279
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,686
Is-is he... is he gonna die?

280
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,481
I... I-I didn't mean to hurt him
like that, I swear.

281
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:46,694
I-I didn't mean
to hurt him like that, Dad.

282
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:49,697
Angela?

283
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,074
I think you need
to take a look at this.

284
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,208
Oh, Jesus.

285
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,588
It's a kill list.

286
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,761
Um...

287
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,764
Did Ethan talk to anyone else
about this?

288
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,435
Is there anyone else who could
have been in on it with him?

289
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,354
No.

290
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:25,107
I'm his only friend.

291
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,985
Okay.

292
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,947
Logan, you and I are going
to Ethan's house immediately.

293
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,407
We need to check on his parents.

294
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:35,731
There may be weapons
or explosives there.

295
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:48,881
Come in.

296
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,220
- Did you take your antibiotic?
- Yeah.

297
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,521
How's it feeling?

298
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,156
I'm pretty freaked out.

299
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:08,192
Oh.

300
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:11,272
I just keep...
I keep replaying it.

301
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,280
Ethan coming at me
with that knife.

302
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:22,039
You ever have a situation scare
the shit out of you like that?

303
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,418
Yeah.

304
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:33,926
What do you do to deal?

305
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,344
I wrap bad guys

306
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,304
in plastic and kill them.

307
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:39,891
I, um, guess I...

308
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,730
I'm not sure.

309
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,694
Right. No, for sure.

310
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:56,198
I mean, you can still talk about
it more with me if you want.

311
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,367
No, I'm okay.

312
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,453
Really. I'm fine.

313
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,748
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

314
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,920
- Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

315
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,931
Aw.

316
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:24,143
Who's the world's greatest dad?

317
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:26,812
That's funny.
That's good, Deb.

318
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:29,648
Man, to think,
from the moment he was born,

319
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:32,985
you were worried that he would
inherit your fucked-up genes.

320
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:35,279
But...

321
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:39,450
he's emotional,
he's empathetic, personable,

322
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:43,746
popular, heroic even.

323
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,247
And you're so different.

324
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,915
It's gonna be impossible

325
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,836
for you to have a relationship
with your own son.

326
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:20,364
I can stay home
with you today, if you want.

327
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,452
I know school's shut down.

328
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,705
No, it's cool. Ow.

329
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,167
I can just...
I can hang here by myself.

330
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:36,174
What are you looking at?

331
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:39,927
When Ethan came at you,
you were...

332
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:42,805
facing him, right?

333
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,515
He suddenly charged at you?

334
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,433
- What are you...?
- That's what you told Angela.

335
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:48,018
Yeah.

336
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:49,770
Did he knock you down first?

337
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:51,647
- I-I don't remember.
- Do you remember

338
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,591
if he was holding the knife
in his left or right hand?

339
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:56,110
No, I-I don't remember which
fucking hand. I was attacked.

340
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:57,486
It's not every day that type

341
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,711
- of shit happens to me.
- I know. I...

342
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:00,540
Well, then
why are you interrogating me?

343
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,282
Sorry.

344
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:04,284
It's just my old forensic brain.

345
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,537
I know
you've been through a lot.

346
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:09,498
Just stabbed
by my friend, is all.

347
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,046
Where are you going?

348
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,342
Outside to breathe some fresh,
cold air.

349
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:24,555
Is that all right, or do you
have questions about that, too?

350
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,274
What are you doing?

351
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,776
The stab wound doesn't match
the story he told Angela.

352
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,070
Something's off.

353
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:42,239
You're off.

354
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:44,491
He's normal.

355
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,744
Details get mixed up.

356
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:50,831
Normal people, you know,
fuckers who aren't mental cases,

357
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:54,752
they get rattled
when crazy shit happens.

358
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,964
I hope you're right.

359
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,049
Do you?

360
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,343
Nah, he wasn't there
when we arrived on scene.

361
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,220
Yeah, I don't know
what happened there, but, uh...

362
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,972
Nah, I don't know.

363
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:09,683
Yeah, you know, they said
that we need to go back, so...

364
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,442
Excuse me?

365
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:27,285
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Williams.
Um...

366
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:31,789
I-I just came
to see how Ethan was doing.

367
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,209
He's still very sedated.

368
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,252
He lost so much blood,
he could have died

369
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,089
if the paramedics hadn't gotten
there as quickly as they did.

370
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,967
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:47,221
I... I-I didn't mean to, um...

372
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:52,435
E-Ethan's, like,
my only friend here.

373
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:55,771
He liked you, too.

374
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,814
How-how are you doing?

375
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:00,484
Oh, I'm... I'm okay.

376
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:04,279
Um... maybe, uh,
maybe when Ethan's better

377
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,282
- and comes home...
- He isn't coming home.

378
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,034
Well, I thought
that the-the surgery...

379
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,203
What do you think
is going on here?

380
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:13,288
Iron Lake isn't
our home anymore.

381
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,123
We've been getting
death threats.

382
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,126
No one's ever gonna buy anything
from my store again.

383
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,254
We have to sell our house
and leave.

384
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:23,590
And Ethan's probably going
to juvie.

385
00:21:23,674 --> 00:21:26,635
- Why didn't you come to us?
- Beth, it's not his fault.

386
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,721
If you had just told me,
I could have helped.

387
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:33,392
God, it didn't need
to happen this way.

388
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,853
You should have come to us!

389
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,198
Listen,

390
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:50,200
she's obviously very upset.

391
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:52,453
We both are.

392
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,291
You should know
we appreciate what you did.

393
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,628
It could've been a lot worse.

394
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:06,133
But we don't ever want
to see you again.

395
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,427
You understand?

396
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,813
Hey, Jim.

397
00:22:19,897 --> 00:22:21,189
How's Harrison?

398
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,276
Uh, he's okay,
all things considered.

399
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,361
I heard the stab wound
wasn't too deep.

400
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,447
Yeah, you know
about as much as I do, then.

401
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:35,370
Going
to the police station to see

402
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,956
if your son is lying
about a stabbing he was in.

403
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,418
What page of
the parenting handbook is that?

404
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,222
Are you sure
you want to look at that?

405
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,934
I'm curious.

406
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:03,690
Jim, I'm a cop,

407
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:05,817
and I'm messed up knowing
that Audrey was meant

408
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,028
to be a victim of Ethan's.

409
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:10,697
But your son actually
was attacked.

410
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,866
I was meant to be a victim?

411
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,576
Audz, I told you,
you cannot be in here.

412
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,578
- Don't change the subject.
- Audrey.

413
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,747
I deserve to know if I was.

414
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:24,086
- Holy shit.
- Audz, out. Out.

415
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,754
- Now!
- What about Jim?

416
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,673
- Why is he in here?
- He should go, too.

417
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:31,885
I actually have some information
that might be helpful.

418
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,887
You do?

419
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,056
Yeah, the weapons you found
stashed in Ethan's room,

420
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,891
they're from Fred's.

421
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:40,978
I sold them to Ethan's father
a couple of months ago.

422
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,859
Along with that knife.

423
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,503
What is your problem?

424
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:09,756
The angle of the penetration
of his wound,

425
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,884
the blood spatter.

426
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:15,053
Nothing matches his story.

427
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:16,888
His story?

428
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:19,641
He was stabbed,
non-fictitiously.

429
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,351
It doesn't add up.

430
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:22,894
Everything he said about Ethan
turned out to be true.

431
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:25,981
The kill list, the weapons.
It all adds up.

432
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:37,910
Prove it.

433
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,620
What?

434
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,541
You're Ethan. I'm Harrison.
Show me what happened.

435
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,837
- Do it.
- You are fucking crazy.

436
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,755
- Harrison's lying.
- You can't handle the fact

437
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,466
that Harrison is a hero.

438
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,093
That was always your wet dream.

439
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:57,888
Yay!

440
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:01,558
And you can't stand the fact
that he's living it,

441
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:03,351
because you are a jealous,

442
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,479
fucking pussy.

443
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:09,941
Blood doesn't lie.

444
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,735
The spatter doesn't match.

445
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,699
How do we recreate
these patterns?

446
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:21,412
I don't know.

447
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:26,374
This time we see if Harrison
attacked Ethan first.

448
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,546
What are you trying to do here?

449
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,548
- Make sense of this.
- No, you're not.

450
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:37,511
You're trying to make him
into a monster, like you.

451
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:42,557
'Cause that's the only way you
can feel like a real dad, right?

452
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,018
Is if he looks up to you
and wants to be like you

453
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:47,938
so you could have some sick-ass
serial killer family.

454
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:51,984
He's a good kid.
He's nothing like you.

455
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,779
I am so sick of your bullshit.

456
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:05,705
It matches.

457
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,791
Stop it!

458
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:11,295
This is all in your head!
You are creating this!

459
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,641
Ethan was the one trying
to get away.

460
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:26,602
No.

461
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:31,815
Harrison attacked him
from behind.

462
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:35,986
Then he stabbed himself
to sell us on this story.

463
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,614
He planned the whole thing.

464
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,534
Tell me
that's not what happened.

465
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:45,120
Why would Harrison slash
Ethan first?

466
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,331
He didn't hate him.

467
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,841
He wanted to know
what it felt like.

468
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:07,267
It's almost like
he fit the Code.

469
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,159
Smells good.

470
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,887
He even eats like me.

471
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,518
What?

472
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,187
How you feeling?

473
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,272
Lot less pain, actually.

474
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:56,274
I know school's back on,
but they'd understand

475
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:58,402
if you stayed home another day.

476
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,363
I want to get back
into a routine.

477
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,323
I totally get that.

478
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:05,033
I totally get that.

479
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:09,746
So did you notice anything
going on with Ethan

480
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,040
before that day?

481
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:18,422
I didn't know anything until
Ethan got me alone at school.

482
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,519
- Kurt, what's going on?
- Hey, Jim.

483
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:35,855
Well, I just thought
I'd bring Iron Lake's own hero

484
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:37,857
a little show of appreciation.

485
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:39,526
- Oh.
- How's he doing?

486
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,363
He's a little rattled,
as you can imagine,

487
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:44,989
but I can take it in to him.

488
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:47,075
Was kind of hoping
to shake his hand,

489
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,620
thank him personally, you know?

490
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:52,330
- Okay.
- Yeah?

491
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,666
Sure.

492
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,751
Hey!

493
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,879
There he is. Hey, stud.

494
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:02,757
I, uh,
got you a little something

495
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,051
for keeping our town safe.

496
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:07,220
Thanks.

497
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:08,888
- Just, yeah, go ahead, open it.
- Oh.

498
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:10,933
It's for you.

499
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:14,436
- Oh.
- Huh?

500
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,938
Holy shit. A...

501
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,314
A drone.

502
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:20,817
This is really cool.

503
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:22,068
Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.

504
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:23,987
Oh, just call me Kurt.

505
00:29:24,071 --> 00:29:26,030
Okay.

506
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,491
Well, I, um,
I should... I should go.

507
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:30,493
Thanks again, Kurt.

508
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:32,996
Yeah. No, well, thank you.
Thank you, son.

509
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:51,431
Ah, boy, must be nice.

510
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:52,974
Hmm?

511
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:55,059
Having a hero for a son.

512
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:56,686
Ah.

513
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,273
Yeah, my Matt,
he's... he's the opposite.

514
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:02,275
Well, he seems like a fun person
to be around.

515
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,403
Ah, no, he's a fuckup.

516
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:06,738
Wish I'd done something about it

517
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:08,072
when he first started
fucking up.

518
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,657
Kept thinking
he'd grow out of it.

519
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,493
But there was a darkness in him,

520
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,453
- and you knew it.
- Yeah, but I just kept

521
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:16,123
helping him get out of trouble.

522
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:22,796
But it's not really
Matt's fault, you know?

523
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,422
It's my fault.

524
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:25,965
I wouldn't say that.

525
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:28,510
Well... the truth is,

526
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,429
I just raised a terrible kid.

527
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:35,725
I mean, my Matt's much more
like Ethan than he is Harrison.

528
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:37,477
- No.
- No, he's worse.

529
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:39,062
I-I mean, Ethan might have
wanted to kill people,

530
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:40,522
but Matt actually did.

531
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:42,649
Hey, he didn't mean
to crash that boat.

532
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,317
He didn't crash it.

533
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:46,694
He wasn't driving.

534
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,739
No, I know. I meant it
the same way you did.

535
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:51,903
How do you even know
about that?

536
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,869
My girlfriend's
the chief of police.

537
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,872
And not
to throw anyone under the bus,

538
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,500
but Esther's a bit of a gossip.

539
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:03,294
Mm-hmm.

540
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:05,922
So what did Esther
and your girlfriend say

541
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:07,715
about the boat accident?

542
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,717
That Matt wasn't driving,

543
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,971
and that teenagers do
stupid things.

544
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:14,556
He wasn't a teenager.

545
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,974
Oh, I didn't know that.

546
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:18,226
I knew that.

547
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,229
Look, Kurt, you can't
carry around this guilt.

548
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,607
Kids are born the way they are.

549
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:27,485
I wasn't in Harrison's life
for the last ten years.

550
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:29,446
Look how he turned out.

551
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,577
Yeah, you're right.

552
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,287
I appreciate that.

553
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,207
But you'll see.

554
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,917
You know, if Harrison
ever does anything wrong,

555
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,713
it is hard not
to feel responsible for it.

556
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,930
Fuck.

557
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,892
The guy's fishing,
and I just nibbled.

558
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:06,149
- Hey.
- So,

559
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,692
I just wanted
to formally let you know

560
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:09,110
that we're not bringing
any charges

561
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,112
against Harrison
for stabbing Ethan.

562
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,615
It's been ruled
an act of self-defense,

563
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:16,117
no matter what Ethan tried
to claim.

564
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,119
What did he say?

565
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,998
He swears
he never stabbed Harrison.

566
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,958
Well, how does he explain...?

567
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,961
He said that Harrison
just suddenly slashed him.

568
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,285
And that's the last thing
he remembers.

569
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,552
You know, I try to have
some compassion for him.

570
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:36,888
He's clearly a troubled kid.

571
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:39,140
Yeah.

572
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:43,102
So, we're moving forward
with our case against Ethan.

573
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:44,562
And I don't know if you want me

574
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:46,105
to put you in touch
with a lawyer,

575
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:48,149
if you want to look
into a civil case, or...

576
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,818
No, he and his family
are going through enough.

577
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,529
Wow.
If I were in your position,

578
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:55,615
I don't know if I could be
so compassionate.

579
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:59,035
You're a good person, Jim.

580
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,703
Take it.

581
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:01,829
I'll call you later?

582
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,957
Okay. I love you.

583
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,084
Love you, too.

584
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:11,715
Chief Bishop.

585
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,458
Ethan's telling the truth.

586
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:20,264
This wound wasn't made
by a hunting knife.

587
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:23,434
Harrison brought his own weapon
to school that day.

588
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:26,229
Hey.
I heard your son was amazing.

589
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,151
Gonna call you back.

590
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,528
Just wait a minute.

591
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,447
I come with a peace offering.

592
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,496
I'm not drinking, Molly.

593
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,789
Well, there's no point
in sticking around.

594
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,124
I've alienated the one person

595
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,667
that I needed
to tell this story.

596
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,951
Can I get that in writing?

597
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,054
Consider this...
my goodbye present.

598
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,890
Faith Darwas.
Three days ago,

599
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,060
outside
of a Dollar Store in Tulsa.

600
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:10,606
I googled a few of your, uh,
names on this Carrie board here.

601
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,108
Which, by the way, is not a jab.

602
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:13,818
I mean,
that it's crazy thorough,

603
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,612
which is how
people describe my work.

604
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:18,781
How did you get this?

605
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:21,200
I posted their pics on my
Merry Fucking Kill Insta-feed.

606
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:23,745
You'd be surprised
what 800,000 amateur sleuths

607
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,456
can dig up
in a matter of hours.

608
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,667
I also got
her last three addresses

609
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,085
and a cell phone number.

610
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,213
- You talked to her?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

611
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,715
She goes by Lauren now.

612
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,925
She left because her mom was
a pill-popper

613
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,553
with a rotating door
of shitty boyfriends.

614
00:34:40,637 --> 00:34:42,221
She's doing a lot better now.

615
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:44,682
So she was just another runaway.

616
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:47,018
Just like everybody said.

617
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:51,272
She is alive.
That's a good thing.

618
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,734
Well, yeah, of course.
It's just...

619
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:57,862
Um...

620
00:34:57,946 --> 00:34:59,947
Maybe I am fucking crazy.

621
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,241
Look, I pretty much
traffic in crazy,

622
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:04,494
and you are
most definitely not.

623
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,331
I posted these ones, as well.

624
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:12,001
Nothing. Not one sighting.

625
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:15,171
Not even a psychic claiming to
feel their aura in New Mexico,

626
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:17,215
and I usually get
at least three of those.

627
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,717
So whoever these women are,

628
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,469
they are most definitely
missing.

629
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,097
And no one is looking
for them, except for you.

630
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:27,100
Let me in on your theory.

631
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:29,227
'Cause I know you got one.

632
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:40,005
When I was in high school,
my best friend disappeared.

633
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:42,824
Iris.

634
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,076
Everyone said she ran away.

635
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,744
No one looked for her.

636
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:48,371
It stuck with you.

637
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:51,624
So, when I became a cop,
I promised myself

638
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,252
that I'd be different.

639
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:57,004
I got a reputation as being
the cop who would listen.

640
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,340
I started collecting
these women's stories.

641
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,342
Poor, from troubled homes.

642
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:02,718
Some of them Native.

643
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:06,597
Everyone assumes
they just moved on.

644
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:12,729
But I know in my gut something
terrible is happening to them.

645
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:18,025
I know
you don't want to hear this,

646
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,153
but I think
we should form an alliance.

647
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,157
I mean,
what if I followed the story

648
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:27,076
while you investigate,
from a close proximity?

649
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,495
I mean, you said it yourself.
You need resources.

650
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,956
And I've got an army
of armchair detectives.

651
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,001
I-I thought you wanted
to do the Matt Caldwell story.

652
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:37,628
Well, you know, every great
podcast starts about one thing

653
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,423
and then ends up somewhere
completely unexpected.

654
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,557
If you want to help me
shed light on these women,

655
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,058
I'll take it.

656
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,227
Great.

657
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,188
Okay.

658
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:58,232
I know
this is gonna take a while,

659
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,278
but I need you to run me
through everything you have.

660
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:10,745
Okay. Now I'm ready.

661
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:23,591
Uh, yeah, come in.

662
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:26,469
Mr. Caldwell,
sorry to bother you,

663
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:28,387
but a few customers
have mentioned

664
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:30,723
- the girl camped out in our...
- Uh, I'll take care of it.

665
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:32,767
- Really? I don't mind.
- I got it.

666
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,936
Thanks, Susan.

667
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,323
Hi, Kurt. Just checking

668
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:49,242
to see
if you've heard from Matt.

669
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:52,453
I have a couple of questions
that I need to ask, so...

670
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,515
Okay.

671
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,898
Hey, uh, Chloe, right?

672
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:23,859
Yeah. Look, I-I know I said
I was gonna use that money

673
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:25,903
you gave me
to get bus fare to my mom's,

674
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:28,406
but I, I was really hungry

675
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,824
and-and I needed
to buy a new coat,

676
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,284
'cause it's cold
as hell out there,

677
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:33,745
- and I just...
- It's okay. It's okay.

678
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:38,207
If you spot me another 80,

679
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,001
I will get that bus fare.

680
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,919
I swear, just-just give me
your address, and I'll...

681
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:44,005
and I'll send it back to you
as soon as I get to my mom's.

682
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:47,050
I can't keep
giving you money, sweetheart.

683
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,598
You know what I can give you?

684
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:57,476
A job.

685
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,478
Waitress at the diner.

686
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:01,480
Make your own money.
What do you say?

687
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:07,821
The thing is, I'm...
I'm not staying.

688
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,865
I just need bus fare.

689
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,159
Can you just

690
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:15,412
help me with that?

691
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:21,500
Coach Logan, or should I say
Sergeant Logan,

692
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:23,711
who is here with us today
in his official capacity

693
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,715
to talk to you because you were
on Ethan's list. Listen up.

694
00:39:33,346 --> 00:39:34,555
Hey, everyone.

695
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,807
What's up, Coach?

696
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,185
Okay, okay, settle down.

697
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:43,230
Um... first of all,

698
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,192
I want to say how proud I am of
how you all handled yourselves

699
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:49,445
during a situation
I obviously wish

700
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,281
you'd never had to experience.

701
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:03,334
You acted with... maturity

702
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:05,419
and courage.

703
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,381
Uh, but please be understanding
of yourselves,

704
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:10,174
or-or any of your friends

705
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:13,470
who are going through
a tough time in the aftermath.

706
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:17,598
Counseling is being offered
to each of you.

707
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:21,268
It's a scary thing

708
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,354
to be targeted like that.

709
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:25,719
It's good to talk about it,
how you feel.

710
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,404
Uh, I'd like
to open this up to anyone

711
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,696
who'd like
to share their concerns or...

712
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,824
or ask me any questions.

713
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,993
Zach.

714
00:40:38,077 --> 00:40:41,580
Uh, yeah, I just want
to give a shout-out to Harrison

715
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:43,666
for saving all our asses.

716
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,092
Um, yeah, I-I think
I speak for all of us

717
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:55,636
when I say how grateful we are

718
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,471
that you're a part
of our community.

719
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,015
- Speech!
- Speech!

720
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,684
Speech! Speech! Speech!

721
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:03,436
Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech!

722
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,120
All right, but if he
doesn't want to talk, it's okay.

723
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,484
I mean, I don't really
know what to say.

724
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,988
Um, I'm glad no one got hurt.

725
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:17,367
Except Ethan.

726
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:21,912
You-you know, personally,

727
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:24,707
I don't really hold anything
against Ethan.

728
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:29,795
I mean, yeah, he, uh, he planned
to do something terrible.

729
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:32,840
And he ended up stabbing me,

730
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,259
but, uh,

731
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:38,054
you guys picked on him
for years.

732
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,559
You-you beat him up,
made fun of him.

733
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,395
You kind of made his life hell,
you know?

734
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,855
And I guess it's like, yeah,

735
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,524
yeah, we're all victims,
or whatever.

736
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,819
And I know everyone's saying
that Ethan was a-a-a psycho

737
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:57,323
or a-a monster or something,

738
00:41:57,407 --> 00:42:00,285
but he was definitely
also a victim.

739
00:42:02,328 --> 00:42:04,205
So...

740
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,740
I don't know.

741
00:42:08,835 --> 00:42:11,045
I guess
we all have two sides to us.

742
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:15,299
Maybe we're a little bit hero
and a little bit,

743
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:19,845
I-I don't know, monster.

744
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:23,141
It's all about
which side wins out in the end.

745
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,065
Trinity used a straight razor

746
00:43:13,149 --> 00:43:17,403
to kill his mother.

747
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,456
He was born in blood,
just like you.

748
00:43:23,354 --> 00:43:25,557
He has my Dark Passenger.

749
00:43:26,305 --> 00:44:26,563
