<b>1x01 - Legendary Sandwich</b>

4
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,538
<i>It's no use, Sparkle-face.</i>

5
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,175
<i>We'll be trapped in this
candy dungeon forever!</i>

6
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:29,776
Don't give up, Butterbean.

7
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:36,114
Great. Right in the middle of the
best part of Pretty Pretty Pegasus.

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,481
And so I kicked another dirt
monster into a furnace,

9
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:43,350
and then I was all, "I bet
that really burns you up."

10
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:46,716
It's like a metaphor. Boo-yah!

11
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:49,487
That's too much, dude.

12
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:51,853
He didn't hear me though.
He was on fire.

13
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:55,390
Ah, boo-yah!

14
00:00:57,394 --> 00:01:00,029
Ah, seriously? You
guys eat like animals.

15
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,733
Oh, that's so good.

16
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:08,903
- What, Raven?
- Well, I guess you get a pass.

17
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:12,339
- But you two are disgusting.
- Hmm, sorry.

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,974
It's just Robin makes
the best sandwiches.

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,776
It's true. I've developed
a sandwich design

20
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,245
that will take your mouth
on a flavor journey.

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,049
A flavor journey worth
a journey of its own.

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,452
Oh, yeah. I'd crawl
over a hundred miles

23
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,087
of broken glass for
this sandwich.

24
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,055
I'd drive across the country
in a car that smelled

25
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,891
like Cyborg's B.O. for this sandwich.
Ha-ha.

26
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,962
Ain't no mountain high enough to
keep me away from this sandwich.

27
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,965
Well, yeah, I'd do some, uh,
incredibly difficult stuff

28
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,533
for that sandwich, actually.

29
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,070
So, you're saying, you'd
leave this tower,

30
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,871
if I told you where to
find a good sandwich?

31
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:50,741
Sure, but it would have to be a
legendary sandwich, like mine.

32
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,844
There is an ancient
sandwich of power,

33
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:56,880
hidden away from those who
would use its power for evil.

34
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:00,617
Okay, first of all, that's
dumb and you made it up.

35
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:04,588
Second, even if it is true, my
sandwiches are the best, period.

36
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:07,591
Oh, but it is true. Behold.

37
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,295
Oh, is it story time?

38
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:14,297
<i>In an age long forgotten,</i>

39
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,365
<i>an old king summoned
his Sandwich Wizard.</i>

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,301
<i>The King commanded him to
create a sandwich of power.</i>

41
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,203
<i>The Sandwich Wizard labored
in his tower for six days.</i>

42
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:25,673
<i>On the seventh, he brought the
sandwich before the king,</i>

43
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,642
<i>and it was glorious. It would
grant him eternal life.</i>

44
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:30,710
<i>So he could rule his
kingdom forever.</i>

45
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,079
It was also delicious.

46
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:36,049
- Cool.
- Delicious?

47
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:38,751
<i>One night, the prince
betrayed the king,</i>

48
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,219
<i>and tried to steal the sandwich.</i>

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,121
<i>The old king was heart-broken.</i>

50
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,623
<i>He realized the sandwich
was too powerful.</i>

51
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,258
<i>It had to be destroyed.</i>

52
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:49,128
<i>So the ingredients were hidden away
in the far corners of the world.</i>

53
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,731
<i>Watched by the fierce
Sandwich Guardians.</i>

54
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,400
Legend says, it can be reforged

55
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,335
if all the ingredients
are brought together.

56
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:57,970
We got to get that sandwich.

57
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:00,172
Oh, man! I want to eat it twice.

58
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,974
The sandwich will look
beautiful in my hair.

59
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:05,744
No way can it top my
sandwich science.

60
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,614
What are we waiting for?
Titans, go!

61
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,584
Finally.

62
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:16,120
<i>We have to get the candy
keys from Gumdrop Goblin.</i>

63
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,889
<i>Or we'll never make it to Princess
Puffball's birthday party.</i>

64
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,524
<i>Hey, Raven.</i>

65
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,159
Uh, I thought you were
making a sandwich.

66
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:23,661
We have no idea where to look.

67
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,031
There are four ingredients.

68
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,833
<i>The mystical bacon is
here on the Lava Lake.</i>

69
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:31,600
I got the heat resistors, baby.

70
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,136
I'm on it.

71
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:38,440
<i>The next ingredient is the king's
lettuce, buried deep underground.</i>

72
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:39,941
I can dig it.

73
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:43,911
<i>The next ingredient is
the stellar tomato.</i>

74
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:45,479
<i>Hidden among the stars.</i>

75
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,082
I shall retrieve the tomato.

76
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:51,551
Okay, let's do this.

77
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:54,054
I assume you saved the
most dangerous ingredient

78
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:55,388
for the leader of the Titans.

79
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,992
Oh, yes, the last ingredient is
pretzel bread. It can be found...

80
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:02,495
At the supermarket.

81
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,130
<i>Here is a coupon.</i>

82
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,841
<i>With the candy keys,
we'll be able to make</i>

83
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:20,810
<i>Princess Puffball's birthday
where all dreams come true.</i>

84
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:22,678
You rock, Butterbean.

85
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,048
Let's see.

86
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,717
<i>According to that ancient map,
it should be right around here.</i>

87
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Boo-yah!

88
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,262
Too easy, baby.

89
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,465
Whoa! Sandwich Guardian.

90
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:49,270
<i>Uh-huh, I'm digging,</i>

91
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:51,272
<i>I'm digging, digging
like a pro, yo.</i>

92
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:52,440
Digging, dig...

93
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:56,877
Oh, yeah, lettuce. I'm so
close, I can smell it.

94
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,749
Awesome.

95
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,751
<i>Sandwich Guardian dude.</i>

96
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:17,194
This must be the containment
vessel for the tomato.

97
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,165
How did anyone manage to transport
this Earth fruit to the Lylap System?

98
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:27,003
This is an excessive
use of force, sir.

99
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,851
<i>Whoa!</i>

100
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:54,770
I need some pretzel bread.
The freshest you've got.

101
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:57,094
Make it quick. This place
is really bumming me out.

102
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:08,176
You are gonna need a drink of
water with this hot sauce, baby.

103
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,678
Oh, it's on now.
Give me that bacon.

104
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,183
Looks, you're pretty angry, huh?

105
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,151
<i>Whoa!</i>

106
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:26,853
Hey, we cool, man!

107
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,960
Okay, dude. Let's talk
about this face to face.

108
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,905
I am thinking perhaps this is
too much trouble for a tomato.

109
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:57,377
I mean, you see, some people
prefer swords or, like, lasers.

110
00:06:57,412 --> 00:07:01,147
But I like to use this staff.
See? Just...

111
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:02,214
Right on the head.

112
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,589
The knee, crack! Clavicle...
whatever!

113
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,185
Really gets the job done.

114
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,131
My arm!

115
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:31,572
<i>My hair!</i>

116
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:38,278
My teeth!

117
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:30,688
Yes!

118
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,390
Yes!

119
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:35,625
Yes!

120
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:37,393
Whatever.

121
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:44,599
<i>Oh, look, Sparkle-face.
It's Licorice Forest.</i>

122
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,963
<i>Isn't that place full of trolls?</i>

123
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:51,238
Don't be silly, Sparkle-face.
It's the home of our new friend.

124
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:55,107
Princess Silkiesoft. Nice to
meet you, Princess Silkiesoft.

125
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,343
Your hair sure is...

126
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:59,745
Bad, Silkie.

127
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:08,419
You're back already?

128
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:15,792
Dude, those Sandwich Guardians
were way tougher than we thought.

129
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:18,261
Yeah, no kidding, but look.

130
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,098
- You mean the legend's actually true?
- This sandwich better be worth it.

131
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,723
You know how long it's gonna take me
to build a new hand with one hand?

132
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:31,005
Wow, the supermarket was brutal. I
barely made it out of there alive.

133
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,540
Hey, Starfire. I like what
you did with your hair.

134
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,277
What?

135
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:42,180
Now I will speak the ancient
legendary sandwich words of power.

136
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:57,060
The key to immortality,
and a delicious lunch.

137
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:00,129
Eh, my sandwiches
still look better.

138
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,932
Well, as team leader,
and sandwich expert,

139
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:07,669
- I should get the first bite.
- Hold on now.

140
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:10,138
I lost an arm for this sandwich.
I get first dibs.

141
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:14,141
But I lost my hair. Surely that
is more important an a hand.

142
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:15,976
I should get the first of bites.

143
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,712
Dudes, I should get
the first bite.

144
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,615
I got the worst of it.
Look at this.

145
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:25,551
How are you gonna eat with no teeth?
You gonna gum the sandwich down?

146
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:32,491
- Silkie, stop.
- Mama's little Bumgorf, no!

147
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,993
That's not for you!

148
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:45,236
I told you that
sandwich wasn't great.

149
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:47,872
So, anyone wanna watch
Pretty Pretty Pegasus?

150
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:51,930
<b>1x02 - Pie Bros</b>

151
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:01,072
- What is that?
- A birthday gift for Cyborg.

152
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,274
<i>I'm drawing him as a
dog, and me as a robot.</i>

153
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,277
Okay, and you think
he's gonna like it?

154
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:10,180
As his best friend
in the whole world,

155
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,348
I always know exactly
what he wants.

156
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:14,850
Hey, Beast Bud. You hungry?

157
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:18,787
- Watch this.
- You know, I kinda feel like having...

158
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:21,456
- Pie, perhaps?
- How did you know?

159
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:26,060
It's my job to know. And
'cause I love pie, too!

160
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:28,762
<i>When I say "I want"
you say, "Pie"</i>

161
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,964
<i>- I want...
- Pie!</i>

162
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,032
<i>When I say "Yummy"
you say, "Pie"</i>

163
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:35,234
<i>- Yummy...
- Pie!</i>

164
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:37,235
<i>- Apple, peach -
Rhubarb, or pear</i>

165
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,470
<i>Any kind, we don't care.</i>

166
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,372
<i>- I love pie - Yeah, I love pie</i>

167
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:43,874
<i>Oh, we love, love,
love love, love pie</i>

168
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:46,943
Yeah, dude. Warm pie.

169
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,111
I need a slice.

170
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,380
Yup, he is gonna love my gift.

171
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:01,154
- Time to get our pie on.
- You guys really like pie.

172
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:04,924
Who doesn't? Ooh,
whatcha got there?

173
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,432
Mmm.

174
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,001
Oh, wow, blueberry.

175
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,972
- Uh, gross.
- Relax, I just washed my hands.

176
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,641
And I've lost my appetite.

177
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:27,244
The Mother Mae Eye makes the
best pies in all of Jump City.

178
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:35,252
- I wonder what her secret is.
- I hear she bakes people into her pies.

179
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:42,113
Someone's been reading
too many fairy tales.

180
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:47,028
No, I suspect the secret
ingredient is love.

181
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,897
Time we talked about
something really important.

182
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:52,299
This guy's birthday!

183
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:56,620
Oh, yes. I have decided to
plan Cyborg's day of birth

184
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,472
- festivities myself.
- No offense, Starfire,

185
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,306
but maybe someone else
should plan this party.

186
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,208
Oh, please allow me.

187
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:06,478
I promise I will learn all
of the proper Earth customs.

188
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,980
Well, the party can be lame. As
long as the presents aren't.

189
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,316
And you best believe I know exactly
what my best friend wants.

190
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:16,619
I bet it's not that new
video game that a certain

191
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:19,555
cybernetic organism has
been dropping hints about.

192
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,023
Video game?

193
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:26,627
Ah, it's totally the new game.
The really expensive one.

194
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:29,028
The one you should know
I can never afford.

195
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:34,160
- Yup, that's what I got you.
- And that's why you're my best friend.

196
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:04,259
<i>And that's why you're
my best friend.</i>

197
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,761
But I can't afford the game.

198
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,663
<i>Then get a job, you bum.</i>

199
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:13,800
I will get a job. For you,
Cyborg window hallucination.

200
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,271
Oh, wow. Bubbles.

201
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:27,077
And that, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

202
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:30,113
is why he is guilty beyond
a shadow of a doubt.

203
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:33,382
What? I'm supposed
to be defending him?

204
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,351
Oh.

205
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,288
Oh, gross!

206
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:42,790
Gross, gross, gross! What's
that squiggly thing?

207
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,785
You mean that's what's
inside of people?

208
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:52,832
<i>After much research,</i>

209
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,935
I have decided to hold the
festivities for Cyborg here.

210
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,070
That's actually a good choice.

211
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:00,906
Ooh! I also made
these for the party.

212
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:04,476
<i>Ah, balloon animals.</i>

213
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:07,845
Correct. And there
will be a game called,

214
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,981
"Pin the tail on the donkey."

215
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:13,217
Do you think this spike will be
sufficient for tail-pinning?

216
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,186
Uh, yeah. That's about right.

217
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,757
Hey, you okay, Beast Boy?

218
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:22,542
Oh, man! It's just...

219
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:25,529
I can't afford the present
that Cyborg really wants.

220
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,198
Friends don't care about
how much money you spend.

221
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,100
Just that you put
some thought into it.

222
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,869
Whaddup, Titans?

223
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:34,938
Which reminds me.

224
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:38,208
Hey, Cyborg. I thought I'd give you
your birthday gift a little early.

225
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:41,478
Your gift to me is
a half drunk soda?

226
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:44,848
What? Not expensive enough
for you, fancy pants?

227
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,323
You know, I'd like to think
it's the thought that counts.

228
00:15:47,552 --> 00:15:49,153
We cheapos need to
stick together.

229
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,556
Nice hat. Whew. Comedy gold.

230
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:29,428
Just trying to make a few extra
bucks for something important.

231
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,864
Whatever they're paying
you, it's not enough.

232
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:40,239
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

233
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:42,074
Whew!

234
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:53,052
Oh, my... oh my goodness.

235
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:55,054
Anyways, I'm just making
sure my best friend

236
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:57,756
is gonna be at my party. Not
dressed like that, of course.

237
00:16:58,258 --> 00:16:59,925
About that, uh...

238
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,461
- I have to work Friday.
- What!

239
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,597
It's my birthday.

240
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:06,832
If I don't work, I can't...

241
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,569
I mean, you won't have...
Look, I just...

242
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:13,106
- I can't be there.
- You are making less sense than usual.

243
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,574
What I'm trying to say is
that I'll be there, but...

244
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:19,345
- I'll be working.
- Oh, I see.

245
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:22,982
So basically, making a few extra bucks
is more important than your pal.

246
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,853
Well, do not take
my quivering lip

247
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:29,389
as a sign of profound
disappointment.

248
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:57,385
Duck, duck, goose!

249
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:01,523
<i>Stop!</i>

250
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:04,559
- Did I get that right?
- That's how I played.

251
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:08,130
I just wanted to thank
you all for coming.

252
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:11,800
And you know, "taking
time off from your jobs".

253
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,471
Oops! Speaking of jobs.

254
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:17,940
Guess someone is gonna
have to pick that up.

255
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,878
Man! I am so clumsy today.

256
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,516
Oh, cleaning crew!

257
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,986
I guess my so-called best friend
will have to come over and...

258
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:32,622
How dumb can you be?!

259
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:36,058
I'm only working here so I can
buy you an expensive present!

260
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,861
I never told you to
get a stupid job!

261
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,832
Well, my hallucination of you
in the store window did.

262
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,335
And the real you made
fun of my pie suit.

263
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:05,222
- Think we should stop them?
- Nah. This is the first time

264
00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:07,490
I've ever actually enjoyed
a birthday party.

265
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:11,829
Oh, wonderful! Then the
celebration is a great success.

266
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,215
Uh. I don't think we need
any more pies, granny.

267
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:50,336
Since you love gifts so much,

268
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,673
here is what I was gonna give you!
When I still liked you.

269
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,343
This is what you got me?

270
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:58,845
I love it! It's well
drawn, and thoughtful!

271
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:02,414
- Thank you!
- I knew you would like it. Ha!

272
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,119
Face pie.

273
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:14,022
Ah, the best kind. Huh, pie bro.

274
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,891
<i>When I say, "I want"
you say, "Pie"</i>

275
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:19,060
<i>- I want...
- Pie!</i>

276
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,095
<i>When I say "Yummy" you say "Pie"</i>

277
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:23,363
<i>- Yummy...
- Pie!</i>

278
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,365
<i>- Apple, peach -
Rhubarb, or pear</i>

279
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:27,534
<i>Any kind, we don't care.</i>

280
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:29,502
<i>- I love pie - Yeah, I love pie</i>

281
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:31,938
<i>Oh, we love, love,
love love, love pie.</i>

282
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,341
Man, my pie bro!

283
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,876
Oh, why were we ever fighting?

284
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,736
- I love pie.
- I love you and pie.

285
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:44,719
- Hey, looks like everyone went home.
- Just means more pie for us.

286
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:53,427
Something tells me
I just figured out

287
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,663
what Mother Mae Eye's
secret ingredient is.

288
00:20:57,999 --> 00:20:59,066
Love.

289
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:04,170
Oh, mmm, yup.

290
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,640
The secret ingredient
is definitely love.

291
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:15,881
Seriously?

292
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:17,254
- What?
- What?
