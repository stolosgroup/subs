1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,816
The famous Mrs Sweeney. There's
the girl I'm going to marry.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,656
Everything is about sex.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,216
That's Margaret.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,576
Canapes and cock.
Is there anything else?

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,856
Well, hopefully a dessert.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,176
I do like it,
and I'm extremely good at it.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,456
Captain Ian Campbell.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,616
I liked him. I liked his castle.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,936
Shipwreck full of jewels.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,896
I inherited it all from
a distant, distant cousin.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,176
Ian always get what he
bloody wants.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,856
Be my Duchess. Yes?

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,296
Then yes.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,736
Divorce him. Best thing I ever did.

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,696
Perhaps if I didn't love my son

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,496
so much I would deprive you
of your gloating triumph. You win.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,576
It's been one of
the greatest privileges of my life

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,096
to restore Inveraray Castle.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,656
Pay the b-bills.
It's what you're for.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,496
Every morning I wonder which
Ian I'm going to wake up to.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,496
An enduring legacy
for my husband the Duke of Argyll.

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,216
What happens to me when you die?
The home that I've built.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,936
My son will be duke,
and he's very fond of his mother.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,776
Don't push her in
the lake or anything.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,160
Of course I won't. Promise.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,376
No peeking. It's a surprise.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,576
I'm not peeking.
Turn right. You are peeking.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,016
I can feel the eyelashes moving.

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,696
All right, a little further.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,776
Oh, you're getting there.

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,216
Stop... stop.

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
Ready? Look.

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,256
A cannon ball?

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
A Spanish Armada cannon ball.

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,776
Four centuries that's been buried
under the seabed,

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,720
and now it's your paper weight.

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,016
We're getting there.

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,896
All my treasure will be somewhere
safe.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,976
Probably two decks down. Mm?

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,576
I'm in the right place.

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,576
Didn't I tell you do it?

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,280
Didn't I promise you you would be
the one to do it?

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,016
Father?

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,600
Christ, I'd forgotten, sorry.

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,456
Ahem.
Yep, got to get you back to school.

46
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,216
Margaret,
you remember Mrs MacPherson?

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,576
Yes, of course.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,896
I've asked her to do some
secretarial work for you,

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,600
she's excellent,
nothing gets by her.

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,056
Her husband died.

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
I promised him I'd look after her.

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,336
Well, I could certainly use
the help.

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,960
Marvellous. Come along first-born.

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,816
My apologies.
Bit of a surprise for you.

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,576
No, not at all.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Such good news. A great family's
fortune is soon to be restored.

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,616
Wonderful for the duke.

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,480
Wonderful for us both,
Mrs MacPherson.

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,816
Will you come and wave me off?

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,216
Of course I will.

61
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,080
Then we'll discuss my duties.

62
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,440
And please, call me Yvonne.

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Goodbye, Ian.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,840
Good morning.
Morning.

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,200
Thank you.

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,256
The car is being packed.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,936
We'll need to leave in half
an hour.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,400
Thank you, Yvonne.

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,960
What is it?

71
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,280
I don't know.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
Oh. It's a crank.

73
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,496
It's Louise's handwriting.

74
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,256
You're not to brood on it.

75
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
It belongs in the fire.

76
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,160
Not a word about this.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,880
What on earth do you take me for?

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,696
Are you telling me you actually
believe this?

79
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,016
It's your handwriting.

80
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,256
I write hundreds of letters.

81
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,256
I've never written this.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,496
You spend an awful lot
of time in Paris.

83
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,256
Everyone spends
a lot of time in Paris.

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,096
I've never stayed at
L'Hotel St Mariette.

85
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,160
I've never even heard of it.

86
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,736
I wish I had been unfaithful,

87
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,000
it would've given me some happy
memories of our marriage.

88
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:41,176
Are the boys my boys?

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,776
I swear on the lives
of my sons who I would die

90
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,456
for that you are their father.
You don't deserve them,

91
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,920
but you are their father,
you piece of absolute shit.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,256
You're brooding.

93
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,520
Why would someone send me
that letter?

94
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,600
Because people are very strange.

95
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,336
You should see some of
the things that I get sent.

96
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,176
Don't think about it
because that's what these peculiar,

97
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,696
nasty little people want.

98
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,056
Oh...

99
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,840
Of course the boys are yours.

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,296
Of course they are.

101
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,920
Don't get along with their mother
but I can't imagine for a second

102
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:55,536
that she'd do something like that.

103
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,480
She's far too boring.

104
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,056
Don't leave me tonight.

105
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,016
Stay by my side.

106
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,600
Of course.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,840
It's your daughter's birthday.
It'll be fun.

108
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
Papa.
Jeanne. Darling girl.

109
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,296
Happy birthday, Jeanne darling.
You look wonderful.

110
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,896
Margaret.
Well? Let's go get a drink.

111
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,400
Oh, good idea.
I'm spitting feathers.

112
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,576
Oh, dear, have you lost Ian,
darling?

113
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
He's over there
with, er, wife number one.

114
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,256
Yes, of course.

115
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,056
Thank you Maureen, darling.
Enjoy the party.

116
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,280
I will.

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,720
Jeanne, go back to your friends.

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,296
Oh, but mummy,
this is much more interesting.

119
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
Jeanne!

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,656
I paid for this party.

121
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,656
I know.

122
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,800
The least you could do is not
humiliate me.

123
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,816
This isn't about humiliating
you, Margaret.

124
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,936
This is about doing what Ian wants

125
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,536
because not doing what
Ian wants is a scene.

126
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,856
You must have realised that by now.
A scene.

127
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,336
Right here in public.

128
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,136
I don't want that.

129
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,016
Do you know,

130
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,840
I think you can't bear it that I've
succeeded where you've failed?

131
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,400
You think I want him back?

132
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,816
On the first night of our honeymoon,

133
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,696
Ian took me to a brothel because,
according to him,

134
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,856
I had a lot to learn.

135
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,016
I was 17.

136
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,976
Ian took everything I had,

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,936
and then he moved on to Oui Oui
and took everything she had,

138
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,296
and when the money runs out,
because it will,

139
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,936
the campaign to remove you will
begin in earnest,

140
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,656
and if you're not very careful,
you, too, will be left with nothing.

141
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,736
You and Oui Oui may be snivelling
little girls,

142
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,336
but I'm not,

143
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,800
and I don't need or want
your advice.

144
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,656
He just left and you didn't try
and stop him?

145
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,096
I did look for you.

146
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,456
Well, not very hard.

147
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,576
He took my car, Yvonne,
my car and my driver.

148
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,976
I have a car.

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,016
Well, it's a Volvo, no frills,
covered in dog hair.

150
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,336
Dog hair? For a duchess?
I'll arrange a taxi.

151
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,096
No, I love dogs. And you are?

152
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,376
Peter Combe.

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,376
Shall we?

154
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,416
Yes, we shall.

155
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,520
Thank you, Yvonne. Goodnight Janet.

156
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,120
I hate this bathroom.

157
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,816
Why would anyone sane want to watch
themselves as they strain

158
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,056
for stool from every
possible angle?

159
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,736
There are other bathrooms
for you to strain in.

160
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,256
I hate those, too.

161
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,936
In fact, I hate this whole house.

162
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,096
Well, I love it.

163
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,936
You didn't mind passing out in there
last night.

164
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,080
Ow, Margaret. That's a low blow.

165
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,776
You do like to kick
a man when he's down, don't you?

166
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,456
If I liked kicking a man when he was

167
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,280
down I would've stamped you to
pieces on that bath-mat.

168
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,576
You took my car, Ian.

169
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,536
My car and my chauffeur.

170
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,016
Look at you, you're fine.

171
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,320
You're all hung over and vulnerable
and delicious.

172
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,136
Just don't treat me like your
other wives.

173
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,896
Oh, God. Don't tell me you've been
speaking to Janet.

174
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,360
No.

175
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,856
You should give it up.
Give what up?

176
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,016
This house. This cold,
sterile hole of a house.

177
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,456
Don't be ridiculous.

178
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,376
We'd have more money.

179
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,256
You're always complaining
about money.

180
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,256
Give it up, you won't have to
complain, will you?

181
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,296
Get that shipwreck off
the sea floor,

182
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,440
and we can have as many houses as
we want.

183
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,256
You don't think I can do it, do you?

184
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,856
You think I'm going to cock it up.
Can't raise a shipwreck.

185
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,336
Can't fight a war without getting
captured. Can't father his own sons.

186
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,216
Oh, for God's sake Ian, I told you
to ignore that bloody letter,

187
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,696
and who is it who's always telling

188
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,816
you you can achieve whatever you
want? Me.

189
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,816
Yes. You do a lot of telling.
You're like Nanny.

190
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,696
The last thing I am is your nanny.

191
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,440
If I didn't think you could raise
that hulk,

192
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,224
I wouldn't have invested
so much money in it.

193
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,344
Here we go again. Money.

194
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,896
I'm being a horrible bastard.

195
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,696
Yes, you are.
Why do you put up with me?

196
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,776
No idea.

197
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,456
I'm going to take you out
to dinner tonight,

198
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,376
make up for being
such an incorrigible,

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
selfish prick last night.

200
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,816
Have a think about
the house, though.

201
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,856
No. Yes.

202
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,320
No. Just think about it.

203
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,400
That's new since I last saw you.

204
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,056
Pain?

205
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,120
No.

206
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,656
It's just a twinge.

207
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,856
Numbness? Pins and needles?

208
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,960
No. Insomnia?
Blurred vision? Headaches?

209
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,616
No, no, er, sometimes.

210
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,560
Anything else?

211
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,200
I want to have a baby.

212
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,656
You were lucky to have two children
all things considered,

213
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,336
and that was before your fall.

214
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,936
But my accident was years ago.

215
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,736
If you manage to carry the child to
term, and that is a big if,

216
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,576
I am not certain you'd survive
the labour.

217
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,496
There's been so many advances
in medicine.

218
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,200
It could kill you.

219
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,376
No, leave it.

220
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,616
Diana, darling.

221
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,376
You're answering your own door.

222
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,616
Have the ravens left the tower?

223
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,976
Where's Il Duce?

224
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,281
Oh, he's at the House of Lords all
day, something about...

225
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,665
Oh, I don't know and I don't care.

226
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,304
Go away.

227
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,176
Now I'm swearing you
to absolute secrecy, Diana.

228
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,960
All right, fine, yes.
What's the urgency?

229
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,560
Well?

230
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,080
I need you to buy me a baby boy.

231
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,616
What?

232
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,216
A newborn baby boy.

233
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,216
I'll pay. I'll pay very well.

234
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,576
You're married to a Pole.
You must have lots of contacts,

235
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,736
and there must be some poor girl
somewhere who wants

236
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,656
to give her baby
the best of everything,

237
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,136
you know, a wonderful life.

238
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,216
The baby does need to grow up tall
like Ian, though,

239
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,736
so it's probably best that you know
the parents.

240
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,576
Oh, Jesus.

241
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,840
You're serious.

242
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,560
Margaret, either you're having a
nervous breakdown, or I am.

243
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,520
Oh, Diana.

244
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,656
No, it's too awful.

245
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,280
No, it's too shocking.

246
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,416
Ian's sons aren't his.

247
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,216
They're illegitimate.

248
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,856
Both of them. Heir and spare.

249
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,376
How do you know?

250
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,216
Ian got a letter, anonymous.

251
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,336
They say they've got proof.

252
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,536
Well, that's just
standard extortion.

253
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,016
No, they don't want money.

254
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,280
They want to right a great wrong,
set matters straight.

255
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,856
They're some other man's sons,

256
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,896
passed off as sons by bloody
Oui Oui this entire time.

257
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,376
Oui Oui?

258
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,136
She doesn't seem the type.

259
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,376
Oh, she's the type.
She's completely vindictive.

260
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,016
So, Ian needs an heir because he
can't possibly leave anything

261
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,336
to them now, can he?

262
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,376
Have you met the
British aristocracy?

263
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,656
It's rammed with bastard Earls
and by-blow Barons.

264
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,456
Everyone turns a blind eye.

265
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,776
I've thought it all through.
I start to pad my waist,

266
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,656
let people whisper about it.

267
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,096
Start the rumours,

268
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,776
and then I go to
a clinic in Switzerland,

269
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,816
and then you bring me
a beautiful baby boy,

270
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,776
and I give you a lot of money.

271
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,856
I thought you were my friend.
I am, and as your friend

272
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,776
I'm telling you,
just don't get involved.

273
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,736
Ian's sons are nothing to do
with you.

274
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,176
Well, Inveraray wouldn't exist if it
wasn't for me and Daddy.

275
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,720
It would be a ruin and those boys
would have nothing to inherit,

276
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,304
so yes, it has everything to do
with me.

277
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:31,144
Margaret, go on holiday before you
get yourself in trouble.

278
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,616
Diana, I swore you to secrecy

279
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,736
so if you tell anyone I'll know that
you can't keep a promise.

280
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,760
A long holiday. Somewhere sunny.

281
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,416
Oh, hello, darling.

282
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,016
You said you'd take me out
for dinner.

283
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,256
Do you know, the House sat late?

284
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,256
Yes, it did.

285
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,736
But you weren't there.

286
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,816
Oh, I'm sorry. I was at the club.

287
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,616
No.

288
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,376
You weren't there, either.

289
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,056
Oh. Your legion of spies,
duh, duh, duh, duh.

290
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,376
Drunk. You were drunk last night
and you're drunk now.

291
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,456
Fish-face is being
a little nag tonight.

292
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,856
You reek of other women.

293
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,560
Do I? You've been with some other
woman, then you come back to me in

294
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:19,536
this state? Oh, my God, this
relentless bourgeois whine.

295
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,936
It's so fucking boring!

296
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,896
Your grace.

297
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,616
Oh, dear.

298
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,136
Now look what you've made me do.

299
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,456
I've gone and woken the servants.

300
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,056
Why are you being like this?

301
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,680
I had such a lovely day and then
you've gone and spoilt it.

302
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,256
I'm going to sleep at the club,

303
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,296
and tomorrow morning we go back
to Inveraray first train.

304
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,216
I won't be.

305
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,016
You'll do what I tell you to do,
and when I tell you to do it.

306
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,960
You must be confusing me
with one of your other wives.

307
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,136
Oh, I'm so glad you were free.

308
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,096
Darling, for you, I'm always free.

309
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,760
So, what's the menu tonight?
Drinking or dancing?

310
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,800
Both.
Right answer.

328
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,760
I loved your mother so much.

329
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,776
You've got me, Daddy.

330
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,040
You've always got me.

331
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,376
You shouldn't have let Yvonne go
without discussing it with me first.

332
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,936
We can't afford her, Ian.
We have to save money.

333
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,856
Besides, I didn't have enough work
for her.

334
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,736
She can't just stand around doing
nothing. Well, why not? You do.

335
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,896
Look, I got her another job,

336
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,616
and I'm giving her lunch
to make up for it.

337
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,520
Ooh. Lunch with you. What a treat.

338
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,656
That's terrifying.

339
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,056
You think I want to do this?

340
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,176
Do you think I want to debase myself
advertising Argyll socks?

341
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,376
You'll have me selling

342
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,056
surgical trusses with the family
crest on it next.

343
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,336
If it pays well, why not?

344
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,176
Or you could give up this house?

345
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,096
Or you could give up your
treasure hunt?

346
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,136
We're ready, Your Grace.

347
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,656
Oh. You done?

348
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,136
Oh, it's just like being there.

349
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,616
So, where do you want me?

350
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,496
I'm out for dinner tonight.

351
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,080
Smile.

352
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,136
Super.

353
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,000
I was very sorry
to hear about your mother.

354
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,920
Thank you.

355
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,080
And are you enjoying your new job?

356
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,616
They're a very generous employer.

357
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,856
I'm very glad.
It was difficult to let you go,

358
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,936
I hope you understand that.

359
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,256
Yvonne, can I ask you?

360
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,056
You've known Ian longer than I have,
and he and your husband

361
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,216
were such good friends,

362
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,816
has he always been so impossible?

363
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,360
The drinking.

364
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,216
He can be so changeable, I can
barely keep track of his moods.

365
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,296
Well, the Duke has
a lot on his mind at the moment,

366
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,816
although I don't see how you can
tell that he's impossible.

367
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,136
You're never with him.

368
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,176
I...

369
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,576
beg your pardon?

370
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,736
You keep talking about how much you
love Inveraray.

371
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,496
I do. It's my home.

372
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,776
But you're always here,
going about with men,

373
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,736
men half your age.
If you spent more time with Ian,

374
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,856
supporting him as a proper wife
should then maybe he wouldn't

375
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,176
be so impossible.

376
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,696
Oh, I see. So, it's my fault.

377
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,856
I don't think you try hard enough.
No, I try.

378
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,176
Do you?

379
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,856
And as for that advertisement,
how could you?

380
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,536
Debasing and humiliating
a man like that,

381
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,576
your own husband forced to shill
for mass produced socks.

382
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,536
Yvonne, I've invited you here as a
friend,

383
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,376
and you choose to speak to me
like this.

384
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,216
You invited me to lunch because you
want me to agree with you.

385
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,696
Perhaps because you thought
I'd drop some hints,

386
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,216
some gossip about poor Margaret,

387
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,696
and how she suffers with the Duke,

388
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,336
what a saint that woman is.
Well, you're no saint.

389
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,656
I feel sorry for Ian.
He deserves better.

390
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,696
Well...

391
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,760
Ian always thought you were
terrible at your job.

392
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:24,744
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
have lasted two months.

393
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,520
If you're going to tell lies,
do try and make them plausible.

394
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,696
Do you know, Yvonne,
I think you've just remembered

395
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,176
a very important engagement.

396
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,400
Do you know, I think you're right.
I have.

397
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,296
Make sure Ian packs everything he
needs for Scotland.

398
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,160
He needs a wife.

399
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,416
That's it. We're shutting it down.

400
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,296
The exploration is over,
Your Grace.

401
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,736
Come on, please. I beg you,
we're nearly there.

402
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,896
Don't stop now.
I'm working out with the admiralty,

403
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,656
you can stay in the boat.
You can... you can get back to it.

404
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,456
We're so close.

405
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
It's over, Your Grace.

406
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,560
Dr John Petro for the Duke.
He is expecting me.

407
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,720
I've failed.

408
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,176
Ian?

409
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,656
What is it?
I've failed.

410
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,616
No. No, of course you haven't.
We tried everything.

411
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440
We both did.
It's just it's not possible.

412
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,680
I wanted it for my boys.

413
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,776
They're my boys.

414
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,560
They're mine.

415
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,920
Of course they are.

416
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,320
Your Grace? Dr Petro.

417
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,560
Dear me, old boy.

418
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,456
You are a mess.

419
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,936
He's got a raging temperature
and he's not making any sense.

420
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,280
I beg your pardon, Your Grace,
but I need privacy.

421
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,480
I'll be just outside, darling.

422
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,176
I saw that you prescribed
amphetamines for the Duke.

423
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,176
Yes, to boost his system.

424
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,176
I would've thought that
an iron tablet,

425
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,960
cod liver oil would've been
better treatment.

426
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,880
Not amphetamines.

427
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,096
His behaviour...

428
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,080
can be very volatile.

429
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,216
Have you given my husband
this boost before?

430
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,800
I'm here to treat your
husband's pneumonia.

431
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,400
What sort of doctor are you?

432
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,160
The Duke's.

433
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,376
Which one of your lovers are you
seeing this time?

434
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,160
Is it Peter Combe?

435
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,576
God's sake. Peter escorts me.

436
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,296
He's got so many girlfriends,
I'd have to book him in advance.

437
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,696
I've got a meeting with the bank,

438
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,536
and if I thought it would help
OUR situation, I'd ride the manager,

439
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,656
and all the clerks like the
Cheltenham winners.

440
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,376
No, you like it like this.

441
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,416
You're glad that shipwreck's buried
under the mud.

442
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,456
Am I really? Mm.

443
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,056
It means you can still control me,
prancing around

444
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,616
calling yourself a Duchess with
my balls in your fucking handbag.

445
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,840
Well, it's not as if they take up
much room.

446
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,536
Oh, dear.

447
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,760
Now you've lost your place.

448
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,256
You take too many of those.
They're not doing you any good.

449
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,240
They stop me from shooting myself
in the face.

450
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,136
How many men have you got?

451
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,416
Oh, at least 80. Probably more.
How about you?

452
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,360
How many women have you got?

453
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,400
Of course, I could just shoot YOU in
the face.

454
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,056
You could...

455
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,576
but then you'd be hanged
for murder and I'd win,

456
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,936
and think how much you'd hate that.

457
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,720
You see, this is why we're a match.

458
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,656
Oui Oui and Janet would've burst
into tears,

459
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,496
but not you.

460
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,176
You're a little streetfighter.

461
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,840
Lipstick.

462
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,376
Now that you've mentioned her,

463
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,136
have you decided what
you're going to do

464
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,240
about Oui Oui and the letter?

465
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,016
Well...

466
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,176
after taking professional
advice, I've decided to do nothing.

467
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,976
Professional advice?

468
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,856
I went to Scotland Yard,
spoke to a Detective.

469
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,496
He said this sort
of thing happens all the time.

470
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,696
Plus they found nothing at
L'Hotel St Mariette.

471
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,256
They said do nothing.

472
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,016
They'll trip themselves up
in the end.

473
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,776
Well, I'm glad that you've
spoken to someone,

474
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,696
though you never mentioned it to me.

475
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,400
Well, why, would I? They're not your
children.

476
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,840
Are you going to talk
to your father about money?

477
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,280
Ian, I don't want to ask him for
money while he's still grieving.

478
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,696
I do love you, you know?

479
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,120
In spite of it all.

480
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
I do love you.

481
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,200
And don't worry about your balls.
I'll keep them safe.

482
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,880
Don't tell me you didn't know, dear.

483
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,976
No, of course I did.

484
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,216
They just wanted
to keep it, er, secret,

485
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,056
you know, private,
being so soon after Mummy,

486
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,056
and there's photographers everywhere
I go, so.

487
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,176
You didn't want to steal
the bride's light.

488
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,776
You are so selfless.

489
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,520
Utterly angelic.

490
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,120
The couple departed immediately for
a honeymoon in Barbados. Adorable.

491
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,096
Your new stepmother's
younger than you.

492
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,320
Your daddy is a sly old dog.

493
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,936
You're sure you're OK?

494
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,456
I'll be fine.

495
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,416
I feel silly telephoning you.
I don't know what I was thinking.

496
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,080
No, it's OK.

497
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,480
I was just worried about you,
that's all.

498
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,856
Oh, God, here he is.

499
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, I look a fright.

500
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,696
Margaret? Mm?

501
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,936
Why don't you just tell him
another night, mm?

502
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,256
We could just have a quiet little
dinner, just you and me.

503
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,456
No, darling.

504
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,720
No.

505
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,736
Sorry for ruining your evening.

506
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,096
No... No you didn't.

507
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,176
No plans, as per.

508
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,000
Er, call me.

509
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,080
No.

510
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,280
Please.

511
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,656
Be nice.

512
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,600
I know how to b-behave.

513
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,136
Salutations and congratulations,
George.

514
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,256
Thank you. Hello, hello, hello.

515
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,296
Jane. Lovely to see you. Hello.

516
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,176
Enchanted to meet you at last.
Oh, thank you.

517
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,336
My darling daughter.

518
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,416
Come in and sit down. Thank you.

519
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,456
So, how was the journey up?

520
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,240
Oh! Oh, very long. Long. Yes.

521
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,216
Oh, it's nice to be here.

522
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,376
Well, let's have
a spot of restorative lunch,

523
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,320
and then I'll take Jane for
a tour of the garden.

524
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,976
Gosh, it's, erm...

525
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,920
It's beautiful.

526
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,216
Of course I should've told you

527
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,376
but I was swept off my feet.
I've been so lonely,

528
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,360
you know, since mother.

529
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,240
I would've kept you company.

530
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,016
Ian was drunk at lunch.

531
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,856
We were all having champagne.

532
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,176
He was drunk when we arrived,

533
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,576
and I see the way he drinks
in the club.

534
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,376
Everybody drinks, Daddy.

535
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,480
He drinks for oblivion,
and you know it.

536
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,176
Daddy?

537
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,176
Please don't ask me
to bail Ian out again.

538
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,960
I'll not throw good money after bad.

539
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,560
I see.

540
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,400
You understand about the money?

541
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,856
Of course.

542
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,616
And about Jane?

543
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,056
I just want you to be happy.

544
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,480
I am. So very happy.

545
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,400
Did you talk to him?

546
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,960
Yes.

547
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,840
And?

548
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,600
No.

549
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,000
There's no more money.

550
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,120
How long am I going to get
the silent treatment for?

551
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,456
Pathetic.

552
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,056
It's especially sickening

553
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,776
to watch you be completely charming
to Jane and then foul to me.

554
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,176
Mm. Well it's easy to be lovely
to Jane.

555
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,216
She's delicious and sexy.

556
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,856
Your old man's going to need Spanish
Fly to keep up with her.

557
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,480
She's wasted on him.

558
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,376
What are you for?

559
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,376
What are you for?

560
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,536
What is the point of you?

561
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,376
What are you for?

562
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,936
I'm coming in.

563
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,240
I'm-I'm coming in right now.

564
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,680
Your Grace.

565
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,840
Do you need a doctor?

566
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,520
Dr Petro.

567
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,480
How did you find me?

568
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,656
Well, I'm sure the police would be
very interested in a doctor whose

569
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,176
consulting rooms is
this sordid hole,

570
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,376
and whose patients queue up outside.

571
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,776
What can I do for you?

572
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,056
You are going to stop giving my
husband amphetamines.

573
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,616
You'll cease all contact with him.

574
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,560
His health is no longer
your concern.

575
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,800
Do we understand one another?

576
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,880
Good.

577
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,896
Your Grace, any comment on the Duke
taking a suite at Claridge's?

578
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,376
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
My husband's in Scotland.

579
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,896
If he was in London,
he'd be with me.

580
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,616
No, he's he in Claridge's.

581
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,576
We've been told your marriage
is over. Any comment?

582
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,320
Come on,
you must know something, Duchess?

583
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,776
Duchess? Duchess, a quick word?

584
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,520
Oh, hello, here we go.
Duchess?

585
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, of course it would be you.
Where is he?

586
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,880
He doesn't want to see you,
Your Grace.

587
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,936
What have you told him?

588
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,296
I haven't told him anything.
I haven't told ANYONE anything.

589
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,896
I want to see my husband.

590
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,120
Please, don't make a scene.
He doesn't want to see you.

591
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,696
I wouldn't believe
a word she's saying. She's a liar.

592
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,120
That's why I don't want her working
for me any more. Duchess?

593
00:47:58,144 --> 00:48:00,856
She's a deeply troubled woman.
Duchess?

594
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,216
You try and help people,

595
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,560
and they just throw it back in
your face.

596
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Why's he leaving you, Your Grace?

597
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,560
Where is he?

598
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,800
Hello?

599
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,416
Come back, please.

600
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,000
Ian?

601
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,280
Please come.

602
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,216
I... I can't bear it, please come.

603
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,320
Where are you?

604
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,400
Oh, Ian.

605
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,600
Bonne nuit. Merci.

606
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,200
I don't know why I went
to Claridge's.

607
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,520
I don't know why I say
and I do the things I do. I don't.

608
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,376
You frighten me sometimes, Ian,

609
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,520
and you hurt me.

610
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
You wouldn't give me money.

611
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,936
I kept thinking that you were lying,

612
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,720
and you were going behind my back
and you were lying.

613
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,376
I think we can make it work
between us,

614
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,256
I really do.

615
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,896
But we have to be kinder,

616
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,640
stop doing terrible things
to each other.

617
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,560
What terrible things have you done?

618
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,336
Nothing, just...

619
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,280
being in London too much.

620
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,336
It's not quite the same as
humiliating me in public, but still.

621
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,776
I'm so sorry.

622
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,616
Yes, you should be.

623
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,120
I'm sorry.

624
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,576
The pills and the drinking have got
to stop, Ian.

625
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,856
Yes.

626
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,640
For good. Yes.

627
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,720
We'll be all right.

628
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,400
Piss off.

628
00:55:41,305 --> 00:56:41,436
