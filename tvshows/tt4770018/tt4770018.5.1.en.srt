00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:06,631
<font color="#00FFFF">The waiting is over.</font>

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:11,632
<font color="#00FFFF">An unforgettable summer</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is about to begin.</font>

3
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:16,631
<font color="#FFFF00">So, the question is...</font>

4
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:19,631
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Are you ready for love?</font>

5
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:22,672
<font color="#11FF11"># Yes, I am</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Are you ready...</font>

6
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:26,671
<font color="#00FFFF">Here you go, mate, you can do that.</font>

7
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:28,632
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready for love?</font>

8
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:34,631
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready for love?</font>

9
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:37,631
<font color="#11FF11"># Yes, I am</font>

10
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,631
<font color="#11FF11"># Yes, I am.</font>

11
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:45,632
<font color="#11FF11"># Yes, I am</font>

12
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:50,631
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Are you ready for love?</font>

13
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:55,151
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready for love?</font>

14
00:00:55,152 --> 00:01:01,991
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Are you ready for love?</font>

15
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:06,631
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready for love?</font>

16
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,631
<font color="#11FF11"># Yes, I am... #</font>

17
00:01:08,632 --> 00:01:11,631
<font color="#00FFFF">How do you like your baps,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sweetheart?</font>

18
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:13,632
<font color="#11FF11"># Are you ready for love?</font>

22
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,631
The sun is rising on a brand-new
summer of lighthouse...

23
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,631
Sorry, love.

24
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:44,631
The picture threw me.

25
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:47,632
And the class of 2019
is on its way to paradise.

26
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,311
Newsflash, this year, the producers
decided the villa needed a revamp,

27
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:55,631
so they went down the pub
with a load of Post-its

28
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,151
to write down their big ideas.

29
00:01:57,152 --> 00:02:00,631
Nine lagers later, someone noticed
the Post-its were yellow.

30
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:02,631
A voila.

31
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:04,631
That room is nowhere near
yellow enough.

32
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:06,992
Better.

33
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:12,471
There's also a new snug, the make-up
room has had a bit of work done

34
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:15,631
and that gorgeous new bedroom
is sure to encourage hours of,

35
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:17,631
what is the word again?

36
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:19,832
Sleep.

37
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:24,631
As ever, to make it
all the way to the final day

38
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:28,632
and a shot of winning 50 grand,
our islanders need to couple up.

39
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:33,631
The ability to wave your arms
in the air like you just don't care

40
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,631
in a moving car, is also essential.

41
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:38,152
Yes, here comes those ladies.

42
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,831
<font color="#00FFFF">Nearly fell over.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Hello.</font>

43
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,632
<font color="#00FFFF">Hi, I'm Amy. </font><font color="#11FF11">I'm Amber.</font>

44
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:49,632
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't believe were here.</font>

45
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:03,632
<font color="#00FFFF">It's so beautiful.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It's real-life. </font><font color="#11FF11">Yeah, I know.</font>

46
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:11,631
<font color="#11FF11">Are we the first people here?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">We are. Where is everyone?</font>

47
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:14,632
<font color="#00FFFF">First ones in. First ones in 2019.</font>

48
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:18,631
<font color="#00FFFF">Hi, I'm Amy, I'm 26.</font>

49
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,472
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm from Worthing and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm an international air hostess.</font>

50
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:27,631
<font color="#00FFFF">Life as an air hostess,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you are here, there and everywhere.</font>

51
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:29,631
<font color="#00FFFF">Which makes finding a boyfriend</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really impossible.</font>

52
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,831
<font color="#00FFFF">I was once invited to join</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the mile high club,</font>

53
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,631
<font color="#00FFFF">but really,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have you seen the toilets?</font>

54
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,632
<font color="#00FFFF">Disgusting.</font>

55
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:42,257
<font color="#00FFFF">I have been single forever,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I've never had a proper boyfriend.</font>

56
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:44,257
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know why</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm so unlucky in love.</font>

57
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:48,097
<font color="#00FFFF">I've been ghosted so many times,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">my phone is like a Ouija board.</font>

58
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:50,258
<font color="#00FFFF">There is nobody out there.</font>

59
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:55,097
<font color="#00FFFF">I need someone to make me laugh,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">halfway between a gym body</font>

60
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,297
<font color="#00FFFF">and a dad body, we like a cuddle,</font>

61
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:59,257
<font color="#00FFFF">and we also like a bit of eye candy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to look at.</font>

62
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:01,257
<font color="#00FFFF">Going into the villa</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is like pressing the reset</font>

63
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:04,257
<font color="#00FFFF">button on my life, hopefully</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm going to find my Prince Charming</font>

64
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,258
<font color="#00FFFF">to sweep me off my wedges.</font>

65
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:12,258
<font color="#11FF11">There we go. Right,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">do you want to get your glass?</font>

66
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:19,452
<font color="#00FFFF">That view is so beautiful.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Cheers. </font><font color="#00FFFF">2019. </font><font color="#11FF11">We are here.</font>

67
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:30,451
<font color="#11FF11">I'm Amber, I'm 21 and I'm</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a beauty therapist from Newcastle.</font>

68
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,451
<font color="#11FF11">I'm funny, bit of a diva,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and a little bit sassy.</font>

69
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:38,451
<font color="#11FF11">People always say I've got</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a resting bitch face, all the time.</font>

70
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:42,291
<font color="#11FF11">My natural face is quite miserable.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm just being honest.</font>

71
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:46,451
<font color="#11FF11">I've never been rejected in my life,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God, I'd be shocked.</font>

72
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,972
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know what I do.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It's never happened before.</font>

73
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:53,451
<font color="#11FF11">I can be a bit of a man-eater,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I do eat boys for breakfast.</font>

74
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:59,117
<font color="#11FF11">And if you do do something that's</font>
<font color="#11FF11">really nasty, I will ruin your life.</font>

75
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:01,078
<font color="#11FF11">That works well for us.</font>

76
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,920
<font color="#11FF11">Saying that, I'm single,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it probably doesn't work that well.</font>

77
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,213
<font color="#11FF11">I would like to be in love,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">who wouldn't?</font>

78
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:10,214
<font color="#11FF11">Fingers crossed</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I can find that in Love Island.</font>

79
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,213
<font color="#00FFFF">There is the little gym that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll never go to.</font>

80
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:20,213
<font color="#11FF11">Right, so what is your type,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">then?</font>

81
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:22,213
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't really have a type</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">looks-wise,</font>

82
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:26,213
<font color="#00FFFF">but I just want someone funny,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">someone I can have banter with.</font>

83
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:29,213
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm really easy-going,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm really spontaneous,</font>

84
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:31,253
<font color="#00FFFF">I just want someone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can have a really fun life with.</font>

85
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:34,213
<font color="#00FFFF">I have a lot of love to give,</font>

86
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:37,213
<font color="#00FFFF">and I tend to give it to the people</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that don't reciprocate it.</font>

87
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:40,213
<font color="#00FFFF">I've never had a boyfriend.</font>

88
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,053
<font color="#00FFFF">I've been seeing guys, but I've</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">never had a boyfriend before. </font><font color="#11FF11">Ever?</font>

89
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:45,213
<font color="#00FFFF">Ever. </font><font color="#11FF11">How old are you? </font><font color="#00FFFF">26.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I know.</font>

90
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:48,213
<font color="#00FFFF">Exactly, which is why I'm here.</font>

91
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,573
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like if there is anyone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that is going to be my match,</font>

92
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,734
<font color="#00FFFF">it's going to be here.</font>

93
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:06,213
<font color="#FFFF00">So exciting. Oh, my God.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can hear someone coming.</font>

94
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:08,214
<font color="#FFFF00">I cannot believe it.</font>

95
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:13,214
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello. </font><font color="#FFFF00">This is crazy.</font>

96
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:17,214
<font color="#11FF11">Here you go.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Finally.</font>

97
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:24,214
<font color="#FFFF00">Anna, nice to meet you. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Hi, Amy.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Would you like a drink? </font><font color="#00FFFF">Yes please.</font>

98
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:32,214
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you feeling? </font><font color="#00FFFF">Excited.</font>

99
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:38,214
<font color="#FFFF00">My name is Anna,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am 28-years-old.</font>

100
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:47,213
<font color="#FFFF00">I am never going to find someone at</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">work because everyone is old</font>

101
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:50,213
<font color="#FFFF00">or they are sick or not in the mood.</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">Anna, you need to get married and</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">left before nobody wants you.</font>

105
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:08,213
<font color="#FFFF00">Excuse me. Meghan Markle got married</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at 36.</font>

00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:50,213
<font color="#00FFFF">biotechnology and I work with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">vaccines for cancer, so it is nice</font>

118
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:59,213
<font color="#00FFFF">to be able to give people a better</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">quality of life. I have been single</font>

00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:05,213
<font color="#00FFFF">for four years, which is such a long</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">time. I have definitely been</font>

120
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:10,213
<font color="#00FFFF">heartbroken. It is never what I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">expected and we never get on, don't</font>

121
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:14,213
<font color="#00FFFF">have anything to talk about, it's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just real awkward. Really hard to</font>

122
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:17,213
<font color="#00FFFF">find the time to death because I am</font>

00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:23,893
<font color="#00FFFF">into the villa, hopefully a little</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit more confidence. Swapping my</font>

Hello ladies.

148
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:32,213
How exciting is this! You all look
incredible. Are we ready for love?

149
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:38,213
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah! </font>Look at you all. Ladies, let's
talk love. Who is looking for the

150
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:43,213
real thing? <font color="#FFFF00">I think we all are. </font>Has
it been a long time waiting? <font color="#00FFFF">Yes,</font>

151
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:50,213
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm 28, so yeah. </font>Have you been in
love before Anna? <font color="#FFFF00">I have yes, I got</font>

152
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:54,573
<font color="#FFFF00">heartbroken. I am feeling positive.</font>
You are a pharmacist, what would you

153
00:12:54,574 --> 00:13:02,213
prescribe for love? <font color="#FFFF00">There is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">nothing. Time. And the villa. </font>You

154
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,213
are in the right place girls.
Yewande when was the last time you

155
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:10,573
were in love? <font color="#00FFFF">I have never been in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">love, I'm 23, never been in love.</font>

156
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:16,213
That is why we are here. Describe
your ideal boy. <font color="#11FF11">Blonde, longish</font>

157
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:23,053
<font color="#11FF11">hair, a lot of hair. </font>A bit like you?
<font color="#11FF11">Like me, like two lions together</font>

158
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:28,733
<font color="#11FF11">really. A bit of a dude I think.</font>
Amber, have you got a type?

159
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:32,213
<font color="#00FFFF">Someone that goes to the gym and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">makes us laugh and I think I want to</font>

160
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:36,733
<font color="#00FFFF">go for looks now because I haven't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">previously. </font>You are going for looks.

161
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:42,213
I love that. Most people go for
looks and then go for personality. <font color="#00FFFF">I</font>

162
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:47,053
<font color="#00FFFF">have got to try something different.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I want someone I can connect with</font>

163
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:53,213
<font color="#FFFF00">and banter off. </font>What is a massive
no-no. <font color="#11FF11">Arrogance probably and a</font>

164
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:56,413
<font color="#11FF11">wandering eye. I want someone</font>
<font color="#11FF11">devoted to me as much as I am</font>

165
00:13:56,414 --> 00:14:00,213
<font color="#11FF11">devoted to them. </font>Are you ready to
meet some boys, are you ready to

166
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:13,213
meet some men? <font color="#FFFF00">Yes! </font>No boys. Let's
do it. <font color="#FFFF00">Girls it's time to couple up.</font>

167
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:18,053
The boys will come in one by one and
ask you to step forward if you fancy

168
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:21,733
them. The boy will then decide which
girl he wants to couple with up.

169
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:29,214
It's as simple as that. Are you
ready to meet our first boy? <font color="#FFFF00">Yes!</font>

170
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:36,214
Everybody this is Anton.

171
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:47,893
<font color="#00FFFF">I bet you don't expect a Scottish</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">accent coming out of this! I am</font>

172
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:54,213
<font color="#00FFFF">Anton, I am 24 from Scotland and I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">own my own gym. The gym has changed</font>

173
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:57,213
<font color="#00FFFF">my life because it's given me more</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">confidence with my body. Always</font>

174
00:14:57,214 --> 00:15:01,253
<font color="#00FFFF">attracts the girls which usually</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">helps as well. Even though I have</font>

175
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:07,213
<font color="#00FFFF">bigamous Kehls, I definitely am a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mummy's boy. My mum chucked me out</font>

176
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:11,733
<font color="#00FFFF">when I was 19-years-old because I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was bringing too many girls home.</font>

177
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:16,213
<font color="#00FFFF">The final straw was when she came in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">my room one day, there were two in</font>

178
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:20,573
<font color="#00FFFF">my bed, how do you explain that to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">your mum. I have been in a</font>

179
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:23,413
<font color="#00FFFF">relationship since I was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">14-years-old. When I am in a</font>

180
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:29,213
<font color="#00FFFF">relationship, I have a severe</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">medical condition, it's called a</font>

181
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:45,893
<font color="#00FFFF">wandering eye. If that wandering eye</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">comes out again... Hi Caroline, how</font>

182
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:54,213
<font color="#00FFFF">are you? Six beautiful women.</font>
Welcome to the Love Island villa.

183
00:15:54,214 --> 00:16:00,213
How are you feeling? <font color="#00FFFF">Feel good. </font>It's
all about finding your perfect match

184
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:01,214
and it starts here

185
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:04,733
with your important decision about
who you want to couple up with. The

186
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:10,213
great news is, you are in first so
you get first pick. How about that.

187
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:13,213
<font color="#00FFFF">Amazing. </font>OK, before you make your
decision I am going to make it

188
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:18,253
easier and I am going to ask the
girls to step forward if they fancy

189
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:25,213
you. Awkward? <font color="#00FFFF">A little bit. I am</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a little bit nervous. </font>Girls, if you

190
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:28,214
fancy Anton, please step forward.

191
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:54,053
The coupling up is under way

192
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,573
and Anton is the first boy to enter
the villa. But will any of the girls

193
00:16:56,574 --> 00:17:02,214
step forward for the second most
desirable Scotsman in Mallorca.

194
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:08,214
Girls, if you fancy Anton, please
step forward.

195
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:19,213
Amy has stepped forward for you.
Why did you step forward?

196
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:22,893
<font color="#FFFF00">Because I have eyes.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's really, really fit.</font>

197
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:27,213
<font color="#FFFF00">I saw him come in and I was like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yes. </font>You can choose to couple up

198
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,253
with Amy or any of the four girls
that didn't step forward. The choice

199
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:33,414
is down to you.

200
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:38,734
Which girl would you
like to couple up with?

201
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:49,214
<font color="#00FFFF">Amy of course. </font>Off you go.
<font color="#00FFFF">Lovely to meet you.</font>

202
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:54,213
We have our first island couple

203
00:17:54,214 --> 00:18:00,213
of 2019, Amy and Anton. Amy, how do
you feel? <font color="#FFFF00">Really happy. </font>Is he as

204
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:06,573
good close up? <font color="#FFFF00">Yes. </font>How are you
feeling Anton? <font color="#00FFFF">I feel like I should</font>

205
00:18:06,574 --> 00:18:12,213
<font color="#00FFFF">have wore bigger heels, but Amy can</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">make take hers off. </font>Anna, why didn't

206
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:14,213
you step forward? <font color="#00FFFF">I</font>

207
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:18,213
<font color="#00FFFF">feel like I am too tall for him. He</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would have to get in really big</font>

208
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:23,414
<font color="#00FFFF">heels. </font>Amber, why didn't you step
forward? <font color="#11FF11">Do you shave your legs?</font>

209
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:34,213
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes. </font>Do you shave your whole body.
<font color="#00FFFF">My mum usually shaves for me. </font>This

210
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:39,213
is the weirdest start. Lucie, why
didn't you step forward? <font color="#00FFFF">I think it</font>

211
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:47,213
<font color="#00FFFF">is the accent, not the accent for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">me. </font>Are we ready to meet our next

212
00:18:47,214 --> 00:19:03,733
boy. Please meet Sherif. <font color="#FFFF00">This place</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is mad! My name is Sherif, I'm</font>

213
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:12,213
<font color="#FFFF00">20-years-old from South London, and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am a rugby player. So I have been</font>

214
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:17,213
<font color="#FFFF00">single for about a year-and-a-half.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm labelled as a bit of a player,</font>

215
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:23,213
<font color="#FFFF00">not because I two-time, only because</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I dare to do what others wouldn't.</font>

216
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:28,213
<font color="#FFFF00">If you are not showing real interest</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">next week you may catching her best</font>

217
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:33,213
<font color="#FFFF00">friend or cousin even. I live at</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">home with my mum. My mum would</font>

218
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:37,213
<font color="#FFFF00">probably prefer that I find love and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a nice girl to settle down with</font>

219
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:41,213
<font color="#FFFF00">rather than play the dog role. I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coming on Love Island to find love.</font>

220
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,213
<font color="#FFFF00">I think the idea of a solid</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">relationship is better</font>

221
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:49,213
<font color="#FFFF00">than the idea of being a player my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">whole life. But also to find a good</font>

222
00:19:49,214 --> 00:20:00,213
<font color="#FFFF00">girl with a nice bum to take home to</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">Blown away initially, they all look</font>

225

<font color="#FFFF00">absolutely fit and ready to go. </font>We

who is in a couple. Shall we see who

229
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:37,214
has taken a shine to you. OK girls,
if you fancy Sherif, step forward.

230
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:49,213
No, I would have stepped forward!
<font color="#FFFF00">Each to their own. </font><font color="#00FFFF">It is because you</font>

231
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:54,213

<font color="#FFFF00">is what it is. </font>It's just clothes.

237
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:24,213
It's not down to the girls to decide
who they want to couple up with, it

is it going to take, you can't just

say height, because Joe is taller
than you. <font color="#00FFFF">I am just fussy, I am</font>

single ladies, Yewande and Anna and
the gorgeous Michael sitting on the

334
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:09,733
subs bench. Ladies, this may be your
last chance to step forward. Callum,

335
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:20,213
let's find out which girls fancy
you. She was thinking about it and

336
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:29,213
she did it. She was coupled up with
Sherif. She must like you. Amber,

337
00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:35,053
why did you step forward? <font color="#00FFFF">I like how</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he came over and greeted you</font>

338
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:41,213
<font color="#00FFFF">properly. That is what I live for.</font>
You did the right thing. You love

339
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:47,213
the way he looks. <font color="#00FFFF">Yes. </font>Sherif how
are you feeling? <font color="#11FF11">If I am not her</font>

340
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:52,213
<font color="#11FF11">type I am not her type. </font>Anna to be
on Love Island you have to be in a

341
00:31:52,214 --> 00:32:02,893
couple! Yewande, same goes for you h
hun. <font color="#FFFF00">I tried. </font>Why Didn't you step

342
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:07,053
forward for Callum. <font color="#00FFFF">I don't know why</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't. </font>It is still your choice,

343
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:12,213
you can pick any of our girls, who
would you like to couple up with? <font color="#FFFF00">I</font>

344
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:23,213
<font color="#FFFF00">would love to couple up with Amber.</font>
Off you go. Sherif, you are going to

345
00:32:23,214 --> 00:32:28,213
have to join Michael on the subs
bench. Does that make you feel

346
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:33,213
better, Michael? <font color="#FFFF00">I was happy over</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">here any way. It is one of those</font>

347
00:32:33,214 --> 00:32:37,214
<font color="#FFFF00">things. </font><font color="#00FFFF">The shirts match on the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bench now.</font>

348
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:46,213
Amber, how are you feeling? <font color="#FFFF00">Better,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yeah. </font>Callum would you have chosen

349
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:51,213
Amber if she hadn't stepped forward.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, she caught my eye. </font>We have a

350
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:56,213
new couple, Amber and Callum. OK we
have two single ladies, Yewande and

351
00:32:56,214 --> 00:33:00,053
Anna. It's time to get you two off
the subs bench and coupled up. Stand

352
00:33:00,054 --> 00:33:10,213
next to me. Sherif, as you were the
first boy in, who would you like to

353
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:17,213
couple up with, Yewande or Anna? <font color="#FFFF00">I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">am going to go with Anna. </font>Amazing,

354
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:24,213
off you go. You look lovely
together. Anna, he's taller than

355
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:29,213
you. <font color="#FFFF00">I know, yeah, wow. </font>Michael, as
the last single guy, you are coupled

356
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:32,214
up with the last single girl girl,
Yewande. Off you go.

357
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:45,413
Congratulations, we have our five
couples. Amy and Anton, Yewande and

358
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:48,213
Michael, Lucie and Joe, Anna

359
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:53,213
and Sherif, and Amber and Callum.
The choices you have made could

360
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:57,213
decide how long you stay in the
villa. In your couples you will

361
00:33:57,214 --> 00:34:00,573
spend time getting to know each
other, taking on challenges

362
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:07,213
together, living together and even
sharing a bed together. In just

363
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:10,573
eight weeks' time the public will be
voting for their favourite couple.

364
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:17,213
That couple stands to win a massive
£50,000 cash prize, and be crowned

365
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:24,213
the winners of Love Island 2019. But
don't forget, this is Love Island

366
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:28,413
and the path to true love is never
that simple. There may be a few

367
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:30,893
surprises around the corner

368
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:34,213
and the first surprise may
be sooner than you think.

369
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:41,214
I will see you very soon.

370
00:34:54,214 --> 00:34:58,213
It's been a busy first day in
paradise, not for me.

371
00:34:58,214 --> 00:35:03,253
I've barely said five words
but after the coupling up our brand

372
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:10,213
new love matches are Amy and Anton,
Lucie and Joe, Amber and Callum and

373
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:14,213
after a quick trip to the sub's
bench, Sherif picked Anna and

374
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:27,213
Michael was paired with Yewande. <font color="#00FFFF">I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">am really tall. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Fair enough, nice</font>

375
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:33,213
<font color="#FFFF00">one. </font>Amy stepped forward for Anton,
one of the few Scotsmen whose six

376
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:39,053
pack isn't half a dozen cans of iron
brew and she wants to get to know

377
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:44,213
him better. <font color="#FFFF00">Shall we have a chat.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's get a drink first. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Thank God</font>

378
00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:48,213
<font color="#00FFFF">that's over with. </font><font color="#FFFF00">When Anton walked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">into the villa, I was like, wow,</font>

379
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:55,213
<font color="#FFFF00">he's really fit. He's funny, I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happy I did step forward for him. A</font>

380
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:58,213
<font color="#FFFF00">bed outside. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Thank you very much for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">picking me. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Thank you for picking</font>

381
00:35:58,214 --> 00:36:02,618
<font color="#FFFF00">me, you didn't have to pick me. You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are my type though, blonde, blue</font>

382
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:09,139
<font color="#FFFF00">eyes. I'm happy. I know most people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wo say would say they would have</font>

383
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:16,158
<font color="#FFFF00">picked you, but I would have. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">quite shy when it comes to going up</font>

384
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,159
<font color="#00FFFF">and talking to guys. So one of my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">resolutions before I came in here</font>

385
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,159
<font color="#00FFFF">was to be more confident and just to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be more if you like someone, step</font>

386
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,159
<font color="#00FFFF">forward for them. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You</font>

387
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:35,159
<font color="#FFFF00">have to though, don't you. There's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">no holding back. How old are you?</font>

388
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,159
<font color="#00FFFF">26. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I'm 24. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Age is just a number.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You must have been single for a</font>

389
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:51,679
<font color="#FFFF00">while? </font><font color="#00FFFF">Forever, never had a proper</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">boyfriend. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Shut up! </font><font color="#00FFFF">She's</font>

390
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,159
<font color="#00FFFF">never had a boyfriend at 26. It</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">makes you wonder, maybe this could</font>

391
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,159
<font color="#00FFFF">be the first one, you never know.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Hopefully I can give her a good</font>

392
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:07,159
<font color="#00FFFF">experience with that. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Because I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">waited so long for my Prince</font>

393
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,159
<font color="#FFFF00">charming, then it's got to be - I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">don't like dating apps and stuff.</font>

394
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:21,159
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a mine field, there are so many</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">people. I can't see everyone from</font>

395
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:28,159
<font color="#FFFF00">tinder, I am looking for easy going,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fun, funny, likes banter and I</font>

396
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,199
<font color="#FFFF00">picked you to look at you and when</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the boys were coming in and you were</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">giving them banter and I was like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">That is Scottish patter. There</font>

398
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,159
<font color="#00FFFF">are too many good looking people</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that have no chat whatsoever. It is</font>

399
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,999
<font color="#00FFFF">a waste. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Yes, utterly horrendous. </font><font color="#00FFFF">We</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">could be coupled up the whole time,</font>

400
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,159
<font color="#00FFFF">but looks run out, looks fade. </font><font color="#FFFF00">There</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">will be a time when we don't look</font>

401
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,159
<font color="#FFFF00">like this. </font>They are right, one day
Amy's looks will fade and one day

402
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,839
Anton's mum will tell him to shave
his

403
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,159
own cars, circle of life. Meanwhile
Anna, Sherif, Lucie and Joe are

404
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:21,359
having a nosey around. <font color="#FFFF00">They look so</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">comfy. </font><font color="#00FFFF">It's huge as well. It's well</font>

405
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:29,159
<font color="#00FFFF">big. </font><font color="#11FF11">The villa is insane. If it is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">my home for however long, I am going</font>

00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:39,159
<font color="#11FF11">to be buzzing living here, it is a</font>
<font color="#11FF11">dream. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You are from London, I think</font>

407
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,159
<font color="#FFFF00">I have you on Instagram. </font><font color="#00FFFF">That means</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he thinks you are hot. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I don't know</font>

408
00:38:45,160 --> 00:39:02,159
<font color="#FFFF00">about that. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Did you step forward?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No! </font><font color="#00FFFF">You got my back. </font>Guys We will

weeks, all right Callum get cracking

410
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,159

<font color="#FFFF00">fair. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Thank you. </font><font color="#FFFF00">When I first came</font>

411

<font color="#FFFF00">down I thought yeah. And when you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stepped forward, I thought winner.</font>

412
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
<font color="#00FFFF">It's mad.</font>

413
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:24,159
<font color="#FFFF00">Where are you from? </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am from</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Newcastle. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I am from a place in</font>

414
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,159
<font color="#FFFF00">South Wales. Bridgend. It's outside</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a place called Cardiff. First</font>

415
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,159
<font color="#FFFF00">impressions of Amber, she is lovely,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really pretty. We will see what</font>

416
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:46,159
<font color="#FFFF00">happens. I saw your smile and I was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like please step forward. You took</font>

417
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,359
<font color="#FFFF00">your time, mind. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Because thinking</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">who I would want to share a bed with</font>

418
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:03,159
<font color="#00FFFF">the most. You are the most</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">gentleman-like. I do like a gent.</font>

419
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:17,159
<font color="#FFFF00">How old are you? </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am 21. </font><font color="#FFFF00">How old</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are you? </font><font color="#00FFFF">28. I think most people are</font>

420
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,159
<font color="#00FFFF">older than me. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I like young though.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Wrinkles? </font><font color="#00FFFF">Yes. I would be too</font>

424
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:50,999
<font color="#FFFF00">with that. I don't - he's too nice.</font>
It's not her fault, Amber is drawn

425
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,159
to rude unpleasant men. Time for the
girls to touch base. <font color="#FFFF00">I feel like you</font>

426
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,159

<font color="#00FFFF">a bit naughty. I am excited for</font>

00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,199
<font color="#11FF11">following me on Instagram. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Do you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">follow him back? </font><font color="#11FF11">No. Because I go</font>

437
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:08,159
<font color="#11FF11">out a lot, I am always out, party.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">That is probably what he sees all</font>

438
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,159
<font color="#11FF11">year. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You didn't step forward. </font><font color="#11FF11">I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">didn't step forward, I didn't want</font>

439
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,159
<font color="#11FF11">to do it just because. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feel like I did, he was a gent and I</font>

440
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,160
<font color="#00FFFF">liked that, he's not that funny. You</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">can tell. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Callum? </font><font color="#11FF11">He is quite</font>

441
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:36,159
<font color="#11FF11">mature. </font><font color="#00FFFF">He's 28. I can talk to you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">With him, he's serious. </font><font color="#FFFF00">What do you</font>

442
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:43,159
<font color="#FFFF00">think of your guy, he's a bad boy. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feel like he is. I feel he is a</font>

443
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,159
<font color="#00FFFF">heartbreaker. He is lovely, but</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">looking at him, I know you are not</font>

444
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,159
<font color="#00FFFF">supposed to judge looks. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Do you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fancy him? </font><font color="#00FFFF">He is fit. But my brain</font>

445
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,159
<font color="#00FFFF">is like he's going to break your</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">heart, what is the point. </font>Coming up,

446
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Anton's eyes are wandering. <font color="#FFFF00">I'm not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">going to lie, man, Lucie is fit.</font>

447
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,159
At the coupling up scientist Yewande
and Michael were paired together.

448
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,159
Or as she puts it, the co sign of X
equals two squared over A plus seven

449
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,159
to the power of Michael. It's a
science joke. It's very funny.

450
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:30,159
<font color="#FFFF00">There is a lot to me, we can get on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and have a laugh. </font><font color="#00FFFF">What do you think</font>

451
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,159
<font color="#00FFFF">there is to me. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You do seem like you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are up for a laugh. You've got</font>

452
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,159
<font color="#FFFF00">initial attraction and stuff like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that but you never really know what</font>

453
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,159
<font color="#FFFF00">goes on. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Yes, it's not that I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wouldn't step forward for you,</font>

454
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,159
<font color="#00FFFF">I think it is just more like... </font><font color="#FFFF00">You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thought I was a... </font><font color="#00FFFF">I have been</font>

455
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,159
<font color="#00FFFF">through all that and I don't want to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">do it to myself again. I am not</font>

456
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,159
<font color="#00FFFF">supposed to have pre-conceptions,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and stuff like that. </font><font color="#FFFF00">It's quite</font>

457
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,159
<font color="#FFFF00">understandable, I do get that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">assumption allot. To be honest it's</font>

458
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:12,159
<font color="#FFFF00">the complete opposite. </font><font color="#00FFFF">How long have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you been single for? </font><font color="#FFFF00">About a</font>

459
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,159
<font color="#FFFF00">year-and-a-half. No, that is a lie.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Lying to me already. </font><font color="#FFFF00">What I was</font>

460
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,159
<font color="#FFFF00">thinking was, how long was my last</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">relationship. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Why did it end? </font><font color="#FFFF00">She</font>

461
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,159
<font color="#FFFF00">left me. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Did she, why? </font><font color="#FFFF00">She just said</font>

462
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,159
<font color="#FFFF00">she wasn't in the right place in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">life and didn't really see herself</font>

463
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:39,159
<font color="#FFFF00">in a relationship at that time. So,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just ended. </font><font color="#00FFFF">How old are you? </font><font color="#FFFF00">27. How</font>

464
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:47,199
<font color="#FFFF00">old are you? </font><font color="#00FFFF">23. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I am a scientist, I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">studied biotechnology as a degree.</font>

465
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,519
<font color="#00FFFF">That is interesting because I did</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">biomedical science. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Did you, that's</font>

466
00:44:52,520 --> 00:45:00,159
<font color="#FFFF00">class. You work in the hospital</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">labs? </font><font color="#00FFFF">No, I am a firefighter. I</font>

467
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,159
<font color="#00FFFF">graduated from a science degree to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">running into burning buildings. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I</font>

468
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,159
<font color="#FFFF00">wouldn't take you for the type. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">everybody would, everybody is</font>

469
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,159
<font color="#00FFFF">confused when I tell them about my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">degree. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I am so shocked to find out</font>

470
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,159
<font color="#FFFF00">that he is a scientist as well. It</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was interesting talking to someone</font>

471
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,159
<font color="#FFFF00">who shared the same interests as</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you. He's different, he's not - I</font>

472
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,159
<font color="#FFFF00">wouldn't really go for him. But he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is surprising. I don't know how it's</font>

473
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,160
<font color="#FFFF00">going to go. Interesting. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">good with names. What is your girl's</font>

474
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,360
<font color="#00FFFF">name. </font><font color="#11FF11">Amber.</font>

475
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,999
<font color="#FFFF00">Was it because she stepped forward?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It's hard. In the moment and that.</font>

476
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,159
<font color="#FFFF00">She is a nice girl. </font><font color="#11FF11">She is stunning.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">They are so different though.</font>

477
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,159
<font color="#00FFFF">She's really pretty to be fair. </font><font color="#FFFF00">What</font>

<font color="#11FF11">You see Amy, she's never had a</font>

<font color="#11FF11">That is what she said. </font><font color="#FFFF00">That is a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lie. </font><font color="#11FF11">She is a sound girl. </font><font color="#00FFFF">You're</font>

489
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:54,159

<font color="#00FFFF">talking about us! </font>Sherif is not sure
where he stands with Anna so

496
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,159
sensibly he's seeking the advice of
his local pharmacist. <font color="#FFFF00">How are you</font>

497
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,159
<font color="#FFFF00">feeling? </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am feeling all right. How</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are you feeling? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Good. I am really</font>

00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,159
<font color="#FFFF00">easy going, I don't know. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I feel</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it's calm when we are together. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I</font>

499
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,159
<font color="#FFFF00">get on with you a lot. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I feel our</font>

00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,159
<font color="#FFFF00">everyone here me and you, our energy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is the most similar. </font><font color="#00FFFF">In all honesty</font>

501
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,159
<font color="#00FFFF">I was mad nervous during the first</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit. I find you intimidating, I know</font>

502
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,159
<font color="#00FFFF">you from Instagram, don't forget</font>

503
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,199
<font color="#00FFFF">that. </font><font color="#FFFF00">That's cool. I'm 28 and you</font>

504
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,159
<font color="#FFFF00">well. But I feel like we get on and</font>

505
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,159
<font color="#FFFF00">think let's just take each day as it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">comes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Exactly. That is how I feel.</font>

506
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:19,159
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's see what happens. We might end</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up being good friends or... </font><font color="#00FFFF">Exactly.</font>

507
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:28,159
<font color="#00FFFF">You never know. You never know. </font><font color="#FFFF00">The</font>

508
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,199
<font color="#FFFF00">it's going in the right</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">direction. Sherif has grown on me,</font>

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,839
<font color="#FFFF00">it started here and went down a</font>

510
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,159
<font color="#FFFF00">then went up and then I am sure it</font>

512
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:56,159
<font color="#FFFF00">go like this or like this. </font><font color="#00FFFF">You do</font>

00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,159
<font color="#FFFF00">similar. We are free people. I just</font>

00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,159
<font color="#00FFFF">I have seen her talk to you and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that's about it. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Me and Anna, we got</font>

516
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,199
<font color="#FFFF00">coupled up, I guess you could call</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it by default. But we know that we</font>

00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,159
<font color="#FFFF00">are together in a way, in one way</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shape or form, and just I feel like</font>

00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,159
<font color="#FFFF00">we are on the same page in that</font>

are on the same all weather swinging

00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,159
sofa, available now from the Love
Island shop - probably. <font color="#FFFF00">Do you think</font>

521
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:44,159
<font color="#FFFF00">you would have stepped forward for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the other boys, truthfully? </font><font color="#00FFFF">No. I</font>

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:51,159
<font color="#00FFFF">don't like tattoos, he is a lovely</font>

00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:59,159
<font color="#00FFFF">for me. And wouldn't have stepped</font>

525
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,999
<font color="#00FFFF">No. </font><font color="#FFFF00">It is just based on looks.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Like you say, banter and everything</font>

526
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,159
<font color="#FFFF00">with the boys and things. </font><font color="#00FFFF">It is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">being able to get on and having the</font>

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,159
<font color="#FFFF00">an amazing girl. She has great chat.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">There's</font>

530
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,519
<font color="#FFFF00">not a dull moment with her. But just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when I seen Lucie tonight, she did</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">happening boys? </font><font color="#00FFFF">How is your</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">chat? </font><font color="#FFFF00">She is a cool girl, but at the</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">going to break it. He's going to</font>

534
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:06,160
<font color="#00FFFF">break it. </font><font color="#11FF11">Don't say that. We are</font>
<font color="#11FF11">going to call you the heartbreaker.</font>

535
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,359
<font color="#FFFF00">I knew you like her, but at the same</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">time you are thinking you will never</font>

536
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,159
<font color="#FFFF00">know what's going to happen. </font><font color="#00FFFF">She is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a cool girl, but just at the end of</font>

Still to come, Anton makes his move.

<font color="#FFFF00">I am so attracted to you, I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">looking at you, wow.</font>

539
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,159
At last sandwich man Joe
has got the chance to

540
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,159
speak to Lucie, but first he wants
to make sure she's nice and toasty.

541
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:46,160
Strap in guys, plenty more sandwich

<font color="#00FFFF">side is he was asking me how I was</font>

<font color="#11FF11">You can't force this bro. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Say worst</font>

606
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:19,159
<font color="#00FFFF">think she could be keen, after all</font>

01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,159
cheek of Anton. Peachy pert and
thanks to his mum so silky smooth

01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,159
but he is about to regret Spilling
the Beans to Lucie. <font color="#FFFF00">What is the</font>

01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:35,159
<font color="#FFFF00">matter It is a bit weird. I don't</font>

610
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,159
<font color="#FFFF00">was like I fancy a little bit.</font>

611
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:44,159
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't fancy him. </font><font color="#11FF11">It's fine, no. I</font>

617
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,159
<font color="#11FF11">embarrassed. I think because I have</font>
