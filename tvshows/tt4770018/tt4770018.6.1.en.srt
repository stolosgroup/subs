140
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,480
together but not together, so like
you are together without the label.

141
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,240
you are together without the label.
I am afraid of commitment because

142
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
I am afraid of commitment because
you have to put all your trust in

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,639
you have to put all your trust in
one person and I find that really

144
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,160
one person and I find that really
heard. I pledge to change and I'm

145
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,840
heard. I pledge to change and I'm
going to be open to finding someone.

146
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Going to be open to finding someone.
So what do you want looks-wise? So,

147
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,839
So what do you want looks-wise? So,
it is all cliche - we both said

148
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
it is all cliche - we both said
tall, dark and handsome.

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,760
tall, dark and handsome.
Personality is a big one for me.

150
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,040
Personality is a big one for me.
100%. In the past, I have gone for

151
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,760
100%. In the past, I have gone for
more looks which looks is important

152
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,080
more looks which looks is important
as well because you have to be

153
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,759
as well because you have to be
attracted. I think personality is

154
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,880
Attracted. I think personality is
just key. Yes.

155
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,319
just key. Yes.
Maybe I will go for looks this time

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,360
Maybe I will go for looks this time
because usually I don't. They will

157
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,040
because usually I don't. They will
do whatever they want to you so it

158
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,440
do whatever they want to you so it
burns a bit more when it is, like,

159
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,840
burns a bit more when it is, like,
you are not even -

160
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,000
you are not even -
I wasn't attracted to you and you

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,959
I wasn't attracted to you and you
did that. LAUGHTER

162
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,079
did that. LAUGHTER

happening. How are you feeling? I'm

166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,040

OK. I'm still calm.

what I'm doing wrong. Ex number one

188
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,319
what I'm doing wrong. Ex number one
was my favourite. The second, I was

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,960
you have not got it -
it is personality. Are you here to

294

310
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480

might have to try something

311
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,960
might have to try something
different, all of you. Maybe that is

312
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,720
different, all of you. Maybe that is
where we are going wrong! I kind of

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,400

as it sounds, I have been single for

414
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,999
as it sounds, I have been single for
23 years. It is getting a bit boring

415
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,920
23 years. It is getting a bit boring
now. I love cooking. If I was to

416
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,439
now. I love cooking. If I was to
make a three-course meal for a girl,

417
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,560
make a three-course meal for a girl,
tempura king prawn and if I can't

418
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
tempura king prawn and if I can't
win you over in three courses, you

419
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,000
win you over in three courses, you
have snookered.

420
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
have snookered.
Guilty pleasures? I have a few.

with Siannise who is already in a

438
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,799

couple. That is how it works here.

439
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,959

have stepped forward even though you

445
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:24,120
have stepped forward even though you
have been coupled up. You have been

446
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,360

in a relationship for ten seconds,

447
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,240
in a relationship for ten seconds,
is that too long? What made you step

forward?

449

So, Siannise and Shaughna have

467
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
Callum, how are you feeling? I had
my eye on her anyway, so it is good.

468
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,119
my eye on her anyway, so it is good.
When she stepped forward, it was

469
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,040
When she stepped forward, it was
reassuring? Yes.

470
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,720
reassuring? Yes.
Good eye contact!

471

472
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,000
Nas, this making the relationship
with Siannise a bit awkward? It is

473
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,560
with Siannise a bit awkward? It is
not a cracking start! I can't lie.

474
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,159
not a cracking start! I can't lie.
Siannise, how you feeling? I'm OK.

beautiful. There is no need to

477
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,480
beautiful. There is no need to
worry, we still have lots more boys

478
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,199
Worry, we still have lots more boys
to come. Are you ready? Yes.

479
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:09,960
To come. Are you ready? Yes.

guys. I'm Ollie, 23, and I'm heir to

481

guys. I'm Ollie, 23, and I'm heir to
the Lonhydrock Estate in Cornwall.

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,559
the Lonhydrock Estate in Cornwall.
When my dad died, I'm going to be a

483
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,880
When my dad died, I'm going to be a
Lord! My next door neighbours are

484
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
Lord! My next door neighbours are
Prince Charles and Camilla. I would

485
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
Prince Charles and Camilla. I would
describe myself as wealthy, but I

486
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,120
describe myself as wealthy, but I
don't like to brag about it! I fall

487
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,480
don't like to brag about it! I fall
fast and I fall hard when it comes

488
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,039
fast and I fall hard when it comes
to love. The "love" word can come

489
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,400
to love. The "love" word can come
out prematurely.

490
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,600
out prematurely.
Am I a good boyfriend? Depends which

491
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,399
Am I a good boyfriend? Depends which
ex you ask. My ex of four years, I

492
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,640
ex you ask. My ex of four years, I
broke her heart and probably broke

493
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,560
Broke her heart and probably broke
my own heart at the same time. I'm

494
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,040
my own heart at the same time. I'm
coming to Love Island to find a girl

495
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,120
coming to Love Island to find a girl
that I can take home to my parents

496
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,959
that I can take home to my parents
and someone that my dad will approve

497
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,760
and someone that my dad will approve
of. How are you?

498
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,160
of. How are you?
Really good.

499
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,640
Really good.
How does it feel to be in the Love

500
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,360
How does it feel to be in the Love
Island villa?

501
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,840
Island villa?
Surreal. Really good. So far, we

502
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:11,919
Surreal. Really good. So far, we
have two couples. Siannise and Nas.

503
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,160
have two couples. Siannise and Nas.
Shaughna and Callum. And three

504
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,119
Shaughna and Callum. And three
single girls - Paige, Leanne and

505
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,160
single girls - Paige, Leanne and
Sophie. You can choose any of the

506
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,400
Sophie. You can choose any of the
five girls.

507
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
five girls.
Before we do that, girls, it is time

508
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:38,999
Before we do that, girls, it is time
to step forward if you fancy Ollie.

509
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,600
Before we do that, girls, it is time
Oh! It happens. You are not the only

510
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,240
Oh! It happens. You are not the only
one - it happened to Nas earlier on.

511
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,919
One - it happened to Nas earlier on.
What is going on? Sophie?

512
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,880
What is going on? Sophie?
I don't know. I need to start - I

513
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,640
I don't know. I need to start - I
haven't got my glasses on so that

514
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,560
haven't got my glasses on so that
might be one of the reasons! I feel,

515
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,080
might be one of the reasons! I feel,
like, a lot more dark features.

516
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,160
like, a lot more dark features.
Well, Ollie, it doesn't matter that

517
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,360
Well, Ollie, it doesn't matter that
no-one stepped forward. You can

518
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,640
No-one stepped forward. You can
couple with whoever you want. And

519
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,840
couple with whoever you want. And
you can start grafting and make them

520
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
you can start grafting and make them
change their mind. OK. Who are you

521
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Change their mind. OK. Who are you
going to couple up with?

522
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:23,439
Going to couple up with?
Erm...

523
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,879

526
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,840

Paige, you didn't step forward but

532
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,200
Paige, you didn't step forward but
how are you feeling? Good.

533
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,480
how are you feeling? Good.
Like, from the start I have always

534
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,840
Like, from the start I have always
said people grow on me so... Cool.

535
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,920
said people grow on me so... Cool.
Leanne, you are finding it hard to

536
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,680
Leanne, you are finding it hard to
put yourself out there. All it takes

537
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,320
Put yourself out there. All it takes
is one step forward. Yeah. I know. I

538
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,080
Is one step forward. Yeah. I know. I
will keep that in mind. OK.

539
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,560
will keep that in mind. OK.
Siannise, I noticed that you didn't

540
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,280
Siannise, I noticed that you didn't
step forward so I feel you are

541
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,920
step forward so I feel you are
settling in with Nas now? He is

542
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Settling in with Nas now? He is
lovely. Bless.

543
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,319
lovely. Bless.
I love Princess Jasmine and he looks

544
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,200
I love Princess Jasmine and he looks
like Aladdin. Oh my God!

545
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,560
like Aladdin. Oh my God!
Don't do that to me! What the hell!

546
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,399
Don't do that to me! What the hell!

good. You must feel good about

683
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,680
good. You must feel good about
yourself because Leanne hasn't

684
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,040

00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:17,169
Like politics, you work in politics?
Yes.

823
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:22,449
Yes.
I never had you down as a politics

824
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:22,689
I never had you down as a politics
girl?

825
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:25,049
Girl?
Go on, what were you going to say? I

826
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,969
Go on, what were you going to say? I
think someone like dead serious and

827
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,129
think someone like dead serious and
you are, like...

828
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:30,889
you are, like...
I could be serious. Funny. I can be

829
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:34,489
I could be serious. Funny. I can be
serious. What do you do? A male

830
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,489
serious. What do you do? A male
stripper. You are not. You are too

831
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:38,169
stripper. You are not. You are too
young.

832
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,929
young.
A scaffolder.

833
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:41,849
A scaffolder.
What are you going to say? Your

834
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:46,169
What are you going to say? Your
ex-boyfriend was a scaffolder!

835
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:47,489
ex-boyfriend was a scaffolder!
Yeah? Yeah. Maybe you are a good

836
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,929
Yeah? Yeah. Maybe you are a good
one. It's alright. It's alright.

837
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:52,169
one. It's alright. It's alright.
It's alright. Don't worry about it.

838
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:56,089
It's alright. Don't worry about it.
It was all going so well, so that is

839
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:57,689
It was all going so well, so that is
why you have big arms.

840
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:58,729
why you have big arms.
You think?

841
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:01,489
You think?
I have been going to the gym.

842
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:04,329
I have been going to the gym.
Are you good with your hands? I

843
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:09,289
Are you good with your hands? I
might be. Who knows! I'm joking. So,

844
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:11,129
might be. Who knows! I'm joking. So,
have you cheated? I'm going to tell

845
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:14,448
have you cheated? I'm going to tell
you something now. I have never had

846
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:15,569
you something now. I have never had
a girlfriend.

847
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:17,849
a girlfriend.
Ever. I have had trouble, me.

848
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:18,169
Ever. I have had trouble, me.
Go on.

849
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:19,689
Go on.
I wouldn't say I have had trouble,

850
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:22,409
I wouldn't say I have had trouble,
like - I seem to get the bad pick.

851
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:29,529
like - I seem to get the bad pick.
Do you get the bad pick? I do.

852
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,889
Do you get the bad pick? I do.
Once, I can have a laugh but it got

853
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,569
Once, I can have a laugh but it got
serious. It seems to be you.

854
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:37,888
serious. It seems to be you.
See, I don't want to get carried

855
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:40,569
See, I don't want to get carried
away. I do feel a little bit like

856
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:42,489
Away. I do feel a little bit like
the cat that's got the cream. Callum

857
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:45,569
the cat that's got the cream. Callum
is ticking all the boxes right now.

858
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,929
Is ticking all the boxes right now.
He's such a lovely boy as well. I

859
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:49,249
He's such a lovely boy as well. I
think we are going to get along like

860
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,489
think we are going to get along like
a house on fire.

861
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:51,929
a house on fire.
Leanne is getting to know police

862
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:53,529
Leanne is getting to know police
officer Mike.

863
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:54,929
officer Mike.
Leanne, you don't have to say

864
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,368
Leanne, you don't have to say
anything but it may harm your

865
00:41:58,369 --> 00:41:59,529
anything but it may harm your
relationship if you say anything

866
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:01,809
relationship if you say anything
that Mike finds funny and endearing.

867
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:04,449
that Mike finds funny and endearing.
Where are you from? London. I moved

868
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:08,648
Where are you from? London. I moved
away from London. I am pretty much

869
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:09,769
away from London. I am pretty much
from Manchester.

870
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:11,249
from Manchester.
Are you a footballer? I used to play

871
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:13,249
Are you a footballer? I used to play
professional football, but then I

872
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:15,169
professional football, but then I
stopped that and now I'm a police

873
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:18,209
Stopped that and now I'm a police
officer. What?

874
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:19,209
Officer. What?
Stop! Yeah.

875
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:19,729
Stop! Yeah.
In Manchester?

876
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,529
In Manchester?
Yessis, what do you do? Not that!

877
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:23,289
Yessis, what do you do? Not that!
I work in customer services.

878
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:24,729
I work in customer services.
You good at talking to people? No,

879
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:28,409
You good at talking to people? No,
you would think that, but no. OK.

880
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:29,809
you would think that, but no. OK.
How's being a police officer? It is

881
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:36,449
How's being a police officer? It is
fun. I can't lie. It's exciting. You

882
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:38,209
fun. I can't lie. It's exciting. You
catch murderers? Probably not me,

883
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:39,729
Catch murderers? Probably not me,
per se.

884
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:40,009
Per se.
Really?

885
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:43,529
Really?
No, not really, no. Seeing Mike in a

886
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:45,769
No, not really, no. Seeing Mike in a
tropical two-piece is hard to

887
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:48,489
tropical two-piece is hard to
picture him in, like, a police

888
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:51,089
picture him in, like, a police
outfit arresting criminals.

889
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:51,769
outfit arresting criminals.
Why are you here?

890
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,049
Why are you here?
I don't have a story. Things in the

891
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:54,649
I don't have a story. Things in the
past haven't worked out.

892
00:42:54,649 --> 00:42:56,969
past haven't worked out.
Is that a you thing, is that a them

893
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:57,249
Is that a you thing, is that a them
thing?

894
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:59,289
thing?
It is probably a me thing. You are

895
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,529
It is probably a me thing. You are
beautiful. I ain't going to lie.

896
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:03,649
beautiful. I ain't going to lie.
You are very nice to look at.

897
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,528
You are very nice to look at.
How many guys have you been with?

898
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:08,529
How many guys have you been with?
Serious relationships.

899
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:09,209
Serious relationships.
None.

900
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:09,409
None.
None?

901
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:11,368
None?
Not seriously, no.

902
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,969
Not seriously, no.
OK. I feel like, I find it hard to

903
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:17,968
OK. I feel like, I find it hard to
let people in. Oh, so that's... I'm

904
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:21,649
let people in. Oh, so that's... I'm
a bit weird! Now, we are digging

905
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:22,569
a bit weird! Now, we are digging
deeper!

906
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:22,929
deeper!
I know.

907
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:24,289
I know.
From my first conversations with

908
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:27,928
From my first conversations with
her, I do feel like there's

909
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:29,529
her, I do feel like there's
potential for a strong bond, so I

910
00:43:29,529 --> 00:43:31,889
potential for a strong bond, so I
feel, like, if anybody is going to

911
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:33,889
feel, like, if anybody is going to
open her up, it is definitely me.

912
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:35,889
open her up, it is definitely me.
You struggle to let people in?

913
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:37,169
You struggle to let people in?
Possibly.

914
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:40,609
Possibly.
Possibly, maybe. Or is it the right

915
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:42,889
Possibly, maybe. Or is it the right
person ain't come along. I feel it

916
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,129
person ain't come along. I feel it
is the combination of everything.

917
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:50,808
is the combination of everything.
You have been blessed. Why? I ain't

918
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:51,449
You have been blessed. Why? I ain't
mad.

919
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:52,569
mad.
Still to come:

920
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:53,249
Still to come:
How is your man?

921
00:43:53,249 --> 00:44:02,799
How is your man?
He is so lovely to talk

922
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,279
Over by the pool, the boys seem
pretty happy with their choices.

923
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,999
I mean, Ollie would've preferred
the yellow beanbag,

924
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,359
but Mike had first dibs.

925
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,159
Are you all happy
with your people, then?

926
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,719
I can certainly see myself
in a couple with Paige, you know?

927
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,719
I was just chatting to her
downstairs, and I was like, yeah.

928
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,159
No, but she seemed like a nice girl.

929
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,399
She's really good-looking, yeah.

930
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,279
That's pretty much the same
as me and Leanne.

931
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,999
She seems mysterious,
but I've only spoken to her briefly,

932
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,359
But she seems like a nice girl.
Yeah.

933
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,359
Time will tell.

934
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,119
What about you, big man?
What you saying?

935
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,839
I'm attracted to her,
but I normally go for brunettes.

936
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,840
What's her name?

937
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:33,879
Shaughna.

938
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,839
LAUGHTER

939
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,199
Shaughna, are you sure?

940
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,159
I think people from the north
and the south

941
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,799
have got very different types of,
like, banter.

942
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,519
You know what I'm saying?
Especially between boys and girls.

943
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,959
When I was talking to her,
she was actually quite on my level.

944
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,559
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

945
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,599
It did seem like that, mate,
it did seem like that.

946
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,359
What did you think about Sophie?
Are you happy with her?

947
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,999
Yeah, I'm well happy.

948
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,439
She stood out straightaway, she was,
like, the first bird I looked at.

949
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,639
Would you have gone for her
if she didn't step forward?

950
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,799
No. Cos if a girl didn't fancy me,
I don't want go there.

951
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,879
I know what you're saying.

952
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,759
It's a bit of a knock, isn't it?
Yeah. What about yours, anyway?

953
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,599
Obviously, no-one stepped
forward for you. I'm sorry to...

954
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,879
I did realise, but thanks
for letting me know again.

955
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,719
She is actually, like,
such a lovely girl.

956
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,799
She seemed really friendly. But,
again, as you say, early doors.

957
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,999
Yeah.

958
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,479
Do you know what, guys?

959
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,439
If I'm completely honest, like,
I don't fancy him.

960
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,719
Really?
He's shorter than me.

961
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,839
Is he?
Like, that's an issue for me.

962
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,399
What, even with heels?
Are you sure?

963
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,119
Yeah, even when I took my shoes off,
it's even, like,

964
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,719
we're, like, the same.
I'm really short.

965
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,879
I'm happy getting to know him,
and, like, he's fun.

966
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,559
He is fun to talk to though,
and, like, he is lovely,

967
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,159
but I just think at the moment,
I'm just not feeling it.

968
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,559
Ollie's so nice, bless, he such
a nice boy, but he's not my type.

969
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,799
Yeah.
Well, my man sells coffee beans.

970
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,639
Really?
Yeah, he's so cute.

971
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,399
I feel like I like his tattoos,
I like his vibe...

972
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,999
He's obviously got the veneers in,
hasn't he?

973
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,799
Oh, my God.
Have you seen teeth like it?

974
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,159
What about Mike? How is Mike?
Yeah, no, he's nice.

975
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,039
LAUGHTER

976
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,199
I know.

977
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,519
The thing is, I'm not
even joking, like.

978
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,839
No, he's nice.
Just a nice boy, isn't he?

979
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,959
I mean, he's not the plumber,
but he is a policeman.

980
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,959
He's a policeman?
Yeah, he's a policeman.

981
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,359
Really? You go, girl.

982
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,159
What, wears a suit and everything?
Yeah.

983
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,119
You have to, don't you?

984
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,279
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

985
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,279
Even though he's a policeman,
he's very beautiful in the face.

986
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,399
Do you know what I mean?

987
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,919
How is your man?
Yeah.

988
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,039
Is it Callum?

989
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,239
No, but my head is gone.

990
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,399
What do you like?
Like, what are you feeling?

991
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,439
He's just so lovely to talk to.

992
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,919
Aw. You fancy him?

993
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,359
Yeah, I really fancy him

994
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,239
I literally remember when he
was coming downstairs,

995
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,240
I said, "Yeah, he's fit."

996
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:59,759
I said, "He's hot."

997
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,399
That's so cute that
you're literally feeling him.

998
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,639
He might get the odd arm rub
tonight. Oh!

999
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,879
Just an arm.

1000
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,079
No, no, no. I mean, I don't know...

1001
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,919
We don't even know
if they are snorers yet.

1002
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,839
GASPS

1003
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,879
As the sun sets on the first day,

1004
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,039
our brand-new couples
are all asking the same question.

1005
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,039
"Can someone give us a map
for this place?

1006
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,279
"It's bloody massive."

1007
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,639
I'm excited.

1008
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,759
It's going to be nice to get to know
everyone a bit more, as well.

1009
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,439
Is anyone kissing
on the first night?

1010
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,639
You are because you're in love.

1011
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,599
OK, maybe. I'm joking. I'm joking!

1012
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,479
I'm hoping that Leanne opens up
a little bit more.

1013
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,759
She seems a bit reserved.
Really?

1014
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,239
Those are normally the kind of,
like, sweethearts,

1015
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,839
do you know what I mean?

1016
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,959
Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting
Sophie, to be honest, mate.

1017
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,559
She is beautiful, so it would be
nice to see her personality

1018
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,319
Oh, she's beautiful.

1019
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,919
You're gonna tell Sophie
you love her.

1020
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,239
Are you gonna get on
the magic carpet tonight?

1021
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,599
Ladies, he might look like Aladdin,
but it doesn't mean he is Aladdin.

1022
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,799
OK?

1023
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,159
You're not gonna let that lad in.

1024
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,759
LAUGHTER

1025
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,639
Thank you.

1026
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,519
I haven't had much of a chance
to speak to Ollie.

1027
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,319
I need to, like,
not shut him down so quickly.

1028
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,439
Because he seems a nice guy.
Yeah.

1029
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,719
Lets do it, lads.

1030
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:40,239
CHEERING

1031
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,479
Here's to the first night
in the villa.

1032
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,039
Obviously,
to me and all you beautiful people,

1033
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,280
Obviously,
to

1034
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,240
meeting all you beautiful people,

1035
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:51,079
to the beautiful people
of South Africa for hosting us,

1036
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,119
and of course, to finding love.

1037
00:48:52,120 --> 00:49:10,959
CHEERING

1038
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,079
It's taken all day,
but Sophie is finally having

1039
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,239
a one-to-one one with professional
coffee bean salesman Connor.

1040
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,359
Oh, well, better latte than never.

1041
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,519
Have you had any, like,
girlfriends or anything?

1042
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,759
Yeah, I've had, like,
two big relationships.

1043
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,519
They were, like, five years,
and two and a half years.

1044
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,599
Five years?
Yeah.

1045
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,519
That's a lot. Which one first?

1046
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,839
So, five-year first,
then I moved to Australia... Yeah.

1047
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,639
...then I met my previous one
in Australia.

1048
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,879
I feel like you go everywhere.

1049
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,759
No, I know. I just leave.

1050
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,759
You've got your backpack here,
there and everywhere.

1051
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,199
I feel like I'd love to, like...
Actually, to be fair, I've lied.

1052
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,679
No, I wouldn't like the idea
of travelling.

1053
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,919
I can't imagine
you going travelling.

1054
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,199
I've only known you
for five minutes, but...

1055
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,519
Me with a backpack?
Would you hate that?

1056
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,559
Oh, my God,
that would be my worst nightmare.

1057
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,719
It's like staying in hostels,
and things like that.

1058
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,239
Yeah, I hear stories about people
getting bedbugs, and, ugh...

1059
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,719
Are you a family girl?
Yeah, for sure.

1060
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,319
I literally love...
I'm so close to my sisters. Are you?

1061
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,959
We all look exactly the same,
as well. It's scary.

1062
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,879
Really?
Yeah. It's very scary.

1063
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,999
Are you the youngest or oldest?
The youngest.

1064
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,039
The youngest?
Yeah, I'm a baby.

1065
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,719
I've got a brother, as well.

1066
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,599
My mum is called Julie.

1067
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,879
Yeah. A bit of Julie.

1068
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,719
Yeah, I know!

1069
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,199
That's what I always say.
I'm like, "Me Julie."

1070
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,519
How old do you you wanna be
when you have kids?

1071
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,599
I dunno, like, mid to late 20s.

1072
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
Really?
Yeah.

1073
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:36,239
How old are you now, 21?
Yeah.

1074
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,159
So, in, like, four or five years?

1075
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,959
If I met someone...

1076
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,759
You obviously sound like
the relationship type of guy.

1077
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,679
Yeah. I would like to find someone
now, do you know what I mean?

1078
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,519
Well, you're in the right place
to find it. Mm.

1079
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,439
Posh Ollie is talking to Paige.

1080
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,959
It's his first ever conversation
with an actual Scottish person.

1081
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,559
He asked if
he could have subtitles.

1082
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,039
I said, "No, you cannae."

1083
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,999
I don't think he understood.

1084
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,599
I think I feel really, really bad,

1085
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,679
because sometimes, like,
I'm a hard nut to crack.

1086
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,919
I'm such a laid-back guy.

1087
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,719
That's one thing
you don't have to worry about.

1088
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,479
That's what I really like
about you from just now.

1089
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,799
Obviously, you're gorgeous, as well.

1090
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,759
But it's nice just to be able to,
sort of,

1091
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,879
be on the same page as someone...

1092
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,479
Oh! Oh!

1093
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,119
So, am I, like, your usual type, or?

1094
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,279
Yeah, you are.
Blonde?

1095
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,439
Blonde, blue eyes, you know,
gorgeous body. Yeah.

1096
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,079
Your past relationships?

1097
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,879
So, I had a four-year relationship.
Four? Wow.

1098
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,999
18-month relationship.
OK.

1099
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,119
I went to uni
with my first girlfriend,

1100
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,239
and just being really honest
with you, I cocked up.

1101
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,439
First time around. Yeah.

1102
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,519
What?

1103
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,719
Which I now realise...
I cheated on her.

1104
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,799
Oh.

1105
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,439
When he said that he cheated on
his first girlfriend,

1106
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,440
that was, like, a red flag.

1107
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:45,719
I was like, "Hmm."

1108
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:51,839
I have quite high expectations.
I can be quite hard work.

1109
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,599
Yeah, like I said,
I'm very laid back.

1110
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,719
So, can you put up with
high maintenance?

1111
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,799
Yes. Course I can.
OK.

1112
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,559
One thing I do love to do,
is spoil the girl.

1113
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,559
Not even like that way.

1114
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,839
I'm hard work in terms of,
like, emotion.

1115
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,159
So you've got to be very persistent.

1116
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,199
Look at me being rude.
It's fine.

1117
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,879
Be persistent and it will come.

1118
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,279
You'll crack it eventually.

1119
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,359
Cool. That's positive.

1120
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,119
You're definitely a nice boy.

1121
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,039
Good. And you're a lovely girl.

1122
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,639
Hmm.

1123
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,559
She says she high maintenance
and she's a bit of a challenge,

1124
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,679
but to be honest with you,

1125
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,479
the best things in life
don't come without hard work,

1126
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,999
so I definitely think that

1127
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,559
that is something I'm ready to,
sort of,

1128
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,479
start breaking down the walls.
I think I have started the process.

1129
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,639
So, what is that you actually do,
like?

1130
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,639
So, if I was being straight up
with you...

1131
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,119
I will be. I'm a landowner, so...
OK.

1132
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,079
...we have a load of land, and...

1133
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,159
So, you're not actually a farmer?

1134
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,919
Yeah, we do, we have a beef herd.
It's a family business.

1135
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,359
One minute, I'll be doing forestry
with a chainsaw,

1136
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,679
next minute,
I could be feeding the cows...

1137
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,159
A man with many talents. Yeah.
Jack-of-all-trades.

1138
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,119
I am a bit of a jack-of-all-trades.
I like that expression. OK.

1139
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,599
Maybe I was
a bit quick to judge him.

1140
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,839
After the conversation,
it felt easier to flirt with him.

1141
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,399
And that's definitely a big thing.

1142
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:17,119
It was easier to flirt than before.

1143
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,639
Coming up...
Ollie's eyes are wondering.

1144
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,159
You and Paige
are probably the only two girls

1145
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:36,719
I can see myself in a couple with.

1146
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,359
Up in the kitchen,
Sophie's got a question for Ollie.

1147
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,719
I've got a question for Ollie.

1148
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,799
Do you really stand to inherit
17.5 million and, if so,

1149
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,199
would you ever consider
marrying a Scottish comedian?

1150
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,200
Who are you digging?

1151
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:51,199
What do you mean?

1152
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,159
I mean, Paige is really cool,
we get on really well.

1153
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,479
I can see you with Siannise.

1154
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,359
Potentially.

1155
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,999
I feel like yous would have a lot
in common.

1156
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,919
The thing is for me, I don't want
to tread on anyone's toes.

1157
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,439
If you're feeling the vibes,
go for it.

1158
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,839
Everyone in here is so nice,
but, it's like...

1159
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,759
You've got to
do what you've got to do, mate.

1160
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,919
You're not stepping on
anyone's toes.

1161
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,239
Yeah.

1162
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
Everything all right?

1163
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:13,559
Yeah.

1164
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,959
Hey.

1165
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,079
Cool.

1166
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,999
Shall we go and say hello
to the others? Yeah.

1167
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,559
I think we're going to go,
have a little wander.

1168
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,159
So, how are you feeling?

1169
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,359
It's, like, nerve wracking,
really.

1170
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,719
I love your accent.
It's, like, so my end.

1171
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,679
So, like, proper job, mate.
Proper job.

1172
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,559
Proper job. So funny.

1173
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,999
How are you feeling with Nas?

1174
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,199
He's lovely.

1175
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,199
Like, I don't think I fancy him,
if I'm completely honest.

1176
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,519
But, um, to talk to,
he's absolutely lovely.

1177
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,559
Yeah.

1178
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:49,599
Oh, Nas, do you know
where your missus is?

1179
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,759
Where's she at?
Someone get eyes on her for me.

1180
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,799
She's getting a little cosy
with somebody else.

1181
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,999
Your a little shit stirrer, you.

1182
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,559
Don't know how to feel
about that one, to be fair.

1183
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,759
Obviously it is,
it is obviously the first day

1184
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,799
and I understand everyone
wants to get to know each other.

1185
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,479
I actually genuinely think
she's a lovely girl.

1186
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
She is.

1187
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:10,879
She is, yeah.

1188
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,519
What is your type?
What would you say your type is?

1189
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,679
So... I'm more of, like, I like
a tall, dark and handsome typically.

1190
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,959
Yeah, yeah.

1191
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,439
So I quite like, like, dark skin,
dark features, you know,

1192
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,919
that's what I've always gone for.

1193
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,799
Nas is dark and handsome.

1194
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,079
Yeah, but, I don't...
It's difficult.

1195
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,639
Slightly, maybe the tall is...

1196
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,839
Yeah, that is bothering me
a little bit.

1197
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Is it?

1198
00:55:33,841 --> 00:55:35,359
Because I do like a tall man.

1199
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,119
I think I need to just try
something different though.

1200
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,279
Because I think I've always stuck
to the same type of man

1201
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,799
and it's not worked.

1202
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,479
So I'm thinking,
maybe I need to branch out a bit,

1203
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,399
try something different.

1204
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,079
I mean,
blonde guys are always really good.

1205
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,479
Yeah, and I like
you've got blue eyes as well.

1206
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
Yeah, I do.

1207
00:55:52,481 --> 00:55:53,599
Yeah.

1208
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,759
So, you and I.
Could you, could see that?

1209
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,760
I think you're sweet.

1210
00:55:56,761 --> 00:55:57,959
I think you're sweet, definitely.

1211
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,719
That is such a let down.

1212
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,839
No, it's, it's... When you think,
we haven't even been here for a day.

1213
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,759
Being honest, you and Paige
are probably the only two girls

1214
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,319
that I could see myself in a couple
with, if that makes sense?

1215
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,839
Yeah.

1216
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,879
Because you're a West Country girl
and you also joke, which is...

1217
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,199
Ah, I'll take that as compliment.

1218
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,879
No, as in, like, you can actually
make me laugh.

1219
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,880
OK.

1220
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,880
And so can Paige.

1221
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:28,199
Yeah. You are sweet.

1222
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,919
I feel like you look like John Smith
from Pocahontas.

1223
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,559
Who the hell is John Smith
from Pocahontas?

1224
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,799
Have you seen Pocahontas?

1225
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,919
Kind of, like, the cartoon?

1226
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
Yeah.

1227
00:56:34,921 --> 00:56:36,479
You absolutely look like John Smith.

1228
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,440
Is that a good thing?

1229
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:38,479
Yeah, 100%.

1230
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,639
It is obviously the first day.

1231
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,919
On the other hand, I did pick her
and she seems like a lovely girl.

1232
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,319
Ollie fucking picked me
and he's over there, like, I mean...

1233
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,679
How do you both feel about that?

1234
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,959
To be fair,
it may be my own fault.

1235
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,519
It may be entirely me being cold.
But, I mean...

1236
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,999
Do you think you've been cold?

1237
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,279
I don't think, I've not seen a lot,
but I don't think you've been cold.

1238
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,280
Flirty.

1239
00:56:59,281 --> 00:57:01,719
I think that's a bit harsh.

1240
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,039
On paper, obviously Paige is,
you know...

1241
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,239
A bit of you.

1242
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,159
A bit of me.

1243
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,359
But one of the big things is, she's
from Scotland, I'm from Cornwall.

1244
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,519
Yeah.

1245
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,520
Two ends of the country.

1246
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:15,639
Well, that's the thing.

1247
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,559
I'd be interested to find out
who pulled who for the conversation.

1248
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,599
Shall I go and march over there
and ask them?

1249
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,479
That last chat we had,
he told me earlier actually,

1250
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,679
that he cheated
on his first girlfriend.

1251
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,839
Ollie? Ollie?

1252
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,559
Yeah, and instantly, I was like...
I was like, you're a dark horse.

1253
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,759
Seeing Ollie chat to Siannise,
slightly surprising, I'll admit it.

1254
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,319
I mean, it's first day
and things are intense,

1255
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,919
but I don't know
if it's warning signs already.

1256
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,239
Ever since Sophie stepped forward
for our resident coffee salesman,

1257
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,639
Connor, that boy
has been full of beans.

1258
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,640
It's been, it's been a mad day.

1259
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:54,679
It has.

1260
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,439
But at least I'm happy.

1261
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,719
I was shocked you stepped forward
for me.

1262
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,719
You were shocked?

1263
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,439
I don't know why,
but as I walked down the stairs,

1264
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,639
you were, like, the first person
that stood out to me.

1265
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,359
I don't... Obviously
you're beautiful and whatever.

1266
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,479
And whatever!

1267
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,799
No, you are,
but when I walked down the stairs,

1268
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,399
you were the first person that
I caught eyes with. I was nervous.

1269
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,839
When you said hello and stuff,
I heard your voice and I thought,

1270
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,039
wow, that is a bit more of me.

1271
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,199
I think with you,
it's funny as well.

1272
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,879
You make me laugh, you are funny.

1273
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,759
I laugh at you,
no, I'm laughing at you.

1274
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,199
I feel like you're different.

1275
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
That makes me laugh.

1276
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
I'm different?

1277
00:58:30,201 --> 00:58:31,279
Mm.

1278
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,759
No, but you make me laugh.
I'm laughing at you.

1279
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,439
I can't even look at you seriously.

1280
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,519
You know what,

1281
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,279
I feel like Connor has this laugh
where it actually kills me.

1282
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,839
It sounds so cringy,
but, like, whenever he laughs,

1283
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,159
I'm, like, what are you doing?

1284
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,519
Who do you think, like,
seems the sweetest?

1285
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,479
You.

1286
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,759
No, not, like, girls.

1287
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,079
I meant couples.
Apart from me.

1288
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,439
Go on, answer that question.

1289
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,159
Apart from me. Do you fancy
anyone else in the villa?

1290
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,439
No, do you?

1291
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,999
No.

1292
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Not at the moment.

1293
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:10,599
No.

1294
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:15,359
Coming up, Nas has got news.

1295
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,119
Islanders, it's time to really
get the party started,

1296
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:30,248
as two very important guests
are about to arrive. #doubletrouble

1297
00:59:30,249 --> 00:59:31,848
All ten islanders
are heading over to the fire pit,

1298
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:33,608
for a very revealing game...

1299
00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:36,488
true or false!

1300
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,688
And the answer is, it's true, that
is definitely what they are doing.

1301
00:59:38,689 --> 00:59:40,088
Connor, you're up.

1302
00:59:40,089 --> 00:59:42,648
I'll start off, yeah?

1303
00:59:42,649 --> 00:59:47,608
I did not go on a first date,
and then I had a threesome.

1304
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:48,888
You completely lost me.
Expand.

1305
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,648
I went back to her house

1306
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:52,848
and ended up having a threesome
with her flatmate.

1307
00:59:52,849 --> 00:59:54,088
Oh, wild.
Did you go on a second date?

1308
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:55,768
No, no.

1309
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:56,848
I reckon that's true.

1310
00:59:56,849 --> 00:59:59,088
I can see it in your eyes.
True.

1311
00:59:59,089 --> 01:00:03,168
Yeah, yeah, it's true.
It's true.

1312
01:00:03,169 --> 01:00:09,568
Go on.

1313
01:00:09,569 --> 01:00:12,208
I've got one.

1314
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:15,368
I have slept with over 20 boys.

1315
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:16,369
True.

1316
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:17,968
No, false!

1317
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:20,648
False!

1318
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:22,888
I feel like even
before I could finish my sentence,

1319
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:26,368
good old Connor next to me
was like, "True, true, true."

1320
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:29,008
Fucking, who put 20 pence in him?

1321
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:31,888
I'm going to say false.
False, obviously. Thank you.

1322
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:32,928
Big Mike, let's hear a number.

1323
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:36,168
It's less than 20.

1324
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:38,448
You've got yourself a keeper there.

1325
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:42,128
Not the one with a threesome
on a first date!

1326
01:00:42,129 --> 01:00:46,728
You hate me tonight.

1327
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:49,248
You're hating me, you are.

1328
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:53,808
Why are you saying that?
You're hating me.

1329
01:00:53,809 --> 01:00:57,608
No, I'm not. You're digging me out
already. You are.

Oh, my God.

1351
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:12,208
Oh, my God, I actually couldn't
believe it, twins, what a bombshell.

They're twins, they're twins,
they are twins.

Oh, my God, they're twins!

1354
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:21,368
Twice is definitely nice,
you know it I mean?

1355
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:24,168
Double trouble.

1356
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:30,808
Hey!

1357
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:36,768
Hi, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

1358
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:38,528
What's your name?
I'm Jess.

1359
01:02:38,529 --> 01:02:43,408
Nice to meet you.

1360
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:49,368
Hi, Jess. Good to see you.
You look gorgeous.

1361
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:53,608
It was initially, like, whoa!
I didn't want to react too much,

1362
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:55,928
because I didn't want to
wind up Paige.

1363
01:02:55,929 --> 01:02:57,048
Are you both 20?

1364
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:59,928
Obviously, because you are twins,
stupid question.

1365
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:03,488
These two beautiful blondes

1366
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:10,728
look like they have just
walked out of a Playboy spread.

1367
01:03:10,729 --> 01:03:14,648
So hard because we are dressed
the same.

1368
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:17,288
Jess, Eve.
Jess and Eve? Oh, OK.

1369
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:20,808
I was trying so hard
not to look fuming.

1370
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:24,208
I wasn't fuming, but I was trying
hard not to look bothered.

1371
01:03:24,209 --> 01:03:28,168
I'm a nervous wreck,
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1372
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:33,488
There is no way I could tell those
twins apart. Honestly.

1373
01:03:33,489 --> 01:03:40,808
They are identical,
they look exactly the same.

1374
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:42,288
Let me guess, you are twins.

1375
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:44,888
Yes, identical twins.

1376
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:47,168
People think we look really alike

1377
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:51,168
or some people think
we look quite different.

1378
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:55,488
I can tell straightaway, you know.
Straightaway.

1379
01:03:55,489 --> 01:03:58,368
Serious, nah, I can, straightaway.

1380
01:03:58,369 --> 01:04:03,928
Let me have a guess, Jess.
No!

1381
01:04:03,929 --> 01:04:07,488
Do you not wear the same stuff
all the time?

1382
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:10,848
Sometimes we match, but usually
we do the same or different.

1383
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:11,969
Sometimes we match, but usually
Sometimes we match, but usually

1384
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:13,809
Sometimes we match, but usually
we do the same but

1385
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:14,609
different.

1386
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:15,728
Do you do a lot of things the same?

1387
01:04:15,729 --> 01:04:17,648
We do everything together,
live together, work together.

1388
01:04:17,649 --> 01:04:19,528
Going for the same kind of guys?
Yeah, we have the same time.

1389
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:22,808
What is your type, then?

1390
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:26,528
It is hard to put into words,
you know it I mean?

1391
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:35,008
When you can vibe with someone.
Anyone taking your fancy now?

1392
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:38,088
I need to properly assess it.
If you had to say one name each?

1393
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:45,168
I can't, I can't.
Boys are sitting there, like, "Ooh!"

1394
01:04:45,169 --> 01:04:47,288
How long have you been single for?

1395
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:48,888
I was in a long-term relationship,

1396
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:54,288
and I have been single
since the beginning of summer. Jess?

1397
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:56,328
I have not had a serious, serious
relationship. Never?

1398
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:57,968
No.

1399
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:03,488
What if you both want the same boy?
We have never fought over guys.

1400
01:05:03,489 --> 01:05:06,448
I would never, like, we would never.

1401
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:10,448
This is Love Island,
different environment.

1402
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:13,568
The weirdest time to be me and you,
I don't know.

1403
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:17,208
I can't see us arguing over someone.

double trouble.

back in your mouth, Mike!

1412
01:05:57,089 --> 01:05:59,528
Do you have any ideas?

1413
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:03,528
I will get to know everyone
on an individual level.

1414
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:05,208
I dunno, there are some people
where I'm like, mmm...

1415
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:06,888
I know it's Callum,
one of them is going to like him.

1416

And they look like Playboy girls,
in the best way possible.

This is intense.
Serious thinking tonight.

1418
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:15,408
We'll see.

1419
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:17,928
We were not getting anything
from them,

1420
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:21,688
so we don't know what they are
looking for, what they like.

I think tomorrow
is gonna be a deadly day.

01:06:28,449 --> 01:06:32,048
I can't wait!

1424
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:35,088
Tomorrow night...

1425
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:37,248
Question, there's no chance
of you guys liking the same person?

1426
01:06:37,249 --> 01:06:41,168
...get ready for double trouble.

1427
01:06:41,169 --> 01:06:43,768
There is no, preference,
like, either one of them?

1428
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:46,088
Not at the minute, no.

1429
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:48,448
We've never argued over guys before.

1430
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:51,928
That's my opinion.
You're annoying me so much!

1431
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:58,249
So the boy I would like
to couple up with is...
