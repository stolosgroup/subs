00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:19,406
five boys were hot on hair heels. <font color="#00FFFF">Oh</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">my God! </font>They coupled up. But there

4
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,406

Tonight - two new
boys means two big decisions.

Two new two new
boys have arrived in paradise,

16
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:32,926
Curtis a ballroom dancer and Tommy a

17
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,406
boxer. A brutal and blood thirst
at this sport, ballroom dancing

18
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:41,446
originated in the 16th century. In
24 hours the new arrivals will steal

19
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:45,407
two girls, leaving two boys
vulnerable and the lads are feeling

20
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,406
the pressure.

21
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:56,407
<font color="#00FFFF">Be honest, how are you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feeling confidence-wise?</font>

22
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:00,406
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm there.</font>

23
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:05,406
<font color="#11FF11">Chill. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Chill. </font><font color="#00FFFF">But they are good</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">looking, man!</font>

24
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,406
<font color="#00FFFF">His eyes, I got lost</font>

25
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:11,086
<font color="#00FFFF">in his eyes. Tommy, man.</font>

26
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:18,086
<font color="#FFFF00">He's got big arms. He's in good</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shape, man. Fair play to him.</font>

27
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:24,406
<font color="#00FFFF">Tommy is a big boy boxer,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I wouldn't like to get on his</font>

28
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:27,406
<font color="#00FFFF">wrong side. Game on.</font>

29
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:31,406
<font color="#11FF11">How are we feeling? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Better now.</font>

30
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:33,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Relaxed a little bit now.</font>

31
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:37,406
<font color="#00FFFF">I was bricking it walking in.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It is the unknown</font>

32
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:42,406
<font color="#FFFF00">unknown, not knowing what's to come.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The ladies are stunning, all of them</font>

33
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:47,406
<font color="#00FFFF">are. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I keep thinking everyone has</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">been in here ages, but they're not.</font>

34
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:53,086
<font color="#00FFFF">We are going to get our graft on</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tomorrow. </font><font color="#11FF11">They seem like such sound</font>

35
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:56,406
<font color="#11FF11">guys. They are part of the game,</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">the best looking girl.</font>

37
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:08,406
<font color="#00FFFF">It is what it is. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Judging where my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">eyes are going...</font>

38
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:12,406
<font color="#00FFFF">I know who you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are going to say.</font>

39
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:18,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I like pink pants</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and curly hair.</font>

40
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,407
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know her name.</font>

41
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:28,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I love curly fries with mayo on it.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It is an odd feeling, you don't want</font>

00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:33,406
<font color="#FFFF00">to tread on anyone's toes, I am not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that type of guy. I am a nice guy in</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">What's happening boys? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Join the</font>

45
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:47,406
<font color="#FFFF00">slumber party. </font><font color="#11FF11">How is everyone</font>
<font color="#11FF11">doing? Sit down. Come and take a</font>

46
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:52,406
<font color="#11FF11">seat. Talk to us girls-wise, what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">are you feeling? </font><font color="#FFFF00">You had no clue of</font>

47
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:57,407
<font color="#FFFF00">the girls before you came in? </font><font color="#00FFFF">We</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">knew nothing about you or the girls.</font>

48
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:04,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I like that, we are all in the same</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">predicament. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Everybody is, you need</font>

49
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:07,406
<font color="#00FFFF">to get to known everyone.</font>

51
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:18,406
<font color="#FFFF00">dudes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">It's mad because everyone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sees me as being a Dick head, I am</font>

52
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:21,406
<font color="#00FFFF">anything but that,</font>

53
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:26,406
<font color="#00FFFF">I love Hannah Montana</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for God's sake.</font>

54
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:29,406
<font color="#00FFFF">There's not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">one bad bone in my body.</font>

55
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:32,926
<font color="#00FFFF">I might be a tough man</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in the ring but that</font>

56
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,406
<font color="#00FFFF">doesn't display my personality at</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">all.</font>

57
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:38,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel under threat,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't lie.</font>

58
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:43,406
<font color="#FFFF00">We are going to have to see how it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">goes and who they choose. </font>Tommy is

59
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:47,406
getting straight down to business.
Ding, ding, seconds out. Get your

60
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:52,406
graft on. <font color="#00FFFF">Were you nervous coming</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">down there earlier? </font><font color="#FFFF00">I was, yes. You</font>

61
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:58,406
<font color="#FFFF00">can't be everyone's cup of tea. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know that. It's all about connection</font>

62
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:01,406
<font color="#FFFF00">for me. Looks is good, but you are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not talking to the looks, you are</font>

63
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:06,407
<font color="#FFFF00">talking to the personality. I wanted</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to come over and see where you are.</font>

64
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:14,406
<font color="#00FFFF">Joey is good at cooking.</font>

65
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:19,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I can cook,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I would have to take lessons.</font>

66
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:24,406
<font color="#11FF11">Tommy is definitely nice to look at.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Really nice eyes, he had nice hair,</font>

67
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:30,406
<font color="#11FF11">dressed nicely. It was a switcher,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I really liked it. </font><font color="#FFFF00">How is</font>

00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:53,406
<font color="#11FF11">and meeting everyone for the first</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">much? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Not really, I am always</font>

75
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:07,246

<font color="#FFFF00">cigar and whisky and let me listen</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to the 60s. I feel like Amy and I</font>

110
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:10,406
<font color="#FFFF00">have a lot in common. She seems</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">nice, like she's got a good</font>

112
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:20,446
making a move on Anton's other half.
He's not bothered, he is too busy

113
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:27,406
getting lost in Tommy's eyes. They
are so blue. <font color="#FFFF00">In this environment you</font>

114
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:33,406
<font color="#FFFF00">can't have a game plan. If a girl in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">here says yeah you are good looking</font>

115
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,406
<font color="#FFFF00">but I have a really strong</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">connection with such and such, I am</font>

00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:41,406
<font color="#FFFF00">not going to fight that. I will try,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I will say what I need to say,</font>

117
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:45,406
<font color="#FFFF00">if it's not good enough, you can</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">only do so much. </font><font color="#00FFFF">You can't make the</font>

118
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:50,247
<font color="#00FFFF">decision for them at the end of the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">day. That is the situation I am in</font>

119
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:56,406
<font color="#00FFFF">with Lucie just now.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Joe really likes her.</font>

120
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:59,406
<font color="#00FFFF">When Lucie came down in</font>

121
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:04,406
<font color="#00FFFF">that dress. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Got me too. </font>Tommy and
Anton have their

122
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:09,406

already got her into bread - bed, I

125
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:22,406

128
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:36,407

00:10:43,407 --> 00:10:48,406
<font color="#00FFFF">If I said yes, come on then. Is that</font>

134
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:25,406
<font color="#FFFF00">too small. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I feel like we are going</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be touching. </font><font color="#FFFF00">That is affine.</font>

135
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:29,606
<font color="#00FFFF">Curtis and I have a lot in common.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">We have been talking for ages. </font><font color="#11FF11">Would</font>

<font color="#11FF11">to, she is seems sweet.</font>

00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:52,406
<font color="#00FFFF">What are you wearing to bed? Sexy?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Not sex,</font>

141
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:58,406
<font color="#FFFF00">never. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I want to wear something a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little bit bevvy, but not too much.</font>

142
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:05,407
<font color="#00FFFF">Too much, what do you think?</font>

143
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:16,407
<font color="#FFFF00">Treading the water.</font>

144
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:24,407
<font color="#FFFF00">Testing it. A</font>

00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:37,407
<font color="#FFFF00">a little bit of that.</font>

146
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:45,407
<font color="#00FFFF">Good night, people.</font>

147
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:51,606
Still to

The islanders are waking up for
their first morning in the communal

151

188
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,406

189
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:27,406

Sherif's happy but there is bad news

195
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:54,926

skinny sandwich man wants to hear. A

00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:58,606
six foot two, 2 216 pound
professional boxer fancies your

<font color="#00FFFF">If she doesn't want to be with him</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">I need that time with her.</font>

200
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:18,607

person, which means one thing - he's

205
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:45,406
got no chance with Amber. <font color="#FFFF00">Your</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">glasses are cool. Suit your face. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I</font>

206
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:50,406

207
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:56,086
<font color="#00FFFF">You can? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. Do you think? </font><font color="#00FFFF">Really?</font>

208
00:17:56,087 --> 00:18:01,086
<font color="#00FFFF">I think I can pull off any sun</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">glances, I am not sure about you.</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you. Amber is fit, she's a</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">the other lads can crack on, get to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know her and then we will see what</font>

213
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:20,406
<font color="#FFFF00">happens. You don't know me from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam. You have to chat to everyone.</font>

214
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:23,406
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, you have got to do the same. </font><font color="#FFFF00">We</font>

about Callum, how about his ears?

225
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:16,406
No? I tried. Here is Anton digging
himself out of a hole with Amy. <font color="#FFFF00">I</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">Boom. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You need to get out of the sun</font>

boxing it is all about picking a
fight you can win. Just ask Anthony

279
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:27,406
<font color="#00FFFF">situation. We've got the deciding</font>

280
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,406

281
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:34,926
<font color="#00FFFF">someone's relationship. At least I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">won't be sleeping with Tommy tonight</font>

282
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:40,406
<font color="#00FFFF">though. </font>You never know, I might get
a look in after Tommy worked his way

283
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:43,407
around the girls. He is cracking on
to Amber now.

284
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:48,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you happy? </font><font color="#00FFFF">On who I am with??</font>

285
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:52,406

00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:59,406
<font color="#00FFFF">talk to him, that is all there.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">There's no other different side.</font>

287
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:02,606
<font color="#00FFFF">Whereas I have millions of different</font>

00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,446
<font color="#00FFFF">level and he is lower than me. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">glad now I know because I think you</font>

289
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:11,407
<font color="#FFFF00">are a nice girl, I really do. I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a lot of different sides to me. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am</font>

290
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:16,406
<font color="#00FFFF">a big diva you know. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You need</font>

291
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:21,407
<font color="#FFFF00">someone to put you in your place. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I</font>

292
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:28,926
<font color="#00FFFF">would probably kick off. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Amber seems</font>

293
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:35,086
<font color="#FFFF00">feisty, we all like a feisty girl. I</font>

294
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:39,406
<font color="#FFFF00">am looking forward to seeing how</font>

00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:44,406
<font color="#FFFF00">that unfolds. </font><font color="#00FFFF">How are you doing? </font><font color="#FFFF00">I'm</font>

296
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:49,406
<font color="#FFFF00">all right. Are you going to shake my</font>

297
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:55,406
<font color="#FFFF00">hand? That is better than what you</font>

298
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:59,406
<font color="#FFFF00">did. </font><font color="#00FFFF">These are tight on the old</font>

299
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:04,406
<font color="#00FFFF">gentleman area. I just sat down. How</font>

300
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:09,406
<font color="#00FFFF">are you feeling? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Fine, I feel better</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">today than I did yesterday. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Me</font>

301
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:14,406
<font color="#00FFFF">too. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Amy, you and Amy were having a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">little chat, you look like you get</font>

302
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:18,406
<font color="#FFFF00">on well. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am not going to lie, I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have a lot in common with her. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You</font>

303
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:21,406
<font color="#FFFF00">look like a good match.</font>

304
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:28,406
<font color="#00FFFF">She seems legit, but it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is the first day and I</font>

305
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:32,406
<font color="#00FFFF">want to get to know everyone. You</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">seem a nice person as well. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I'm</font>

306
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:37,406
<font color="#FFFF00">lush. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I love the confidence. </font>Coming

307
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:42,406
up: Pucker up, it's challenge time.

308
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,407
<font color="#FFFF00">The kiss was pretty erotic.</font>

309
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:59,246
From the moment he arrived,
Tommy's had his

310
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:04,406
eye on Lucie, but Joe's fine, he is
not about to have a tuna meltdown

311
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:09,086
about it. <font color="#FFFF00">If he wasn't here I would</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be like, yeah for him, because he's</font>

312
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:14,406
<font color="#FFFF00">like a boxer. He's quite nice. But I</font>

313
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:19,406
<font color="#FFFF00">have met you. </font><font color="#00FFFF">We'll see. I want to</font>

314
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:24,406
<font color="#00FFFF">gauge you and see what you are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feeling. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I am</font>

315
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:30,406
<font color="#FFFF00">literally chilled, I am enjoying</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this. </font><font color="#00FFFF">You make it all seem so easy.</font>

316
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:35,766
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel at east with you, I feel like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have known you for so long, I feel</font>

317
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:39,406
<font color="#FFFF00">well relaxed. I am not worried at</font>

318
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:44,406
<font color="#FFFF00">all. </font><font color="#00FFFF">We get on. </font><font color="#FFFF00">We do. As soon as we</font>

00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:48,406
<font color="#FFFF00">met each other, it wasn't awkward or</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anything. </font><font color="#00FFFF">No, I feel I can talk to</font>

320
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:52,446
<font color="#00FFFF">you about anything and everything. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like it. I haven't had that with</font>

321
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:58,406
<font color="#FFFF00">anyone for ages as well. You seem so</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">nice. I think if any other girls</font>

322
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:02,406
<font color="#FFFF00">came in I wouldn't be worried but I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">would be shocked if you were like,</font>

323
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:08,767
<font color="#FFFF00">see you later. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I wouldn't do that.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I don't know, until we see.</font>

324
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:15,407
<font color="#FFFF00">No, don't worry. There's not going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to be any girls a patch on you. </font><font color="#00FFFF">We</font>

325
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:20,606
<font color="#00FFFF">have just clicked. Everyone is so</font>

326
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:25,406
<font color="#00FFFF">nice, no-one would want to ruin it.</font>

327
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:32,406
<font color="#FFFF00">But it is all part of it. </font><font color="#11FF11">I am</font>
<font color="#11FF11">straight up. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Straight to the point.</font>

328
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:36,406
<font color="#11FF11">Nothing in here would stop me, I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">would go there tonight and say I</font>

329
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:42,406
<font color="#11FF11">would want to couple up with Lucie</font>
<font color="#11FF11">but I wouldn't she wouldn't be 100%.</font>

330
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:45,406
<font color="#11FF11">I wouldn't want that. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I will give</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you two alternatives. Who is the</font>

331
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:50,406
<font color="#FFFF00">person you spotted and you wanted to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get with, this is all about you, who</font>

332
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:56,406
<font color="#FFFF00">was it? </font><font color="#11FF11">Lucie. </font><font color="#FFFF00">So then, if you had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the doubt in your head then, if she</font>

333
00:27:56,407 --> 00:28:03,406
<font color="#FFFF00">really does like him, you go for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">longevity and go with Amber, get to</font>

334
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:07,406
<font color="#FFFF00">know her and then you and Amber</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">could be the next big thing. You</font>

335
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:10,926
<font color="#FFFF00">could be madly in love. You don't</font>

336
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:14,406
<font color="#FFFF00">know. </font><font color="#11FF11">What about you and Amy? </font><font color="#FFFF00">I</font>

337
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:18,406
<font color="#FFFF00">really like her. I get on with her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really well. She's sweet as</font>

338
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:24,606
<font color="#FFFF00">anything. </font><font color="#11FF11">Have you opened up to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">anyone else? </font><font color="#FFFF00">I actually haven't</font>

339
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:30,406
<font color="#FFFF00">properly. </font><font color="#11FF11">I think I will talk to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">other girls. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I need to. </font><font color="#11FF11">Amy is</font>

340
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:37,406
<font color="#11FF11">obviously number one but get to know</font>

341
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:43,406
<font color="#11FF11">them. </font><font color="#FFFF00">There's a was. Amber is a bit</font>

342
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:47,606
<font color="#FFFF00">of a different taste, she is a diva.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I wonder if I can tame her. It is a</font>

343
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:51,406
<font color="#FFFF00">challenge, I like challenges. How</font>

344
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:55,406
<font color="#FFFF00">would you feel if I coupled up with</font>

345
00:28:55,407 --> 00:29:01,406
<font color="#FFFF00">you? Because I have put two and two</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">together, I don't think you are the</font>

346
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,406
<font color="#FFFF00">happiest in your couple? </font><font color="#00FFFF">No, I'm not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">happy at all.</font>

347
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to get to know you more</font>

348
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:13,406
<font color="#FFFF00">than I do any other girls in here.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">But I heard that you like little</font>

349
00:29:13,407 --> 00:29:18,406
<font color="#00FFFF">Lucie. </font><font color="#FFFF00">She's attractive, yes, she</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is, but something about you.</font>

350
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:22,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Something about you. I will find out</font>

351
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:25,446
<font color="#FFFF00">what it is. </font>It's time for the first

352
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:31,406
big challenge of the year, that
challenge is finding out what the

353
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:35,406
hell is this game is. There is a
slide, I guess that looks like a

354
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:39,406
phone, it's called sliding into the
DMs and boys versus girls and the

355
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:43,406
boys are up first.

356
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,406
To start

357
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:50,926
they lube up, obviously.

358
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:55,406
Then slide down

359
00:29:55,407 --> 00:30:01,406
the phone, into some pink slide and
pick up a DM, in which is a fact

360
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:06,406
about one of the girls. <font color="#FFFF00">I have only</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">slept with one person. </font>The boy then

361
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:12,406
kisses the girl he thinks the fact
refers to. <font color="#FFFF00">What do we think boys?</font>

362
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,406
Or the girl he
fancies the most.

363
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:17,406
That is what I
would do. The team with the most

364
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:24,407
correct answers wins. <font color="#FFFF00">I think it's</font>

365
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:34,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Amber. Oh, Yewande!</font>

366
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:38,407
Joe is up next.

367
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:48,407
<font color="#FFFF00">I have slept with 11 people but can</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">only remember the names of nine.</font>

368
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:56,406
<font color="#00FFFF">That is awful, man! </font><font color="#FFFF00">Let's do this.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Who am I going to choose? Lucie, I</font>

369
00:30:56,407 --> 00:31:01,406
<font color="#FFFF00">think it's Lucie. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I think that's</font>

370
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:06,406
<font color="#00FFFF">quite rude actually. Me and Joe</font>

371
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,406
<font color="#00FFFF">should have waited for a really</font>

372
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:12,406
<font color="#00FFFF">nice date with our first kiss, but</font>

373
00:31:12,407 --> 00:31:15,406
<font color="#00FFFF">no, we obviously had to kiss each</font>

374
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:20,926
<font color="#00FFFF">other. </font><font color="#FFFF00">She's a good kisser. I fancy</font>

375
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:26,406
<font color="#FFFF00">the hell out of her. Amy! </font><font color="#00FFFF">I am quite</font>

376
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:32,406
<font color="#00FFFF">old, it is over a long time.</font>

377
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:37,406
Next on
the lube slide,

378
00:31:37,407 --> 00:31:40,406
it's Callum.

379
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:42,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I rate myself ten out of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">ten for looks,</font>

380
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:45,406
<font color="#FFFF00">body personality and chat.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think</font>

381
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:51,406
<font color="#FFFF00">it's Anna. Amber. </font><font color="#00FFFF">As Ru Paul says if</font>

382
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:58,406
<font color="#00FFFF">you can't love yourself how the hell</font>

383
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:01,246
<font color="#00FFFF">are you going to love somebody else!</font>

384
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:05,606
Michael is next. Remember, Mike,

385
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:11,406
look before you leap. <font color="#FFFF00">I once cheated</font>

386
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:17,407
<font color="#FFFF00">on a boyfriend whilst on a trip to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Australia. I think it's Lucie.</font>

387
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:30,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Lucie. </font>Now it's Sherif's turn. <font color="#FFFF00">I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">would love to sleep with a man in</font>

388
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:37,406
<font color="#FFFF00">uniform at their place of work.</font>

389
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:41,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it's Anna.</font>

390
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:45,446
<font color="#FFFF00">The kiss was pretty</font>

391
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:50,406
<font color="#FFFF00">erotic. She's a good</font>

392
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:55,406
<font color="#FFFF00">kisser. I can back myself as well.</font>

393
00:32:55,407 --> 00:33:00,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Lucie. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I quite like a marine and I</font>

394
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:07,406
<font color="#00FFFF">quite like a police officer. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Joe's a</font>

395
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:13,086
<font color="#FFFF00">sandwich boy! </font>Tommy is next.

396
00:33:13,087 --> 00:33:20,247
<font color="#FFFF00">I have seen over 100 different</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">musicals multiple times.</font>

397
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:28,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it's Amy. I</font>

398
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:34,406
<font color="#FFFF00">had a few of the cute kisses with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Amy. She is a really nice girl,</font>

399
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:39,926
<font color="#FFFF00">really, really nice girl. </font><font color="#00FFFF">That is</font>

400
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:43,606
<font color="#00FFFF">what I do in my spare time.</font>

401
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:47,406
<font color="#00FFFF">Hopefully I will get someone to go</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with me soon, boys.</font>

402
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:54,246
We have saved the last dance for
Curtis.

403
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:56,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I called out my</font>

404
00:33:56,407 --> 00:34:03,407
<font color="#FFFF00">ex-boyfriend's brother's name during</font>

405
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:11,406
<font color="#FFFF00">sex. I think it's Anna. I can be</font>

406
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:15,406
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit dopey sometimes and we were</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">talking about him. It was on my</font>

407
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:20,406
<font color="#FFFF00">mind. </font>Time for the girls to get wet

408
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:25,406
and wild. <font color="#FFFF00">I bout myself a Porsche</font>

409
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:30,086
<font color="#FFFF00">for my 21st birthday.</font>

410
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:34,246
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it's Anton.</font>

411
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:40,086
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought it would help pull</font>

412
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:46,406
<font color="#00FFFF">in women, but it is the opposite. It</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">never helped as you can see. </font>Amber

413
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:51,606
is next. <font color="#FFFF00">I have had more than one</font>

414
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:58,767
<font color="#FFFF00">threesome. We think it's Michael.</font>

415
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:07,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Why would I say no to that</font>

416
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:10,406
<font color="#FFFF00">situation. You would have to be</font>

417
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:14,767
<font color="#FFFF00">pretty stupid. </font>Now it's Anna's turn.

418
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:23,406
<font color="#FFFF00">My favourite film is The Note book.</font>

419
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:28,406
<font color="#FFFF00">We think Sherif. I would rather kiss</font>

420
00:35:28,407 --> 00:35:34,406
<font color="#FFFF00">him out of everyone and he is a good</font>

421
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:39,406
<font color="#FFFF00">kisser and has great lips. </font><font color="#00FFFF">Anna</font>

422
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:42,606
<font color="#00FFFF">definitely called me just because I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">feel she didn't want to kiss anyone</font>

423
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:49,406
<font color="#00FFFF">else. Either way I will take it.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Callum. </font><font color="#11FF11">It is a classic. A lot of</font>

424
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:52,406
<font color="#11FF11">people agree. </font>Amy is next

425
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:56,406
on the lube slide. <font color="#FFFF00">I was once</font>

426
00:35:56,407 --> 00:36:00,406
<font color="#FFFF00">interrupted having sex by my nan</font>

427
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:04,926
<font color="#FFFF00">offering me tea and biscuits, we</font>

428
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:09,246
<font color="#FFFF00">think it's Curtis. It was a good</font>

429
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:12,406
<font color="#FFFF00">cuss with Curtis, but now I want</font>

430
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:17,406
<font color="#FFFF00">another one that will be even</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">better.</font>

431
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:20,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I do really like him. Tommy!</font>

432
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:24,246
Now it's Lucie.

433
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:27,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I can rap all the</font>

434
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:33,086
<font color="#FFFF00">words to the song</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Duty by Biggie Small.</font>

435
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:36,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it's Joe. It didn't</font>

436
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:41,406
<font color="#FFFF00">really matter on the caption to be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">honest. I was going to kiss Joe any</font>

437
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:46,407
<font color="#FFFF00">way, that was that.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It is actually Joe!</font>

438
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:58,407
JOE RAPS

439
00:36:58,408 --> 00:37:02,406
Amber has got the green

440
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:08,406
light to go again. <font color="#FFFF00">My favourite sex</font>

441
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:15,407
<font color="#FFFF00">position is the eagle.</font>

442
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:25,407
<font color="#FFFF00">We think it's Curtis.</font>

443
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes!</font>

444
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:36,406
<font color="#00FFFF">The eagle is my</font>

445
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:39,406
<font color="#00FFFF">favourite romantic position we shall</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">say. I will leave you all to find</font>

446
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:46,406
<font color="#00FFFF">that out yourself because I am not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">telling you what it is. </font>Television

447
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:51,406
was the real winner in this game.
Coming up, it's decision time for

448
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:57,407
the new boys. <font color="#FFFF00">The girl I want to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couple up with is...</font>

449
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:10,406
With the islanders

450
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:14,406
back in the villa,

451
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:20,606
attention can turn to the next big
steal. <font color="#FFFF00">Obviously tonight is... </font><font color="#00FFFF">The</font>

452
00:38:20,607 --> 00:38:25,406
<font color="#00FFFF">big night. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Something is going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happen. I thought I best get to know</font>

453
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:29,766
<font color="#FFFF00">everybody. I feel like I am going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be stepping on people's toes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">But I</font>

454
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:36,406
<font color="#00FFFF">feel I have got the impression that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you are set on Amy. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I clicked with</font>

455
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:41,406
<font color="#FFFF00">her. I haven't talked to everyone. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">could talk to somebody and then, I</font>

456
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:45,606
<font color="#FFFF00">don't know, have something more with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that person. I hadn't spoken to</font>

457
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:48,406
<font color="#FFFF00">Yewande at all since being in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">villa, so I thought it would be</font>

458
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:54,406
<font color="#FFFF00">flies to get to know her. She is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">very attractive young lady. How are</font>

459
00:38:54,407 --> 00:39:01,406
<font color="#FFFF00">you and your couple? </font><font color="#00FFFF">Obviously me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and Michael got together at the</font>

460
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:04,406
<font color="#00FFFF">start and I think yesterday we were</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">having a chat and he said we will</font>

461
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:08,406
<font color="#00FFFF">see how it goes. I don't think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there's anything there. Do you know</font>

462
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:12,406
<font color="#00FFFF">what I mean. Out of all the lads</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">here Curtis would be the one that I</font>

463
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:16,446
<font color="#00FFFF">would be most attracted to. What do</font>

464
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:20,406
<font color="#00FFFF">you do for fun? </font><font color="#FFFF00">Not a lot really. I</font>

465
00:39:20,407 --> 00:39:24,766
<font color="#FFFF00">sound like a miserable person. It's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not I don't have fun, I love all my</font>

466
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:28,086
<font color="#FFFF00">work and everything, but that is my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fun.</font>

467
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:32,406
<font color="#FFFF00">That is why I am very lucky.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You have nice eyes.</font>

468
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:37,926
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you, yours are horrible!</font>

469
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:43,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm joking. You have very nice</font>

470
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:49,406
<font color="#FFFF00">eyes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I do kind of fancy him and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stuff, but it's just really hard and</font>

471
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:55,406
<font color="#00FFFF">awkward because I do want to say to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">him but Amy is really keen on him. I</font>

472
00:39:55,407 --> 00:40:01,926
<font color="#00FFFF">just don't know what to do. </font>Tommy's
behaviour is starting to grate on

473
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:06,247
Joe. He put no mayo on the sandwich.
<font color="#FFFF00">How do you think tonight is going to</font>

474
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:11,086
<font color="#FFFF00">go down? </font><font color="#00FFFF">I can't really tell. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I am</font>

475
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:15,246
<font color="#FFFF00">taking everything as it comes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I</font>

476
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,406
<font color="#00FFFF">like Lucie, I think she is a nice</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">girl. But at the same time I don't</font>

477
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:21,406
<font color="#00FFFF">want to fuck things up with her and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Joe because they seem really good</font>

478
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:28,406
<font color="#00FFFF">together. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You have got to do what's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">right for you </font><font color="#00FFFF">I don't want to upset</font>

479
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:32,406
<font color="#00FFFF">someone. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You're going to upset</font>

480
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:36,766
<font color="#FFFF00">something. </font><font color="#00FFFF">It's easy. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I do not envy</font>

481
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:42,406
<font color="#FFFF00">you at all. </font>It is a tough one for

482
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:47,406
Tommy. Joe and Lucie are busy

483
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:53,407
snuggling under the bed together. <font color="#FFFF00">I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">think he's going to pick Amber.</font>

484
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:03,407
<font color="#00FFFF">Tommy can see we are</font>

485
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:14,406
<font color="#00FFFF">You are aren't you. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Yes. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I knew you</font>

486
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:17,926
<font color="#00FFFF">were way nicer, you would keep me</font>

487
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:21,926
<font color="#00FFFF">warm. He is a little bit worried</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about tonight. Tommy is a lovely guy</font>

488
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:26,406
<font color="#00FFFF">but I am getting on with Joe and I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">am really happy, so I just want it</font>

489
00:41:26,407 --> 00:41:31,406
<font color="#00FFFF">to stay like that.</font>

490
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:37,926
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a shit situation.</font>

491
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:44,406
<font color="#00FFFF">That's what we are here</font>

492
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:47,406
<font color="#00FFFF">for though.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">How do you think Joe is feeling?</font>

493
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:48,766
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he is a bit nervous.</font>

494
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:55,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I was reassuring him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">earlier saying it would be fine.</font>

495
00:41:55,407 --> 00:42:00,926
<font color="#00FFFF">It is what it is, I know</font>

496
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:04,406
<font color="#00FFFF">you like her.</font>

497
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:10,406
As darkness falls the

498
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:14,606
question is, how the hell do you fit
strip lights between those bits of

499
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:19,406
decking. And who are Tommy and
Curtis going to pick. <font color="#FFFF00">How are you</font>

500
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:25,406
<font color="#FFFF00">feeling about tonight, do you fancy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">rocking the boat? </font><font color="#00FFFF">I don't know. My</font>

501
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,406
<font color="#00FFFF">head has been going back and forth</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">all day. I didn't get no sleep last</font>

502
00:42:29,407 --> 00:42:35,246
<font color="#00FFFF">night. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You should go with whatever</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your heart feels like.</font>

503
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:36,406
<font color="#00FFFF">As it stands</font>

504
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:42,446
<font color="#00FFFF">right now, it's 50-50. I am being</font>

505
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:49,406
<font color="#00FFFF">honest with you, I don't know. </font><font color="#11FF11">I</font>

506
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:56,406
<font color="#11FF11">don't know what I am going to do. I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">may have been swayed. It is such an</font>

507
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:01,406
<font color="#11FF11">awkward place. Bloody hell. </font><font color="#00FFFF">It would</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be great if he recoupled with me</font>

508
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:07,766
<font color="#00FFFF">because he's the only guy I have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">connected with. </font><font color="#FFFF00">It is easy, I don't</font>

509
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:12,406
<font color="#FFFF00">feel like I have to force anything,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am hoping he picks me. But he was</font>

510
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:18,246
<font color="#FFFF00">talking to Yewande again, so I don't</font>

511
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:23,406
<font color="#FFFF00">know. </font><font color="#11FF11">Curtis, it was the first time</font>

512
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:25,406
<font color="#11FF11">when I laughed and meant</font>

513
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:31,406
<font color="#11FF11">it. I was really happy. </font><font color="#FFFF00">I am getting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit stressed because I feel like</font>

514
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:35,406
<font color="#FFFF00">everyone is being like, you need to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feel like this, I would be happy if</font>

515
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:41,406
<font color="#FFFF00">he picked me, because it means I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not coupled up with Callum. I would</font>

516
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:48,406
<font color="#FFFF00">like Tommy to pick me, the mood is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">super tense. You could cut the</font>

517
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:51,766
<font color="#FFFF00">tension with a knife. </font><font color="#00FFFF">I would be</font>

518
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:55,406
<font color="#00FFFF">gutted to lose you. I want him to</font>

519
00:43:55,407 --> 00:44:00,406
<font color="#00FFFF">pick me. It's awkward. We get on so</font>

520
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:05,406
<font color="#00FFFF">well. I would want to be with you</font>

521
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:10,246
<font color="#00FFFF">throughout the process. There is a</font>

522
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:14,406
<font color="#00FFFF">pride element. I have more to lose</font>

523
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:19,447
<font color="#00FFFF">than anybody else, because we really</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like each other. To have that pulled</font>

524
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:26,406
<font color="#00FFFF">so early from me, it would hurt a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">lot.</font>

525
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:29,406
<font color="#FFFF00">It's crazy man. </font><font color="#11FF11">Are you</font>

526
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:34,406
<font color="#11FF11">nervous? </font><font color="#FFFF00">I've got a few butterflies.</font>

527
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:39,406
<font color="#11FF11">Me and Tommy have a decision to make</font>

528
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:42,926
<font color="#11FF11">and we are unfortunately going to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have to take</font>

529
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:46,406
<font color="#11FF11">two young ladies off two of the</font>

530
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:50,406
<font color="#11FF11">boys, it's going to happen. Yewande,</font>

531
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:53,606
<font color="#11FF11">she seems honest and legitimate,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that is what I want in a girl. </font><font color="#FFFF00">You</font>

532
00:44:53,607 --> 00:45:00,767
<font color="#FFFF00">have got to go with your gut. I have</font>

533
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:17,407
<font color="#FFFF00">no clue what to do.</font>

534
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:23,406
PHONE BLEEPS
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you hear that?</font>

535
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,406
<font color="#00FFFF">Curtis and Tommy,</font>

536
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:30,406
<font color="#00FFFF">the time has come for you to choose</font>

537
00:45:30,407 --> 00:45:37,406
<font color="#00FFFF">which girls you want to couple up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with. All-islanders must gather at</font>

538
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:42,246
<font color="#00FFFF">the firepit. Hashtag absolute steal,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">hashtag all's fair in love and </font>war.

539
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:49,407
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, shit. It's been a very hard</font>

540
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:56,406
<font color="#FFFF00">decision to make.</font>

541
00:45:56,407 --> 00:46:01,406
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, coming in</font>

542
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:04,406
<font color="#FFFF00">in the position I have come in as, I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">didn't want to step on any of your</font>

543
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:10,406
<font color="#FFFF00">lads toes and I have come in and I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">am going to have to end a</font>

544
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:14,406
<font color="#FFFF00">coupling with one of you. The reason</font>

545
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:18,406
<font color="#FFFF00">why I'm going to choose this young</font>

546
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:23,406
<font color="#FFFF00">lady is, she is funny, as soon as I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get to spend time with her I am</font>

547
00:46:23,407 --> 00:46:29,406
<font color="#FFFF00">laughing straightaway, she is good</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">looking, very intelligent. It's a</font>

548
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:36,447
<font color="#FFFF00">definite. So the girl I want to</font>

549
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:54,407
<font color="#FFFF00">couple up with is... Amy.</font>

550
00:47:02,407 --> 00:47:06,406
<font color="#00FFFF">So this</font>

551
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:12,246
<font color="#00FFFF">decision is far harder than I ever</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thought it would be. Coming in here</font>

552
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:16,406
<font color="#00FFFF">was a massive game, I didn't know</font>
