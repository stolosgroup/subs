00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:05,099
The photos link Ray
Fiske to Gregory Malina.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,280
Patty used it as leverage against Fiske.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,899
Do you regret what we did?

5
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:10,070
Because I do.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,200
I did everything you asked me to.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,700
You said I'd be taken care of.

8
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,200
Mr. Popler is leaking
information to Frobisher's camp.

9
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>Ellen, it's me.</i>

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,426
<i>Katie brought you a videotape
that Gregory Malina made.</i>

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,280
Do anything you have to do,
but get me that tape.

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,099
We went to Patty Hewes'apartment.

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,299
We didn't find the tape.

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,800
No matter what you think,

15
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,348
I didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

16
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:33,419
I know.

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,956
I've been accused of murder,
and you're going to exonerate me.

18
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,199
Then I'll give you the tape.

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,900
Ellen Parsons is out on bail.

20
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,950
You know where to find her.

about what happened in Florida.</i>

<i>I'm going to leave it
in our hiding place, okay?</i>

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,000
You go in,
you get the tape, and you get out.

29
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,245
- You ready?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:25,299
Give me your penlight.

31
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,037
- Where's yours?
- I'm not sure.

32
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,500
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.
I'll take a look.

33
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,316
David!

34
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:10,899
Bloody, half-naked,
wandering the streets at 7:00

35
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Just your type.

36
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,199
You get a name?

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,788
All we found on her was this.

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,500
"Hollis M. Nye, Attorney-at-Law."

39
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,430
You her lawyer?

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,900
No. A friend.

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
You have a current address?

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,515
Yes, certainly.

43
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,625
She...

44
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:32,064
she lives with her fiancי?

45
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:33,485
We have a problem.

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,400
The police just came to see me
about Ellen Parsons.

47
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,125
10 DAYS LATER

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,589
Your mom made these for us.

49
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm accused of murder,
and my mom bakes cookies.

50
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,700
Sounds about right.

51
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,600
Who attacked you?

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
I don't know.

53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
I never saw him before.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,073
Your mom said...

55
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:18,313
Patty Hewes posted the bail.

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,300
She knows I'm innocent.

57
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
She's representing me now.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,300
When is David's funeral?

59
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,000
I can't go.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why not?

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,794
Conditions of...

62
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,525
my bail. I...

63
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,400
I can't travel.

64
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:43,500
Patty can petition
the judge for an allowance.

65
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,360
I don't know if...

66
00:04:45,592 --> 00:04:47,971
David's family even
wants me to be there.

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
I am so sorry, El.

Finale

Capture : Swsub.com
Synchro : Gaillots

70
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:51,600
Could you help me?
I'm looking for Lot 77.

71
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,121
Yeah, you want to stay on the path,

72
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,130
then swing a right at the oak grove.

73
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,999
Thank you.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,834
You don't look like
you're from around here.

75
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
It's been 35 years.

76
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,950
Anything I can do?

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
I'll be up in a minute.

78
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,371
How does Ray Fiske's
suicide affect our case?

79
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,700
Judge Toomey granted the
opposition a one-month continuance,

80
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,999
which we expected
under the circumstances.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And Marshall Phillips has assumed
lead counsel for Mr. Frobisher.

82
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:14,522
He a good attorney?

83
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,670
He's one of the best.

84
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,100
Has there been another offer
since we turned down the 500 million?

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,799
No, not yet.

86
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,299
I want to reiterate
that none of what's happened

87
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,000
can detract from our case.

88
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,825
We know what Frobisher did,

89
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:28,889
and we're ready to prove it to a jury.

90
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Your office is finished.

91
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,771
I promise you, Patty,

92
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,900
the place is as good as new.

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Thank you, Pete.

94
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,194
DNA tests confirm that the blood of...

95
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,750
an unknown male
was found in my apartment

96
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
and on my client's clothing.

97
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,200
That corroborates her
story that she was attacked.

98
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,600
By who? There was no
body found in your apartment.

99
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,004
Our detectives did
a thorough forensic search,

100
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:31,299
they canvassed the building,
they talked to the neighbors.

101
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,799
The blood evidence...

102
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Is inconclusive at best.

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,811
No, Ms. Parsons still had the motive,
the opportunity,

104
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:40,929
and her fingerprints were
in the victim's blood

105
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,227
on the murder weapon.

106
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:43,600
She explained that.

107
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,200
Can you explain why
her apartment was ransacked?

108
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,063
A file cabinet broken
into with contents stolen?

109
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:50,584
I mean, not exactly

110
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:53,372
consistent with
a crime of passion, is it?

111
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,425
Look,

112
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,799
a young doctor was found
murdered on Riverside Drive...

113
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,300
And people are scared,

114
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,073
which is why you want this to go away
quickly. I mean, hell, if,

115
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,821
if I lived on the Upper West Side,
I wouldn't sleep tonight.

116
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,200
In fact, I might not want
to reelect my district attorney.

117
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,920
Ms. Hewes, Ellen Parsons worked for you.

118
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:14,302
I don't think you can
be objective

119
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,382
- about this.
- I'm not!

120
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,699
I'm not objective at all,

121
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,309
and I'm going to turn my passionate,

122
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,300
irrational anger against your office.

123
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,199
I am going to go on every talk show,

124
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,399
every media outlet I can find

125
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,999
to expose how you ignored key evidence

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,425
in your incompetent rush to accuse...

127
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,666
- Ms. Hewes...
- how, for political ends,

128
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,551
you destroyed the life
of an exceptional young woman,

129
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,800
while the real murderer
walks the streets.

130
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:47,399
This would be a lot more pleasant
if I were dealing with you, Hollis.

131
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,200
I tried to reason with my client,

132
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,600
but she insisted on Ms. Hewes
representing her.

133
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,950
What do you want?

134
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,700
The DA's agreed
to reopen the crime scene.

135
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:58,899
<i>OK</i>.

136
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,900
You still know where the tape is?

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Of course.

138
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,400
And it's safe?

139
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,300
It's safe.

140
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,709
Get the charges dropped, and it's yours.

141
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,200
Ellen pushed me aside.

142
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,600
Shit.

143
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,080
Who's representing her now?

144
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,300
Patty Hewes.

145
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:25,200
She got the DA to reopen
the murder investigation.

146
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,096
All right,
how would you like us to play it?

147
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,911
Has the videotape
been put into evidence?

148
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,900
I don't think so. No.

149
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,300
Then maybe Patty Hewes doesn't have it.

150
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,499
What are we doing,
playing guessing games?

151
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,499
There's a goddamn gun
out there pointed right at me,

152
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,161
and you don't know if it's loaded.

153
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:43,900
What about David Connor?

154
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,947
Do I have to worry about him?

155
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,100
No.

156
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,600
There's nothing that
could get back to you.

157
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:53,500
Good.

158
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,900
Christ, what a mess.

159
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,494
You're looking for anything incongruous,

160
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,351
anything that didn't
belong to you and your fiancי?

161
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,200
Anything that's not in the right place.

162
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Got to go.

163
00:11:58,054 --> 00:11:59,600
Take your time, Ms. Parsons.

164
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:21,500
Excuse me.

165
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:25,100
- Hey, Rick.
- How's it going?

166
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,200
- Hey, Rosie.
- How you doing, Rick?

167
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:30,399
This is Detective Rick Messer.
He asked if he could take a look around,

168
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,856
see if...

169
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,371
the scene fits the profile
of a case he's working downtown.

170
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Any luck?

171
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,700
No.

172
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm very sorry for your loss.

173
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,350
I hope they find the guy.

174
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,668
Can we have a moment, please?

175
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,700
Hi.

176
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,385
I'm... sorry, Patricia.

177
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm terribly sorry.

178
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:27,800
Mr. Frobisher?

179
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,900
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,400
What...? She turned
down $500 million, Larry.

181
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
What the hell's going on over there?

182
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:38,634
Does she have something?

183
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:40,500
I don't know.
She's not telling us anything.

184
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:42,300
Then what do I have you for?

185
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:45,189
Larry, you know,
you haven't given me anything in weeks.

186
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
What can I do?

187
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,700
All right, look.

188
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,776
Has she said anything

189
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:53,362
about a videotape?

190
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Think...

191
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,541
a videotape? A confession?

192
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
What? No.

193
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:00,599
I don't know nothing about that.

194
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,555
What tape? What are you talking about?

195
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,100
No... forget it.

196
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
I got to tell you, Mr. Frobisher,

197
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,999
ever since your deposition,

198
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,987
I don't think she's going
to settle for any amount.

199
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:12,163
God damn it!

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,700
You know something... I don't
pay you to think. Do I, Larry?

201
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,799
You haven't paid me for anything,
Mr. Frobisher...

202
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,714
I need facts. I need information,
that's all I want.

203
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:22,500
Mr. Frobisher, I know!

204
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,199
No, you actually don't know!

205
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,300
You don't know shit,
and you've done shit...

206
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,609
which is exactly what
you're going to get from me.

207
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,100
I ain't paying you a penny.

208
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,900
I don't need your money, you prick!

209
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,400
I have to admit,

210
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

211
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,000
Arthur, why hasn't
this case already settled?

212
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:52,700
What's this?

213
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:56,351
Ray with Gregory Malina.

214
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:01,478
Jesus.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
- Was Ray having a thing with this kid?
- I don't know.

216
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:06,916
Maybe.

217
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I mean, the kid's a hustler,
for Christ sake. He's a liar.

218
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,100
Ray brought him down to Florida
the same weekend I was there.

219
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,500
The kid took advantage of him.
He tried to extort money from him.

220
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:19,599
How?

221
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,299
He made up some bullshit videotape,

222
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,400
confessing crap that never happened.

223
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,700
What did happen in Florida, Arthur?

224
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:43,064
I stepped into that condo
and she was staring right at me.

225
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,200
That girl was high and out of her mind.

226
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,299
My assistant assured me,
she didn't see a thing.

227
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,400
- And you believed him?
- Hey, relax.

228
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:51,338
We'll take care of the girl.

229
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,624
You have my word on that.

230
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Now tell me.

231
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,300
It's not good.

232
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,700
This is the report we're going
to be filing next week.

233
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,999
The SEC has evidence that
the accounting fraud in your company

234
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,566
has been going on for years.

235
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,400
What kind of evidence?

236
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,400
You use shell corporations
to hide your debt.

237
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,518
You book potential earnings as current
earnings to artificially boost profits.

238
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,700
I can't even tell
what I'm looking at here.

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,700
I've known you 40 years.

240
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,100
Don't give me that shit, Arthur.

241
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,400
Arthur...

242
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,100
what happened in Florida?

243
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Nothing.

244
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:34,500
Absolutely nothing.

245
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,673
So this tape...

246
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:41,505
have you viewed it?

247
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:43,699
No.

248
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,500
- Did Ray?
- I don't know.

249
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,800
But...

250
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,700
Malina wrote him a letter
saying the tape was out there.

251
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,114
And you think Patty has it?

252
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,505
She might.

253
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Well...

254
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,286
there's a way to find out.

255
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
We file for summary judgment.

256
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,100
We get the judge
to rule on the case now.

257
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,000
It'll force Patty to show her hand.

258
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,380
But what if she does have the tape?

259
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,700
Well, then at least
we'll know where we stand.

260
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,700
But if she doesn't,

261
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,600
based on the evidence I've seen,

262
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm betting the judge
will dismiss the whole case.

263
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
Summary judgment.

264
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,600
Why wait for a trial when a judge
can decide the case now?

265
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,972
If I file today,

266
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,282
this all could be over by next month.

267
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
We're going to trial.

268
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I'll be in touch.

269
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,800
Turn this over to a judge?
What is he, crazy?

270
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
He's desperate.

271
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,700
He needs to know if we have the tape.

272
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,100
So Phillips is forcing your hand?

273
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,532
I need the tape, Ellen.

274
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If the judge rules against us,
we lose the case.

275
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,800
That would be unfortunate.

276
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm doing everything
I can to exonerate you.

277
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:16,167
I had the crime scene reopened...

278
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,451
There was nothing there.

279
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,300
I've hired my own investigators.

280
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm puttI'g as much
pressure on the DA as I can.

281
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I don't think so.

282
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,100
He's a DA.

283
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,500
DAs want to be reelected.

284
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
Yes, they do.

285
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,300
So cut a deal with him.

286
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,700
Give him what he wants.

287
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:47,821
Right over there,

288
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,830
it's going to be the R&D building.

289
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,480
You know what that is?

290
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:52,399
Yeah.

291
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,399
- It's research and development.
- There you go.

292
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
That's the brain center of any company.

293
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,800
Hub of creation, that's where...

294
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,100
that's where dreams
are forged into reality.

295
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
Are we losing the house, Dad?

296
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,300
Holly said she and Bethie
are moving out to Aspen.

297
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,596
Well,

298
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:11,800
whatever happens, you're going
to be living with your mom in San Diego.

299
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,200
Well, why can't I stay here with you?

300
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,500
I've got a lot on my plate right now.

301
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:20,300
So what, I just have to pick
up and just move across the country?

302
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,380
Hey, you know something?

303
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
You need to grow up.

304
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:25,999
I'm dealing with some...
Hey, listen to me.

305
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm dealing with some major shit here.

306
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
I'm a guy who always lands on his feet.

307
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,100
But right now,
I need to focus on making things right.

308
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,945
You understand that?

309
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,300
No... Yeah. Whatever.

310
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,800
Come here. Come here, come here.

311
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,600
I did something stupid, Owen.

312
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,159
I made a...

313
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,100
big mistake. I'm going to be paying
for the rest of my life.

314
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,300
What mistake?

315
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,200
I trusted too many people.

316
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:11,892
All right.

317
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,956
What's it going to take?

318
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,500
What's what going to take?

319
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:18,678
For you to drop

320
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,699
these preposterous
charges against Ellen Parsons.

321
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,090
You didn't find any new evidence.

322
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,700
Let's cut the bullshit
and talk business.

323
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,700
You're a free woman.

324
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,100
You struck a deal?

325
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,000
The DA dropped the charges.

326
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
The investigation's been reopened.

327
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,687
They'll be a press
conference later today.

328
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,200
You can go to David's funeral now.

329
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Thank you.

330
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,200
You're welcome.

331
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,500
Now where's the tape?

332
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,319
I don't have it.

333
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,800
You told me you did.

334
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:33,400
I told you it was safe.

335
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,622
- You got five minutes.
- Thank you.

336
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Good evening.

337
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:13,887
Got have a few minutes?

338
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
<i>In 2002...</i>

339
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
<i>I met Ray Fiske.</i>

340
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,700
<i>I didn't know this at the time,
but he was Arthur Frobisher's lawyer.</i>

341
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,300
<i>Shortly after, Mr. Fiske sent me down
to Florida to help set up a meeting.</i>

342
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,800
<i>I didn't know what
this meeting was about,</i>

343
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,006
<i>but I know that Arthur Frobisher</i>

344
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:36,599
<i>was in contact</i>

345
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,300
<i>with a member of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</i>

346
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,699
<i>The name of that member is...</i>

347
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,900
George Moore...

348
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
tipped you off.

349
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,800
That's going to get you quite
a few years in the federal penitentiary.

350
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,400
Tell me what you want.

351
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,600
Well, we have a couple of options.

352
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,300
What are they?

353
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,199
If I turn this over to the U.S.
attorney's office,

354
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,500
you either plead guilty

355
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,800
or you fight it in court.

356
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,500
Either way, you lose years of your life,

357
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,299
and I'm still waiting in the wings

358
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,600
to bleed you dry in a civil trial.

359
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,100
And the other option?

360
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,000
We settle.

361
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,100
At my price.

362
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,500
The videotape?

363
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,300
It goes away forever.

364
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,000
You'll sign a nondisclosure agreement?

365
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,400
All the evidence I have against
you will never come to light.

366
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,300
So think about it.

367
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,616
But not for too long.

368
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,400
If I don't hear from you
by the end of the day tomorrow,

369
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,899
I'm going to treat some friends
of mine at the Justice Department

370
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:12,700
to dinner and a movie.

371
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:19,672
Boy, you really enjoy this, don't you?

372
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
It's my job.

373
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:27,800
Why do you hate me so much?

374
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,634
Someone was attacked in our home.
You haven't said a word about it.

375
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,550
I didn't get attacked.

376
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
Ellen saw you, Michael.

377
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:54,799
You said you were going
to Henry's house for the weekend.

378
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
I did.

379
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:57,780
Then what were you doing here?

380
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,100
I left my laptop, so
I came back to pick it up.

381
00:26:00,404 --> 00:26:02,200
Why, am I a suspect?

382
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,000
No.

383
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,900
Then why are you interrogating me?

384
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:09,200
We'd just like to know
why you feel the need to lie.

385
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:12,200
Maybe it just runs in the family.

386
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,600
I've gone over all of
it with your money managers.

387
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,815
Now, remember,

388
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:23,986
this is just a theoretical dismantling
of your asset structure.

389
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,366
What did they come up with?

390
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,800
You'd have to give
up 93% of your net worth.

391
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,136
They'd start with your
bonds preferred stock,

392
00:26:33,137 --> 00:26:34,900
and then move on to real estate.

393
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,700
- The houses?
- Yes, all the houses.

394
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,600
Fine.

395
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,700
Liquidate all of it.

396
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,400
Foreign holdings, domestic holdings.

397
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,499
I don't really care about anything else,

398
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,000
but I need to know that I can
keep the new land that I'm developing.

399
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,999
Arthur, you don't have to do this.
We could still win.

400
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,188
Can I keep the goddamn land, Marshall?

401
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Yes.

402
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:04,800
Promise me that.

403
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,800
We would find a way
for you to keep your land.

404
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:11,369
All right.

405
00:27:13,582 --> 00:27:14,700
Pay her.

406
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:17,200
This is ludicrous.

407
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,299
Let's just cool down
and think this through.

408
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,400
I have thought it through,
Marshall, and it's my call.

409
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:23,700
Pay her.

410
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
What about our motion
for summary judgment?

411
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:29,400
A settlement like you're talking about,
we have nothing to lose.

412
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,300
I have everything to lose, Marshall.

413
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,200
That number is astronomical.

414
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,200
Even if we lose at trial, you may never
have to pay a figure so high.

415
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,800
I'll give a jury a dozen reasons
to award your employees less than that.

416
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Marshall...

417
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,400
I will build all this back up again,
believe me.

418
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,800
But right now, I'm done with this.

419
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,900
I need to move on.

420
00:27:57,813 --> 00:28:00,299
Miss Hewes,
Marshall Phillips is here to see you.

421
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,200
Thank you, Betty. Send him in.

422
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:06,800
Marshall.

423
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,500
This is a surprise.

424
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,300
Oh, I doubt that.

425
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Please.

426
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,800
Can you believe it's almost fall?

427
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,100
What sign are you?

428
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,300
We're dropping our motion
for summary judgment.

429
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,381
My client...

430
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:27,951
has instructed me to extend to you...

431
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:29,700
this settlement offer.

432
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,300
There's a condition.

433
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,200
He wants a nondisclosure agreement.

434
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
All evidence sealed.

435
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:38,700
Nothing comes out.

436
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
Whatever you've got is buried.

437
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,300
Otherwise, the offer evaporates.

438
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Understood.

439
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,000
Tell him we accept.

440
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,099
You knew my father, didn't you?

441
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,200
I never liked him.

442
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,900
Oh, he never liked you.

443
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:17,900
He always thought your cases
had a stink to them.

444
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Good to see you, Marshall.

445
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,182
Together,
we hit a few bumps along the way,

446
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,700
but in the end

447
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,516
you believed in me

448
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:34,416
and in our justice system.

449
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,100
Your trust won this case.

450
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
<i>Here we go.</i>

451
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
<i>There we are.</i>

452
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,150
<i>We're billing you for this by the way.</i>

453
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
<i>Congratulations.</i>

454
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:03,000
<i>There's a psychiatrist there.</i>

455
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,888
- Why'd you come in this room?
- Larry?

456
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,517
- Do you have a moment?
- "The light was on."

457
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:19,100
Don't sit, Larry. This won't take long.

458
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
What's going on?

459
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,700
We know you were leaking
information to Frobisher.

460
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,400
We want you to disclaim
your interest in the settlement,

461
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:35,900
voluntarily.

462
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,900
And cut myself out of two billion?

463
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,600
You gotta be kidding me.

464
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,894
If you don't remove yourself, we'll turn
you over to the U.S. attorney's office.

465
00:30:47,904 --> 00:30:49,100
It's your choice.

466
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,500
But I made amends.

467
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:59,500
They've made their decision, Larry.

468
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Hey, I'm 70 years old.

469
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,400
I lost everything.

470
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:09,300
The man came to me.
What was I supposed to do, huh?

471
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,400
What am I gonna do now?!

472
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
Before you go?

473
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,800
- If you'll excuse me?
- Sure.

474
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:36,100
Your first victory as an attorney.

475
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,200
Have you given any thought
to what you're going to do next?

476
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
I don't much care at the moment.

477
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,800
Your office is still empty.

478
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm sure someone will
make good use of it.

479
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,600
The job is yours, Ellen.

480
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,200
Anytime you're ready.

481
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
Thanks for the drink.

482
00:32:15,707 --> 00:32:16,800
Ellen.

483
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,375
Mr. Nye.

484
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Get in the car.

485
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,400
They know what you did, Ellen.

486
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Who are you?

487
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,700
I'm Agent Harrison. This
is Agent Werner. We're with the FBI.

488
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,253
Miss Parsons,

489
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:49,262
the night of Ray Fiske's suicide,

490
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:51,400
you were seen leaving
Hewes & Associates.

491
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
I worked there.

492
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,700
You were fired at the time.

493
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,900
What is this about?

494
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,400
It's about Patricia Hewes.

495
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,800
And the Frobisher case?

496
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,800
No, we were investigating Ms. Hewes
long before the Frobisher case.

497
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,499
Arthur Frobisher had my fiancי killed,

498
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,319
and you're investigating Patty Hewes?

499
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,396
I tried to warn you, Ellen.??????

500
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:22,990
Not to take the job.

501
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,200
You talk to us,

502
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,700
maybe we overlook what
you were doing there that night.

503
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,011
This is your leverage?

504
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:34,328
You're gonna have to do
better than that, this...

505
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,800
picture means nothing.

506
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,690
You don't want us pursuing it.

507
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,800
Go ahead.

508
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,000
Thanks for the chat.

509
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,500
<i>We commend our brother, David Connor,</i>

510
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,700
<i>unto you, Lord,</i>

511
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,200
<i>now that he has passed from this life.</i>

512
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
<i>May he live on in Your presence.</i>

513
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon him.

514
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,000
May he rest in peace.

515
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,499
May his soul,
and the souls of the faithful departed,

516
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,200
through the mercy of God,
rest in peace. Amen.

517
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,800
<i>Amen.</i>

518
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
I'm trying to forgive you.

519
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,600
You don't have to.

520
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
It's my fault.

521
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,400
No.

522
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:34,900
This whole thing started
because I took Frobisher's money.

523
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
The last time...

524
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,800
the last time I saw David...

525
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,000
we had a fight.

526
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,000
And he was right.

527
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,300
He was right about everything.

528
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,992
Thank you for...

529
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,960
thank you for letting me come today.

530
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:07,600
David would have wanted you here.

531
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,505
I know you're not
the enemy in all of this.

532
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,100
Thank you.

533
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,278
Call me when you get back to New York.

534
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,850
Okay, let me know.

535
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
We're square.

536
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,000
Indeed, we are.

537
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,200
You didn't get this from me.

538
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
You sound like my college girlfriend.

539
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,600
Sit on it till the next election.

540
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,200
When it comes out,
there'll be a lot more lawsuits.

541
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,300
Shareholders are going to go
after the rest of Frobisher's fortune.

542
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,400
And you can send him to jail.

543
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,900
Hey!

544
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:19,133
Now we're even.

545
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:27,900
Oh, God.

546
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,900
I've been in touch with
the DA's office every day.

547
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,411
And what have they found?

548
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,200
Well, they've turned the
crime scene inside out, but...

549
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,400
even if they find
the guys who did this...

550
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,400
They'll never trace
them back to Frobisher?

551
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
I'm sorry.

552
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,000
So, Patty tells me that
you're not coming back to work.

553
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,900
So you're in the loop again.

554
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:19,665
Now that you're partner, you must have
got a nice chunk of change

555
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,813
from that settlement.

556
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
So...

557
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:29,800
what did, what did you and Patty do

558
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,100
to win this thing?

559
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:35,800
Enjoy your money, Tom.

560
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,792
There's a lot of great
charities out there.

561
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,300
Hey, can I ask you something?

562
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,500
Sure.

563
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,100
When Patty went away,
did she ever tell you where she went?

564
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,300
No.

565
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,300
Told me she was visiting family.

566
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,007
2 WEEKS EARLIER

567
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,400
You, uh, had a little girl.

568
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,600
She died before delivery.

569
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,200
May I ask...

570
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:50,000
is there a name you'd
like on the certificate?

571
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:41,474
You wanted to speak with me?

572
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,147
The other night at my apartment...

573
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,000
you asked me

574
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,500
if I regret what we did.

575
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,300
I want you to know...

576
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,000
that I do.

577
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:15,900
I deeply regret it.

578
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,200
Why are you telling me this now?

579
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,000
Because you're right.

580
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,600
I've lied.

581
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,300
I hired you to get to Katie.

582
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,406
I've...

583
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:35,550
manipulated you.

584
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,200
I am ashamed of what I did.

585
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,200
I hope you can forgive me.

586
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,200
Someday.

587
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,800
I have...

588
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,700
a lot of flaws.

589
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,389
Come back, Ellen.

590
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,000
Give me a second chance.

591
00:43:28,463 --> 00:43:31,100
I was thinking of
going away for a while.

592
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,300
Without David, I...

593
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:41,800
I don't have a reason to be anywhere.

594
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,100
I understand.

595
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,300
I don't believe in the law anymore.

596
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,600
But I believe in justice.

597
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,400
So I'll come work for you again.

598
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:06,700
On one condition.

599
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,400
What's that?

600
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,300
Let me use the firm's resources to prove
that Frobisher had David killed.

601
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
It's a deal.

602
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,500
Ellen?

603
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Thank you.

604
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
You're welcome.

605
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,700
Thanks for the chat.

606
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,442
What are you looking at her for?

607
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,198
Fraud, conspiracy,
obstruction of justice.

608
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,999
Now, Mr. Nye tells us you
might have reasons of your own

609
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
for wanting to take down Ms. Hewes.

610
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:23,300
Yes.

611
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,743
I do.

612
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,500
Do you regret what we did?

613
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:35,200
Because I do.

614
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,100
You do?

615
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,100
While I'm gone,
you're welcome to stay here.

616
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,400
It's done.

617
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,700
She tried to kill me.

618
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,850
How do you know that?

619
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,900
Because I know Patty.

620
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,100
See you on Monday.

621
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:06,500
You want me to go
back and work for her?

622
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,602
Ms. Parsons, =

623
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:10,297
you'll be working for us.

624
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,700
See you Monday.

625
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:48,528
