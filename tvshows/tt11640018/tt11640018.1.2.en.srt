down there.

Is the tail number 9300NN?

- How the hell could
he have known that?

13
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,336
- I don't know.
But we need to look into him.

wearing
her ring around her neck?

How is that possible?

that emerged from the sinkhole
this morning.

127

- Yes. The only thing we know
about them

128
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:38,022
is that they're clearly
not from modern day.

129
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,198
But to me, the question isn't
what they are.

130
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,897
The question is,
where did they come from?

131
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,508
You know, sometimes here
at the La Brea Tar Pits...

Somehow your mom and Josh

138

to do that?

141
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,799
You don't even know
where they are.

142
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:19,716
- That professor said
those birds came from the past.

143
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,892
So what if your mom and Josh
somehow ended up

144
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:25,505
in the same place
that they came from?

146

I'm--I'm not even sure
I believe it myself.

147
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,903
But maybe we can prove it.

148
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:37,168
- How?
- I have an idea.

149
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,649

152

a look down there.

- I took the wrong backpack.

156

Oh, God,
the sutures, the antibiotics.

157
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,932
He's got everything.
Sam has everything.

158
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,717
- Look, we're gonna find Sam.

159
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,370
And we're gonna find these meds
for your boy.

160
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,982
We're not gonna let
either of them die, okay?

161
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,071
- Okay.
- Let's go.

162
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:14,815
.

163
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,560
- We're on the brink of the
most important discovery

164
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,258
in human history.
We have a responsibility

165
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,303
to investigate
what's beyond that light.

166
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,523
- We're all on the same page,
Dr. Nathan.

167
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,439
But we can't authorize
an exploratory mission,

168
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:33,660
not until we know for certain
where that light leads.

169
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:36,663
- I understand. And I'm working
on that as we speak.

170
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,839
- Well, when you have
something concrete,

171
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,581
you let us know.

172
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,669
- I will.

173
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,560
- There he is.

174
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,737
- Dr. Shen,
do you have a minute?

175
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,565
- Sorry, who are you?

176
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,871
- Someone you want to talk to.

177
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,916
About those birds
that flew out of the sinkhole.

178
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,352
- This isn't a good time.

179
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:17,051
- On the news, you asked
where those birds came from.

180
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,575
I think I may know.

181
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,882
- So you think these birds
are from the past

182
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,535
and that
your family is there too.

183
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,711
- Look, we know how
it sounds, okay,

184
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,277
but we could really
use your help.

185
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:27,627
- I'm sorry.

186
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,106
I'm a man of science,
not science fiction.

187
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,978
- What if we could prove it?

188
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,589
This is my wife's ring.
I dug it up last night.

189
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,245
All I'm asking you to do
is carbon date it.

190
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:38,333
- I really do need
to get going.

191
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,640
- You have a family, Dr. Shen?

192
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,599
- Two daughters.

193
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,776
- Wouldn't you do anything
to save them?

194
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,389
- Of course.
- That's all I'm trying to do.

195
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:58,919
- And if you're wrong...
- You've wasted a couple hours.

196
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:04,315
But if I'm right, you'll have
made a hell of a discovery.

197
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:09,277
- All right.
Give me the afternoon.

198
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,730
- You, my friend, are in luck.

199
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,950
I snagged you
a bottle of water.

200
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,520
- Hey, hey.
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

201
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,349
- Maybe our parents
are stuck in traffic.

202
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:39,786
- Are you seriously
making jokes?

203
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,178
- You should check out
my TikTok when we get home.

204
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:43,485
I'm very funny.

205
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:46,270
- Hey, hey.
Hey, just stop talking, okay?

206
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,969
Save your energy.

207
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:51,580
- Sam!
- Sam!

208
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,191
We've been looking for hours;
where could he be?

209
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:57,804
- Sam!

210
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:04,201
- You're exhausted.
Here, come on. Take a minute.

211
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:07,291
- Yeah.
- Come on.

212
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,641
- Thanks.

213
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:14,995
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- You don't need any?

214
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:17,127
- Mm-mm.

215
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,694
- So what, you're Superwoman?

216
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,001
- No, I wake up at 5:00 a.m.
every day and run 10 miles.

217
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:22,567
You build a stamina.

218
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:27,442
- 10 miles, wow.
What are you running from?

219
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:31,228
- Didn't realize we were
in session.

220
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:33,056
Come on. Let's keep looking.

221
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,884
- Yeah.
- Come on.

222
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,594
- Hey, hey, excuse me.
Do you have any cell reception?

223
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,118
- Mm-mm. No.
- No?

224
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,467
Of course not.
Why would you?

225
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,600
You fell in a massive hole.
That's just great.

226
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,472
No reason to have
a panic attack at all.

227
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:00,997
- Hey, you all right?
- Not really.

228
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,825
I'm trying to answer
the million dollar question

229
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,696
of where we are.

230
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,568
I thought if maybe
someone had a signal,

231
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,657
we could possibly
call for help,

232
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,443
try to figure out a way home.
But obviously, that's hopeless.

233
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,010
- I thought you said
you had theories on that.

234
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,533
- I did.

235
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,057
I thought maybe that I ate
some really strong edibles

236
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,581
and I'm about to wake up in bed
like Neo in "The Matrix."

237
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,148
Oh, man.
We're totally screwed--

238
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:24,934
- Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.
We're gonna be fine, buddy.

239
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,675
- Thanks.

240
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:30,592
I just can't believe this is
all really happening, you know?

241
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:34,291
- Neither can I.
You from Australia?

242
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,554
- Yeah. What gave that away?

243
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:38,687
- Guess you picked a bad time
to visit LA.

244
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,995
- Oh, no. I'm not visiting.
I live there.

245
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,866
I heard that you're a cop.

246
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,042
What, are you like LAPD
or something?

247
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,262
- No, I'm from Louisiana.

248
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:52,483
- So what were you doing
in LA.?

249
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,311
- I had my reasons.

250

Feeling any better?

251
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,448
- A bit.

252
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:01,884
Wait. Where are you going?

253
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,930
- Well, to charge my phone
in one of these cars.

254
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,888
Like you said, it could
help us get out of here.

255

- Good luck. I don't think
any of these cars even work.

00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,197
- You don't have to do this.
- I know. But I am.

318
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,635
- Come on.

319
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:57,005
- Hey. This is gonna
sound a little awkward.

320
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:00,095
But I'm just gonna say it.
I need a bathroom buddy.

321
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,662
- Seriously?
- Doesn't have to be weird.

322
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:02,967
You don't have to watch me.

323
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,100
I just don't want to
go into the woods alone.

324
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,058
- You have a shovel.
You'll be fine.

325
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,060
- Yeah, that's not
for protection.

326
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:10,540
- I just threw up
in my mouth.

327
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,498
- Okay, I could die out there.

328
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,890
- Which sucks.

329
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:14,936
- When those wolves
attacked us, I froze.

330
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:19,419
I freaked out. But you didn't.
You saved yourself.

331
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:22,248
Look, I need you in case
something happens out there.

332
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,206
- Dude, I can't.
I have to look after Josh.

333
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,210
- Hello.

334
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,691
Sorry to interrupt,
but can I borrow your shovel?

335
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:34,825
- Uh...
- My father.

336
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,523
I have to find him.
He needs a proper burial.

337
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,394
It's what God commands.

338
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,794
- Uh, yeah. Here you go.

339
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,578
Oh, wait.
So most wolves,

340
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,538
they don't take their prey
back to their den to eat.

341
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:52,800
They eat right away.

342
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:53,975
- Scott.
- What, that's actually true.

343
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,890
- How do you know that?

344
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,197
- I'm getting my master's
in anthropology.

345
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,373
I do a lot of research
at the Tar Pits Museum.

346
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,767
Or at least I did before
I fell into a massive sinkhole.

347
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:04,899
- Well, then you could
help me look.

348
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:06,466
- Oh, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

349
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,164
- My father did everything
for me. He died protecting me.

350
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,341
I can't just leave him
out there to rot, please.

351
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:16,215
- Well, I guess maybe
I could probably help you.

352
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:20,741
- Thank you.
Um, just give me a minute.

353
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:26,486
- Well, now you have
your bathroom buddy.

354
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,846
- Does this look like
a wolf print?

355
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,587
- Uh, could be.

356
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,329
- But you're not certain.

357
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:44,808
- Not entirely.

358
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:48,856
- But if it is, it could mean
we're in the right area.

359
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:51,946
- Or not at all.

360
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,948
- Maybe we should
just keep looking.

361
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:58,387
- That seems wise.
- Hey, listen,

362
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,259
I don't want to pretend to know
what you're going through.

But whenever I'm stressed,
which is, like, all the time,

- It's a vape.

You know, marijuana?
It's medicinal.

367
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:14,098
- Drugs are a sin.
- Well, I don't believe in God.

368
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,970
So guess that works
fine for me.

- There's a connection there.
I can feel it.

455
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,438
He saw the drone, Adam.
He saw the tail numbers.

456
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,528
Whatever is beyond that light,
somehow he can see it.

- Sophia, are you listening
to yourself?

458

- If he can help us prove
what's down there,

459
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:20,274
he could be the key to getting
this mission off the ground.

460

466
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:52,132

- What's going on?

467
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:55,309

in the woods.

468
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,702
- She's okay? She was safe?

469

I'm not upset.

629
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:47,857
We don't usually watch videos
in our house.

630
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:50,164
Come on, sweetie. Let's leave
these nice people alone.

631
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,774
Thanks again.

632
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,871
Lilly, did that man
Tony ask you any questions?

633
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:09,923
Did he ask questions
about you, Lilly?

634
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:12,795
Look at me when I speak to you.

635
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,101
You know we can't
trust these people.

636
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:18,279
We don't know them.
They won't understand us.

637
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,629
- I know.

638
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:26,940
You're right.
I didn't tell them anything.

639
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:35,253
- It's okay.
Sweetie, I'm not mad.

640
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:38,865
We'll just forget this
ever happened, okay?

641
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,970
- Dude, I've been
looking everywhere for you.

642
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,798
We need to talk.
- What, Scott?

643
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,234
- I think I know
exactly where we are.

644
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,454
- And how could you
possibly know that?

645
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:05,021
- Because of the camels.

646
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:07,154
- The camels?
- Yeah, like, eight of them.

647
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:09,504
They were about to walk
into a pit of tar

648
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:11,332
until I saved them.

649
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,899
- Okay.

650
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:16,250
- Those were the Tar Pits,
like the ones in LA.

651
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,472
- Wait, you think
we're in Los Angeles?

652
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,169
- Yes.
- Are you high?

653
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,736
- Yeah,
but that's not relevant.

654
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,694
Look, I remember those camels.

655
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,392
Their bones were excavated
last year.

656
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:28,741
It was, like, a huge find.

657
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:31,134
And there were eight of them.
Just like now.

658
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,484
- I thought you just said
you saved them.

659
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,355
- I did. I mean, I don't know.
Maybe I changed

660
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,096
the course of history.
Look, that's not the point.

661
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,273
Scientists from the Tar Pits
carbon-dated those bones.

662
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,102
They were from around
the year 10,000 B.C.

663
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:45,888
So if I'm right, that would
mean that we're in LA.

664
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,673
And it's sometime
during the last Ice Age.

665
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,023
Isn't that insane?

666
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:52,242
- I can't deal with this
right now. I have to go.

667
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:55,028
- Riley.

668
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:56,508
- I'm gonna go find them.
- Well, hold on.

669
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,074
Let me go with you.
- You've done more than enough.

670
00:38:58,118 --> 00:38:59,641
- I'm not gonna let you
do this alone.

671
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:00,686
Let me look for somebody to--

672
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,383
- Riley!
- Dad.

673
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,646
- Riley!

674
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,390
- Dad.

675
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:12,393
- Easy, easy, easy.

676
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,874
Hey, kiddo.

677
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,616
- How you doing, Sam?
- I'm fine.

678
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,664
Just a little banged up.
What about Josh?

679
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,926
- I gave him the meds.

680
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,493
But Riley was with him
the whole time.

681
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:28,583
- I'm just glad you're back.
- Lucas here was a godsend.

682
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:29,932
We ran into him in the woods.

683
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,804
- Oh, right place, right time.

684
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,414
- What were you doing
out there?

685
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:37,157
- I fell in that hole, ended up
about a mile from here.

686
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,506
- We have to lie you down.
- Yeah.

687
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,334
Let's get him in the bus.
- I got this. Thank you.

688
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,683
- Come on.

689
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,090
- I've been looking for you.

690
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:58,787
- What the hell
are you doing here?

691
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:00,223
- Fell through the sinkhole
just like you.

692
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:02,138
- No, you're supposed
to be in Baton Rouge.

693
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:05,446
- I got a tip you were in LA
about to make a deal.

694
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,534
I came to stop you.

695
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:07,883
- Oh, so you're following me?

696
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:09,798
- I'm not gonna let you
throw your life away.

697
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,452
- You're not a part
of my life anymore.

698
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:14,412
You don't get a say in it.

699
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:18,677
Stay away from me.

700
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:25,118
- Is that the guy
you were trying to find?

701
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,163
- Yep.

702
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,600
- Who is he?

703
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,820
- He's my son.

704
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,702
- I'm gonna see if I can
find you some more water.

705
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,011
- Hey. Thank you. Both of you.

706
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:54,190
- What else can I do?
What do you need?

707
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:56,584
- I just need to relax.
That's all.

708
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,194
- Mom.

709
00:40:58,238 --> 00:41:00,545
- Josh.

710
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:03,504
Josh. Hey, sweetheart.

711
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,550
How you doing?

712
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:08,553
- A little better.

713
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:12,513
- You still have a temperature,
so you should rest, all right?

714
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:15,516
- I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

715
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,213
- I know.

716
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:27,267
I love you so much.

717
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,355
- I love you too.

718
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,885
- What do you think?

719
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,278
- Looks like you've been busy.

720
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:40,367
- It's a Striker prototype
designed specifically

721
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,761
to fly down
into one of these sinkholes.

722
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:44,893
- I've never seen
anything like it.

723
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:47,417
- We've been developing it
for years.

724
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,028
We've been trying to get
the go ahead to launch

725
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,683
a rescue mission,
but we couldn't.

726
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,032
Until now.

727
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:55,774
- What changed?

728
00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:57,906
- You.

729
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,560
Now that we know
where it leads,

730
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:03,782
now that we know people are
alive, everything's different.

731
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:09,744
We're going down there,
and you're gonna help us do it.
