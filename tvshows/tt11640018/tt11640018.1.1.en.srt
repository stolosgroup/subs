- What are they saying?
- Same thing.

170
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,004
Fell into the sinkhole,
got scattered, like, randomly.

171
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:22,963
Followed that smoke
to get here, but that's it.

172
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,879
- Same thing for me.

173
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,141
I'm going to take
a stab in the dark here

174
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:28,839
and say you don't know
anything, do you?

175
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:34,105
- What's wrong with that guy?

176
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:38,283
Maybe he knows something.

177
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,720
- Hey, you okay?

178
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,376
Do you know where we are?

179
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,987
- Do I know?

180
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,815
- Hey.

181
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,686
Kid's high as a kite.

182
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,863
- Oh, you are incredibly
perceptive.

183
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,604
And yes, as a matter of fact,
I do have some theories.

184
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,084
- Excuse me.

185
00:12:57,128 --> 00:13:00,392
Sorry, have you
seen any glasses?

186
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:02,263
- I lost mine.
I can't see anything.

187
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:04,222
- No, sorry, man.

188
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:06,833
- That does not
bode well for him.

189
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:09,488
- It's okay, sweetheart.
We will find them, okay?

190
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,011
- This is my nightmare.

191
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,405
- Well, what's going on here?

192
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:16,016
Look at all these sad faces.

193
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,278
Come on, cheer up, folks.

194
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:18,932
We're still breathing,
aren't we?

195
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:21,326
We'll figure this out,
all right?

196
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:25,460
- Would you please shut up?

197
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,549
- Sorry.

198
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:31,858
Did you--did you all
fall through that light

199
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,468
at the bottom of the hole?

200
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:38,082
- Uh, yep.

201
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:41,868
- That's the same light,
isn't it?

202
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:43,609
That's what brought us here?

203
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:44,871
- Yeah, I think so.

204
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:47,221
- So are we alive?

205
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:54,533
- Sure feels that way to me.

206
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,014
- People, we need to focus.

207
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,145
It's gonna be dark
before we know it.

208
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,233
And right now,
we need more water,

209
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:01,366
we need shelter,
and we need food,

210
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,541
all in that order.

211
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,891
I say we gather supplies,
see what's here.

212
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,414
- He's right.
We should spread word

213
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,243
throughout the clearing
and get everyone to help.

214
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:10,897
- And share everything we find.

215
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,681
- 100%.

216
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:13,944
Why don't we each
take a section

217
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,033
and stay in groups
just to be safe.

218
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:19,210
Come on, let's go.

219
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,255
- Close to me at all times.

220
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,479
- Check that car.

221
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:34,921
- Josh, what are you doing?

222
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,401
- I'm listening.

223
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:38,925
It's just quiet.

224
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,275
There's nothing here.
How is that possible?

225
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,107
Oh, no.
- What is it?

226
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:48,369
- My wedding ring, it's gone.

227
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:51,024
It must've fallen off
in the woods.

228
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:52,765
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

229
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,115
- Bathroom.
- Stay alert.

230
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,335
Watch your surroundings, okay?
- I got it.

231
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,947
- I know this sounds crazy.

232
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,514
But what if we're in
a national park?

233
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:04,037
- We fell into a sinkhole
and you think

234
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:05,865
we're in a national park?

235
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:08,259
How high are you?
- No more than usual.

236
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:10,435
Hey, I'm Scott, by the way.

237
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,263
- You know, those things
kill your brain cells, right?

238
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:13,742
- Yeah, and my doctor says

239
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:15,701
it'll help with my anxiety
so it's a trade-off.

240
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:17,137
- Mm-hmm.
- Look, the point is,

241
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,617
if we're looking at
this logically,

242
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,401
we should be inside the Earth.

243
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:22,360
But clearly something else
is going on.

244
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:23,752
- Clearly.

245
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:24,971
- I mean, come on,
none of this makes any sense.

246
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:26,146
Like why are
all of these cars destroyed

247
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,408
but we're all fine?

248
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,801
- You think I know
the answer to that?

249
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,150
- I don't know.

250
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:31,978
Maybe we're just in
an episode of "Lost."

251
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,330
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

252
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:38,854
Dad was a SEAL
before he was a surgeon.

253
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,682
He can do everything.

254
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:42,946
- Really makes you question
your life choices.

255
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,080
- Hey! Hey!

256
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:48,952
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,825
- Josh?

258
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,957
- I saw you, lady.

259
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,871
- You don't know what you saw.

260
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:57,177
- Josh?
- I saw her, Mom.

261
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:58,831
She had this big box
of protein bars.

262
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,006
She tried to hide them
over there.

263
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,530
- I didn't steal anything.

264
00:16:02,574 --> 00:16:04,663
I don't appreciate
being called a liar either.

265
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:06,186
I look like a criminal?

266
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,058
I'm a cop.
- Is there a difference?

267
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,234
- Okay, so you do
want me to beat your ass.

268
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:13,411
- Hey, step away from him
right now, you got it?

269
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,979
- Got a firecracker
there, Josh.

270
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,939
- Where are they?

271
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:23,073
Here?
- Yeah.

272
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:30,732
- What are you doing?

273
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,082
There's a lot of people
who could use this food.

274
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,084
- Save the judgment, all right?

275
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,999
Just trying to survive here
like everyone else.

276
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,044
- Well, everyone else
isn't stealing.

277
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:40,307
- Give it a minute.

278
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,009
- Here you go.
The rest is for the group.

279
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,536
- Take care of yourselves.

280
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,930
- At least there's
a bright side to all of this.

281
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,020
No more freaking Twitter.

282
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,152
Am I right or am I right?

283
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:00,588
- Is that heroin?

284
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:05,463
- That's unexpected.
- Oh, my God.

285
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:07,117
- Calm down, this is fine.
This is just a little--

286
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,553
- Heroin? Just a little heroin.

287
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,076
Is that what
you're trying to say?

288
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,209
Who do you think
this belongs to?

289
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,776
Do you want them
to know we found it?

290
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,735
- Maybe not.

291
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:20,130
- Hey, we never saw this, okay?

292
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,006
- Jesus.

293
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,617
- Josh, I'm sorry
you have to see this.

294
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,836
- I'm fine, Mom.

295
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,360
- Hey, hey, look at me.

296
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:38,017
You're allowed
to be scared, okay?

297
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,333
Don't move.

298
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,686
Come on. Go!

299
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,430
- Run! Run!

300
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:01,475
- Come on!
- Go, go, go, go.

301
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,348
- Get to the car!

302
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:06,741
- Jesus.

303
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,835
- Open the door.

304
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:15,794
Open the door!

305
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,022
- Hey, over here!

306
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,031
Come on, in the car. Let's go!

307
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,555
- Get in. Go!

308
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,210
Come on, go!
- Dad!

309
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,133
- No!

310
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,067
- No, no, no, no, no!

311
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,721
No! No, no, no, no.

312
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,116
- Somebody help me!

313
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:19,727
.

314
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,643
- Don't touch it,
don't touch it, don't touch it.

315
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,950
Let me see, let me see.

316
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,172
You're okay.
Help!

317
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:31,130
I need help!

318
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:33,176
- I'm a doctor.
Let me take a look.

319
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,918
- Riley, I need your help.

320
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:38,050
Let's move him into that bus

321
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,879
in case those wolves come back.

322
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:42,228
That's it, come on.

323
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,623
Over here.

324
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,277
Put him down right here.
Easy, easy.

325
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,888
♪

326
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,890
I need to bandage and gauze

327
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,761
to wrap that wound to get
the bleeding to stop.

328
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,067
- Maybe I can find
a first aid kit.

329
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,374
- And sutures and antibiotics
if you can.

330
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,592
Help her.
- Okay.

331
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:00,594
- Hey.

332
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:03,380
- I'll be right back, okay?

333
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,864
- Good morning.
My name is Dr. Sophia Nathan,

334
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,039
and I'm the chief scientist

335
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,259
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

336
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:15,696
What we know
is that today's tragedy

337
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,481
was a natural disaster.

338
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:20,788
The sinkhole at La Brea
is the largest of its kind.

339
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:23,095
And as of this moment,

340
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,792
we don't know how deep it goes.

341
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,968
- Dr. Nathan,
what about the victims?

342
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:29,362
Are there any numbers?
- No, not yet.

343
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:31,582
- Are there any plans
to send a rescue mission

344
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,148
to locate any survivors?

345
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,935
- Not at this time.

346
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:41,983
Unfortunately, no one
could have survived that fall.

347
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:44,203
But what I can tell you
is that we have

348
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:47,250
a long-range military-grade
drone en route,

349
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:49,687
and we hope
to have confirmation soon.

350
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,430
To all the families
affected by this tragedy,

351
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:57,782
please know that we're thinking
of each and every one of you.

352
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:03,440
- Iz.
- I need a minute.

353
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:04,745
- Izzy, come here.

354
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,704
Come here.
Hey, hey.

355
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,363
- I just can't believe
they're gone.

356
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,719
What is it?

357
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,329
- Nothing,
it's just a headache.

358
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,854
- Mom!
- Josh!

359
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:32,338
- It's not just a headache.

360
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:34,906
- No, it's not.

361
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,300
- It's okay, Dad.

362
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,171
What you're seeing,
it's not real.

363
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,391
- I know.

364
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,088
Only this time it's different.

365
00:21:43,131 --> 00:21:45,308
- What are you talking about?

366
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:48,789
- Usually,
what I see, it's fields,

367
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,488
trees, wilderness,
always the same place.

368
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:53,359
But now...

369
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,796
- What?

370
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,364
- It's your mom and Josh.

371
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:00,758
Look, I can't explain it,
but they're there

372
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,237
in the woods.

373
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,761
- Dad.
- Okay, believe me.

374
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:05,676
I know how it sounds,

375
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,418
but it's not just them.

376
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,725
Those--those birds,

377
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:14,685
I saw them in that place
this morning.

378
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:16,164
And then--

379
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,688
then they flew out
of the sinkhole.

380
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:18,906
- What are you saying?

381
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,386
- None of it makes sense
to me either,

382
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,563
but my gut is telling me
that something is going on.

383
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,739
I can't let it go.

384
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:28,829
I need to talk
to someone in charge.

385
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:30,222
- And tell them what?

386
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,398
- What if there are people
alive down there, Iz?

387
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,008
They can't give up.

388
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,708
- Adam, I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

389
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:39,797
- Got the first flight
out of D.C.

390
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,189
How's it going with the press?

391
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,713
- Telling them
what they need to hear.

392
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:44,236
But I hate lying
to the families.

393
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,586
- What are you supposed to say?

394
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,283
The truth?

395
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:54,899
- Everyone, this is
senior agent Adam Markman.

396
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:56,509
He worked the Mojave incident
with me.

397
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:59,382
We'll be running point together
moving forward.

398
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:00,992
- So where are we at?

399
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:02,297
- Bring up the live feed
of the drone.

400
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,082
- Right away.

401
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,654
- That's the same light
we saw in the Mojave.

402
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:12,264
We estimate
it's at 20,000 feet.

403
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,006
- We're approaching
that depth now.

404
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:16,834
- Send it through.

405
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,544
- Hey, wait. Hey, wait.
Can you get that feed back?

406
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,808
- I've lost the connection.

407
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:37,071
It's gone.

408
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,465
- Where the hell did it go?

409
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,859
- You okay?

410
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,774
- I've never shot
anything before.

411
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:45,558
- You saved that boy's life.

412
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,694
I'm gonna get a fire going
before it gets dark.

413
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:52,217
I could use a hand.

414
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,134
- I'm sorry.

415
00:23:56,177 --> 00:23:57,483
I can't.

416
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,446
- Where are you going?

417
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,972
- Hang in there, buddy.

418
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,628
- First aid kit.

419
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:12,890
Hey.

420
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:14,805
Hey, how you doing?

421
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,459
- I'm okay.

422
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,156
- Listen, do you remember
when you broke your arm

423
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,287
in the fifth grade?

424
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:20,854
Remember then it took you,
like,

425
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:22,377
four hours to see a doctor?

426
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,468
- This is worse.
- Yeah, I know.

427
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:28,949
I know, but you got
through it, right?

428
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:30,951
And do you remember
how I told you?

429
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:32,997
Do you remember
how I told you to do that?

430
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,434
You kept breathing

431
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:38,132
in and out.

432
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,745
- You didn't focus on the pain.
You just--

433
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:43,050
you just focused on breathing.

434
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:47,925
In...and out.

435
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:49,361
That, that's great.

436
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,450
That's great, just--
just keep doing that.

437
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,236
- Could I talk to you?

438
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,542
- Yeah.

439
00:24:56,586 --> 00:24:59,023
Be right back.
You're doing great.

440
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,811
- Okay, so the wound's wrapped

441
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:07,074
but he needs those antibiotics.

442
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:08,685
Bleeding won't stop
without sutures.

443
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,034
And the way he's losing blood,

444
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:12,166
I don't know
how long he has left.

445
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,778
Hey, put it down.
We share that.

446
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:17,563
Scott, watch that food.
No one steals anything, got it?

447
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:19,086
- I'm your man.

448
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,045
- There was an ambulance.

449
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,351
I saw it, I saw it.
It fell in the sinkhole

450
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:24,875
so it has to be
around here somewhere.

451
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:26,398
I'll just--I'll find it.
- It's gonna be dark real soon.

452
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,660
Everything that fell in
got scattered.

453
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:29,096
Where do you even look?
- I don't know.

454
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,620
I don't know.

455
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,839
- All right, you're gonna need
more eyes

456
00:25:32,883 --> 00:25:34,014
out there
so I'll go with you.

457
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:35,450
- No, you have to
stay here with Josh.

458
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:36,582
- There's nothing else
I could do for him,

459
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:37,670
not without those supplies.

460
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:38,802
- I'm not leaving him
here alone.

461
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:40,368
- Even if you could
find it yourself,

462
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:41,848
you wouldn't know
what to look for.

463
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:42,936
Do you know what
toothed forceps look like

464
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,024
or a needle driver?

465
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:45,417
I do.

466
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,506
Riley, she'll look
after Josh, right?

467
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,116
- Sure.

468
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:53,904
- Okay, give me a minute. Okay.
- Okay.

469
00:25:53,947 --> 00:25:57,211
Hey. Just keep him hydrated.

470
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,343
If he gets too hot,
you cool him down.

471
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,649
He gets too cold,
you warm him up.

472
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,041
You're pre-med.
It's nothing you can't handle.

473
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:02,608
- Actually, I'm not.

474
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:05,437
I-I dropped it.

475
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:09,920
- What? Since when?
- Since last semester.

476
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:11,095
- Why wouldn't you
tell me that?

477
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:13,053
- That's so not
the point right now.

478
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:14,577
What if he dies?
What am I supposed to do then?

479
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,926
- I'll be back
before that happens.

480
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:16,970
- You don't know that.

481
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:17,928
You don't know where we are

482
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:19,494
or who we're with.

483
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,496
These people
could be dangerous.

484
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,715
- Look at me.

485
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,760
I wouldn't leave you here
if I didn't think

486
00:26:23,803 --> 00:26:26,066
you could handle it.

487
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,591
They need my help.

488
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:31,202
- Okay, then do what
you're gonna do then.

489
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:33,204
- Sweetheart, listen to me.
Listen to me.

490
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:34,945
I have to go for
just a little while.

491
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:37,295
Josh, Josh, look at me.

492
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:40,951
I'm telling you I have to go.

493
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:42,430
- What? No.

494
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:43,736
- There's an ambulance
out there, honey.

495
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,130
I have to find supplies.
- Don't leave me here.

496
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:48,001
- I'll find it
as fast as I can, I promise.

497
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:50,090
- Okay, found a flashlight,
food, water.

498
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:52,310
This is for you.

499
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:57,620
Eve, we need to go.
- Okay.

500
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:03,582
- I love you.

501
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:08,282
.

502
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,129
- Wait!

503
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:30,348
Don't.

504
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,265
- Can you give me
the gun, please?

505
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:39,487
- Just go.

506
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:42,142
- You don't have to do this.

507
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:45,015
- All I feel is pain.

508
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:48,975
I just need it to end.
- It's okay.

509
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:50,673
Let me help you.

510
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:52,587
- Please, this isn't
your problem.

511
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,198
- Yes, it is.

512
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,895
It is my problem.

513
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:57,767
I'm supposed to be out there
looking for an ambulance

514
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,725
for supplies for my son,
but I'm not going to do that

515
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:01,596
because I can't leave you here.

516
00:28:07,037 --> 00:28:08,342
- Hold on.

517
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,996
- What is it?

518
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,608
- I saw the ambulance.

519
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,741
- You did? Where?

520
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:17,830
- It was when I first got here.

521
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:19,658
It was in the middle
of a field.

522
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:22,139
- Can you bring us there?

523
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:24,097
- Maybe, I don't know.

524
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:26,447
- My son is dying.

525
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:27,840
I don't know where to look.

526
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:30,538
Please, I need your help.

527
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:36,719
Thank you.
- I said maybe.

528
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,372
Don't thank me yet.

00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:48,600
- Like I said,
I can't help you.

532

- Kay, look, I have information
I think she needs to hear.

- Sir, I'm not gonna ask again.
Step away.

534
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:55,259
- I'm sorry.
Dad, can I talk to you?

535
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:56,913
- Yeah.
- Can we please just go home?

- Gavin, Izzy.

537

- Aunt Jessica.

- I'm sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

539

- It's okay.

540

- Have they said
anything official?

541
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:07,793
- No, they still haven't
found the bottom.

00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,365
- Gavin, are you all right?

543
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:19,892
Are you okay?

544
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:24,636
- Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

545

I'll be right back.

546
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,205
Excuse me, Dr. Nathan.
I know you're busy,

547
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:31,164
but my wife and son
fell into the sinkhole.

548
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:34,211
I realize how
this is gonna sound,

549
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:37,954
but I think people
might be alive down there.

550
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:39,912
- Sir, we all
want to believe that.

551
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,261
But it's not possible.

552
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:42,915
Excuse us,
we have to get going.

553
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,743
- You need to move on.

554
00:29:44,787 --> 00:29:46,266
- I think I saw
your drone down there.

555
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,790
- Sir.

556
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,361
- It's okay.
Give--give us a second.

557
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:56,668
- Look, I don't know
how to explain it,

558
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,758
but is the tail number 9300NN?

559
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,543
Okay, that drone,

560
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:04,937
it's in the same place
where everyone else is.

561
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,330
I know this is hard to believe.

562
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:07,853
I'm not sure I even
believe it myself,

563
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:10,943
but if there's even a chance
that people survived,

564
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:13,076
you need to send
a rescue mission.

565
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,121
- What's your name, sir?
- Gavin Harris.

566
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:17,732
- And how did you come
by this information?

567
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,779
- It doesn't matter. I'm just--

568
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:22,868
I'm just asking
that you don't give up.

569
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:24,652
- Like I said before,

570
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:26,829
no one could have
survived that fall.

571
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,831
I'm very sorry for your loss.

572
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:31,659
- How the hell could
he have known that?

573
00:30:31,703 --> 00:30:34,358
- I don't know,
but we need to look into him.

574
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,847
- Are these the boxes
Mom brought from home?

575
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,674
- Yeah, why?
What are you looking for?

576
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:49,416
- I need to prove to Dr. Nathan
that they're alive.

577
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,984
I think there might be
a way to do it.

578
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:53,812
- How?
- I saw Eve down there.

579
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:55,422
She was next to a boulder.

580
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:56,946
The boulder had
a handprint carved into it,

581
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,730
and I've seen
that boulder before.

582
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,558
We have a picture of it.

583
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:02,908
- Gavin, look at me.

584
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:05,171
These things you're seeing,
they're not real.

585
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:07,565
- Hey, Jess, I know that's
what we've always thought,

586
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:10,046
but how do you explain
why I'm seeing Eve and Josh?

587
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:13,614
- I--I can't,
but you have to stop this.

588
00:31:13,658 --> 00:31:15,181
- Aunt Jessica's right, Dad.

589
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,357
Do you have any idea
how many times Josh would say

590
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:19,316
we couldn't count on you,

591
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,840
but I always defended you

592
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:23,189
because I knew the only reason
that you drank

593
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:26,366
was because of how much pain
you were in.

594
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,891
I knew that when it counted,
you'd be there for us.

595
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:31,894
- I know this-this
seems crazy,

596
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:34,157
but I am trying to help.

597
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,289
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on.

598
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,901

599
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:43,470
- Iz.

600
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,778
Iz.
- Just let her go.

601
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:50,738
- Yeah.

602
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:53,393
Give me a minute, okay?

You've caught me at

You've got enough

I don't even know your name.

If you say so.

your fault?

631
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:15,519
- I think that I have let
my children down far too often.

That's what I think.

- Uh...

634
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:22,091
- Come on, you can tell me.

635
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:24,789
- You sound like a shrink.

636
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:27,487
- I am.
- Oh.

637
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:30,316

I'm always analyzing people.

638

It's not my most
endearing quality.

So tell me what happened.

640
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:37,715
- About a year and a half ago,
I was running late at work

641
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:42,328
and then I had a neighbor
pick up my daughter from school

642
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:44,504
and then there was
an accident and, uh,

643
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:46,724
Izzy, my daughter,

644
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:48,465
she lost her leg.

645
00:33:48,508 --> 00:33:50,467
- And you blame yourself.

646
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,122
I understand.

647
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,863
You can't control
everything, Eve.

648
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:57,909
It's just life.
