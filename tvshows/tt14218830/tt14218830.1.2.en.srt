1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:02,174
- Ten seconds!
- Ooh. Alright.

2
00:00:03,454 --> 00:00:04,860
Ooh.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,398
Ah.

4
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:07,742
Oh, we love "Action News".

5
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:09,335
We get in early just to watch it.

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,888
It just calms you down after
wanting to take a wrench

7
00:00:11,893 --> 00:00:13,950
to someone's side mirror in traffic.

8
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:16,779
But the Philadelphia
region continues to suffer

9
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,702
temperatures in the mid-90s

10
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:20,504
with the heat index approaching 100...

11
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:22,600
Now, I'm a proud,
married, Christian woman,

12
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,527
and I love my husband.

13
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:27,208
But there's something
about that Jim Gardner.

14
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,345
That non-regional diction.

15
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,897
We haven't seen anything like this...

16
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:33,893
It is so important
to support and acknowledge

17
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:36,530
local journalism, okay?
There's no agenda here.

18
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:39,419
This is... This is on the
ground, in the streets,

19
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,776
powerful stuff.

20
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,947
Wouldn't want to see
that dog in traffic.

21
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:45,113
Yes, Jim.

22
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,336
I like the news, because
that's when I can say

23
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:51,220
whatever I want and
nobody asks any questions.

24
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:55,265
Taking a personal day. Going
fishing with my friends.

25
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,555
Anyways, toilet paper's in the closet.

26
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:01,487
I saw Jim Gardner once, at the Chipotle.

27
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:04,573
Ooh, he ordered a bowl so handsomely.

28

- Tariq, oh, my God. That's...
- That's it. That's a little sample.

34
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,094
That is so good. And you
recorded that last night?

35
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,768
Yeah, yeah. Did it in like 15 minutes.

36
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,824
- It's nothing. Yeah. Super fast.
- Wow.

37
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,449
Tariq is my boyfriend of over 10 years,

38
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:37,182
and he's been a music artist
since we were in high school.

39
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,217
Clearly, he's very, very good.

40
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:41,132
Um, all of his TikToks go viral,

41
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:43,895
which nowadays, is the true
mark of a great musician.

42
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,866
I'll be home kinda late
tonight 'cause I got a show.

43
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,523
I sold out the King's Lounge.

44
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:49,675
- Stop.
- Yeah.

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,820
- Oh, my goodness!
- Yeah.

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,204
- I'm so proud of you!
- Thank you.

47
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:53,832
- Maybe I could come.
- Oh, no, no, no.

48
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:55,868
You can't come, 'cause they
got a strict capacity thing.

49
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:57,575
And it's 15 people.

50
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,354
So if you come, then it's 16,

51
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,173
and then it's a fire hazard,
and then they shut it down.

52
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:04,171
But look. You wanna do dinner tonight?

53
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:06,634
I'll be home around 10.
I'll bring you Bahama Breeze.

54
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,764
- That is my favorite.
- I know. I know.

55
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,136
- That's my favorite! Okay.
- I know. Yeah.

56
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,132
- Alright. Alright.
- Alright, baby.

57
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:13,817
Ooh, you got that seat far up!

58
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,811
- You know I'm short.
- Damn. Okay. Ahh.

59
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:17,134
Alright, baby, I gotta get goin'.

60
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,256
I'm hungry as hell, and
although it is that hunger

61
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,430
that keeps me going,
I gotta eat something.

62
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,429
Okay. Well, why don't you just
take my breakfast sandwich?

63
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:24,959
- Huh?
- Yeah. I'll get something at school.

64
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:26,545
- Are you sure, baby?
- Yeah. I'll get something in there.

65
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,462
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

66
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:29,869
I love you. I love you, too.

67
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:30,850
Yeah.

68
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:32,905
Um, look, we didn't get
to discuss this last night

69
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,641
because you were making the hits, but...

70
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:38,243
our rent is going up, so
we need to redo the budget.

71
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,493
- Mm-hmm.
- I left that, uh,

72
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:41,178
bill-organizer thing on the fridge.

73
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:43,636
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll get to it.
- Okay.

74
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,006
Yeah, but, no, I was just
thinking, like, you'd get to it

75
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,204
kind of soon because
my name's on the lease

76
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:49,240
and we were already late on rent once.

77
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,412
Oh, I got you, baby. Can we
talk about it later, though?

78
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,855
It's not even 8:00 in
the morning, and you know

79
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,976
I don't even wake up till, like,
noon o'clock in the morning.

80
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,237
Yeah. Could you just look
at it, though, you think?

81
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,723
I'll get to it. I promise, baby.

82
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:01,922
- Okay.
- Okay?

83
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,056
- Alright. I love you.
- Love you, too.

84
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,825
- Thanks for the sandwich.
- You're welcome.

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,738
Mmm.

86
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:17,936
Melina, what's wrong?

87
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,793
I don't want to walk down
the hallway, Ms. Janine.

88
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:22,536
It's scary.

89
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,773
I don't want to go to school.

90
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:26,459
What... Hey, Mr. Johnson.

91
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:28,520
These lights have been
going on and off for weeks.

92
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,031
Are you gonna do anything about them?

93
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:31,415
The kids don't even wanna walk in.

94
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:32,911
Above my pay grade, Janine.

95
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:34,421
I make most electrical things work

96
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:36,822
with a makeshift system
I've had since '92.

97
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,746
For this, we gotta
wait on an electrician.

98
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,504
- But...
- Goin' fishin'.

99
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:42,771
I'll get to it.

100
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,412
Don't worry, Melina.

101
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,331
I actually am going to get to it,

102
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:50,168
unlike janitors and boyfriends.

103
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:51,295
Huh?

104
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,851
Just... Come on.

105
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,942
Whose branzino is this?

106
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:57,579
That is a very powerfully smelling fish

107
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,945
- to put in a shared fridge.
- Don't touch it.

108
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,986
I'm making it tonight
at my cousin Annette's.

109
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,701
She thinks she's the
best cook in the family.

110
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:05,904
I'm gonna show her in
a nonthreatening way.

111
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,576
I'm-a look cuter than her, too.

112
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,697
Guys, the lights in the back
hallway have been out for weeks.

113
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:12,533
- Thank you for the update.
- What are you wearing?

114
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:15,407
And we need to do
something about it. Okay?

115
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,203
Uh, uh, Melina, from your class...

116
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,230
Yeah, she was afraid to
come to school this morning.

117
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:20,589
Said it looked like "The Shining,"

118
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,188
and I don't even get how
she knows that reference.

119
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:23,629
- She loves "The Shining."
- It's a classic movie.

120
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,166
This isn't okay, alright? And
I already talked to Mr. Johnson,

121
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,799
and he said there isn't
anything he can do.

122
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,294
What do you want us to do about it?

123
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,904
It can't be hard. It's just
screwing in a few new bulbs.

124
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:36,370
Janine, just worry about
what can be controlled.

125
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,981
Exactly. All we can do
on a hot day like this

126
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:40,492
is our own jobs, anyway.

127
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,573
I know that's right! Why is it February

128
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,567
and hotter than
the devil's booty-hole outside?

129
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:45,548
Climate change.

130
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,897
We are living in the middle
of its disastrous effects.

131
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:49,326
The permafrost in Russia...

132
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,959
Nerd.

133
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,949
Ava, can someone from the city

134
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,636
come and check on
the back-hallway lights?

135
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:58,246
Girl, no. Do I look
like the Kool-Aid Man?

136
00:04:58,251 --> 00:04:59,880
I don't have enough juice to manipulate

137
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:01,405
the inner workings of city hall.

138
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,598
They'll probably come in the summer.

139
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,404
- In the summer?
- Tough break.

140
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:08,219
Want some egg-white bites?

141
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,009
No. I don't have time to eat.

142
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,368
They're just egg-white
bites. You microwave them.

143
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:17,103
See, I just can't accept this.

144
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,558
You know, they didn't
see those kids' faces.

145
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,753
It was like they walked into
The Haunted Mansion at Disney,

146
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:25,119
which is a very scary ride, by the way.

147
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,752
I don't care what people say.

148
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:29,507
Okay, so, we went over
the days of the week. Now we...

149
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:30,828
Alright, baby, sit down.

150
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:33,624
Um... it's 9:00.

151
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:35,595
Word.

152
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:41,626
Uh, school starts earlier than... that.

153
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:43,312
Look, I know you're just a sub,

154
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:45,353
but these kids need to
be in their seats by 8:00.

155
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:47,063
- It's a school requirement.
- Understood.

156
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,890
Sixth time in two weeks
that kid's been late.

157
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:51,143
Seems like a drop in
a bucket, but then...

158
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:54,160
that bucket overflows and
everything gets sticky.

159
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,335
We don't want to get sticky, do we?

160
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,538
Y'all are getting this, right?!

161
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:14,619
Oh, um, hey, Mrs. Howard,
can I get some advice?

162
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,392
I was gonna ask Janine,
but she seems busy.

163
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:20,822
- Oh, sure. Come on in.
- Thanks.

164
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,154
- Okay.
- Have a seat.

165
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:26,640
Mm-hmm.

166
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:28,432
Y-Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:36,162
So, one of my students
has been coming in late...

168
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,487
9:00, to be exact...
For the last week or so.

169
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,039
Did you talk to the parent?

170
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:41,835
No. No. I'm a sub. I don't want to be

171
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,790
mixing it up with parents.
It's unnecessary.

172
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,509
Sweetheart, this isn't happy hour.

173
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:47,554
You are the child's teacher.

174
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,639
- Which child is it?
- Uh, Williams.

175
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,110
Um, Joel Williams.

176
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:53,185
Okay. I know that family.

177
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:56,352
Oh, listen, I've got to go
pick my kids up from the gym,

178
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:59,609
so why don't you meet
me during my free time,

179
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:02,336
which is my nail
appointment during lunch.

180
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,935
Um, I was gonna eat in my car.
I brought a sandwich from home.

181
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,749
Okay. Then bring your little
Nissan sandwich with you.

182
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,410
The more senior teachers
are just used to giving in,

183
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,634
but I, however, am young, sprightly,

184
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,526
and know where they keep the ladder.

185
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,224
Forgot I was afraid of ladders.

186
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:28,918
That was just my stomach.

187
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,573
Okay.

188
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,073
Oh. Oh, look at this.

189
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,784
It was just a loose wire.

190
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,403
Ooh!

191
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:47,343
Oh, God. Can someone
please help me down?

192
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:50,770
And why would we do that, since
you clearly caused this situation?

193
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:53,914
Okay. I didn't know doing this
would cause all the power to go out.

194
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,671
Well, the power is not all out.

195
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,899
It's on in some places
and off in others.

196
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:59,924
- It's off in my room.
- On in the gym.

197
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,518
Yeah, it's off in my room.

198
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:04,203
Thank God we got the A/C, or
we'd all be meltin' already.

199
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,669
Okay, best thing to do in these
situations is just stay calm and...

200
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:09,281
Okay! This is it, y'all! The end times!

201
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,849
It's three months early,
but it's happening!

202
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,560
Aah! Don't shake the ladder!

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,422
Gregory is the only person that can
stay in my bunker, so stop asking.

204
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,997
Hell yeah, I'm a doomsday prepper.

205
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,120
Why wouldn't I be?

206
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,873
I don't know why more people aren't.

207
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:23,399
Have you seen "Train to Busan"?
With the fast-ass zombies?

208
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:27,312
That day is coming.
That day soon come.

209
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,810
Ava, it is just a partial power outage.

210
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,322
Alright. Listen up, everybody...

211
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,115
- Listen to Barbara, y'all!
- Are you kidding me?

212
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,122
This is what we're gonna do...

213
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:37,207
Everybody without power,
please, head to the gym.

214
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,444
- Head.
- We will conduct classes there

215
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:41,124
until this is all fixed.

216
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:43,609
It is not ideal, but it will work.

217
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:44,921
You heard her. Let's go.

218
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:47,353
Guys... Guys, I-I just want
to say, I-I'm sorry, everybody.

219
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,273
I just thought if I could
get up here and get this done,

220
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:50,617
then we wouldn't have to wait and...

221
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,125
And look where it landed us, baby girl.

222
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,150
Yeah, how'd that work out for you?

223
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:55,217
Everybody, please, head to the gym.

224
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:57,300
We've got bigger fish to fry now.

225
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,889
Oh, Jesus! My branzino!

226
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,519
Everybody out of the way!
Out of the way!

227
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,986
If someone could please help me?

228
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:03,705
I feel like I'm one
wobble away from death.

229
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,056
A-Alright. Okay. I got you.

230
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,643
- Okay. Hi. Thank you.
- We good.

231
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:08,329
Give me your hand. Take your time.

232
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,759
- Okay.
- Whenever you're ready.

233
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:12,100
- Okay. Am I doing it?
- No.

234
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,609
- Let's go to a count of three.
- Okay.

235
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:15,610
One, two...

236
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:16,962
three.

237
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,438
One more time.

238
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,933
And it's pointing to the number...

239
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,440
- Right here. Thank you.
- Four!

240
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,143
This is all my fault.

241
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:27,266
Yeah, you probably shouldn't
have tried to do the job

242
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,341
of a newly graduated DeVry
student, but this is okay.

243
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,615
_

244
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,932
I made this mess, and
I need to fix this.

245
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,133
Okay, but fix this how?

246
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:45,819
It seems very outside of your skill set.

247
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,455
You should probably just wait
for somebody to get to it...

248
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,619
I don't want to wait
for someone to get to it.

249
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:52,612
You know, our children have
needs that deserve to be met.

250
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,132
And I'm going to fix this.

251
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,766
Nothing is going to get in my way.

252
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,822
What if you have to
climb another ladder?

253
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:00,783
Those seem very tricky for you.

254
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,099
No. Not today.

255
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:06,784
Aren't you going to lunch, Janine?

256
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,519
Uh, no. I'm gonna stay and help
the lunch ladies with lunch.

257
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:11,235
The lunch ladies don't like you.

258
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,021
She always coming in the kitchen
saying "hello" and whatnot.

259
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,982
It's unsanitary.

260
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,664
Is that what you're really doing?

261
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:21,888
Yes! And maybe trying to
get the lights back on.

262
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,759
Would you give that a rest?
What do you want?

263
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,190
To make the whole school blow up?

264
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,431
No. Plus, I can't.

265
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:30,039
Luckily, the school was built as
a bomb shelter in World War II,

266
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,217
so...

267
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,099
Let it go.

268
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:36,925
Okay. I will.

269
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,766
You're not gonna let it go, are you?

270
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,848
No, I'm not gonna let
it go, Jacob, okay?

271
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:47,438
I need to right my wrong.

272
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,130
Okay. Well, count me out.

273
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:51,244
I never counted you in.

274
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,512
Well, then count me in,

275
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,014
because I don't have any lunch plans.

276
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,497
Okay. Come on.

277
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:58,937
Okay.

278
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:01,653
Hi. Can I help you?

279
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,730
Oh, I'm just here to talk to her.

280
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:05,448
You need your nails done to sit.

281
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:06,859
What color are you doing?

282
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,187
Um... clear?

283
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:10,781
No loitering and no clear.

284
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,851
Okay. Blue. On one nail.

285
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,576
Thank you.

286
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:26,897
Can we talk now, please?

287
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,980
We could, but there
isn't much more to say

288
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:30,945
other than you need
to talk to the parent.

289
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,907
Look, I understand. There
just has to be another way

290
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,866
to do this other than
awkwardly talking to the parent

291
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,199
first thing in the morning.

292
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:39,466
Well, try it this way...

293
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,518
You could talk to your
student's parent right now.

294
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:44,886
Hold on. Now, did you call her?

295
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:46,471
I did not.

296
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:49,562
But when you said it was Joel,
I remembered that his mother

297
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,746
comes here every two
weeks to get her nails done

298
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:54,544
just like I do.

299
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:57,277
- Hey, Mrs. Howard.
- Hello, Amber.

300
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,286
Aren't you my son's teacher?

301
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:05,752
Yes.

302
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:07,586
Getting your nails done?

303
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,318
Word.

304
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,210
Well, you've seen all the properties.

305
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:17,075
Are you going to flip it or ship it?

306
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,484
This is just like the one in my
apartment. This is gonna be easy.

307
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,969
Me and Tariq have to go in that
thing like three times a month.

308
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:23,559
Maybe you should move.

309
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,025
Yeah.

310
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:27,701
Tariq says he is
"practicing" his credit score.

311
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:31,136
Apparently, 380 isn't a good...

312
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,966
Unh.

313
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:36,964
Oh, no. "Don't touch.
Not even a little bit."

314
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,531
Uh, okay. What's that say?

315
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:43,280
"End of the Road"? "It's
So Hard to Say Goodbye"?

316
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,134
What? "Motownphi..."

317
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,146
These are Boyz II Men songs. Why?

318
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:49,209
It's ironic, 'cause
I'm On Bended Knee.

319
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,667
Heh. Okay.

320
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,077
Oh, God. Why is that one hot?

321
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,115
Uh... Mm, try this one.

322
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,803
We're going to...

323
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:03,612
N-o-o-o-o!

324
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:13,636
Can you give me something bold?

325
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:17,174
Something that... starts a conversation.

326
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,471
So, Amber...

327
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,661
Nice to meet you.

328
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:28,264
Yeah, we met already,
but nice to meet you, too.

329
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,847
So, um, your son, Joel...

330
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,984
You've been, um, bringing
him to school at 9:00.

331
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,613
School starts at 8:00.

332
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,147
Is there a reason for this?

333
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:45,536
Well, nosy, I start
my shift at my job at 9:30,

334
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,433
so it's easy for me to
drop him off before that

335
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,893
and go straight to work instead
of going home or whatever.

336
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,925
Right, right.

337
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:58,620
Can I get some rhinestones that say,

338
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,309
"I'm not afraid of
awkward interactions"?

339
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,306
Literally or metaphorically?

340
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:06,240
'Cause I can do that design.
It'll just be $50 extra.

341
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,524
Fifty...

342
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,321
Well, I hear what
you're saying, um, Amber.

343
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:12,545
Y-Your son needs to
be at school at 8:00.

344
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,508
He's missing a lot of vital learning.

345
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:17,924
Word? I thought y'all just be
playing with blocks and stuff.

346
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,659
No. This isn't daycare.
By the time he comes in,

347
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:23,692
we're already working on
primary reading and math.

348
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,292
He's always struggling to keep up.

349
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,032
Oh.

350
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:29,303
I didn't know that.

351
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:30,927
Yeah, I would hate for him

352
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:32,718
to fall behind and have
to retake the grade.

353
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:36,191
I don't want that, but
that's as much up to you

354
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:37,352
as it is up to me.

355
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:38,649
I get you.

356
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:41,358
I don't want him to fall behind.

357
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,220
He's a smart kid.

358
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,610
Very.

359
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,122
Okay.

360
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:48,028
I'll bring him at 8:00 from now on.

361
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,177
It's kinda nice.

362
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,433
Word.

363
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,246
- Ooh.
- What in the... What's going on?

364
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:02,538
- What in the world?
- It's so hot! I'm gonna frizz!

365
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,485
Janine, what did you do?!

366
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,400
Lookin' like who shot John.

367
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,375
Barbara, look, I know you told
me to let it go, but I couldn't.

368
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,046
Jacob helped me open the breaker.

369
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,955
It was a chance to support
a strong Black woman.

370
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,848
The breaker?! Janine!
You can't do this stuff!

371
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:18,931
What had you come to work
today and lose your mind?

372
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:21,335
Look, I... I just have...

373
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:23,210
- Oh. Ooh. Okay.
- I feel lightheaded.

374
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,758
- Are you okay?
- Did you eat today?

375
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,551
Because I know you didn't have lunch.

376
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,442
And you didn't have any breakfast.

377
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:31,314
Okay. We're losing her. Do I
have your consent to slap you?

378
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:33,233
- Oh!
- There she goes. She's out.

379
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,741
- Um...
- Y'all feel this heat?

380
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,932
Oh, my God! She pale like a zombie!

381
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,408
You know, they eat
the hottest people first.

382
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:39,631
Let me back my tasty ass up.

383
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,471
Okay, I'm gonna get some
water out of the fridge.

384
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,928
Uh, hopefully it's still cold!

385
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:44,895
Oh, my God! My branzino!
Barb, excuse me!

386
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,940
I'll be back! She'll be okay!

387
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,984
Where's my class?
Is... Is everyone okay?

388
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,586
Obviously, everyone's not okay.

389
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,340
You're in the nurse's office.

390
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,696
But everybody else is fine.

391
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,738
They are so happy.

392
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:22,576
He's climbing again.

393
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:25,075
Oh, look who's back in
the land of the living.

394
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,964
Who opened the fire hydrant?

395
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:31,061
Well, as Melissa would
say, snitches get stitches.

396
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,375
That is correct, but
I am not talking to you

397
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,690
on account of you killing my branzino.

398
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,878
Ooh. What's going on here?

399
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,652
So that's it, huh?
I, uh, gave it my all,

400
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:51,629
passed out, and ruined the school day?

401
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:54,340
Oh, you tanked. You tanked, Janine.

402
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,108
You took the whole school down
with you. It was impressive.

403
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,967
Look. I know. I should've stopped.

404
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:01,034
I'm sorry. I just felt so bad

405
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,349
when I saw that look on
Melina's face this morning.

406
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:06,814
You don't think it kills us to
see those faces in the morning?

407
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,149
What, are we made of stone?

408
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:11,594
You're not the first person
to feel things, kid. We care.

409
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,629
How do you and Barbara stop
yourselves from caring too much,

410
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:17,946
if that's a thing?

411
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,167
Because it's the opposite.

412
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,495
We care so much, we refuse to burn out.

413
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:26,343
If we burn out, who's
here for these kids?

414
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,034
That's why you gotta
take care of yourself.

415
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,223
What is with you today, anyway?

416
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,551
You... You're normally bananas, but...

417
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:36,259
I don't know. Just some
stuff at home, I think.

418
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:37,854
Oh. Okay.

419
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,947
See, that's the other thing
me and Barbara learned.

420
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,738
All that at-home stuff... You gotta...

421
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:43,599
Leave it right at that door.

422
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,166
Otherwise, you open up a whole nother

423
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,512
Panera's box of problems.

424
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,581
I think you mean Pandora's box.

425
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,309
No, I'm pretty sure it's Panera's box.

426
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,538
Thank you for your help
earlier, Mrs. Howard.

427
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,210
I feel like a better communicator.

428
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:01,700
Mm.

429
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,121
Well, if you're gonna
keep doing this job,

430
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,270
awkward interactions come with it,

431
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:08,460
so you've got to learn
how to say what you need

432
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:10,279
to get what you want.

433
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:11,837
Mm-hmm.

434
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,089
Hey, Jaden, don't drink that.

435
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:26,109
- Mnh-mnh.
- Don't drink that. No.

Oh. No. The, um, lunch lady

but no can opener, so, no.

Alright, well, you wanna go

Oh.

448
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:03,790
I was gonna wait for my boyfriend

to finish his show to eat...

450

but... no.

451
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,651
I'm hungry now, so I
should eat now, right?

452
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:16,875
That's typically how hunger works, yeah.

453
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,537
Right! Normal people
eat at normal times.

454
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,857
Like... 4:00.

455
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:24,914
Yeah. All true.

Oh, my God. Please.

Here he is. Five minutes early.

475
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:16,355
Now I have to find something
to do before my shift starts.

476
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,323
Maybe I can get through half a movie.

477
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:21,062
Well, I'm happy he's here. Thank you.

478
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,010
Thank you, actually.

479
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,013
It's nice to know he
has a teacher who cares.

480
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:27,780
Just doing my job.

481
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,549
Well, you're doing it well.

482
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,825
Mm! You sure follow orders.

483
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:47,542
Just doing my job.

484
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,434
"Well, you doing it well."

485
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,719
Thank you.
