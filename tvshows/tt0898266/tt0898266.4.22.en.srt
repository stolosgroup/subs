1
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:07,260
I must say, Penny,
this is great fun.

2
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:08,795
Glad you're
enjoying yourself.

3
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,464
Until I met you and Bernadette,
my trips to the bathroom

4
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:14,267
had been entirely focused
on elimination.

5
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:17,704
Now they have a delightful
social aspect.

6
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:19,439
Amy, you must've been
in the bathroom

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,807
with other women before.

8
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:24,310
Of course I have.

9
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:26,496
But they were strangers
and seemed off-put

10
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:29,816
when I engaged in friendly
stall-to-stall chit-chat.

11
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:31,984
Some women don't
like to get chummy

12
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:34,120
when their panties are down.

13
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,257
You okay in there, bestie?

14
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:38,491
I'm fine...

15
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:40,026
The reason I ask is
that many people

16
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:41,561
experience bladder shyness;

17
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:43,329
the inability to pass uri...

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,498
Yeah, I said I'm fine.
Stop talking to me.

19
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:47,901
She always this crabby
when she urinates?

20
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,103
We're really not that close.

21
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:53,106
Screw it.
I'll go later.

22
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:55,541
And I'll be right
by your side.

23
00:00:57,895 --> 00:00:59,412
Did I tell you
Priya invited

24
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:01,581
me and Howard to have dinner
with her and Leonard?

25
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:03,182
Oh, that's nice.

26
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:05,051
No, it's not.

27
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:06,552
It's a strategic maneuver.

28
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:09,188
Leonard's new girlfriend is
testing Bernadette's loyalty

29
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,390
to you and the group.

30
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:12,358
That bitch is crafty.

31
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:17,029
- You think?
- Of course.

32
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,332
How does the cheetah attack
a herd of wildebeests?

33
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,501
By going after
its weakest member.

34
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:25,772
Well, what makes me
the weakest member?

35
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:29,976
Your trusting nature coupled
with your teeny-tiny body.

36
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:32,578
You wouldn't last a minute
on the Serengeti.

37
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,064
Okay, Amy,
you're being silly.

38
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:37,183
I'm not concerned about
who hangs out with who.

39
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,685
And I certainly
don't have a problem

40
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:41,187
with Leonard's new girlfriend
who wears way too much makeup.

41
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:45,024
Ooh, these are cute.

42
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:46,259
Of course if I buy them,

43
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,362
I'll have to rent
my womb out to a gay couple.

44
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,750
It doesn't matter. I'm going to
tell her we can't make it.

45
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,568
Oh, no. You <i>have</i> to go.

46
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:56,753
I don't understand.

47
00:01:56,754 --> 00:01:59,672
I thought I was
a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

48
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:03,142
You are-- with hair
that smells like strawberries.

49
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:05,178
And we're going to use that
to our advantage.

50
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:06,546
Wait. What are you
talking about?

51
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:08,931
By accepting the invitation,
Bernadette becomes

52
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:10,984
a double agent
inside the enemy camp.

53
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:12,802
She could ferret out
Priya's tactics,

54
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:14,053
identify her weaknesses

55
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:16,105
and feed her false
information, such as:

56
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:20,259
Leonard's no stranger
to back-alley cockfights.

57
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,261
I don't know.
I'm not a very good liar.

58
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:25,598
They kind of whup that
out of you in Catholic school.

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,617
Don't worry.
I'll teach you.

60
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:28,985
I did two years
of Cub Scouts

61
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:30,970
before they found
out I was a girl.

62
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,074
Okay, I don't
know you people.

63
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,642
I'm just an innocent
woman wondering

64
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:39,579
if this shoe store will
take my Texaco card.

65
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:43,533
How do you feel about
concealing a recording device

66
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:46,319
in the cleavage of
your ample bosom?

67
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,856
I don't want anything
in my ample bosom.

68
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:53,459
Come on, Strawberries.

79
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,694
- Okay, see you later.
- Good news.

80
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:28,014
I finally have a handle on my
idea for three-person chess.

81
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,201
That is good news. Bye.

82
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:33,369
Uh, do you know
how I solved

83
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,138
the balanced center
combat-area problem?

84
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,490
Five words:

85
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:41,744
transitional quadrilateral
to triangular tessellation.

86
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,880
That... that's brilliant.

87
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:46,916
It's what I do.

88
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,168
But wait, there's more.

89
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,121
I also invented
two new chess pieces.

90
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:55,324
The serpent...
and the old woman.

91
00:03:57,494 --> 00:03:59,929
Okay, now I have to ask.
What do they do?

92
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,965
When the serpent slithers
to an opposing player's piece,

93
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,034
that piece
is considered poisoned

94
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:08,304
and will die
after two more moves.

95
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,041
All right.

96
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,845
Unless... it gets to
the old woman in time,

97
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:18,514
in which case
she sucks out the poison,

98
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,784
turning her into
the Grand Empress:

99
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,388
a piece combining the power

100
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,025
of the knight, queen
and serpent.

101
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,427
Elegant.

102
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,996
That's because it's simple.

103
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,900
Okay, well, I look forward
to playing with you.

104
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,135
And...

105
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:40,169
And what?

106
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,671
And a third person.

107
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:45,191
It's three-person chess.

108
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,176
I must say,
ever since you started

109
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:51,480
having regular intercourse, your
mind has lost its keen edge.

110
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,517
You should reflect on that.

111
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:57,453
Excuse me, but Einstein had
a pretty busy sex life.

112
00:04:57,454 --> 00:05:01,857
Yes, and he never unified
gravity with the other forces.

113
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,959
If he hadn't been
such a hound dog,

114
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,828
we'd all have time machines.

115
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,297
Got it. Bye.

116
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,166
You know I'm right.

117
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:15,204
I think he's getting worse.

118
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:18,073
Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

119
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:26,215
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

120
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:28,350
I'm just breaking in
some new shoes.

121
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:30,219
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.

122
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,403
Did you know that women
wear high heels

123
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:33,989
to make the buttocks
and breasts more prominent?

124
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,825
Hadn't really thought about it.

125
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,226
Look.

126
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:44,500
Uh, sure. Very... prominent.

127
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,269
Please, Leonard, don't leer,
you have a girlfriend.

128
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,272
- Sorry.
- So, are you off to dinner

129
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:51,674
with Priya, Howard
and Bernadette?

130
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:52,675
Yeah. How did you know?

131
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:53,709
I heard it at the mall,

132
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,177
when I was shopping
with my girlfriends,

133
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,813
'cause, you know,
that's kind of my life now.

134
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,049
Have a good night.

135
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,218
Try not to ogle my caboose
as I walk away.

136
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:12,962
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

137
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:16,498
Hey, Raj, will you
be joining us for dinner?

138
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,934
The lonely guy
and the two happy couples?

139
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:20,736
I'd rather get a prostate exam

140
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:24,373
from a leper who walks away
with nine fingers.

141
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:28,110
Oh, would you please stop
feeling sorry for yourself?

142
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:31,463
I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.

143
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:34,250
Just like I'm the only one
who'll have sex with me.

144
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,169
Really? In front
of your sister?

145
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,156
We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.

146
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:43,976
Excuse me. I'm going to go
wander the streets alone.

147
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:46,095
Invisible, unwanted and unloved;

148
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:49,331
a pathetic shadow
in a city with no heart.

149
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:54,970
I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.

150
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:01,777
I don't understand. Is this
a way to break in new shoes?

151
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:04,213
No. Once these puppies
touch the ground

152
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:05,447
they're mine,
and I'll have to wear them

153
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,016
walking up and down
Hollywood Boulevard

154
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,118
in order to pay them off.

155
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:14,189
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

156
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,659
Good news: the wildebeest
is in the curry.

157
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,128
The what?

158
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,997
Bernadette is with
Priya and Leonard.

159
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:24,466
Message received.

160
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:28,671
Commence operation
"Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."

161
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,024
Hey. Seriously?

162
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,710
Didn't you get enough of this
cliquey crap in high school?

163
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,745
I wish. A clique
requires friends.

164
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,281
- I didn't have any.
- None?

165
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,583
I used to take my lunch
down to the maintenance room

166
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:43,786
and eat with the janitor.

167
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:46,255
It was nice until his wife
called me a <i>puta</i>

168
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:47,690
and made me stop.

169
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:53,429
Hang on.

170
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,831
It's the wildebeest.

171
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:58,500
Priya just made a snide comment
about your acting career.

172
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:00,369
W-What the hell did she say?

173
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,438
She thinks it's cool
you're following your dream,

174
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,340
no matter what.

175
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:07,776
That bitch!

176
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,512
How do you want
to handle it?

177
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,348
Um, okay.

178
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,317
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya
that I'm on my way to Prague

179
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:17,853
to shoot a movie
with Angelina Jolie.

180
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:19,555
Got it.

181
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:22,391
Is it going
to be in 3-D?

182
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:24,226
What? I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

183
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:25,627
I'm gonna say 3-D.

184
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:28,430
That'll let her know
the studio has faith in it.

185
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,868
You're kidding. 3-D?

186
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,705
That's what I hear.

187
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,141
Then the studio
must have real faith in it.

188
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,245
Wonder why she
didn't <i>tell</i> me.

189
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:45,714
Have you been spending time
with your ex-girlfriend?

190
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:47,716
No...

191
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:50,285
Then why are you surprised
she didn't tell you?

192
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:53,856
Well, it's not as much
"surprised" as

193
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:57,726
you know...
uh... the other thing.

194
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:00,829
What other thing?

195
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,833
Well, if you... uh...

196
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,803
I don't... oh...

197
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:09,371
What's the word I'm looking for?

198
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:12,107
I'm not going to help you.
This is hilarious.

199
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:17,579
She's also dating an astronaut.

200
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:21,083
Wow. That's very impressive.

201
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,753
Yeah. But Leonard's
impressive, too.

202
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,092
Thank you.

203
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:33,262
"Befuddled."

204
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:36,832
The word I was looking for
was "befuddled."

205
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:46,208
Knight to old woman...

206
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,213
six-and-a-third.

207
00:09:57,053 --> 00:10:00,322
Brilliant move.

208
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,062
Thank you.

209
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,901
Will the two of you excuse me?

210
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,642
I need a hug.

211
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,028
Sorry, I have company.

212
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,182
Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

213
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:35,485
I don't want to hug you.

214
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:36,853
I don't want to
hug you, either.

215
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:38,221
I was just
feeling blue.

216
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:41,058
Blue, as in depressed.

217
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,193
Well, not so much
depressed as lonely.

218
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:46,163
I don't know what
color lonely is.

219
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,198
- What?
- Red is angry;

220
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,800
yellow is frightened;

221
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:53,036
green is jealous;
and blue is depressed.

222
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:56,206
Perhaps we can assign
a color to lonely.

223
00:10:56,207 --> 00:11:00,210
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.

224
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,213
All right. Come in.

225
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:05,882
You look positively
orange with loneliness.

226
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:10,654
No, I don't see that
catching on at all.

227
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:11,855
What are you doing?

228
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:13,757
I'm working on my
three-person chess game.

229
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,392
Oh, cool. Can I play?

230
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:20,597
It's three-person chess.

231
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,299
Did you bring a friend?

232
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,900
No.

233
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:26,403
Then as a mental exercise
I invite you

234
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:31,274
to figure out why the two of us
can't play three-person chess.

235
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:35,679
Can you believe this guy?

236
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:39,416
Social protocol does, however,

237
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:41,084
require me to bring you
a hot beverage

238
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:42,352
in your time of need.

239
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,587
No, thank you. I'm fine.

240
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:45,255
It's not optional.

241
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,959
We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.

242
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,930
I, uh, I guess you're probably
wondering what's got me down.

243
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:55,649
Actually, I was wondering

244
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,768
if I could add
a third new chess piece.

245
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,321
How do you think people
would feel about Prince Joey--

246
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:04,975
the king's feeble-minded
but well-meaning cousin?

247
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,676
I'm going to be 30 years old,

248
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,779
and I have no one in my life
to love me.

249
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,448
I'm such a basket case, I can't
even talk to a woman

250
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:13,483
without having alcohol
in my body.

251
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,286
The fun thing about
Prince Joey

252
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:20,123
is every time he moves,
there's a one-in-five chance

253
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:21,758
he'll kill himself.

254
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:25,195
Sheldon, listen to me.

255
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,798
I have a big decision to make,
and I'm scared.

256
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,767
Yellow. Go ahead.

257
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:32,219
A friend at the School
of Pharmacology

258
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,937
gave me these new pills
they're testing.

259
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:35,305
He says it's
the next big thing

260
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,706
for social anxiety disorder.

261
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:39,076
Fascinating.
What's in it?

262
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:40,510
I'm not sure.

263
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,813
Some sort of beta-blocker
attached to a molecule

264
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:45,816
extracted from
the urine of cows.

265
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:47,951
I like cows.

266
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,152
That's not the point.

267
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:51,822
It was its own
point. Go on.

268
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,457
I'm a scientist.

269
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,792
My ability to think
is my bread and butter.

270
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:57,627
I'm afraid if I take this,
I might lose

271
00:12:57,628 --> 00:13:01,531
that special, unique something that
makes me so successful in my field.

272
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:05,034
Rajesh, I've had
the privilege

273
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,038
of working alongside
you for many years.

274
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,242
My recommendation is that you
gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

275
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:21,084
Okay, I'm still trying
to work this out.

276
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:24,054
How did Penny meet an astronaut?

277
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,021
I don't know.

278
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:28,375
The regular way
people meet astronauts.

279
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:31,128
Most of those
guys live in Texas.

280
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,930
Obviously, this one doesn't.

281
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,266
Okay.

282
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,168
Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.

283
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:40,604
People meet, Howard.
God!

284
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:43,073
Fine.

285
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,374
You've met lots of astronauts,

286
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,576
and I've never grilled you
about that.

287
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,112
I'd thank you to extend me
the same courtesy.

288
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,850
I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.

289
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:57,454
I still can't get over the fact
that she got a big movie part.

290
00:13:57,455 --> 00:14:02,325
Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's
up to, 'cause I don't.

291
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:05,762
Maybe that's where she met
the astronaut, all right?

292
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:07,731
I'm sorry. What would an
astronaut be doing

293
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:09,399
working on a movie?

294
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,302
He's a consultant.

295
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:16,122
I thought the movie was
about 18th-century Vienna.

296
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,958
He can't have a hobby?!

297
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:23,129
Excuse me, I have to pee.

298
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,582
Or is that
implausible, as well?!

299
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:32,189
It's nice to have another
couple to hang with, isn't it?

300
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,426
All right, guys,
you have to go back.

301
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,744
I can't afford you.

302
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:41,131
No, don't send
us away; we love you.

303
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:46,803
I love you, too,
but you cost more than my rent.

304
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,806
But, Penny,
you look so good in us.

305
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,192
Damn it, the shoes are right.

306
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:56,613
Good golly, Penny,
your whimsy is boundless.

307
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,652
What do you got for me,
wildebeest?

308
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,688
I think they're on to me.

309
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,957
The story's starting
to fall apart.

310
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,959
Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.

311
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,227
We may have
to kill her.

312
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:13,463
Bernadette, I'm putting
you on speakerphone.

313
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,398
Where are you now?

314
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,766
In the bathroom.

315
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,503
Oh, look at this, another one of
our classic bathroom gabfests.

316
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,772
What's the problem?

317
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:24,241
They're just asking me

318
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,076
all sorts of questions
I can't answer.

319
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,078
Just change the subject.

320
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,080
I suppose I could get them back
to talking about Leonard

321
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,815
going to India
to meet Priya's parents.

322
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:33,266
What?!

323
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,869
They said something about
going there this summer.

324
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,954
What, are they getting engaged?

325
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:40,890
I don't know. I was too busy
covering my heinie

326
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,393
on Amy's stupid
astronaut story!

327
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:45,729
What astronaut story?

328
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,298
You texted me Penny's
dating an astronaut.

329
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,267
I texted "architect."
That's amusing.

330
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:53,136
Auto-correct
must've changed it.

331
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:56,873
Yeah, it's hysterical.

332
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,476
All right, look, just forget
about the astronaut.

333
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:02,512
Architect. Where would you
have met an astronaut?

334
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:06,549
Look, just find out what's up
with this trip to India.

335
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,418
I don't want
to do this anymore!

336
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,452
Don't you quit on us!

337
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:11,955
Bernie, you okay?

338
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:14,724
It was an architect!

339
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,945
Thank you for coming
with me, Sheldon.

340
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:19,996
You're a good friend.

341
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:21,564
I'm glad you think so.

342
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,667
That's what I
strive to emulate.

343
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:27,954
Okay, let's see
if this drug works.

Can I help you?

346
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,307
Forgive me for staring,
but you're very beautiful.

347
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,598
Thank you.

348
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,434
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?

349
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:58,601
India.

350
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,303
Oh, cool.
I've always wanted to go there.

351
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:01,771
It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.

352
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,073
May I join you?

353
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:06,576
Uh, okay, sure.
Why not?

354
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,411
My name is Dr. Rajesh
Koothrappali,

355
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:09,908
and this is my friend
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

356
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:10,747
Hi.

357
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:12,682
There's no need
to interact with me.

358
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,552
I'm just here to observe.

359
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,420
What's he
observing?

360
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,356
We're scientists.
We observe everything.

361
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,590
Here, go buy yourself a scone.

362
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:23,292
All right.

363
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:26,930
- And what is your name?
- Angela.

364
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:30,100
Oh, derived from the word
"angel." Appropriate.

365
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,402
You're cute.

366
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:34,337
I'd like to buy a scone.

367
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:35,672
Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.

368
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:36,773
We have muffins.

369
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:38,375
They sound delicious,

370
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:41,177
but this money
is earmarked for scones.

371
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:43,163
What are
you doing?!

372
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:44,948
Oh, just getting comfortable.

373
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:49,119
So how long have you
lived in Los Angeles?

374
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,170
I...

375
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:51,421
They were out of scones.

376
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:52,672
Sheldon, I'm talking to someone.

377
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:53,690
You're being rude.

378
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,725
I'll bet you're an actress.

379
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,127
If not, you should be.

380
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:59,129
You have a very expressive face.

381
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,563
Oh, my God.

382
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:02,716
Wait, where are you going?

383
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,184
We were doing so well.

384
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:07,637
She never even got
to see my penis.

385
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:11,307
Ta-da!

386
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:20,683
Who wants some
more coffee?

387
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,185
Thanks, yeah.
Sure.

388
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,987
Let me help you.

389
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,591
Nice to see that the gals
are getting along.

390
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:30,660
"Gals"?

391
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,996
Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

392
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:36,166
This trip to India
sounds fun.

393
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,600
Yeah, I think it will be.

394
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:40,537
Are you concerned your parents
might not approve of Leonard?

395
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,272
A little.

396
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:44,174
They're very old-fashioned.

397
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:45,742
Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

398
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:47,944
It's not like you guys
are getting engaged, right?

399
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,116
Oh, God, no.
We're not there yet.

400
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:55,952
Not engaged.
Very interesting.

401
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:57,320
I have to tinkle.

402
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:59,255
You've been in there
a lot tonight. Are you okay?

403
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:02,792
Yes.
Are you writing a book?

404
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,928
Why are you getting upset?

405
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,597
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.

406
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:09,899
What's up with you?

407
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:14,270
Bernadette?

408
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:17,607
I can't do this anymore!

409
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,742
I'm a good girl!

410
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,078
I went to Catholic school!

411
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:25,081
Okay, well, it's getting late.

412
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:28,518
This was terrific.

413
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,186
You win.

414
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:32,088
Bernie?

415
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:39,053
I think the word you're
looking for is "befuddled."

416
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:51,157
My catapult flings my bishop

417
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:55,461
to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.

418
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,263
Nice.

419
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:01,868
Okay, rook to transporter pad.

420
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,071
And he comes out at...

421
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:10,159
...Leonard's Queen's Bishop
five-and-a-third.

422
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,311
Check on Leonard.

423
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:15,715
Hang on.

424
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:19,986
When is my pawn allowed
to use the golf cart?

425
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,804
When it's done charging.

426
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,689
Or you land on
the time machine.

427
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,092
Obviously.

428
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,861
Oh, oh...

429
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:32,615
Beekeeper to King 12.

430
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:37,670
I capture your pope
and release the swarm.

431
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,174
Checkmate on Sheldon.

432
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:45,611
I knew I should've given
my pope the jet pack.

433
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:46,846
Hey, I've got winners.
