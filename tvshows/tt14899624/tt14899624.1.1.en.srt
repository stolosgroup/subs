We'll keep Sevgi for a few days, Muko.

161
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,791
She needs some rest.

162
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,125
But please don't worry.
I'm taking care of her, all right?

- [mockingly] Hey.

- Where have you been?
- What?

167
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,416
Come on. What do you want from me?
I had to explain to Erdem and pack a bag.

168
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,916
Why do you need a bag?
We're just staying one night.

169
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,916
What, am I not allowed to post a vlog
while we're in Ayvalık? Gimme a break.

- Are you all right, sweetie?
- I'm fine. Just go.

Look, I want to know everything.
Tell me. Who is this guy? What's he doing?

What's up? We're going to Ayvalık, love.
You should come.

Sevgi, get out, please.

179
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,142
I can't, dear. All right, we're leaving.
I was gonna call you tonight anyway.

180
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,583
Ayvalık? Can you tell me
exactly what you're hoping to find?

181

Who knows? Raki, fish,
maybe the Ayvalık trio?

Sevgi, come on.

You either come with us
or you get out of the way.

187

But I have to go. There's no other choice.

Please.

189
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,375
So this is it?

190
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,666
This is what
you're risking your health for?

191

Risking what health, Ada?

[Ada sighs]

193
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,458
Hey, girls, um, just wondering
if anyone feels like telling me

194
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,666

- [Leyla] Hm?
- Pull over at the gas station, please.

199
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,931
- We have enough gas already.
- Leyla, you need to start signaling.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,083
[groans] You're too much today, Ada.
You're seriously suffocating me.

201
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,333
I'm pulling over now.

202
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,333
[Leyla] We just hit the road,
and she wants to pull over.

203

Listen, I'm fine.

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,958
You cannot go on a road trip
in your condition.

205
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,250
Ada, I don't want to be
in a hospital, okay?

206
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,125
And I don't want you
to get your hopes up for nothing.

207
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,728
I don't want to see you unhappy again.

208
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,375
Then please stop making me unhappy, girl.

209
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,375
Let me out. I'm going to the bathroom.

210
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,833
What's your problem, Ada?

211
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,676
Why do you have to make this
such a big deal?

212
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,541
Girl's been through chemo.
Give her a break.

213
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,041
Leyla, I can't let her go
all the way down to that place

214
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,000
just so you can get a few Instagram pics.

215
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,333
Thanks, Ada!
You're not making any sense right now.

216
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,041
I cancelled the operation
I've been waiting for for months.

217

I left my kid all alone.
What are you talking about?

218
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,166
- All because she asked me to go with her.
- Leyla, Sevgi is not doing well.

Sevgi will be fine.

227
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,291
But, right now, she needs to be
under constant care, inside a hospital.

228
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,208
You're positive?

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,125
- You're sure she'll be okay?
- How can you ask me that, Leyla?

230
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,041
Of course I'm not sure.

231
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,208
How could I be?

232
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,541
Then we'll do what she wants to do, Ada.

233

then that's where we're going.

[Leyla] What's the problem?
It's not even gonna take ten minutes.

266
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,958
As most of you know,

267
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,625
in Greek mythology,
Athena is known as the goddess of war.

268
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:45,833
And, in fact, she's also a goddess
capable of seeing things from every angle,

opening new paths, and giving direction.

270

That's why the owl is
the symbol of Athena.

270 degrees? That's all for now.

that's enough enlightenment,

can we please be on our way?

without doing this first. Okay?

- [grunts]
- [Ada] Come on. Come here.

312
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,875
- I can't stand watching this.
- Mm, you're so sweet, my love.

313
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,250
[Leyla] Okay, GPS says it's
somewhere around here, but I don't see it.

314
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,750
God, I'm gonna be so late. Zaman told me
to be there at 10:00 a.m. sharp.

315
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,375
I mean, what kind of name
is Zaman, anyway?

316
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,625
- [sighs]
- [Leyla] Hey.

317
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,708
[Leyla] I think this might be it.

318
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,750
[Sevgi] Yep. This is it. We're here.

319
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,458
[Ada] I'm coming with you, Sevgi.

320
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,541
I'm going alone. Call you when I'm done.

321
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,250
Ada.

322
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,851
- [Leyla] Leave her be, sweetie.
- [sighs]

323
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,791
We'll come back for her, anyway.
It's not like she's leaving without us.

324
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,333
Come on now. Come take a picture of me
over there. The path is gorgeous.

325
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,375
[Leyla] Hang on. I'm setting it up. Here.

326
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,796
- You have to get me walking.
- [Ada] All right.

327
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,875
[Leyla] It needs to look cool,
like a model shoot.

328
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,000
With the wind at my back,
it'll be perfect.

329
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,750
It's gonna be such a good post.

330

[rhythmic meditative music plays]

[inaudible]

332
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,041
- [man] Oh!
- Oh my God. I'm terribly sorry.

333
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,208
No, I'm sorry.

334
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,166
Um, is this Mr. Zaman's place?

335
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,500
Yeah, it is. Come in.

336
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,500
[chattering]

337
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,208
Can I help you?

338
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,125
Which one is Zaman?

339
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,125
Oh, you're new. I'm Fiko.

340
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,833
Fikret. They call me Fiko

341
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,208
Sevgi.

342
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,458
They call me Sevgi.

343
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,958
Zaman's office is upstairs.
You can't miss it. Want some tea?

344
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,458
No. Thanks.

345
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:58,958
[Fiko] Thank you.

346
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,458
[folk guitar music plays on stereo]

347
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,041
Come in.

348
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,208
Excuse me, Zaman?

349
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,041
I called yesterday. I'm Sevgi.

350
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,625
Ah, that's right.

351
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,916
- Have a seat, please. Welcome.
- [door closes]

352
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,583
Pomegranate.

353
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,333
Hm.

354
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,958
They say it's a symbol of abundance
and fortune, as well as life after death.

355
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,541
So

356
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,416
it reminds us that within one's life
there are other lives as well.

357
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,583
Would you like some?

358
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,500
I can't even remember
what pomegranate tastes like.

359
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,875
- It's been so long since I had one.
- Hm.

360
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,791
Welcome, Sevgi.
How can I be of help to you?

361
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,041
- I'm here 'cause I have cancer.
- Mm-hm

362
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,083
It started in my liver.

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,625
I had surgery, and then we started
a chemotherapy treatment regimen.

364
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,708
But now the cancer came back.

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,583
Do you think there's possibly
a way you can help me?

366
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,791
I mean, the treatments you're doing here.
Do you think your treatment could help me?

367
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,041
Now, Sevgi. [sighs]

368
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:51,083
Expansion of Origin Family...
hm... does not offer medical treatment.

369
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,916
We leave that to doctors.
That's not what we do.

370
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,333
What we deal with
is the spiritual origins of diseases.

371
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,500
If we can tap into the source...

372
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,208
the disease... could begin to heal.

373
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,875
Although, there's no guarantee.

374
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,125
Sevgi.

375
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,125
That's a pretty name.

376
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,666
Thank you so much. [chuckles]

377
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,875
All right.

378
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,958
If I may, the other hand.

379
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,875

Excuse me.

383
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,041
I'm not feeling well.

384
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,291
That's it. Let it out.

[exhales]

386
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,625
[Zaman] You've held it inside too long,
haven't you?

387
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,375
[inhales]

388
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,125
- Sevgi?
- [inhales]

389
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,250
Do you think you could thank cancer?

[chuckles, sniffles]

391
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,125
[Zaman] Mm.

[sighs]

394
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,041
No. Of course I can't.

395
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,083
I've never smoked once in my life.

396
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,166
[Zaman] Mm-hm.

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,375
I try to be healthy.

398
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,250
And I've always tried to be a good person.

399
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,416
I didn't do anything to deserve this.

400
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,208
Hm.

401
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,083
So... [sighs]

402
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,416
No, I cannot be thankful.

403
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,583
I just want this thing
to get the hell away from me.

404
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Fine.

405
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,083
Follow me.

406
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,208
Maybe this disease
wants you to remember something. Hm?

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,166
Come, let's see.

- [sighs] Oh, you...

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,684
I really don't understand
how you're so cool about this.

419
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,458
We just left her alone
at that weird place.

00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,101
What do you want me to do?
This is how I keep my mind off things.

What's wrong with that?

Mm, these are pretty good.
Well done, girl.

Are you seeing this? It says
they can enlarge breasts naturally.

Ah! Babe, go grab
an Ayvalık grilled cheese or something.

I'll call you later.

Good morning, love.

00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,541
How's Sevgi?

431
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,125
Not good, Selim, not good.

432
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,416
She acts fine,
but really she's devastated.

You went all that way,
you should at least enjoy it.

434

- Get an Ayvalık grilled cheese.
- That's the last thing I need.

Miss, you forgot your strawberries!

Thank you very much. Thank you.

Ada?

It's Toprak.

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,333
I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.

455
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,864
That's good. I thought
you were just running away from me.

Fine.

I'm good.

You look good.

So what are you doing here?
I thought you lived abroad.

Well, I'll be here for a little bit.

Yeah, kinda.

00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,125
You haven't changed.

471
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,000
[Ada thinking] <i>He still has that smile.</i>

472
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,958
You have, though.
You're not taking care of yourself.

473
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,208
[chuckles] You're exactly the same.
Blunt as ever.

474
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,250
Anyway.

475
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,083
Have a nice holiday.

476
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,000
Ada. Ada.

477
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,000
Do you have time to get coffee?

478
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,375
Sure, Toprak.

479
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,833
Why don't we just get dinner and reminisce
about the good ol' days, yeah?

480
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,250
You're still angry.

481
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,833
[Ada thinking] <i>I'm not angry, moron.
I'm hurt.</i>

482
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:22,000
It's been many years. I'm not angry.

483
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,333
We're not children anymore.

484
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:24,833
Anyway,

485
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,833
the girls are waiting for me.

486
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,458
My number hasn't changed.

487
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:31,541
Mine has.

488
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,333
[Leyla]<i>You're kidding me.</i>

489
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:40,291
Mr. Toprak is in town, for real? [gasps]

490
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,541
Leyla.

491
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,291
Keep it down.
He might be around here somewhere.

492
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,375
[Ada sighs]

493
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:48,458
I mean, would it kill you
to just have one coffee?

494
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,125
Haven't you ever wondered
where the guy has been?

495
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,125
I mean, what has he been doing
this whole time?

496
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,708
I haven't, Leyla. Why would I?

497
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:58,125
I mean, with everything going on,
why would I be thinking about him?

498
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,500
Okay, look at me, sweetie.

499
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,833
Psst.

500
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:04,156
Hey. Stop it. Wait a second. Look at me.
Look, we're gonna take these glasses off.

501
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,666
- [Leyla] Mm-hm.
- Hm.

502
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,416
Now look deep into my eyes, love.

503
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,458
How did you feel when you saw Toprak?

504
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:11,541
Tell me the truth.

505
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,625
Are you stupid or something, Leyla?
I am married.

506
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,458
Oh, that's right.

507
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,708
'Cause people totally stop feeling things
once they're married.

508
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,791
Damn it. I totally forgot about that.

509
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,333
[sighs]

510
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,125
Hey!

511
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,000
Psst.

512
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,125
Listen, Ada, you can't run.

513
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,791
You can't run away from me,
we're going to talk about this!

514
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,583
Come.

515
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,541
No.

516
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,791
[Ada] I got you.

517
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,416
No, it's too cold anyway. It's too cold.

518
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:51,083
Hey, listen, you and I
are gonna talk about this. This is not...

519
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,166
[water whooshing]

520
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,416
Mm, mm, mm.

521
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:04,791
You know,

522
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,916
I've never felt anything like that
in my whole life.

523
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,958
So spill. What happened then?

524
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:13,291
It's not something I can describe.
You have to experience it.

525
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,625
[Leyla] To experiencing it.

526
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:15,708
[Sevgi] Hm.

527
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,208
Mr. Zaman, though, he told me
not to tell anyone about it for a month.

528
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,500
So, what, he decides
whether you tell us or not?

529
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,166
Be patient. I'll tell you in a month.

530
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,517
- Excuse me.
- [Leyla] Let it go.

531
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,341
- Could we get another order?
- Don't push it.

532
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,791
I mean, she looks good right now,
really good.

533
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,916
But, love, you shouldn't eat that much.
You're gonna upset your stomach.

534
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,125
Oh, stop it, Leyla.

535
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,888
It's the first I've been able to eat
without getting sick in months.

536
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,250
Well, then go ahead, baby.
Enjoy all of it.

537
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,958
[Leyla] Enjoy it, love.
Let's do another toast, then!

538
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,267
- Cheers!
- Toast to your health.

539
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,601
- Yeah, to my health! There you go.
- [Leyla] To your health.

540
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:47,791
[all chuckle]

541
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,500
[retches, coughs]

542
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,583
[spits]

543
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
[sniffles]

544
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,125
[upbeat folk dance music plays]

545
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,166
[Sevgi] I feel like
I should call Ayça right now,

546
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,750
and tell her I'm not gonna
put up with her shit anymore.

547
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,458
Tell her I'm quitting. I'm done.

548
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,125
[chuckles]

549
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,250
[Ada] Come here, baby.

550
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,750
Oh, and I could rent a place
with a full view of the ocean.

551
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,958
Why not just go ahead and buy it then?

552
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:18,001
I mean, if you want it that much,
we could rent a place for you right here.

553
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,458
Sweetie, there aren't any good hospitals
around here though.

554
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,291
I'd definitely come visit you
all the time.

555
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,934
- [gasps] You'd bring your son too? Uh?
- Are you out of your mind?

556
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,125
I swear, living with Sarp
for even one single day

557
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,666
is enough to give you cancer.

558
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:32,041
[Ada] I think... maybe you've had enough.

559
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,291
[gasps]

560
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,916
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

561
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
- Love, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that.
- [chuckling]

562
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,288
You know me, babe.
I just blurt things out sometimes.

563
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,142
- I'm so sorry. Was that offensive?
- [laughing]

564
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,791
[sighs] I mean, the good news is,

565
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,791
that's not a problem for me,
so you can just bring him anyway.

566
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,583
[laughs]

567
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,000
You know how people always say,

568
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,833
"Oh, don't eat that.
It'll give you cancer"?

569
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:53,916
[laughs]

570
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,208
And, "Don't drink that,
or else you'll get cancer"?

571
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,500
[chuckles awkwardly]

572
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,392
I don't have to worry anymore...
[sing-song]...'cause I already have it.

573
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,791
- [Leyla] Oh my God, stop.
- Stop.

574
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,208
[all chuckle]

575
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,771
- I wanna make love so bad.
- [coughs]

576
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,708
- What's that?
- [Sevgi] What's wrong with that?

577
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,333
I want to fall in love.

578
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:13,125
- I want somebody in my life. Why not?
- [clears throat]

579
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,728
Love, don't worry. You're not
missing out on anything, for real.

580
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,541
I'm having sex all the time, and so what?

581
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,875
Orgasms, that's what. You remember those?

582
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,250
[scoffs]

583
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,375
Please. I mean, that's just insulting.

584
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,791
Of course I have orgasms.

585
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:27,934
Do you actually think I would go through
all the trouble if I didn't have any?

586
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:30,125
- [Sevgi] Stupid.
- [chuckles] She has a point.

587
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,291
[chuckles]

588
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,625
Honestly, I can't remember what it's like.

589
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,416
Doc? What about you?

590
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,291
[inhales]

591
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,625
- Do fake orgasms count?
- [tsks]

592
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:43,708
[Ada] It's been a while.

593
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,750
You know, the fake ones
just make you appreciate the real ones.

594
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,916
But, if you want to have orgasms,

595
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,250
you have to really
put some effort into it, right?

596
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,791
Leyla, do you even realize

597
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,958
how many surgeries
I have to do every week?

598
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,708
I just don't have time
for fantasies like that, all right?

599
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,041
Oh, come on, Ada.

600
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,916
Like you're too busy to just buy
some cute lingerie or something?

601
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,583
[scoffs] So buy lingerie, have an orgasm.
It's that simple?

602
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:05,583
Yeah, it is.

603
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,416
'Cause you can only have an orgasm
when you feel sexy and comfortable

604
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,833
- in the way you look.
- Mm.

605
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:12,625
You were having real orgasms
with Toprak, though.

606
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:13,958
- [Sevgi] Wait, what?
- Leyla.

607
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,322
- What's Toprak got to do with this?
- I can't hold it in.

608
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,166
Guess who she saw today?
Toprak, she just ran into him.

609
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,416
And how was that?

610
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,750
Enough. Come on.
Just drop it, drop it, please.

611
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,433
Or, at least, I'm done talking about it.

612
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,538
- You two suit yourselves.
- Yeah, we should drop it.

613
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,291
I mean, if Selim heard about it,
he'd lose his mind.

614
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,541
Honestly, Selim is gonna
lose his mind anyway

615
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,333
when he hears all about Brussels.

616
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,517
Don't you worry about Selim.
What's on your arm there?

617
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,461
Oh. Oh, I guess
you wouldn't understand, sweetie.

618
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,625
It's a fantasy thing.
I got it from pole dancing.

619
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,625
- Pole dancing, you said?
- Exactly.

620
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,833
So, just out of curiosity...

621
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:50,083
So you do pole dancing for Erdem,
but what does he ever do for you?

622
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,541
[Sevgi] Yeah, exactly.

623
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,458
- Like, maybe a gladiator costume.
- Mm!

624
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,958
With leather straps and handcuffs
and all that kind of stuff.

625
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,291
[Sevgi] Maybe a whip too.

626
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,642
- [Ada] A whip. [chuckles]
- [Sevgi imitates whip cracking]

627
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:01,791
Well, true, he doesn't do anything for me.

628
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,500
But at least he doesn't do anything
for the other ones either.

629
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,958
- Huh?
- What's that?

630
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,750
What do you think?

631
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,250
Erdem cheats on me.

632
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,083
All the time, ladies.

633
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:15,791
Is there any more raki?

634
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,833
- [server] I'm afraid not.
- [Leyla] You're out?

635
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,791
Guess I'm out as well.

636
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,375
Leyla, hon...

637
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,791
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

638
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,291
[Sevgi] Look.

639
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,875
- In one hearing, I'll have you divorced.
- Mm-hm.

640
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,500
We'll take everything that bastard's got,
down to his underwear.

641
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,000
You know that, don't you, babe?

642
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,208
I know it, sweetie.

643
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,625
That's exactly why
I haven't told you already.

644
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:37,541
But why is that?

645
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,625
Because, babe,

646
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,125
I actually love my husband.

647
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,916
Leyla, he cannot treat you like this.

648
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,541
Do you really think
that this is what you deserve?

649
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:51,875
I swear, if Selim...

650
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:56,541
If Selim ever did that to me,
I would never forgive him. Ever.

651
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,125
Not everyone's like you, you know.

652
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,166
For some, pride doesn't come first, okay?

653
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,250
Yeah, but apparently, comfort does.

654
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,250
It seems like it doesn't matter
what your man does,

655
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:09,166
as long as the credit card keeps working,
that's what really matters.

656
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,833
Are you kidding me right now?

657
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,556
Do you actually believe I think that way?

658
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,916
No, I don't. That's exactly why
I'm getting upset with you.

659
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Guys.

660
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,083
At least you aren't sleeping
all by yourself every single night, right?

661
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,625
And, even better than that,

662
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,666
when you wake up every morning,
you don't have to wonder

663
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,375
how much time you have left. Right?

664
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,458
Hey.

665
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,708
Don't say that, Sevgi.

666
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,250
You're not alone. You have us. Always.

667
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,125
[sighs]

668
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,208
[Sevgi] It's just

669
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,750
this right here.

670
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,750
It's totally empty.

671
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:46,791
And it feels like
I'm somehow hollow inside. [sniffles]

672
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,666
I mean, I just wonder
what if I've already run out of time?

673
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,833
[sniffles]

674
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,500
Sevgi! [grunts]

675
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:58,666
Don't be stupid.

676
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,666
You just have to keep going.

677
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,583
Scoot over.

678
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,583
Who knows how much time
any of us has left?

679
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,791
Anything can happen at any moment.

680
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:08,875
I'm right, aren't I?

681
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,375
Here's what we're gonna do.

682
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,416
Starting from now, we're gonna need
to stop putting things off.

683
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,708
So, wherever you feel good,
that's where you should be.

684
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,625
And us too. We'll be right there with you.

685
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,166
Everything will be all right.

686
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,125
I'm going to stay here then.

687
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,791
Good for you.

688
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,833
I'm not going back to Istanbul.

689
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So don't.

690
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:38,541
And I'm getting a boob job
when I get back.

691

[all chuckle]

- And you're buying lingerie.

693
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,583
Oh, shut up, for heaven's sake.

694
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,958
- Just go buy it already.
- [laughs] Fine, I'll do it.

695
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,250
[Leyla] Okay, but you have to let me
come with you.

696
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,413
- Come on.

[Selim] Sh.

705
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,666
It's okay.

706
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,500
You go ahead.
I'll get the wine and be right with you.

707
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,583
All right, then.

708
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,250
[Ada] Mm.

709
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:58,958
Tonight is supposed to be
the perfect night to make a baby.

710

At least, according to the astrologers.

00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,958
- [Ada] Mm.
- Uh-huh.

712
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,375
As if you believe them.

713
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:07,375
Oh, I believe them right now.

- Mm-hm?

00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,291
I heard back from Brussels.

717
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,458
- Mm?
- There are three final candidates.

718
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,666
And I'm one of them.

719
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:37,375
And if... they do accept me...

720
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,250
it's a two-year research program.

721
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,166
Hm?

722
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,250
- [Selim] Two years?
- Uh-huh.

723
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,625
It's a very important committee.
We talked about this.

724
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,416
Except for the two-year part.

725
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,666
Well, maybe you can come with me, babe.

726

We'll go together.

Sure.

730
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,583
Maybe I could just put off
the construction work in Ankara.

731
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:18,625
Or I have a much better idea.

732
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,291
I could just sit around
