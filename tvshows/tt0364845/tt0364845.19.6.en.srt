1
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,943
He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

2
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,504
6:03, Felix.
Coach is gonna kill you.

3
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:32,066
I'm sorry, Coach.
My alarm didn't go off.

4
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:35,069
Coach?

5
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,898
Commander? Sir?

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,074

7
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:13,659
â™ª

8
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:43,896
This is weird, right?

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,312
That's one word for it.

10
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:46,692
I think it's kind of nice.

11
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:48,349
Well, looks like
the, uh, new guy

12
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,075
is trying to score
some brownie points.

13
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,698
Or in this case, pastry points.

14
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:55,149
I think Parker said
these are Polish kolaczki.

15
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,427
Wait, wait, wait.
What if this is a test?

16
00:01:57,531 --> 00:01:58,670
To see who prefers

17
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,223
plain over powdered sugar?

18
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,122
Well, maybe.

19
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,331
What does taking plain over
powdered sugar say about you?

20
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:05,918
It says I'm hungry.

21
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,437
Hey, I'm serious, guys.
We barely know this guy.

22
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,336
What if he's playing mind games?

23
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,304
Or he's just trying to be nice
his first week on the job.

24
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:14,479
I'm not that easy.
Me, neither.

25
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,309
Well, now I feel like
I should put it back.

26
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:18,241
Morning.

27
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:19,691
Morning.
On it.

28
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,728
Whoa. What's the rush?

29
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,593
You didn't come in to tell us
we have a body, or...?

30
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:28,458
No. How was everybody's weekend?

31
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:31,151
Good.

32
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:32,290
Uneventful.

33
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:33,670
Same.

34
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:36,466
Anybody catch
that Nats game last night?

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,746
Special Agent McGee.

36
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:44,198
Yeah. Uh, one sec.

37
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:46,545
Uh, dispatch has a body.
You want to talk to them?

38
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:51,101
Um, yeah.

39
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,070
Okay, got it. Thanks.

40
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,176
Guess they don't have
your number yet.

41
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,040
We got a dead sailor at the Navy
Athletic Complex in Norfolk.

42
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:03,044
Well, in that case, my delicious
mind games will have to wait.

43
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:06,703
Let's roll.

44
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,981
How did he hear us?

45
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:15,643
Victim is Navy Commander
Henry Davis,

46
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:18,025
head of the All-Navy
Sports program.

47
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:20,545
Worked with some of the
best athletes in the world.

48
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,581
I had a buddy who played
basketball in the Army.

49
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,204
Serious work.

50
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:25,998
Even more so in this case.

51
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:27,276
The other military branches,

52
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,036
your sport
is your primary mission.

53
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:31,072
Navy athletes are
expected to compete

54
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:32,660
at an international level
while maintaining

55
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:34,490
their active-duty assignments.

56
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:36,250
Dual threats.

57
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:38,183
One of the athletes found him
early this morning.

58
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:41,359
Yeah, I would say rigor
suggests the time of death

59
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:43,223
was between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.

60
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,604
You got a cause of death, Doc?

61
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,123
The only visible wound here

62
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,505
is a blunt force trauma
to the temple.

63
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,092
Whoever, uh, killed him

64
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,577
definitely had their pick
of murder weapons.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,096
You got shot puts, hammers,

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,270
javelins.

67
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:57,409
Headwind and tailwind versions.

68
00:03:57,513 --> 00:03:59,377
Wow.

69
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,725
I didn't have you pegged as
the track-and-field type, McGee.

70
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:05,521
I contain multitudes,
Agent Parker.

71
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:08,075
Just curious,
what, uh, type

72
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,146
did you have me pegged as?

73
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,770
Uh, maybe "pegged"
was the wrong word.

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,153
Well, in any case,

75
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,224
I don't think that the murder
weapon came from this room.

76
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:23,159
This wound here
appears to be a burn.

77
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,229
From what?

78
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,817
I'm not sure.

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,026
I've never seen dermal stippling
quite like this before.

80
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,545
So what are we looking for?

81
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,064
I don't know.

82
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:34,101
Then I guess we keep looking.

83
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:36,379
Commander's office
is right next door.

84
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:39,140
No, you-you don't understand.

85
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:40,418
I'm never late.

86
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,764
Why were you this morning?

87
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,317
Coach and I have been
doing two-a-days

88
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,664
to get ready for
the Military World Games.

89
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,528
Time trials are next week.

90
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:51,118
Practice,
plus my regular-duty assignment.

91
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,740
It caught up with me.

92
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,708
I overslept.

93
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,468
It's hard enough to
handle one career.

94
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:57,849
You handle two.

95
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:00,369
I c-- I couldn't do it
without Coach.

96
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:02,302
So the two of you were close?

97
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,374
I was heading down
a bad path as a kid.

98
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,859
Drinking, fighting.

99
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,861
Joined the Navy 'cause
my guidance counselor

100
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,656
thought it'd
straighten me out.

101
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,452
Well? Did it?

102
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,799
Not really.

103
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:19,353
I was looking
at a dishonorable discharge

104
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:22,391
until Coach Davis heard
I was all-state in high school,

105
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:24,324
asked me to try out
for the Navy team.

106
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,498
Running turned things
around for you.

107
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,638
No.

108
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,640
Coach Davis did that.

109
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,574
He gave me
a place to belong.

110
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:36,715
Gave me something else
to do other than drink.

111
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,200
You any idea
who might want him dead?

112
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,133
That's just it.

113
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,790
No one would.

114
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,620
I mean, Coach is the...

115
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,863
Coach...

116
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:49,521
was the best,

117
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,317
on and off the track.

118
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:57,322
Well, he was the best
on the track, that's for sure.

119
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:01,188
Commander Davis has quite
the hardware collection.

120
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,845
Ah, must be the awards
that didn't fit

121
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:05,641
in the trophy case outside.

122
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:08,506
Hmm. This guy's
a regular John Wooden.

123
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,853
The basketball coach.

124
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:12,613
I loved his book
on leadership.

125
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:14,788
Pyramid of Success. Good stuff.

126
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,237
Mm.

127
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:24,487
I wonder if the commander
read it, too.

128
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,593
Sure seems like he knew
the winning secret.

129
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:28,388
Speaking of secrets...

130
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,700
You got something?

131
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,185
Hidden compartment.

132
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:44,887
Drugs.

133
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,718
Yeah.
The performance-enhancing kind.

134
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,755
Testosterone, metenolone.

135
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,482
Wonder what our coach
was doing with steroids?

136
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,286
Commander Henry Davis,
decorated officer

137
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,357
and former
world-class runner himself.

138
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,842
He worked his way up

139
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,223
to become head
of the All-Navy Sports program.

140
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:13,294
These athletes compete
in everything

141
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,193
from the Military World Games
to the Olympics.

142
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,884
I'd hate to find out
that the drugs

143
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:19,542
in the commander's desk
had something to do with that.

144
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,579
Could be why he was killed.
Yeah.

145
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:22,856
Maybe somebody
found out the coach

146
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,892
was doping his athletes,
got upset.

147
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,515
Not athletes.

148
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:28,551
In addition
to his administrative duties,

149
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,864
Davis coached
one person at a time.

150
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,382
Someone who was
stationed locally

151
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,832
and who he saw
extra potential in.

152
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,007
That narrows down the list.

153
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,906
Davis was currently training
Petty Officer Felix Cross.

154
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:41,495
We questioned him this morning,

155
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,048
but that was before we knew
about the drugs.

156
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:44,981
Let's see what Felix
has to say now,

157
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:46,949
and have him pee in a cup
while you're at it.

158
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,606
Yeah.

159
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,780
Who did the coach
work with before Felix?

160
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,645
Petty Officer First
Class Jamie Anderson.

161
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:54,922
Now let's talk to him, too.

162
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:56,027
Let's start
working our way back.

163
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,269
Actually,

164
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:58,754
Petty Officer Anderson

165
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,341
was killed last year,
not in combat.

166
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,309
Some sort
of car accident.

167
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:04,898
That makes two dead.
That's a small world.

168
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,348
You got details?
No,

169
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,729
but Anderson's parents
still live in D.C.

170
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,491
Bring them in.
Let's have a chat.

171
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:16,875
Hi, Jimmy.
Oh, McGee. Great timing.

172
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,981
I was just about to call
Parker down for an update.

173
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:20,430
Well, I like updates.

174
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,397
Would you like an update?

175
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,812
I would love an update.

176
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,262
Let's do an update.

177
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,435
I finally figured out

178
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,920
what our mystery
stippling was here.

179
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:29,336
Commander Davis was killed by...

180
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,717
a gunshot.

181
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,925
No entry wound.

182
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,582
That's because there was
no bullet.

183
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,654
This man was killed
by a blank round.

184
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:38,966
Not the most effective choice
of murder weapon.

185
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,485
No, but it works.

186
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:42,798
Even blank rounds
aren't entirely blank.

187
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,834
Right, they use a wadding
to hold in the propellant.

188
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:47,112
Which, in this case,
was gunpowder.

189
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:48,976
Hence the burn on the temple.

190
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,358
So he was shot point-blank?
Yeah.

191
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:54,741
The paper wadding
was ejected from the barrel

192
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:56,915
and shattered his temporal bone.

193
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,435
The bone fragments
pierced the brain.

194
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,816
Death was instantaneous.

195
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,749
Think this could have
been a suicide, maybe?

196
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:05,683
I didn't find any GSR
on the victim's hands,

197
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:07,685
so that means
someone else pulled the trigger.

198
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:10,032
Why try and kill someone
with a blank round?

199
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:12,793
Eh, starter pistols
could use blank rounds.

200
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,899
At least they used to
before everything went digital.

201
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:18,040
A track coach murdered
with a starter pistol.

202
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,766
Pretty symbolic.

203
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,838
Maybe the killer
is trying to send a message.

204
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,943
Yeah, but what's the message?

205
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,359
This was taken after
the Armed Forces Championship,

206
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:30,604
when Jamie broke
the Navy record.

207
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,710
We were so proud of him.

208
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,746
Yeah. So was Coach.

209
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,437
You were close
with Commander Davis?

210
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,647
We considered him family.

211
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,685
He was just as devastated as
we were when Jamie was killed.

212
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,791
Drunk driver.

213
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:46,724
We're sorry for your loss.

214
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:49,865
From what we understand,
training

215
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:53,731
under Coach Davis was something
of, uh, of an honor in itself.

216
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:56,768
Yeah. Coach only took
the best under his wing.

217
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,459
He had the record
to prove it.

218
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:01,566
Did he ever...

219
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,501
...use performance enhancers
as part of his training regimen?

220
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:10,644
You mean, like, steroids.

221
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:12,819
That's quite an accusation.

222
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,821
We're not accusing anyone.

223
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,650
Well, you'd better have
some proof before you do.

224
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:18,548
Just the accusation
could disgrace

225
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,998
the entire program.

226
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:21,482
That's hundreds
of dedicated athletes.

227
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,656
Not to mention our Jamie.

228
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,071
Jamie would never dope.

229
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,108
And Coach Davis wasn't one
to cut corners.

230
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,215
According to phone records,

231
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,252
Commander Davis called
your house two days ago?

232
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:34,806
Yeah, that's right.
I talked to him.

233
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,050
Ever since Jamie died,

234
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,604
Hank would call us
every once in a while.

235
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,986
You know, to check in, make sure
we were still doing okay.

236
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,816
Did he mention
anything unusual the other day?

237
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,612
Uh, the same old small talk.

238
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:50,166
We're trying to get justice
for Hank.

239
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,238
Anything he might have said
could help us.

240
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:57,553
Well, I mean, it's
nothing specific,

241
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,799
but I could tell that he
seemed a little... distracted.

242
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:04,802
But when I asked what was
wrong, he said he didn't want

243
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:06,458
to burden us
with his problems.

244
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:09,634
Any idea what that problem
might be?

245
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:11,981
Coach wasn't giving us drugs,

246
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,674
and this will prove it.

247
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,676
You guys are way off base.

248
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,127
Look, we're just trying
to find out why he got killed.

249
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:23,027
Well, maybe the steroids
weren't even his.

250
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,545
Ever think of that?

251
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,824
Yes, but they were
hidden in his desk,

252
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,205
and we couldn't find
anyone else's fingerprints.

253
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:31,898
Whatever.
You should be out there

254
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:33,623
trying to catch the killer.

255
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,729
Not wasting time in here.

256
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:37,731
Hey. Hey.

257
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,561
Breathe.

258
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,149
Breathe.

259
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,013
I get what you're going through.

260
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,877
Doubt that.

261
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,675
Coach was family, right?

262
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,785
Well, I just lost
some family, too.

263
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:59,132
Yeah?

264
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:02,791
What did you do?

265
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:06,070
Well, I didn't pick a fight
with a towel dispenser.

266
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,935
I channeled
my emotions

267
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,247
into something positive.

268
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:14,319
Something positive like, what,
finding Coach's killer?

269
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:17,633
Like the time trials
you have coming up.

270
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,601
You run your race,
and you let us run ours.

271
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:23,294
Running isn't gonna
help me forget.

272
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,919
Do you have a sponsor?

273
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:30,784
Navy athletes can't sign
endorsement deals.

274
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,855
No, not that kind of sponsor.

275
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:37,273
The one that you call on
when, uh,

276
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:40,138
you feel like you're falling
back into old habits.

277
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,933
Like drinking?

278
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,765
It's not like that, man.

279
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,319
Something else on your mind?

280
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:51,701
Coach.

281
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,980
You asked me who had problems
with him, right?

282
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,880
Well, I wasn't totally
honest earlier.

283
00:12:57,984 --> 00:13:02,091
I saw Coach get into
this argument the other day.

284
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,301
I have never seen him
lose his temper like that.

285
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,959
Who was he arguing with?

286
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,686
Petty Officer Third Class
Kyle Seward.

287
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,136
Also stationed at Norfolk.

288
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:15,208
And also an All-Navy athlete
in wrestling.

289
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,797
Flyweight?
Actually, this
is an old photo.

290
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,143
He's moved up a few classes.

291
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,803
He went from a skipping stone
to the Rock.

292
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:25,149
All in less than a year.

293
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,598
Think he had a little help?

294
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:27,703
Take a look

295
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,809
at his social media profile.

296
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,364
Notice anything?

297
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,953
I notice good form.

298
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:37,057
Outside of the gym selfies.

299
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:38,783
Vintage 'vette.

300
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:40,889
Eh, nice car.

301
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:43,236
Yeah, too nice. $100,000 car

302
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,341
on an E-4 salary?

303
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:46,791
Kyle's got a side business.

304
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,068
Maybe that's what the argument

305
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,242
with Coach was about.

306
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:50,864
He got caught selling?

307
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:53,039
Or maybe Coach was the customer.

308
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:54,834
Wouldn't be the first
time someone got

309
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,111
into a fight
with their drug dealer.

310
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:58,078
Well, I say we bring Kyle in
and ask.

311
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,736
We could, but this
is just theory right now.

312
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,151
If we really want him to talk,

313
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,118
we got to come up with
something concrete.

314
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,395
If this guy is dealing,

315
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,741
let's catch him in the act.

316
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,674
I can go to the gym.

317
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,883
Make him, uh, sell me steroids
and take him down.

318
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:11,989
I mean, what is he working on
today? Biceps, triceps?

319
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,438
Legs?

320
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,785
According to his
most recent post,

321
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,926
it is "recovery day in the tub."

322
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,033
Even better. I could use
some time in the Jacuzzi.

323
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,280
Great. Mm-hmm.

324
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,075
Thanks.

325
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:33,182
Don't worry, man.
You'll get used to it.

326
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,426
Then you'll crave it,
bro. Seriously.

327
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,255
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

328
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:40,741
Yeah, anything to get rid
of this, uh, back injury, right?

329
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:44,262
Oh, you use the cold to cut
down on the inflammation?

330
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,851
Smart.
Yeah, doctor's orders.

331
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,800
You're Kyle Seward, right?

332
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,836
Yeah, I've seen you
on your social.

333
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,838
You bulked up pretty quick.

334
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,842
Why do I feel like
you don't have a back injury?

335
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,327
You're here for free advice.

336
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,364
I'm here for something else.
Something, uh...

337
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:24,164
Something I'm willing
to pay for.

338
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,270
I hear
you're the man, uh,

339
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,963
you know, who can find,
uh, things.

340
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,861
Don't know what
you're talking about.

341
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,035
Wait, what's the problem?

342
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,347
You, actually.

343
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,245
Approaching me in public.

344
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,075
Wait, I have needs.

345
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:41,319
I bet you do, but I guess
you didn't hear: shop's closed.

346
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,011
Hey, I got-- I got cash, man.
I got money.

347
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:45,496
I got money. You name the price.

348
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,222
Here.

349
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,127
We do this, I never want
to see your face again.

350
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:57,818
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can...Yeah.

351
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,096
Uh, yeah, I can live with that.

352
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,099
Meet me out back in ten minutes.

353
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:10,486
All right, um,
I'm not sure what you're into,

354
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,076
but, uh, I got some options.

355
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,492
I got some old shoes.

356
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:19,875
Huh? Uh... Oh.

357
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,394
I got some old boxer shorts.

358
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:23,810
I was actually looking
for, uh...I know.

359
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:26,123
Something a little more used.
Okay, uh...

360
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:29,436
Oh. Huh?

361
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,507
An Olympic bronze medalist
wore this for two weeks.

362
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:33,993
Never washed. I could
let it go for, uh...

363
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:35,442
$400.

364
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,272
Dude, are you messing with me?
Okay, fine.

365
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:40,516
$350.

366
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,518
Final offer.

367
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:54,082
Oh, come on, man.
Get that away from me.

368
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:56,567
I told you, I had nothing to do
with Commander Davis's death.

369
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,500
We have an eyewitness
who saw you arguing

370
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,364
two days before the murder.

371
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,021
That doesn't mean
that I killed him.

372
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,470
Then what were you
arguing about?

373
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:07,129
And why were you
selling me dirty laundry?

374
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,441
I thought
that's what you wanted.

375
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,339
I was talking about steroids.

376
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,548
What steroids?

377
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:15,482
I don't know
anything about those.

378
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,519
Then why were
you and Davis arguing?

379
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:19,521
Wh...

380
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:24,112
And did I mention that we are
going to charge you with murder?

381
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:26,562
Okay, Coach caught me sneaking

382
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,565
into the locker room and...

383
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:31,567
removing some property.

384
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:33,535
You mean, women's sports bras?

385
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,054
You sure you wouldn't,

386
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:37,021
maybe, just rather
confess to murder?

387
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,609
Okay, look, there's a
whole market out there

388
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:43,855
for people who are really into,
like, unwashed... stuff.

389
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,547
Why?

390
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,135
I don't ask questions.
All right?

391
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:48,377
I'm just an enlisted sailor
and an athlete

392
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,207
trying to make ends meet, so...

393
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,450
I sell the sweaty items
that the athletes leave behind.

394
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,038
Right, but Davis caught you.

395
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,212
And then you killed him.

396
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,593
No. After we argued, all right,

397
00:17:57,697 --> 00:17:59,216
he said if I stopped selling,

398
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,941
he wouldn't turn me over
to the master-at-arms.

399
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,391
Commander Davis gave
me a second chance,

400
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,565
all right,
and I took it.

401
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,463
I closed up shop.

402
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,155
Well, your trunk
looked open to me.

403
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,639
Those were just
some leftovers.

404
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:11,090
All right?
I do most of my sales online.

405
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:13,092
But I shut all of that down.

406
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:17,165
Jerseys, tank tops, socks.

407
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,236
According to these listings,
they've all been worn

408
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,963
by minor celebrities,
musicians or athletes.

409
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,104
And in Kyle's case,
elite Navy athletes.

410
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,106
According to his
transaction history,

411
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:28,969
he made almost
a thousand dollars a month

412
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:31,627
on these things he was
stealing from the locker room.

413
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,974
We are in the wrong business.

414
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:36,218
You think they have
a law enforcement section?

415
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:38,393
What? You would really
sell your stuff?

416
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:40,395
Not everything.

417
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:42,397
I'm sure I have
a few things lying around.

418
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,295
Wow, I'm really learning
a lot about you.

419
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,676
So am I.

420
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:46,987
A little too much.

421
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,369
Why don't we focus on the case?

422
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:51,302
Is Kyle Seward
our killer or not?

423
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:53,062
We don't think so.

424
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,650
As of two days ago,
he closed his seller account.

425
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,100
He was telling the truth.

426
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,584
And we don't have
any hard evidence

427
00:18:57,688 --> 00:18:59,138
connecting him to the murder.

428
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,485
So this was a wild-goose chase.

429
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:02,934
Well, not exactly.

430
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:04,384
See, when Kyle
closed his account,

431
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:06,938
he left behind some, uh,
pretty angry customers.

432
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,217
How angry?
Well, most of them

433
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,597
were one-offs, but there
were definitely some that were

434
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:12,358
a bit more obsessed.

435
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,946
Meet NavyFan92.

436
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,501
After Kyle announced
he was no longer in business,

437
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:19,261
NavyFan92 started sending
hostile messages.

438
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:21,229
They threatened to break
into the locker room

439
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:23,403
and steal the old
socks themselves.

440
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:26,234
Maybe they followed through with
that threat and ran into Coach?

441
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,374
NavyFan92 got a real name?

442
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,444
Working on it.

443
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,170
Then don't let me stop you.

444
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:35,657
Torres.

445
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,073
Hey. Is this a bad time?

446
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,350
Felix?

447
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:42,629
Uh, what's going on?
Are you okay?

448
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,562
Y-Yeah.

449
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,703
I was just thinking about Coach.

450
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,604
Sounds like you're doing
more than thinking.

451
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,122
Where are you?

452
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:56,436
Have you cleared
Coach's name yet?

453
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,611
We're working on it.

454
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,546
What's taking so long?

455
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:04,513
You don't focus on that.
You just tell me where you are

456
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:06,170
and I'll come and pick you up.

457
00:20:09,553 --> 00:20:11,071
Hello?

458
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:19,045
Hey, Kase.

459
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,564
Is that one
of Parker's pastries?

460
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,669
It sure is.

461
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:24,568
I was wondering who all
was gonna go into that box.

462
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,259
Nice of you to take pity.

463
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:28,123
Oh, this is not a pity pastry.

464
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,125
This is a motivation pastry.

465
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,644
It'll be my reward

466
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:34,129
after we figure out
who killed Commander Davis.

467
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,510
Nice.
Mm-hmm.

468
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,753
You find anything
to help us I.D. NavyFan92?

469
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:39,893
Still working on it.
In the meantime,

470
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:42,758
I ran the urine samples
for Felix and Kyle,

471
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,139
but both came back negative.

472
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,589
They weren't using.

473
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,625
And we still don't know
where those PEDs came from.

474
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:50,318
I wish I could help,
but testosterone, metenolone

475
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,423
and methylprednisolone
are all easy to come by,

476
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:55,633
which makes them
impossible to trace.
Mm.

477
00:20:55,737 --> 00:21:00,155
And the only other item in the
dopp kit was this old ribbon.

478
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,262
"Outstanding
participation."

479
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:04,746
I got one of these
in a Fourth of July sack race

480
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,195
when I was nine.

481
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,818
No way to tell
who it belongs to.

482
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:09,785
And the only prints on it
were the commander's.

483
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,615
I hope you like
stale kolaczki.

484
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:15,653
Maybe not so stale.
You get a lead?

485
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:16,827
Yeah.

486
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,207
On NavyFan92.

487
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,658
Still no name,
but I have an address.

488
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,661
Seems our obsessed fan had
their purchases delivered

489
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:25,836
to a mail forwarding service.

490
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:28,528
Warrant come through
on the shipping records?
Uh-huh.

491
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:32,843
The packages' final destination
was a warehouse in Anacostia.

492
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,362
All right, send me the address.
Thanks, Kase.

493
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:35,811
Nice work.
Uh-huh.

494
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:39,574
Mmm.

495
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,336
Anything?
Mm, no lights.

496
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,958
No movement.

497
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:48,721
Those doors are fully motorized
with biometric locks.

498
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,792
Not to mention
I'm seeing security cameras

499
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,345
about every ten feet.

500
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,243
You know, this
place is a fortress.

501
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,694
Oh, maybe
our obsessed sports fan

502
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,490
is into something worse
than used jerseys.

503
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,149
All right, well,
I guess we have first watch.

504
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,266
So, you tap-dance, huh?

505
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,647
Excuse me?

506
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,891
Well, my earlier comments
about your "type"

507
00:22:20,994 --> 00:22:23,238
seemed to hit a nerve.

508
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,654
Made me think that maybe
I should look at more

509
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,207
than your NCIS file.

510
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,210
So you found
my high school yearbook.

511
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:33,628
Didn't realize you were
an all-state champion.

512
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:35,837
Two-time all-state champion.

513
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,529
You do contain multitudes,
Agent McGee.

514
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,361
You look up Torres
and Knight, too?

515
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:43,845
I'm working on it.

516
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:45,985
Might be helpful to know
everybody's hidden talent.

517
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:50,369
Never know when, uh...
when they'll come in handy.

518
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:55,891
Looks like someone's home.

519
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,583
Yep.

520
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:13,357
Excuse us. NCIS.

521
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:18,466
McGee: Hey, stop!

522
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,471
You okay?
Yeah.

523
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:26,405
Nice save.
You are light on your feet.

524
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:31,513
Federal agents!

525
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,657
The hell are we looking at?

526
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,556
Nothing that makes me feel good.

527
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:44,595
Don't come any closer!

528
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,321
This lab is positively
pressurized

529
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,979
with concentrated oxygen.

530
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:52,914
One spark and we all go up
in flames.

531
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,752
I'm serious.

532
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:06,272
Back off.

533
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,343
Take it easy. Easy.

534
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,034
I, uh, I don't know
what's going on here,

535
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:12,658
but I'm pretty sure
no one has to die.

536
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,901
I would rather die
and destroy my work

537
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,869
than give it to your bosses.

538
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:19,285
Your work?

539
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:20,804
Our bosses?

540
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:22,461
Oh, don't play games.

541
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:25,360
I have two advanced degrees
and a brain.

542
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,536
You were sent
by the Chinese government.

543
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:34,749
Credentials say "NCIS."

544
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:37,476
And my fake I.D.
in high school said I was 35.

545
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,960
You need to get
out of here.

546
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:42,929
Otherwise my finger might slip.

547
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:46,485
Look, I can see
that you're, uh...

548
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:48,970
you're some kind
of a scientist.

549
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:51,559
And I can see you're not.
Well, all I'm saying is,

550
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:54,458
instead of making, uh,
premature conclusions,

551
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:55,908
you should do

552
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,980
what scientists
do best: research.

553
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,671
What are you talking about?

554
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:03,432
Look, a simple Internet
search would show

555
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,331
that we are legit agents.

556
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:07,644
I'm not stupid.

557
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:08,921
Any mercenary
worth their salt

558
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:10,854
would have a
backstopped identity.

559
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:13,788
Yeah, that's very true,
but would a mercenary have

560
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:18,482
a personal home page dedicated
to the Spotted Wood Thrush?

561
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,347
What?

562
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,867
You're a bird-watcher?

563
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,834
Hidden talent.

564
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:28,906
I'll give you one search.

565
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,393
Okay. Just type in,
uh, "Alden Parker,

566
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,981
bird man."

567
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,986
Find it yet?

568
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:43,472
Nothing is coming up.

569
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,854
Type "Alden" with--
that's Alden with an "E."

570
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,167
Yes, I got that,
but there's nothing here.

571
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,652
Except a famous ornithologist
Theodore Parker,

572
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,586
but it says here
he died 30 years ago.

573
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,107
Oh, no.

574
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,418
What did you do?

575
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,077
Put it down, put it down.

576
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,565
Please don't kill me.

577
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,471
We've confirmed
that our warehouse scientist

578
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,369
is NavyFan92.

579
00:26:18,473 --> 00:26:19,716
Got an I.D.?

580
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,614
Her real name
is Dr. Astrid Fellowes.

581
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:23,167
Started up her own biomedical
research company

582
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,997
with Silicon Valley
seed money

583
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,378
but whatever she's working on
is being kept under wraps.

584
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:29,760
That explains the secret lab.

585
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:31,451
She doesn't have
a criminal record,

586
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,971
just a PhD in molecular biology.

587
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:36,008
And a master's in paranoia.

588
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:42,014
Okay. The whole
"Chinese mercenary" thing

589
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:43,602
was a big misunderstanding.

590
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:45,604
I'm just gonna apologize
for that and be on my way.

591
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:47,744
Sit down.
There was no misunderstanding.

592
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,643
Look familiar?

593
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,473
Hmm.

594
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:55,821
I've seen those.

595
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:57,477
You bought those.

596
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:58,755
A lot of them.

597
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,757
Along with these
winning-game kneepads,

598
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,655
and these running jerseys.

599
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,726
All from the best Navy athletes.

600
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,003
And you seemed pretty upset

601
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:07,695
when your supply
suddenly got cut off.

602
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:10,732
You threatened to break
into the locker room?

603
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:13,183
So?

604
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:14,978
So maybe you did.

605
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:18,602
And Commander Davis caught you,
so you took care of him.

606
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:21,640
Took care of him?

607
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,440
Wait, is that
what this is all about?

608
00:27:29,544 --> 00:27:32,202
You think I actually
killed someone?

609
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:34,135
Why not? You tried to kill me.

610
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,206
No, that-that
was a mistake.

611
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:39,485
I... I'm not a killer.

612
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:40,762
Or an obsessed fan.

613
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,661
I hate sports.

614
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,766
So, all of this is...

615
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,043
for a friend?

616
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:49,529
They were for science.

617
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:51,704
Weird science.

618
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,810
I am a geneticist
studying DNA.

619
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,571
I'm using elite athlete genomes
as a baseline,

620
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,677
so, naturally, I need samples.

621
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,955
Worn clothing has lots of DNA.

622
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:04,027
Can't you join a medical
study or something?

623
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,787
No, it is not
as easy as that.

624
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:09,653
Genetic research involves
a lot of red tape, regulation,

625
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,172
not to mention the cost.

626
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:14,106
I found a cheaper shortcut.
Someone was already selling

627
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,797
exactly what I needed.

628
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:20,664
What exactly are you working on?

629
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,977
Oh.

630
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:29,638
You won't be working
on anything in prison.

631
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:32,780
Fine.

632
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:39,579
I'm working on a way
to detect genetic manipulation.

633
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:41,098
Uh, that ship has sailed.

634
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:44,550
We've been modifying crop genes
for decades now.

635
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:47,070
I mean, in people.

636
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,800
Go on.

637
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:54,008
The same
gene-editing technology

638
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,665
used to increase plant strength

639
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:01,084
is now being used on humans,
to increase their strength.

640
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,810
Gene doping.

641
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:05,709
It's banned in sports and highly
regulated by governments,

642
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,746
but the trouble is, there's
no way to reliably detect

643
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:10,127
that it is even happening.

644
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,751
U-Until now.

645
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:17,928
I'm developing the first
universal CRISPR test.

646
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:20,966
That's what you were willing
to blow us up for?

647
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:24,003
It would be a scientific
breakthrough worth millions.

648
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:26,281
And you think China
wants to steal it.

649
00:29:26,385 --> 00:29:28,628
I.P. theft
is their national pastime.

650
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:31,597
They have been
after my research for years.

651
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,944
I-I have to protect it.

652
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:35,670
Well, it explains a lot.

653
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,809
Thank you.

654
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:38,777
Like why you'd be
willing to kill.

655
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,055
I didn't kill anybody.

656
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:42,573
You know, for a scientist,

657
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:44,230
you're not giving us
a lot of proof.

658
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,922
Well, I'm not handing
over my research,

659
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:47,268
if that's what you're asking.

660
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:50,685
We're asking for an alibi.

661
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,964
Morning, Kasie.

662
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,138
Hey, Nick.

663
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:56,656
I thought McGee was coming, too.

664
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,039
Yeah, he, uh, had
to take the elevator.

665
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:03,767
Hey, Kase.

666
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:05,251
What you got?
What do you got?

667
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:06,874
I mean, besides a new pimp walk.

668
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:10,015
I got a hairline fracture
on my fifth metatarsal.

669
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:12,120
Killing me all night.
I had Jimmy take an X-ray.

670
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,329
Oh. You want something
for the pain?

671
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:17,298
I got a nighttime cold-and-flu
tablet if you want to feel good.

672
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,887
I appreciate it,
but no, I'd rather

673
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,267
just hear about
our paranoid geneticist.

674
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:22,959
Well, I got
plenty of that.

675
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:24,961
As soon as Fellowes
realized her choice

676
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:26,825
was between an alibi
or the big house,

677
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,310
she gave us access
to her entire research lab.

678
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:30,932
So, was she telling us
the truth?

679
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,313
Mostly.

680
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,142
I can't say
whether foreign governments

681
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,006
were coming after her,
but she was studying

682
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,837
the DNA of elite Navy athletes.

683
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,148
The science is real.

684
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,116
What about her alibi?
Was that real?

685
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:43,876
Unfortunately, Fellowes was

686
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,086
in her research lab
at the time of the murder.

687
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,088
So, not our killer.

688
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:50,400
Uh, a dead end.

689
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,436
So much for sweet rewards.

690
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,510
Torres. Wait, what?

691
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,136
NCIS.

692
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,138
Great.

693
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:05,449
You can remove the cuffs.

694
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:08,004
I think they've cooled down
enough.

695
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,007
So, who wants to go first?

696
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,940
Okay, I was just coming out here
to clear my head

697
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,424
and get some cardio,
the next thing I know,

698
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:15,425
he's all in my face
trying to start something.

699
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:17,737
I did start something.

700
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,325
Finished it, too.

701
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:21,983
Why?
He fought with Coach,
so I fought with him.

702
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:23,502
Okay, I told you I had nothing
to do with what happened to him!

703
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:25,124
Yo, man, get out of my face.
Okay, okay.

704
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:27,816
Hey! Hey!
That's enough, from both of you!

705
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,267
He's lucky I don't
press charges, man!
Stand down.

706
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,131
What's the matter with you?

707
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:34,099
You told me
to channel my emotions.

708
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:35,203
Into running.

709
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,136
Why do you even care what I do?

710
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:41,830
Because I've been
where you are, man,

711
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,937
and I know how hard it is
to ask for help.

712
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,353
I don't want your help.

713
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:50,943
I want you
to clear Coach's name.

714
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:52,358
I need to know he was the man
I thought he was,

715
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:53,877
because if I was wrong
about him,

716
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,223
then maybe he was wrong
about me.

717
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:56,397
Maybe I don't deserve
to be out here.

718
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,157
Maybe I don't belong out here.

719
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:00,470
Don't say that, okay?
Don't-don't go there.

720
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:01,920
You got talent.

721
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:05,406
Doesn't matter. I'm done.

722
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,305
Done with-with you,
with Coach, with all of it.

723
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:10,790
I quit. I quit!
Come here. Come here.

724
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,325
You want to talk?

725
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,431
About?
Felix.

726
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:34,849
He is gonna come around,
you know.

727
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,920
Why do you say that?

728
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:39,095
Well, because you're
a good coach.

729
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:41,028
Said who?
Me.

730
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,927
And Parker.

731
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:47,206
He, uh, seems to think
it's your hidden talent.

732
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:49,243
My what?

733
00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:55,421
Have you seen Parker recently?

734
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:56,560
McGee has.

735
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:58,183
Yeah, about an hour ago. Why?

736
00:32:58,286 --> 00:32:59,839
Well, he hasn't been
at his desk in a while,

737
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:01,013
so I'm thinking
he's about to walk in here

738
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,050
at any minute
looking for answers.

739
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:04,430
Well, we don't have any.

740
00:33:04,534 --> 00:33:06,432
We still don't know
where the PEDs came from

741
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:08,883
and the scientist's alibi
checked out.

742
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,367
No suspects, no leads.

743
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,542
Which is not what
a team leader like to hear.

744
00:33:12,645 --> 00:33:14,544
Even the, uh,
type of team leader

745
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:16,925
that makes small talk
and offers pastries?

746
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,099
I contain multitudes,

747
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:19,342
Agent McGee.

748
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:21,551
Pastry, anyone?

749
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:24,485
Nobody seemed to like
the, uh, kolaczkis,

750
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,108
so today, we have concha
from the best Mexican bakery

751
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:30,180
in D.C.,
which is in a gas station.

752
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,182
It's not a bribe,

753
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:33,597
or a test.

754
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:37,118
It's just a...
a hidden talent.

755
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:39,155
I can find the best
international pastry

756
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:40,432
in any town.

757
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:43,262
That's your hidden talent?

758
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:45,299
I didn't say
it had to be useful.

759
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:48,302
Would you rather
I only come in here

760
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,269
to get upset and bark orders?

761
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:51,995
A little.

762
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,997
It's what we're used to.

763
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:56,620
And I get that,
but that's not who I am,

764
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:59,313
so let's work with what we got.

765
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,349
Except we've got nothing.

766
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:02,523
Case is at a dead end.

767
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,076
So we fix that.

768
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,353
Let's take a breath,

769
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,355
take a concha

770
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:08,977
and start
from the beginning.

771
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:11,049
Who wants to go first?

772
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:12,326
I will.

773
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,396
Ooh, I may not have found
our killer,

774
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:15,536
but I earned this.

775
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,158
Mmm.

776
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:19,678
Mm. I have a lead.

777
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:21,438
So we're trying to figure out

778
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,302
who was using the
PEDs, right?

779
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:26,202
But the only way to
figure out who was doping

780
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:28,411
would be to test
every Navy athlete.

781
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:30,275
Yeah, that's a whole lot
of samples to collect.

782
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:32,622
Then I realized we don't
have to collect anything.

783
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:35,487
We already have
everything we need.

784
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,936
Hmm.

785
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,524
Fellowes's DNA research.

786
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:41,148
Our paranoid geneticist
was analyzing

787
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:42,666
shed skin cells.

788
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,048
That means she already
tested every Navy athlete

789
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:48,258
that's been through that locker
room in the last two years.

790
00:34:48,362 --> 00:34:49,432
We should send her
a thank-you card.

791
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:50,571
It's already in the mail.

792
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,124
Because I was able to look

793
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:54,161
through her reports
for signs of doping.

794
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:55,438
You found some.
Yes.

795
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,233
One. So I ran the sample

796
00:34:57,336 --> 00:35:00,132
through the military
database and got a hit.

797
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:03,377
The only athlete
to show signs of PED use

798
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,518
was Petty Officer
Jamie Anderson.

799
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,348
The runner who was killed
in a car accident last year.

800
00:35:09,452 --> 00:35:11,937
Well, before then, Jamie
was using testosterone,

801
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,353
metenolone
and methylprednisolone.

802
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:17,322
The same drugs we found
in Coach Davis's office.

803
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:19,462
We now have hard evidence

804
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:20,739
that one of his athletes
was cheating.

805
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:22,706
This doesn't look
good for Coach.

806
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,432
Oh, and the Navy's
gonna be pretty pissed

807
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:25,675
when they find out.

808
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:27,642
Yeah, not to mention
Jamie's parents.

809
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:31,025
Or maybe they already knew.

810
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,716
Parker, you got something?

811
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:35,098
Hey, I recognize that look.

812
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,272
That's the same look

813
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,653
Gibbs used to get when...

814
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:41,000
he figured out something.

815
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:43,037
Well, I guess
some things never change.

816
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:50,182
Your son had talent.

817
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:54,186
Jamie still holds
the Navy record

818
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,050
for two events, right?

819
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:58,397
Yeah, he left a legacy.

820
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:02,677
Thanks, uh, for meeting me here
on short notice.

821
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:05,197
But like I said on the phone,

822
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,717
I think we found something
that belongs to you.

823
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:13,447
Sorry. I don't
recognize this.

824
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:16,277
Hmm, that's odd.

825
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,210
I thought it was Jamie's
for sure.

826
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:21,696
I mean, uh, we found it
in the same bag as his drugs.

827
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,698
Excuse me?

828
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:27,012
Jamie was doping.

829
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:30,567
Must be some mistake.

830
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,536
Like I said before,
Jamie would never do that.

831
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:36,297
Well, you also said that you
didn't recognize this ribbon.

832
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:37,471
That's two lies.

833
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:38,817
I'm not lying.

834
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,267
I've never seen that
before in my life.

835
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,234
That's not what your wife said.

836
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:44,650
We have agents
with her right now,

837
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:47,722
and she showed them
another picture of your son.

838
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:54,073
She said Jamie won this
in his first race ever,

839
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,627
and always kept it
for good luck.

840
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,114
That... seems like something
a father should know.

841
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:04,049
How dare you talk
about my son like this?

842
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:06,327
I'm talking about you now.

843
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:09,641
You found out
Jamie was doping,

844
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,159
and you blamed Coach Davis.

845
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:12,091
No.

846
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:13,507
He was a trusted mentor,

847
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,542
a father figure.

848
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,164
But instead
of helping Jamie

849
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:18,236
realize his
potential, he...

850
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,412
...he was addicting him
to drugs. That's...

851
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,554
...that's why you killed him.

852
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:30,455
Hey. Look.

853
00:37:30,558 --> 00:37:33,837
It's a parent's duty
to protect their child.

854
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:35,322
Right?

855
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,394
Yeah.

856
00:37:40,396 --> 00:37:43,191
Yeah, but I didn't.

857
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:45,332
I didn't protect him.

858
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:49,267
Coach didn't give
Jamie the drugs.

859
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,408
I did.

860
00:37:53,478 --> 00:37:55,790
You doped your own son?

861
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:00,933
So Coach was the one
who found out?

862
00:38:01,037 --> 00:38:04,834
A maintenance crew
found Jamie's bag

863
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:08,734
stuck behind an old locker
a few days ago.

864
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:12,117
Coach saw the ribbon
and the steroids,

865
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,430
and he put it together.

866
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,397
Realized what I was
making Jamie do.

867
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:18,434
That's why he called you
that day.

868
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:21,713
Said he was gonna report
the PED use, that...

869
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:24,543
it was only fair to
inform the other athletes

870
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:26,338
who competed against Jamie.

871
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:30,204
Coach was gonna let them
take away

872
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,620
all I have left of my son.

873
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:35,727
So I showed up early
to the locker room

874
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,213
and I begged him, I begged
him to keep quiet.

875
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,666
And when he still refused,
I pulled out the gun.

876
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,461
And I threatened him.

877
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:49,948
It was loaded with blanks.

878
00:38:51,674 --> 00:38:55,402
I only wanted
to scare Coach,

879
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,438
but things got
heated and...

880
00:38:57,542 --> 00:39:00,855
I swear to you,
I did not mean to kill him.

881
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:09,312
I thought sports stories
were supposed to be uplifting.

882
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,314
Well, apparently, not this one.

883
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:13,247
A promising young athlete
pushed to cheat

884
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,768
by an overbearing parent,
a beloved coach dead.

885
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:18,632
Yeah, and my foot is broken.

886
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:21,773
How is that sports-related?

887
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,775
Well, I may never
tap-dance again.

888
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:25,432
You said it was
a hairline fracture.

889
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:26,847
You'll be fine by the weekend.

890
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,367
Yeah, well,
it's still gonna hurt.

891
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,853
That was Felix's CO.

892
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,477
The kid is being busted
down a rank for fighting.

893
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:37,892
That's harsh.
How'd he handle it?

894
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:40,447
I'm worried about him.

895
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,345
Then we still got work to do.

896
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,347
Is this the part
of the sports movie

897
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:45,797
where the coach
gives the rousing speech

898
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,557
to rally the team?

899
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:49,766
I'm not one for speeches,

900
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,976
but I do have another idea
to keep everybody in the game.

901
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,462
Does it involve baked goods?

902
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:58,741
It involves you, Agent Torres.

903
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:05,023
Thank you for coming.

904
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,852
What are we doing here?

905
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:09,303
Well, I wanted to let you know
that, uh,

906
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,478
we cleared
Commander Davis's name.

907
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:14,308
I heard. Thanks, I guess.

908
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,034
You were right about him.

909
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:17,967
He's still gone.

910
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,762
And you're
still here.

911
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:24,732
Right where you belong.

912
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,493
Nah, I can't race without Coach.

913
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:27,977
Well, he believed in you.

914
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,566
Not many people do.

915
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:32,740
That's where you're wrong.

916
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,751
Wait, What's going on?
What are they doing here?

917
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:45,857
Well, they're here
to watch a race.

918
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,412
You and me, right
here, right now.

919
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:50,689
Are you being serious?

920
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:52,346
Oh, yeah.

921
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,865
You know you'd lose, right?

922
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:55,522
Oh, for sure.

923
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,663
But win or lose,
you got to finish strong, baby.

924
00:41:00,906 --> 00:41:02,736
Coach could be cheesy.

925
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:04,669
You're on.

926
00:41:04,772 --> 00:41:07,603
Sure you don't want to join
them? Give them a few pointers?

927
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:09,397
Maybe next time.

928
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,054
What am I missing?

929
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:14,023
Agent Knight here was a college
track star. Division I.

930
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:16,957
Really? You never told us,
this whole time.

931
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,443
Humility is one
of my hidden talents.

932
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:21,893
All right, I need someone

933
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:23,515
to count us off.

934
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:25,897
You want the honors, McGee?

935
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:28,071
Nah. You go.

936
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,730
All right.

937
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,493
On your mark, get set...

938
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:36,839
go!
