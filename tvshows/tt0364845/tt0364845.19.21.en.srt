1
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:08,486
Pastry, anyone?

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,358
I can find

3
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:11,794
the best international pastry
in any town.

4
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:12,925
You're a bird-watcher?

5
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:14,057
Hidden talent.

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,537
Was this in his record?

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,147
No. But we only know his record

8
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,062
from as far back as he was
with the FBI.

9
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,759
We don't know
what he was doing before then.

10
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:22,283
Just thinking if you didn't have
anything to do tonight

11
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:24,241
that maybe you wanted
to go to a wedding

12
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,417
with me as my plus-one.

13
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,028
I'd love to go, yeah.

14
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,203
These are from that, uh,
wedding you went to

15
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:30,682
last month. It looks like

16
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,380
you and Jimmy
had a fun time.

17
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:34,034
Jess, I really like you.

18
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,470
So, there's this
new coffee shop

19
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,124
a couple of blocks from here.

20
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,256
You want to check it out?

21
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,179
Hey there, gorgeous.

22
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:52,617
Damn.

23
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,929
Where'd you go,
you little pecker?

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,284
Hey there, gorgeous.

25
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:12,289
Oh, shake those tail feathers.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

Get, get off!

♪

29
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,797
All I need is the incoming
routing number. See,

30
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,277
I'm filling out disclosure forms
for my job,

31
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,974
and I need to explain
a $10,000 deposit

32
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,542
into my account.

33
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,894
No, it was actually a, uh,
a gift from my former boss.

34
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:38,114
No. No, I do not want to b...

35
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:41,291
I'm on hold.

36
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:44,686
I swear, filling out these
HR forms is a waste of time.

37
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,992
Tell me about it. I have
to disclose that my father

38
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,907
is a foreign spy
and that I can't find him.

39
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,171
Gracias.

40
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,955
McGEE: Knight doesn't seem to
be making much headway either.

41
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,609
She's been on the phone
for 45 minutes.

42
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:56,219
Did you say my name?

43
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:58,003
Oh, we're just saying
that having to list

44
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,179
all your potential
conflicts of interest

45
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,615
is just such a pain in the ass.

46
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,530
Oh.
I didn't think it was too bad.

47
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,185
My dad works
for the NCIS Far East office,

48
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,709
so disclosing his current
contact info was easy.

49
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,537
Then why are you still
on the phone?

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,148
I like talking to my dad.
Oh.

51
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,759
Morning, everyone.
I have those extra HR forms.

52
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:15,760
For who?
For who?

53
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,849
For Agent Parker.

54
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,330
He left a message this morning
saying he needed extra space.

55
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,027
Six-page form wasn't enough?

56
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,207
Okay. Love you.

57
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,434
Dude, this is, like,
60 more pages.

58
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:40,829
How many conflicts of interest
could one man possibly have?

59
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,961
Well, his friend in Philly
is a known felon.

60
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:45,616
Maybe Parker has
other questionable relationships

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,965
he needs to disclose.

62
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,576
Either that or he's dating

63
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,360
the entire
NCIS accounting department.

64
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,057
Oh, come on,
that's a rumor. Right?

65
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,235
Well, clearly there's a lot
about Parker we don't know.

66
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,240
Well, I say we find out.

67
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,764
You can't read his HR forms.

68
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,505
Those are supposed
to be private.

69
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:07,116
Well, then he shouldn't have
left them in the public.

70
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:12,861
Oh, whoa! Okay,
I did not touch anything.

71
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:16,168
No, no. A Bandium notification
from Kasie.

72
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,779
Well, why so loud?

73
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,041
Probably 'cause
it says "emergency."

74
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,999
Well, that can't be good.

75
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,523
McGEE:
Hey, Kase.

76
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,002
Got your message.
Yeah, your very loud message.

77
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:26,222
Sorry. Emergency Bandiums

78
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,224
override
internal volume controls.

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,094
So, what's the emergency?

80
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:32,010
Ah. This.

81
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,403
These photos were emailed

82
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,275
to the NCIS tip line
this morning.

83
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,928
Did these birds commit a crime?

84
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,408
Uh, no, but someone did.

85
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,282
Well, that's creepy.

86
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,022
It gets even creepier.

87
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:46,416
Whoa.

88
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,946
Are these real?
Uh, I already confirmed
the image data integrity.

89
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,166
These photos have not
been altered in any way.

90
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,255
McGEE:
So this kidnapping
actually happened.

91
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,691
So, who's our victim?

92
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,171
Yeah, and who sent these photos?

93
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,739
Still tracing
the anonymous email,

94
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,958
and facial recognition hasn't
come back on the jogger yet.

95
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,003
Anything
on her license plate?

96
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,744
I was only able to get

97
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,441
a partial number.
I'm running

98
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:12,442
against make and
model now to get a...

99
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,184
Oh, there it is.

100
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,013
The vehicle is registered

101
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,754
to a Vivian Kolchak.

102
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:22,147
Same hair, same face.
That's our jogger.

103
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,019
What's the emergency, Kasie?

104
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,281
Whoa.

105
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,501
What's she doing up there?

106
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,200
What, you-you
know this woman?

107
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:33,289
Does this have something to do
with my disclosure forms?

108
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,159
We didn't touch those.

109
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,770
Yeah?

110
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,468
Then why is my ex-wife
on the screen?

111
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:49,436
Thanks, Janet.
If you hear from her,

112
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,046
let me know right away, okay?

113
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,700
Poor guy.

114
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,136
Watching his ex-wife
get kidnapped

115
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,138
really messed him up.
Well,

116
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:57,444
ex or not, he obviously
still cares about her.

117
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,099
Well, here's what
we know so far.

118
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:03,319
Vivian Kolchak, formerly

119
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,626
a special agent at the FBI.

120
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,410
Just like Parker.
Maybe that's where they met.

121
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:10,587
File just says they married
in '97, divorced in '05,

122
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:13,285
citing
irreconcilable differences.

123
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:14,896
Well, that could mean anything.

124
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,767
Well, after the divorce,
Vivian left the FBI

125
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,073
for a job
at the Defense Department,

126
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,988
where she is now...

127
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:23,557
the head of the Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena Task Force.

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,949
That sounds like UFOs.

129
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:26,516
It is UFOs.

130
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,778
They investigate
reported sightings.

131
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:28,910
It's the real deal.

132
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,564
It's very X-Files.

133
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:33,349
You think Parker married
the real-life Agent Mulder?

134
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,134
Might explain why he needed
those extra disclosure forms.
I confirmed

135
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,441
that Viv's cell phone is off
and nobody's heard from her.

136
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,182
We need to find her, like, now!

137
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,575
McGEE:
Well, we, uh...

138
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:43,751
we don't have a lot
to go on so far.

139
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,056
According to Kasie,

140
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,058
the kidnapping photos
are a dead end.

141
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:48,451
McGEE:
Yeah, no identifiable landmarks,

142
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,019
and the metadata
has been erased.

143
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,848
So we don't know when or where
the actual crime took place.

144
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:57,373
And the sender used
a burner email address

145
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,680
and a secure VPN,
so no way to backtrace.

146
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:01,421
- So, what dowe know?
- Well,

147
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,248
we know that whoever sent
those photos

148
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,425
wanted you to see them.

149
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,514
I mean, clearly
they-they know you.

150
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:10,299
Bird-watching, ex-wife, NCIS.

151
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,127
Why send them at all?

152
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,781
Obviously to taunt you.

153
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:17,088
Any enemies you'd like
to disclose, Parker?

154
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:20,875
It's a long list, so let's focus
on finding the crime scene.

155
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:23,181
Maybe the kidnappers
left something behind

156
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,661
we can use to trace them with.

157
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,576
Do you know
where Vivian likes to run?

158
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,535
No, but knowing her,
she probably told someone.

159
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:30,928
She may spend
most of her time

160
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,539
staring up at the sky
looking for little green men,

161
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,671
but she's also very practical.

162
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,847
Okay, the phone records
just came through.

163
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,459
Vivian's last call
was this morning

164
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,591
to a Fairfax Senior Living Home.

165
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:44,420
You got to be kidding me.

166
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,030
Does Vivian have
family there?

167
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:49,120
Not exactly.

168
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,209
So, your ex-wife
still calls your dad?

169
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,428
Viv's a people person.

170
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,517
This place
is nicer than mine.

171
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,519
Well, my brothers and
sisters all have careers

172
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,564
that take them
around the world,

173
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:59,391
so I offered
to move Dad in here.

174
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,350
I'm sure he appreciates it.

175
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:04,745
He appreciates that I come over
once a week for a game of Risk.

176
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,661
Is that the one where
you conquer the world?

177
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,663
Dad likes to go to war.

178
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,624
Is there a problem?
Look,

179
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,321
I love my dad, but
just a heads-up,

180
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,410
we don't always get along.

181
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:20,587
This is all your fault.

182
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,111
You never should've
let Vivian get away.

183
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,069
What does our divorce have to do
with her being kidnapped?

184
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,071
I don't know, Detective.
You tell me.

185
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,683
Dad, we just need to
know what Viv said

186
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,293
when she called
this morning.

187
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,251
She asked if she could drop off

188
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,949
some fresh pecan bars.

189
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,733
I said hell yes.
You know that woman

190
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,387
- can bake.
- Yeah.

191
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,736
But I don't know why
she still bakes for you.

192
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,869
Because she's a damn saint.

193
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,261
- Mr. Parker...
- And divorcing her

194
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,915
was an affront to God.

195
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,395
Mr. Parker,

196
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:47,570
are you saying that Vivian

197
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:49,311
was actually here this morning?

198
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,182
Yeah, i-it's Roman. And yeah.

199
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,663
She, uh,
she dropped off the pecan bars

200
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,709
right before I went
to hot yoga at 8:00.

201
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,929
Well, did she say anything?
Was she acting strangely?

202
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,627
Pecan bar, hon?

203
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,367
Uh...

204
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:05,719
I suggest, uh,
one of the chewy edge pieces.

205
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:06,981
Uh, thank you.

206
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,504
Yeah.

207
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,461
Uh, by the way,
did you know my son

208
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,725
is an ex-con?Dad.

209
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:15,555
You know, he may have mentioned
that he went to juvie once,

210
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,121
but that was a long time ago.

211
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,253
I'll never forget it.

212
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:19,689
Clearly.

213
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,125
And I think
that's all in his past,

214
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,126
because look at your son now.

215
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,389
He is a NCIS agent.

216
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,217
Oh, NCIS.

217
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:29,177
He could've joined the real Navy
if it wasn't

218
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,787
for that criminal record.

219
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,747
The only Parker who
never wore the uniform.

220
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,749
So, you're Navy?
I was.

221
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,012
Three tours on the
USS Garrett County.

222
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:40,928
Mm. A whole military family.

223
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:43,234
No wonder you need
extra disclosure forms.

224
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,758
Oh.

225
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,499
Guess he didn't
tell you. Figures.

226
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,545
Coming here was a mistake.

227
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,808
What are you...
What did I say?

228
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,549
It's what
you're not saying, Dad.

229
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,333
We just need to know
if Viv said anything

230
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,248
about where she was going
or what she was doing.

231
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,249
Well, why didn't you ask?

232
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,816
I've been trying to!

233
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,775
Not hard enough.
Because I would've told you

234
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,559
that Viv said she was going
for her usual run

235
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,821
near Wyatt Lake.

236
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,739
Um, thank you.

237
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,266
See you on Sunday for Risk!

238
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,184
We got tire tracks.
We got a water bottle

239
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,491
and a towel,
but nothing to tell us

240
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,798
who took your ex-wife.
Or where they took her.

241
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,801
Any luck
in your neck of the woods?

242
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:30,455
No sign of our bird-watcher

243
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,805
or where he took
the photos from.

244
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,545
Copy. Keep looking.

245
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,504
McGEE:
Based on the angle

246
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:36,244
of the camera,
definitely say

247
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,637
we're getting close.

248
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,857
Your dad was Navy, right?

249
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,991
Oh, loud and proud.
Sometimes very loud.

250
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:47,995
So, did he get angry
when you didn't join?

251
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,997
You still thinking about
what Parker's dad said?

252
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,609
You know,
he eventually got over it.

253
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,525
Think, uh, joining NCIS
actually helped.

254
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,180
Well, I don't think that's
the case with Papa Parker.

255
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:02,052
I think his son joining NCIS
actually made things worse.

256
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:05,447
Hmm. Well,
I can definitely understand

257
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,753
Parker not saying anything.

258
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,060
You know, I think we
may have something here.
Hmm.

259
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:11,845
Someone made a
shooter's nest.

260
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:16,719
McGEE:
Oh, this is definitely

261
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:17,981
where the photos
were taken from.

262
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,243
Looks like our bird-watcher

263
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,071
had a seed habit.

264
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,509
Found our photo spot.

265
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:27,687
Got some chewed-up
sunflower seeds, too.

266
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,645
The seeds. Salted
or unsalted?

267
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,387
I did not taste them.

268
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,433
Why?
Bag and tag everything.
Torres, take the lead here.

269
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:36,870
- Hey, you all right?
- No.

270
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,872
I won't be until we find Viv.

271
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,751
I just want to know

272
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,535
how many dates constitutes
a relationship.

273
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,495
One? Two? 20?

274
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,453
Filling out
your disclosure forms?

275
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,848
No. Not me. I am...

276
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,546
asking for a friend.
Right.

277
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,374
Well, in that case,
tell your friend

278
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,159
I think it's more
about the quality of dates

279
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,117
than the quantity.

280
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,771
Talking about your coffee
dates with Jimmy?

281
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:12,601
No, we're talking about...
Wait.

282
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:14,777
How do you know about
our coffee dates?
Hmm?

283
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,083
Little birdie told me.

284
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,694
A little birdie
of the genus Palmer?

285
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,695
Ooh.

286
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,392
What do you got, Kase?

287
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,394
A DNA match to the
sunflower shells

288
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:26,746
you guys found yesterday.
Well, that was fast.

289
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,138
Because our bird-watcher
was in the system

290
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,967
as a government employee.

291
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:34,101
Meet former FBI Special Agent
Frank Ressler.

292
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:35,929
According to his file,

293
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,322
he was fired last year
for taking bribes.

294
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,803
Well, looks like he graduated
from fraud to kidnapping.

295
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,718
Former FBI.

296
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,633
Maybe he has history
with Parker.

297
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:48,811
Says here
they used to be partners.

298
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,901
Why would his former partner
kidnap his ex-wife?

299
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,774
Yeah, that's a good question.

300
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,993
I'll send the address.

301
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:05,654
Take the back.
We'll go through the front.

302
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:06,960
So, how long were you partners
with this guy?

303
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,963
Too long. Let's move.

304
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,139
McGEE: NCIS!

305
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,925
Vintage Mercedes.

306
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:16,926
Vivian's car.

307
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,931
House is clear.
The trunk.

308
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,992
We've got blood.

309
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,613
That your former partner?

310
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,009
Yep. What's left of him.

311
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,717
High-end camera equipment,
sunflower seeds.

312
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,720
Looks like Frank Ressler is
our bird-watcher.

313
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,722
Which also makes him
one of our kidnappers.

314
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,506
So where's our
missing ex-wife?

315
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,247
Parker's still processing
the house.

316
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,249
There's no sign of Vivian
or the second kidnapper.

317
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,034
Ski Mask Man.Yeah.

318
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,732
Bullet to the back.
I'm thinking Ski Mask

319
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,429
double-crossed
his partner in crime.

320
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,910
Speaking of bad partners,
I heard that our victim here

321
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,651
used to work with Parker
at the FBI.

322
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,435
That's what Parker said.

323
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,611
He hasn't said much else.

324
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:36,049
Not since he left the park
in a hurry yesterday.

325
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,442
What, you think he knew Ressler
chewed sunflower seeds?

326
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,836
Unsalted sunflower seeds.

327
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,838
Are we thinking that
Parker came here

328
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,926
to confront his ex-partner?

329
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,233
You thought right.

330
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,278
I did come here last night.

331
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:51,542
So what exactly happened
after you came here last night?

332
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,501
Nothing, because he wasn't home.

333
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,458
And Vivian's car sure as hell
wasn't in the driveway,

334
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:55,242
so I left.

335
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,027
And what time was that?

336
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,551
I don't know, Jimmy. Why?

337
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,553
Because body temperature
tells me he died

338
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:04,555
about 10:00 p.m. last night,

339
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,602
which is, obviously,
after you left, right?

340
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,125
Obviously.

341
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:15,305
All right, yes, I had a hunch
about the sunflower seeds,

342
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,742
but it was a long shot,
so I wanted to check it out

343
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,745
before dragging all of you
into yet another chapter

344
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,269
of my sordid history.

345
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:25,228
Well, Parker, we're reading
that chapter now.

346
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,013
Yeah, why would
your former partner

347
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,058
want to kidnap your ex-wife?

348
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:31,887
Let's just say
after he was fired,

349
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,062
we had a falling out.

350
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,282
Over what?

351
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,937
Over me getting him fired.

352
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,768
The FBI was shocked to learn
of Vivian's abduction.

353
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,683
How can we help
NCIS find her?

354
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:48,034
Appreciate the offer,
Deputy Director Sweeney,

355
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,384
but right now
we're just asking that

356
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,689
all local
and federal agencies

357
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,256
keep an open line
of communication.

358
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,650
And in that spirit, please,
pass along my sympathy

359
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:56,956
to Agent Parker.

360
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,002
I know he and Vivian were close.

361
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,004
We still are, Chief,
because she's still alive.

362
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:05,660
Agent Parker, my apologies.
I misspoke.

363
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,618
Yeah, not the first time.

364
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:11,057
As I recall, you accidentally
fired me for doing my job.

365
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,797
Oh, that was no accident.

366
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,930
Your job was to bring
Agent Gibbs to Justice,

367
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,410
not let him disappear
in Alaska.

368
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,238
Gentlemen, perhaps
we should discuss

369
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:20,936
the firing of our murder victim.
Agent Ressler?

370
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,633
I'd be happy to, Director.

371
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,592
The FBI takes pride
in ridding itself

372
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:27,725
of corrupt agents.

373
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,032
The last case Special Agents
Parker and Ressler

374
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,295
worked together was
a fraud investigation.

375
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,559
A U.S. senator was using
his security briefings

376
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,040
as insider information
to buy stocks.

377
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,215
Turns out he was
buying my partner,

378
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,825
so I blew the whistle.

379
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:43,350
Agent Ressler was caught
destroying evidence

380
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:46,048
in exchange for hush money,
which was never found.

381
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:48,746
So he avoided prison,
but after Ressler was fired,

382
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,575
his life quickly fell apart.

383
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,491
Messy divorce.
Oh, bankruptcy.

384
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,841
He blamed it all on me.
He wrote threatening letters,

385
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,408
left constant messages.

386
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,846
He also filed a costly
defamation suit against you.

387
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,153
Now that he's dead,

388
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:05,241
it all conveniently goes away.

389
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,071
Deputy Director,
are you accusing

390
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,204
one of my agents of murder?

391
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,250
Oh, I misspoke again.
I'm simply saying that,

392
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:16,426
given Agent Parker's history
with the victim,

393
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,211
he should be on the list
of suspects.

394
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,387
At the top, I'm sure.

395
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,084
If NCIS can't see this,
perhaps the FBI

396
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,782
should take over
this investigation.

397
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:28,656
I assure you,
NCIS will pursue all leads.

398
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,179
We'll be in touch.

399
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,010
I should have warned you
he has trust issues.

400
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,013
He's also got a point.

401
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,885
Director, if you think
for one second that I killed...

402
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,627
No, Parker, I don't.

403
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,934
But I do think you're
too close to the case.

404
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:48,980
Ex-wives, ex-partners.
Parker, I have no choice.

405
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,070
I have to send you home.

406
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,813
I know.

407
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,989
But I'm not gonna stop
looking for Vivian.

408
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,209
I know.

409
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,476
I can't believe that Parker
never told us

410
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,305
that his ex-wife is
a paranormal investigator.

411
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,655
And apparently, his whole family
is in the Navy.

412
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,135
I mean, these are
the sort of things

413
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,702
we should know
about a teammate.

414
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:18,488
We can't all be open books,
Dr. Palmer.

415
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:22,405
Perhaps keeping secrets is
another of his hobbies,

416
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:26,888
like bird watching
or pastry buying.

417
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,369
I heard that
he also gardens.

418
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,762
Apparently, he's been
trying to clone

419
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:34,025
Kasie's pomato plant
for the last month

420
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,419
in his rooftop greenhouse.

421
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:37,986
That does not sound real.

422
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,901
Exactly. We don't know
enough about him.

423
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:42,904
Well, I just learned today
that Dr. Mallard moonlights

424
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,645
as a refrigerator repairman.

425
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:47,430
It's one of my many skills.

426
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:50,390
Yeah, the compressor
went out on 106.

427
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:51,434
He's the only one that
knows how to fix it.

428
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:52,696
Ah.

429
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,828
Despite my leaving

430
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:55,873
specific instructions.

431
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:58,093
This time, I was in the middle
of an autopsy.

432
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,486
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,488
An autopsy I'm about
to get an update on?

434
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,273
Right. Frank Ressler.
He was killed with

435
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:06,754
a single nine-millimeter slug
that punctured

436
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,059
his lung and
his pulmonary artery.

437
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,713
Kasie has the bullet?

438
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,193
Yeah, along with
the tissue I pulled

439
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,760
from underneath his fingernails.

440
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,196
Here, look at this.

441
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,764
These bruises on his forearm

442
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,113
appear to be defensive wounds.

443
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,810
So he fought with his killer.

444
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:22,509
Yeah. Hopefully we can
get a hit on that DNA.

445
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:25,512
Well, that is very good work.

446
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,081
Ah, I see you are, uh, starting
on your HR forms already.

447
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,388
Oh. Uh, yeah,
yeah. Hey, funny

448
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,825
you should mention
that. Um...
Uh...

449
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:39,178
Why is Jessica Knight listed
as a workplace relationship?

450
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,572
I was gonna talk
to you about that

451
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,270
before I submitted
those forms.

452
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,314
When?

453
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,232
How about now?

454
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,324
Director Vance.

455
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:58,197
Yes, yes, I heard that.
Um...

456
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,286
To be continued.

457
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,986
Well, that's one
of your problems fixed.

458
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,336
Anything else?

459
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,994
I'm telling you,
Vivian's car is a dead end.

460
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,039
No DNA, no fingerprints.

461
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,954
Certainly not a GPS tracker.

462
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,217
Not even an after-market one?

463
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,220
Vivian still uses
a cassette player.

464
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,918
Oh, we got Aretha and Bowie
and Frank.

465
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:26,268
Zappa, not Sinatra.

466
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,269
Kase, you gotta
give me something.

467
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,010
It's about 24 hours

468
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,229
since Vivian was taken,
and we got nothing.

469
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,361
Oh, not true.
We have these.

470
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,670
Wood shavings?

471
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,759
I found them in
the driver's-side footwell.

472
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,804
Okay, maybe Parker's not
the only one with hobbies.

473
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,285
Maybe Vivian could be
into woodworking.

474
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,592
Oh, no, I doubt
these came from Vivian.

475
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:49,378
The rest of the car is
meticulously detailed.

476
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,119
Not so much as a crumb
between the seats.

477
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,077
Okay, so they were left
by a kidnapper.

478
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,905
Can you trace the wood?

479
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,560
Mass spec is still analyzing,

480
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,562
but it looks
pretty common to me.

481
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,999
No tracing, no help. Ooh.

482
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:02,870
Could that be some help?

483
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:05,438
Uh, maybe.

484
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:08,702
It's a DNA match to the tissue
Jimmy found on the body.

485
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,181
That seems kind
of fast, again.

486
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:13,010
Uh, because again, the match is

487
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,708
to a government employee.

488
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,623
Oh. More dirty FBI agents?

489
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,495
Uh, not FBI.

490
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:25,458
Parker?
It's gotta be a mistake.

491
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,634
Uh, yeah. I'll-I'll
double-check the report.

492
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,249
It's not a mistake.

493
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,860
The DNA found under
the murder victim's fingernails

494
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,863
belongs to... Agent Parker.

495
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,344
So what now?

496
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,955
Now we call Vance,

497
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,870
and bring in Parker
for questioning.

498
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,274
Oh, it's a nice neighborhood.

499
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,884
Given Parker's hobby habit,
I would have thought

500
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,277
he'd live in a place
with a garage.

501
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,148
Or a basement.

502
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,454
According to this,
his apartment's

503
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:07,891
on the top floor.
So just to be clear,

504
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,676
we don't think he actually
did this, right?

505
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:13,070
Kill someone in cold blood?
Absolutely not.

506
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:16,987
Well, he did admit to
going to the house last night.
That's true.

507
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,903
And, uh, his DNA was underneath
the victim's fingernails.

508
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,906
Also true.

509
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,214
So maybe the ex-partner was
home, and they fought.

510
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:27,476
Could have been self-defense.

511
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,740
But Parker wouldn't lie
to us about that.

512
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:31,524
Right?

513
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,224
I hope not.

514
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,671
Oh.

515
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,891
Hey, the gang's all here.

516
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,893
We need to talk.

517
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,678
I was just thinking
the same thing.

518
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,725
Park...

519
00:22:58,768 --> 00:22:59,900
who is it?

520
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:02,337
Is that...

521
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:07,734
Everybody, this is
my ex-wife Vivian.

522
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:19,180
We can talk in here.

523
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,531
So you do have a greenhouse.

524
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,577
My little oasis.

525
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,274
I'd ask you to sit
and relax, but, uh...

526
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,537
When did you find Vivian?

527
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,452
And when were you
gonna tell us?

528
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:34,456
I can help explain that
after I make myself a drink.

529
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,633
Ginkgo and mint, please.
Over here.

530
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,809
Given that I was drugged
and held prisoner

531
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:43,987
for the last day, I need
something to clear my head.

532
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:45,772
So if you were held prisoner,
how'd you end up here?

533
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:48,557
I was able to escape
this morning.

534
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,210
Whatever it was they
injected me with

535
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:50,603
started to wear off.

536
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,256
Must have been
some kind of benzos.

537
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,997
Should you be drinking?

538
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,479
Alcohol? No.

539
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:00,090
A mix of hot water
and GABA inhibitors?

540
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,527
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Okay...

541
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,006
How did you get away?

542
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,486
Well, in my
drug-induced haze,

543
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,183
all I can remember
are blurry flashes.

544
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:09,491
I'm sawing of my bindings
on a broken sink.

545
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:12,015
Kicking out a vent,
and then, uh,

546
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,843
making a run for it
through a patch of trees

547
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:16,324
until I was finally able
to make it to a road.

548
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,413
She flagged down
a passing driver,

549
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,023
and then used their phone
to call me.

550
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:23,462
Yeah, Parker's the only person
I knew I could trust.

551
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,811
We've been through
a lot together.

552
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,943
For better or worse.

553
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,642
Parker, why didn't you call us
about any of this?

554
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:32,340
Things happened fast.

555
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,863
We just got here
when you showed up.

556
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:34,864
Why, is there some kind
of problem?

557
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,738
Yeah, there is.

558
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,131
We need you to come with us
back to NCIS.

559
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,220
Vance took me off the case.

560
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,310
Not coming in as an agent.

561
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:48,051
Coming in as a murder suspect.

562
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,098
Park?

563
00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,933
This is a joke, right?

564
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:01,891
Wish it was.

565
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,330
We couldn't do this
in the conference room?

566
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:07,854
This chair is uncomfortable.

567
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:10,160
Same chair as over here.

568
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,380
No, it isn't.

569
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:15,165
Your DNA was found
under the victim's fingernails.

570
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,126
Would you care to explain that?

571
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,394
Wish I could.

572
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,875
What happened when you went
to Frank Ressler's house?

573
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:31,704
I knocked on the door.
He wasn't home. I left.

574
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:34,141
My story isn't changing, fellas.
It's the truth.

575
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,969
And the DNA?

576
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:39,320
We all know how easy it is
to get this.

577
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:41,148
All somebody had to do
is go through my trash.

578
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,584
I'm being framed.

579
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:45,500
That explains why
the kidnapping photos

580
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,676
were sent to NCIS
in the first place.

581
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,549
To taunt me and to create
a motive for murder.

582
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,420
Well, I'd say it worked, then.

583
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,813
Well, that part maybe,

584
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:56,337
but not cleaning
the victim's fingernails?

585
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,730
Do you really think
I'm that stupid?

586
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,692
No, we don't.

587
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,694
McGEE:
But a jury might.
That's why we need to

588
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:07,522
find the evidence
to prove you're innocent.

589
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,872
Parker, you have any idea
who might be doing this?

590
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:13,572
No, but I have an idea why
they might be doing this.

591
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,663
May I?Yeah.

592
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,536
Everybody involved
in this case

593
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,756
has one thing in common, right?

594
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,714
All are former FBI.

595
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:28,587
They took Viv, killed Frank
and framed me.

596
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,894
It's gotta be connected
to our time in the Bureau.

597
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:33,940
Okay, how do we find out?

598
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:36,682
We pull my old case files
and we look for a connection.

599
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,945
And how do you plan
to get those files?

600
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:41,687
If I ask the FBI for help,
they'll want to know why.

601
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,906
Right. And then you'd
have to say that

602
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,430
I'm officially a murder suspect,

603
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,737
and NCIS would have
to turn over this case.

604
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,739
As it is, I should have
called Justice

605
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:53,176
the minute your DNA
showed up on the victim.

606
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,484
And why didn't you, Director?

607
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,791
Seems I've lost
their number for now.

608
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,709
And how much time might we have
until you find it?

609
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,626
Forty-eight hours.

610
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,410
So I suggest
you find another way

611
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:10,846
to access those files.

612
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,326
Quickly and quietly.

613
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,763
You know what?

614
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,592
We might have someone who can
access that FBI database.

615
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:23,685
After you escaped,
you called Parker from here.

616
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:27,428
The question is
where did you escape from?

617
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,822
Vivian.

618
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:33,303
I'm sorry, my brain is still
a little scrambled.

619
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:36,959
My ex-husband is being
interrogated for murder.

620
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:40,223
I-I should be in there.
I am a federal agent.

621
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:43,052
Yeah, well, you investigate
UFOs, not murders.

622
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:47,056
I investigate the unexplained,
and this counts.

623
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,884
Look, I just want to help Park.

624
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:51,495
You know, for a divorced couple,
you're still pretty close.

625
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,888
Yeah.

626
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:54,542
Why did you break up?

627
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,892
He left his dirty socks
on the floor.

628
00:27:58,764 --> 00:27:59,765
Listen, there are some things
that even a happy marriage

629
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,505
can't survive,

630
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,507
and I would really rather
not get into it.

631
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,466
Right now, Vivian,
the best way

632
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:07,337
for you to help Parker
is by helping us.

633
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,253
Starting with finding out
where you were being held.

634
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:13,213
Close your eyes and try
to picture where you were.

635
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,345
I know how this works.

636
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:19,001
Anything can help.
Colors, shapes, feelings.

637
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,265
I, um...

638
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:27,270
I remember feeling trapped,
like-like an animal.

639
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,359
Maybe because it smelled like
a dirty animal cage.

640
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,666
What kind of cage?
Dog cage?

641
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,889
Um, no. Like a, a hamster,
because...

642
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,368
The kind that have, like,

643
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:39,674
those little wood shavings.

644
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,285
We found wood shavings
in your car.

645
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,809
We're not looking
for a wood shop.

646
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:46,812
We're looking for a pet shop.

647
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:51,033
Anything?
Yeah.

648
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:53,035
There's an abandoned
strip mall that used to have

649
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,689
an old pet store.

650
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,082
That could be where
they were holding me.

651
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,257
Only one way to find out.

652
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,954
Thank you.

653
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:06,527
Wow.

654
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,878
This reminds me of the botanic
gardens in Glasgow.

655
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:12,620
Well, the director asked us
to keep a low profile, so...Yeah.

656
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,796
Yeah, a very wise decision.

657
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,669
Especially given this.

658
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:21,890
Every FBI file that mentions

659
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:24,327
Special Agent Alden Parker.

660
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,547
Mm. Nice work, Duck.

661
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,856
As NCIS historian,
I couldn't access data

662
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,640
from outside agencies,

663
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:36,557
but my counterpart at the FBI
was most helpful.

664
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,820
All it took was a glass
of Montrachet

665
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,561
and a little persuasion.

666
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:41,518
He owed you one?

667
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,346
She did.

668
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,001
Dating within one's
professional circles

669
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,568
has its perks.

670
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:48,961
Duck, you got a girlfriend?

671
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:52,312
At my age, who needs labels?

672
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:54,880
HR, apparently.

673
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:56,795
I'll get started
on these files.

674
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,187
Federal agents!

675
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,115
Clear.Clear.

676
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,555
Well, this is definitely
where Vivian escaped from.

677
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,125
Unfortunately, no sign of
our kidnapper/killer.

678
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:24,953
Yes, there is.

679
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,655
You gotta be kidding me.

680
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:33,962
Whoever wrote this garbage

681
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,182
signed it appropriately.

682
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,445
- McGEE: "Quoth the raven."
- Get Kasie on the phone.

683
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,447
Hmm.
The flask, Jimmy.
Don't open it.

684
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,535
Code 2 alert.

685
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,885
Biotoxin detected.

686
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,713
This came in the mail today.

687
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,629
It was addressed to Special
Agent Alden Parker and his team.

688
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:50,457
What's it say?
One word.

689
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:56,419
The Raven.

690
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,813
He's back.

691
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:08,257
"Nevermore," quoth the raven.

692
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:10,390
- Same calling card.
- Same block letters.

693
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:12,087
Thankfully, no sign of
the same deadly toxin

694
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,523
he tried releasing
a few months ago.

695
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:16,526
Eh. But our bird is back
with a vengeance.

696
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,312
We're not dealing with
a sane individual.

697
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:22,706
He went to great lengths
to poison half the city.

698
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,708
And now it appears
he blames you

699
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:26,101
for stopping the attack.

700
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,842
He blames me for something.

701
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,018
Kidnapping my ex-wife,
killing my ex-partner

702
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,715
and framing me for
the murder.

703
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,980
If he hates you so much,
why not just, you know,

704
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:37,896
kill you and be done with it?

705
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:41,290
I'll let the, uh, forensic
psychologist answer that one.

706
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:43,814
Well, I'd need to perform
a detailed study

707
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:45,294
to get a proper assessment,

708
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:49,298
but it appears this Raven
takes pleasure

709
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:51,474
in prolonging things.

710
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:53,737
Why bite the lollipop

711
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:56,566
when you can savor it
over time?

712
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,353
Well, if I'm the sucker,
consider me licked. I'm done.

713
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,442
You're not gonna like this.

714
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,226
Skimming through old
FBI files,

715
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,489
I found an investigation
that's still active.

716
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,361
Why? Who's being investigated?

717
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,232
You are.

718
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:13,453
How? They don't know about
my DNA.

719
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:15,759
Not a murder investigation.
It's fraud.

720
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:18,153
Looks like the FBI found
the hush money that your

721
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,241
former partner took off with.

722
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,290
Money is in an offshore
account in the Caymans

723
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,987
that they think
belongs to you.

724
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,250
Believe me, If I had
an account in the Caymans,

725
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,296
I'd be using it
in the Caymans.

726
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,253
I don't know anything
about this.

727
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,125
This doesn't make sense.

728
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:34,561
You're already being
framed for murder.

729
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,606
Why add on a lesser
charge of fraud?

730
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,695
I think that was
the doctor's point.

731
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:41,960
Indeed. Clearly, the Raven
hasn't finished savoring.

732
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,397
Unless we're missing something.

733
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,790
Why are we still talking
about him? We got work to do.

734
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:50,055
In 36 hours, Vance hands
the case over to DOJ.

735
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:51,578
Let's do it.
Stop!

736
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:56,713
Okay, we're handing over
this case right now.

737
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:59,760
What? Why?
Director said that...

738
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,066
And I'm saying that
this has gone far enough.

739
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,676
We all know what
the Raven is capable of,

740
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,677
and you heard the doc.

741
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,766
This guy is not done.

742
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,855
Yeah. That's exactly why
we need to stop him.

743
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,597
Right. He got away the first
time and look what happened.

744
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,860
Yeah, what happened was
Jimmy and Kasie nearly died,

745
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:15,776
and I'm not gonna let that
happen again to any of you.

746
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,386
Parker, we can do our job.

747
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,997
Doing your job doesn't include

748
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,739
taking unnecessary risks
for me.

749
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,090
I'm not Gibbs. Okay?

750
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,746
You don't owe me anything.

751
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:34,621
I appreciate all of you

752
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:35,970
more than you know.

753
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,061
But it's over.

754
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,379
Hey, what are you doing with
Polly the pomato plant?

755
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,076
Parker said to give her back.

756
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,339
So it's true?

757
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,080
He's really turning himself in?

758
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,300
It looks that way.
Meeting with Vance this morning.

759
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,823
Man.

760
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,045
Hey, did we miss the meeting?
What meeting?

761
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,134
The meeting to help Parker.

762
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,570
I mean, if the Raven is back,

763
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,093
he's gonna need our help,
believe me.

764
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,616
I've been thinking about
what Parker said,

765
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,575
and I think maybe he's right.

766
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:16,880
Maybe we've done
everything that we can do,

767
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,578
and we just need
to walk away.

768
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,232
Right.

769
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,363
I mean, it's not like
it's Gibbs, you know.

770
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,061
We don't know him
all that well.

771
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,279
Right.

772
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,935
So why does this feel wrong?

773
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:31,025
He had our backs when
the Raven came back last time.

774
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,853
Jimmy and I know that
up close and personal.

775
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:34,681
He had your backs, too.

776
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:37,162
He risked his life
to save ours

777
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,119
when we were held hostage
on that ship.

778
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:43,820
And Parker risked everything
for Gibbs, too, up in Alaska.

779
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:48,129
You know everything
you need to know about the man.

780
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,349
It's him that doesn't know us.

781
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:51,698
Yeah, thinking that
we'd turn our backs on him

782
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,613
at a time like this.

783
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:56,137
Well, then,
I say we get back to work.

784
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:59,097
Yeah.
All right, let's go update
those BOLOs on the Raven.

785
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,143
I'll keep processing
everything we have.
Hey, Jess, Jess.

786
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,319
Uh, you have one second? Yeah.
Yeah.

787
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,498
What's up?Uh, hey, I just...

788
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:13,154
I wanted to apologize for
listing you on my HR forms.

789
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,895
You're thinking
about your HR forms?

790
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,418
Now?

791
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:17,854
I-I feel like I overstepped.

792
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:19,204
You know, it was...

793
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:23,338
It was just
a couple coffee dates, right?

794
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,299
I don't know.

795
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:31,346
You see, 'cause-'cause
I don't know, either.

796
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,349
I mean, with all the bad
that's happened this year,

797
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:35,524
why deny the good?

798
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:40,355
And we have something good.

799
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,009
Don't we?

800
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,317
Yeah.

801
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,363
But are you saying that
that something good

802
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,191
should be disclosed?

803
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:54,282
Do you think we should find out?

804
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,906
That is definitely
worth disclosing.

805
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,778
I think that we
should do that again.

806
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,693
You know, just-just to make sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,393
Ooh!

808
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,701
Uh...

809
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,529
You guys!

810
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:26,401
I...What happened
to Polly the pomato plant?

811
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,882
It was an accident.
What had happened was...

812
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,536
I-I sneezed.

813
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,233
Wait, hold up.

814
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:33,365
We've got a problem.

815
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,369
There is more in here
than just potatoes and tomatoes.

816
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,024
Is that what I think it is?

817
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,594
Parker's place is bugged.

818
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,857
We found this hidden
inside the pomato plant.

819
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:50,208
Safe bet is they're
all over your apartment.

820
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,557
Who's bugging me?

821
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,819
The FBI.

822
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,429
We did a backdoor search

823
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:55,996
into DOJ records.

824
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,085
Found the warrant.

825
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:00,261
So the listening
devices are legal.

826
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:02,350
Well,
the justification's pretty thin.

827
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:03,830
Obviously, they
pulled some strings

828
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:05,223
to get a judge to sign off.

829
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,268
The FBI wants Parker's head.

830
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,575
And the Raven is handing it
to them on a silver platter.

831
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:13,274
Are you saying that the Raven
is connected to the FBI?

832
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,450
What we're saying is
that if we turn Parker over now,

833
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,104
we're not gonna find out
what's really going on.

834
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:21,674
All right,
I agree. This is bad.

835
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,850
But I'm afraid
it's too little, too late.

836
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:25,765
- We just need more time, Director.
- And I can't

837
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,245
give it to you,
Agent McGee.

838
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,594
I called Justice
this morning.

839
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,073
Call them back.

840
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,031
They've already sent the FBI

841
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:32,293
to take over this case.

842
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:34,252
Deputy Director Sweeney

843
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,383
just signed in downstairs.
Look,

844
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:37,298
I told you this was happening.

845
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,908
Why are you
still trying to help me?

846
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,606
Because you forgot
rules five, eight and 15.

847
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,391
We'll send you a list.

848
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,001
We got to do something
before the FBI

849
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,394
walks through that door.

850
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:58,667
You two, stay here.

851
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,713
You see Parker, cuff him.
Yes, sir.

852
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:06,022
Deputy Director Sweeney, FBI.

853
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,328
I'm here to see the director.

854
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:09,287
Is he expecting you?

855
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:12,377
Deputy Director. Come on in.

856
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:21,255
Can I get you something?
Coffee, water?

857
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,952
The Department of Justice
said you agreed

858
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:24,389
to hand over this case.

859
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:26,086
Along with Agent Parker.

860
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:27,870
And we plan to cooperate fully.

861
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:30,525
Well? I'm waiting.

862
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:33,093
The file boxes are
already packed downstairs.

863
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,269
But as for Agent Parker,

864
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,098
your guess is as good as mine.

865
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:40,361
An extra go bag
with a change of clothes

866
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,928
in case the FBI
has your apartment staked out.

867
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:43,451
And a burner phone.

868
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,105
Untraceable.

869
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,933
Look, I appreciate
what you all are doing,

870
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,717
but, uh, I've never been a fan

871
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,676
of running away
from my problems.

872
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,155
You're not running.
You're just doing your job.

873
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,679
We all are.

874
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:56,203
Starting with that account
in the Caymans.

875
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,248
What, the account
the FBI thinks belongs to me?

876
00:38:58,292 --> 00:38:59,380
Only because
they stopped digging.

877
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,164
I kept looking.

878
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,644
Were you able to trace
the money?

879
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:04,733
Uh, it bounced around
through various accounting firms

880
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:05,647
on the eastern seaboard.

881
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:06,518
Got a list?

882
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,348
Sorry I couldn't
narrow it down more.

883
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,175
Leave that to me.

884
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:15,570
I'll keep digging

885
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:16,571
on my end, too.

886
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,580
Morning, Chief.

887
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,365
Where the hell are you?

888
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:28,235
Well,
I had a little car trouble,

889
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:29,584
but, uh, don't worry.

890
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:31,412
I'm just about to jump
into an Uber.

891
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:33,588
I hope
you're on your way to NCIS.

892
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,416
Well, I got to be honest.

893
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,375
Wasn't the plan.

894
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,289
Running will only
make things worse, Parker.

895
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,856
For you and NCIS.

896
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,467
Not running.

897
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,685
Just doing my job.

898
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:46,471
We'll be in touch.

899
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:51,389
This isn't over.

900
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,527
Well, last chance.

901
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:01,442
Sure you want to help
a fugitive?

902
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,922
Not a fugitive.

903
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,532
Family.

904
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:09,711
Thank you.

905
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:16,979
So...

906
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,416
Same goes for you.

907
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,374
You sure you want to do this?

908
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,550
This Raven
came after me, too.

909
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,770
Whatever bigger plans he has,
I'm already a part of it.

910
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,990
For better or for worse.

911
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,003
We could lose our
jobs for this.

912
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:43,745
Hmm. Or worse.

913
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:45,486
Just like old times.

914
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:53,363
Do you have any idea
where we're gonna stay

915
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,017
on this little sojourn
of ours?

916
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:57,542
I'm guessing that they're
watching my place, too.

917
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:58,673
You remember our honeymoon?

918
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,416
How could I forget?

919
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:07,334
I was thinking that might be
a good place to lay low.

920
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:08,814
Do you know
that I still have

921
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:11,425
that mixtape that you made
for us when we eloped?

922
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,687
Get out of here.
I'm not kidding.

923
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,515
I just saw it the other day.
Wow.

924
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,344
Man, I worked hard on that one.
I remember.

925
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:20,390
I got it right back here.

926
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:24,569
Just saw it the other day.

927
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:26,788
Let's see.

928
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,575
Which one is it?

929
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,186
No, it's not that one.

930
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:35,188
Ah!

931
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:37,320
There it is.

932
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:38,931
Got it?

933
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:40,323
Original sticker and everything.
Oh, my...

934
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:41,803
All right.

935
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,065
Go ahead.

936

runaway... ♪

937
