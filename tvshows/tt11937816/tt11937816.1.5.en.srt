00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,246
There's some things going on here
that are more painful

11
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,790

those fucking cowards gave you.

How long you in for?
I've been here eight years.

Twenty-two to go.

00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,309
Your fairy godmother, Alejandro Guzmán.

18
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,256
Is there any news, or...

19
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,136
So what'd the judge say?

20
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,183
They promised I'd be here two months.
Been almost eight.

21
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,978
Your case isn't easy.
I have little evidence in your favor.

22
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,772
César Lazcano said
it would be two months at the most.

23
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,066
He made a promise.

24
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,777
My momis out there, and she's alone.

25
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,989
She can't visit me
because she gets sicker by the minute.

26
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,282
They didn't tell you?

27

Thanks.

31
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,541
Well?

32
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,087
How long are they gonna keep you?

33
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,171
No idea.

34
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,801
They know I'm an ex-con,
so they'll do whatever they want with me.

35
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,597
- I'm gonna talk to them.
- No.

36
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,975
- What? Álex!
- No, don't interfere. Don't.

37
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,227
I don't want you talking to them.

38
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,561
I'm just trying to help.

39
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,738
Did they hurt you?

40
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
They went straight for Ortega.

41
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,668
I swear, I did nothing. I swear.

42
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,714
I just went to my dad's offices.

43
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,676
I was trying to find the accountant
so I could speak to him, that's all, Álex.

44
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,432
They won't come after you.

45
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,558
No?

46
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,686
How can you be so sure?

47
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,028
Because I'm gonna be your life insurance.

48
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,656
As long as I'm with you,
my family won't do anything.

49
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,118
I've decided.

50
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,470
Oh, I'm so glad you're back.
I've been sleeping alone for too long.

51
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,225
I've been sleeping alone
for too many nights.

The casino, the clients, the new venue.

54
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,369

- No, I like that.

55
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,953
César, keep going. Don't stop.

56
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,456
You gonna call the priest...

57
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,709
- so he can give you permission to fuck?
- I'll take it off.

58
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,254
Yeah, I guess I should carry the guilt
of you burning in hellfire.

What are you talking about?

143
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,706
Someone trapped me inside the sauna.

144
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,584
And they raised the temperature.

145

165
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,570
It was Lorenzo who decorated.

166
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,450
Waitress?

167
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,662
Assistant for a casting agency?
Manicurist?

168
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,039
Now you're making me a little nervous.

169
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,875
A building super, salesperson.
So many jobs!

170
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,794
Why so many professions?

171
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,380
- I'm just versatile, man.
- Hm.

172
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,466
Besides, it's not my fault
people get me fired all the time.

173
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,635
- Some people can be...
- You interested in working?

174
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,012
Yes, I'm interested. Very.

175
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,307
But I want it to be a job that...
that fills my heart

176
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,352
- and fills...
- And what if you were offered

177
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,271
a truly important position?

178
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,231
Like, say something that...

179
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,567
that fills your heart
and fulfills your life?

180
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,987
- Hm.
- What would you say?

181
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,656
Well, I'd accept and devote my mind, body,
soul,

182
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,075
and feel... profoundly happy.

183
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,164
Lorenzo and I would love to offer you

184
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,916
perhaps the most important job
of your life...

185
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,127
and of our lives as well.

186
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,210
Mm-hmm.

187
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,716
That's amazing!

188
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,594
But we haven't told you what it is yet.

189
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,095
Okay.

190
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,265
So, dummy, are you afraid of needles?

191
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,392
- No.
- Or gaining weight?

192
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,019
Oh, come on.

193
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,729
Of having a baby?

194
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,150
Um...

195
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,321
We would you like you to, uh,
carry our child for us.

196
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,824
Lorenzo and I wanna be parents, Clara.

197
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,118
And, well,

198
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,413
all we need now is a woman to help us
by lending us her uterus.

199
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,541
You in?

200
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,629
You mean...

201
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,551
No, no, no! Are you serious?
Are you serious?

202
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,597
- Of course I'll do it! Of course!
- Careful with the glasses.

203
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,183
I can't believe this. I can't believe it.

204
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,936
Wow. Oh, thank you!

205
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,021
Thank you, thank you!

206
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,774
Of course! It's the most beautiful thing
anyone's asked me.

207
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,776
- Of course!
- Let me make this clear.

208
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,903
- You're gonna be compensated for this.
- Yeah.

209
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,863
But first, we have to agree on a price.

210
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,157
Okay, that's perfect, that's perfect!

211
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,701
But you know the best part of all this?

212
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,081
You, and you... we...

213
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,583
are a family as of this moment.

214
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,127
I can't believe it!

215
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,131
A family! A family!

216
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,632
Oh!

217
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,644
- Play it again, please.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,446
Huh? It's great, no?

219
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,533
We have the best casino in México.

220
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,869
Jorge Ortega has passed.

221
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,040
A car hit him last night.

222
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,209
I bet he was drunk.

223
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,878
- What happened?
- No clue.

224
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,507
The point is he's dead,
and we need a new accountant, urgently.

225
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,427
You must have a few candidates.

226
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,388
So, what's the protocol for tonight?

227
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,933
The invited guests arrive,
and we'll keep them at the lobby.

228
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,978
Meanwhile,
go inside so you can meet the press,

229
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,564
and you can welcome them
and visit with them...

230
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,816
I want the girls ready. You got that?

231
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,567
César,

232
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,779
that's a risk we shouldn't take right now.

233
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,823
You know that the clients...

234
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,784
Are you gonna tell me
how to manage my companies, amigo?

235
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,748
I want them to be hotter than ever.

236
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,584
'Cause we're going to close
a shitload of deals tonight.

237
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,480
Excuse me, Elroy?

238
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,898
I was looking for you.

239
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,984
I have the invoice
for Mr. Jorge's funeral arrangements.

240
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,527
Can you approve it?

241
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,157
I still can't believe it.

242
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,160
It was so... out of nowhere.

243
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,829
It was completely useless.

244
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,678
<i>Elroy, you check the cameras?</i>

245
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,765
Elroy, the cameras. Did you look?

246
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,519
- Do you hear me?
- No, they weren't working right.

247
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,233
What do you mean,
they weren't working right?

248
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,694
That's your only... Fuck, Elroy!

249
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,488
We'll have them repaired.

250
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,866
Someone tried to kill me.
Because of you, I don't know who it was.

251
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,163
You should have never been hired.

252
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,623
I want you to look at me.

253
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,457
It was pity.

254
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,002
That's all it was.

255
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,421
Just pity.

256
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,591
Go bathe. You smell like shit.

257
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,624
You can trust me, Sara.

258
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,962
What's up with Don César and you?

259
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,437
- Let's wait one more year.
- No. No, no, no, no.

260
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,149
- I want you to take every damn test...
- Sofía, it's terrible timing!

261
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,525
Today? Seriously?

262
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,236
I want us to have a child together, baby.

263
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,114
It's something I've wanted
since the day we got married.

264
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,827
Plus, I need to know
if you're the one with the problem.

265
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,412
Of course <i>I</i> have the problem.

266
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,999
- It's always my problem.
- No, don't play the victim.

267
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,418
Confront this issue once and for all.

268
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,505
The damn sperm count, just do it!

269
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,841
Help me to know why I can't get pregnant.
Is that too much to ask?

- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

284
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,345
I heard that you talked about Sara
to Elisa.

285
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,016
You said that someone may have tampered
with the harness?

286
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,353
What do you know that you haven't told us,
Elroy?

287
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,814

- Hi, dear. Of course.

00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,192
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Going over business with Elroy.

289

You don't need to worry about a thing.
This is your night. Go out and shine.

290
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,239
You all right?

291
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,244
Don't you forget.

292
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,416

00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,142
You've already helped me enough.

302
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,269
You don't have to come with me
if you don't want.

303
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,397
I'm your life insurance.

304
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,068
Wait.

305
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,405
You know a girl here who goes by Imara?

306
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,658
Imara.

307
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,102
The first thing I'll need to get started
is your father's IP address.

308
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:18,316
Then I need to get into his computer,
introduce some code,

309
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,861
and use inverse engineering,
and I'll get all the info I need.

310
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,491
Aren't you curious
about what I'm planning?

311
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,785
I told you I want to uncover the truth.

312
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,412
Even if it involves your family?

313
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,414
Especially if it involves my family.

314
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,379
When were you gonna tell me
you were leaving for Madrid?

315
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,134
Okay...

316
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,268
Where did you get that information?

317
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,353
I have ways.

318
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,564
Right.

319
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,110
I was accepted to
a master’s program for Neuropsychiatry

320
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,279
at the Autonomous University of Madrid.

321
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,821
Goddamn.

322
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,244
SAVING FILES TO USB

323
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,912
So when are you leaving?

324
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,212
Next month.

325
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,259
But I thought you were gonna stick around.

326
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,478
TRANSFER COMPLETE

327
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,939
Ready.

328
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,734
Yeah? That's it?

329
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,401
No.

330
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,655
Still not finished.

331
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,791
You can't talk to the guests.

332
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,668
Tell them to come to me.

333
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,421
- That clear?
- I'm sorry.

334
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,174
We won't have that issue again,
will we?

335
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,146
Okay.

336
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,275
Okay. Okay.

337
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,820
One, three...

338
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,838
Happy to see you.

339
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,092
Come this way.

340
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,813
And here he is... César Lazcano.

341
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,568
Thank you.

342
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,195
Thank you very much!

343
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,948
Ladies and gentlemen,

344
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,325
what an honor to have you here

345
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,453
on such an important evening
for the Lazcano family.

346
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:21,416
You, our friends of the press,
have been very important,

347
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,168
a key part in the success
of our enterprises.

348
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:29,465
That's why we wanted you to be the first,
before any of the other guests,

349
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:35,555
to enjoy this new and beautiful venue
that I know will bring our town

350
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,224
some magic and much, much pleasure.

351
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,309
It's a very exciting evening.

352
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,604
You're all aware that first impressions
are never forgotten.

353
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,691
That's why we have made a point
to make absolutely sure

354
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,403
that every detail has been taken care of.

355
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,197
I've always believed words
are more than just...

356
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,158
I asked you not to call me.

357
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,372
Now, I have an appetizer.

358
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,584
Some images of what I am certain

359
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,172
will be a great place in our city
for years to come.

360
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,255
Enjoy yourself.

361
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,613
Three, two, one...

362
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,197
Boom!

363
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,661
César, what was that?

364
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,498
What's going on? What happened?

365
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,125
What's this? Stop that video!

366
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,170
Take the video down, now!

367
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:54,092
- Take it down! Don't record this!
- Oh, my God.

368
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,302
No one record this!

369
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,013
Stop the video. Everyone, please, stop.

370
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,064
That's enough!

371
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,525
Elroy!

372
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,608
No!

373
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,862
That's enough!

374
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,113
No. Relax.

375
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,406
Elroy! Hey, man!

376
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,241
Enough! Shut up!

377
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,951
- No, Rodolfo!
- Watch out, Rodolfo!

378
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,414
No more secrets, goddamnit!

379
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,666
- Calm down.
- Shut up, now! Quiet!

380
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,501
No more secrets.
