Almost, Mom<i>.</i>

11
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,807
Everything's going to be all right,
I promise.

12
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,768
We'll get you the transplant...

13
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,063
and then you just
have to try to stay positive.

14
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,897
Hm?

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,443
I'm going to be away
just a couple of months.

16

You won't see me,
but it's for your own good.

17
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,364
This way you can get better, and...

18
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,077
you won't want for anything. At all.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,246

baby, please.

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,590
you won't need to come back here anymore.

00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,471

But where are you going?

26
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,356
It'll only be a couple of weeks.

27
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,442
One month.

28
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,944
Two months, the maximum.

00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,884
This is not a simple case
of involuntary negligence.

34
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:20,014
The death of Sara Guzmán
was a deliberate homicide.

35
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,935
The evidence proves
that the defendant, Alejandro Guzmán,

36
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,313
intended to murder Rodolfo Lazcano

37
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,526
because he impregnanted
Mr. Guzmán's sister.

38
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,320
- Sara was pregnant, Rodolfo? My God.
- Sit down.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,866
The defendant did not
take into account

40
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,826
the fact that his own sister

41
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,164
would be the first person
to go down the parachute harness.

42
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,209
It is the decision of this court
that you serve

43
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,588
a sentence of no less than 30 years.

44
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,298
No! No!

45
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,301
I wasn't involved, sir.
I didn't do anything. Listen to me!

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,178
Rodolfo! I had nothing to do with this!

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,139
César! César, please.
I had nothing to do with this.

48

INVESTMENT 29,880,000

56
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,933
All right. Can't wait to get there.

57
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,936
Sara!

58
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,271
Come on, guys.

59
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,527
I knew you'd make us wait.

60
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,903
Get over here!

61
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,364
Hey, guys! Help me with this.

62
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,866
- Chema.
- Hey.

63
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,909
- What's up?
- Thanks for coming, dude.

64
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,120
- Hello, ma'am.
- How are you guys?

65
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,039
- Fine, and you?
- Good, thanks.

66
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:35,293
Listen, we're so glad that, uh,
Sara is able to come along with us.

67
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,628
Of course.

68
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,797
I'm sure her brother'll look out for her.

69
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,049
Of course.

70
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,010
You're going to be in my room. Ow!

71
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,054
Okay, well, have a great time.

72
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,930
Love you, too.

73
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,183
- Come on, get in.
- Let's go!

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,693
Eighteen years had to go by
before you learned why men have balls?

75
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,870
Come in.

76
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,541
I don't need to come in.
This'll only take a minute.

77
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,377
Come in, asshole.

78
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,145
What do you want?

79
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,775
What, your dad's thugs
couldn't make me go away,

80
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,861
so now you...
you've come to finish the job, right?

81
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,780
Are you armed, asshole?

82
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,863
Of course not.

83
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,492
Álex...

84
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,372
- I understand your anger...
- You don't.

85
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,999
I know all of us made promises
we didn't keep to.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,753
I know that my family failed you
and that you...

87
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,131
you have every right.

88
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,720
I've been forced
to live with the guilt, man.

89
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,973
And I'm full of regret.

90
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,559
And this is when you play the victim, and,
uh...

91
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,270
we both start to cry. Is that right?

92
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,814
We forgive each other.

93
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,650
I tell you it's all right,
and we go back to being friends?

94
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,861
You damn hypocrite.

95
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,779
You were there the day of the trial.

96
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,906
You heard all the lies the judge said
about me,

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,950
and you didn't defend me,
you son of a bitch.

98
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,160
My father...

99
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,621
He promised you money you never got.

100
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,790
Oh...

101
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,667
I remember that very well, too.

102
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,295
How much are we talking?

103
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,088
Oh, wow.

104
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,800
That's a shitload of cash.

105
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,183
Go fuck yourself, asshole.

106
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,019
Fuck you. Get outta my house.

107
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,063
Please just leave my stepson
out of this whole whatever...

108
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,733
- Bruno's not a bad kid.
- What are you talking about?

109
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,860
- Those photos you messaged.
- What photos?

110
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,030
If you didn't message them, who did?

111
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,907
I have no idea, but it wasn't me.

112
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,035
I don't involve children in my plans.

113
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,412
Now get the fuck out.

114
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,165
Get out!

115
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,043
Hey!

116
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,962
You're next on my list.

00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,672
Yeah, guys, she's all set! You good to go?

120
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,347
Rodolfo.

121
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,352
Did you cut those ropes?

122
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,354
What?

123
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,606
Did you cut the ropes on the harness?

124
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,442
Of course not. Parachute was defective.
It wasn't cut.

125
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,028
It was my fault that day
because I never looked.

126
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,281
The parachute wasn't defective,
believe me.

127
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,116
I've spent years investigating it.

128
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,743
The harness was damaged,
and the ropes were cut.

129
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,121
Listen, Sara was murdered.

130
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,332
If it wasn't you,
it was someone in your family.

131
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,502
I know we've been bastards,
but there's no way we're murderers.

132
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,172
- The harness on that parachute was cut.
- No.

133
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,967
And whoever it was, they were there...

134
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,219
on the day that Sara died.

135
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,263
They were on the boat,
or they had access...

136
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,143
There's a monster in every family.

137
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,439
And if you are not that monster,

138
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,566
then someone else is, dude.

139
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,445
It may be painful to hear,
but that monster has your last name.

140
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,365
That person had all of us believing
that it was you who murdered my sister.

141
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,659
He tricked us for all these years,
my friend.

142
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,413
I mean, don't you want to know who did it?

143
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,668
Maybe it's the same person
who sent that photo to Bruno.

144
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,211
<i>Think about it.</i>

Hey!

146
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,055
Do me a favor and tell your sister
to stop spying on me.

147
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,759
<i>No!</i>

148
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,845

Was it you who sent that photo
to Rodolfo's boy?

152
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,388
- <i>Yes</i>.
- Why did you do that?

153
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,559
<i>So you two would finally talk face-to-face
and start to work together.</i>

154
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,561
How did you know we talked?

155
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,523
<i>It was obvious.
You knew about the photo that I sent.</i>

156
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,650
He could've just called me.

157

<i>I just want to help you.</i>

159
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,785
I don't need your help.
Do I know you personally?

160
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,577
<i>Yes.</i>

161
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,080
Did you kill Sara?

162
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,917
Did you kill my sister?

163
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,963
PRIVATE NUMBER - ON LINE

164
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,299
NO CONNECTION

165
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,382
Shit.

166
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,436
HOPE THIS BRINGS YOU GOOD MEMORIES
KISSES, SARA

167
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,521
Well?

168
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,773
You have nothing to say?

169
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,025
No, I...

170
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,403
I don't get it.

171
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,537
I don't know how Álex
would've gotten it back.

172
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,871
It was yours, right?

173
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,414
Yes. So?

174
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,501
Do you think that I would...

175
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:00,506
I can't believe you'd even suggest it.
I know you don't approve of my life, but...

176
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,485
- you're accusing me of something...
- No, I don't approve of your lifestyle.

177
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,718
I think it's perverted.

178
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,802
César.

179
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,432
What's all this?

180
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,059
What are we arguing about now?

181
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,811
Our father's stuck in the 18th century!

182
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,894
Chema.

183
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,649
Were you aware that
Sara was pregnant when she died?

184
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,734
- You didn't know?
- It was Rodolfo's?

185
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,404
- Most definitely not!
- Most definitely yes, Mom<i>.</i>

186
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,864
With Rodolfo's kid.

187
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,033
That's why Rodolfo
never recovered after the accident.

188
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,203
- You didn't know?
- Stop it now!

189
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,415
I'm had enough of you kids
blaming your father and me.

190
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,427
Your father's worked his whole life
to be able to get you whatever you wanted,

191
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,178
and this is how you repay him?

192
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,141
Why don't you
take the drama down a peg or two, Mom<i>?</i>

193
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,310
Even better, why don't you explain

194
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,854
why Rodolfo'd wanna kill
his pregnant girlfriend?

195
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,522
I didn't kill anyone.

196
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,569
What are you doing here?

197
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,614
You're supposed to be at the casino
preparing for the opening.

198
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,990
I didn't murder her.

199
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,326
Someone cut those ropes on purpose.

200
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,054
- What are you talking about?
- I spent 18 years

201
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,707
thinking I murdered Sara, when really...
I was innocent.

202
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,542
Of course you're innocent!

203
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,963
- It was an accident.
- It wasn't an accident, no!

204
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,633
I'm trying to say someone cut
the ropes on that parachute

205
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,550
to murder Sara!

206
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,677
Harness was tampered with. Elroy told me.

207
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,970
Elroy? Come on.

208
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,014
Elroy was there with us the whole time.
It's true.

209
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,475
- You're accusing your family?
- Yes.

210
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,185
There's nobody else.

211
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,188
I mean, that's really the only option.

212
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,106
<i>- Cállate.</i>
- It was one of us.

213
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,902
Nobody else had access to our boat
or the parachute.

214
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,528
Just shut it, I said!

215
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,072
Just please...

216
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,743
When you took Sara to the hospital,

217
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,496
I just... I wasn't sure what'd happened,
and I was scared.

218
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>I cleaned the boat myself.</i>

219
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,795
<i>I folded the parachute</i>

220
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,673
<i>and put it away,
and nobody had cut the ropes.</i>

221
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,341
Are you crazy, Mom<i>?</i>

222
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,592
Álex is free.

223
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,596
It's not an issue that the
little whore's case will be reopened.

224
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,724
Don't you call her that.

225
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,488
I'm sorry, but that's what she was.

226
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,437
A little whore who shook her ass
in front of your brother

227
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,022
to try to get our last name.

228
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,524
Stop stirring up the past.

229
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,943
The one who stands
to lose the most here is you.

230
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,530
And the rest of the family
had nothing to do with it, you idiot.

231
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,782
- Every family has a monster.
- That isn't so.

232
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,409
That's right. A monster.

233
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,745
And in this family, according to the law,
you were the monster.

234
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,163
But you were saved.

235
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,250
So it's time for you
to shut your goddamn mouth!

236
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,002
And get to the casino!

237
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,170
Go take a shower and a steam in the sauna.

238
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,382
Do what you want,
but tomorrow I want you at your best.

239
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,884
No one in this family murdered Sara.

240
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,803
No one!

241
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,213
Call me.

242
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,976
What the hell?

243
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,524
Chema,
you really shouldn't have grabbed me.

244
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,072
Álex...

245
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,335
I'm in love with you.

246
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,764
Hello?

247
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,974
<i>What's up, stupid?
What's going on?</i>

248
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,476
What's up, idiot?

249
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,936
<i>How are you?</i>

250
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,189
Well, I'm looking for a job.
Got fired from the store.

251
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,900
- Oh, no way. What did you do?
<i>- Well, nothing,</i>

252
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,904
but the boss hates me or something
because I'm cuter than her.

253
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,405
Ugh. Sucks, babe.

254
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,534
<i>Well, if you know of anything,
I'd really appreciate it.</i>

255
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,619
I don't know, maybe you know what, um...

256
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,081
at your dad's casino. What do you think?

257
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,125
Uh, sure, yeah.

258
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,794
Aw, Chema, I swear to you.

259
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,047
I can do whatever you guys need me to,
I promise. Plus...

260
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,385
I can do some card tricks for the clients.
That'd be cool.

261
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,137
That's great, sweetie.

262
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,264
Uh, say, I'm, uh...

263
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,476
Let me talk to Lorenzo, because...

264
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,646
we might be able to do something.

265
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,314
Thanks, Chema. I love you.

266
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,876
Oh, I can't do it. I'm working.

267
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,129
Did you get the gift?

268
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,090
Have you tried it on?

269
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,510
I get so horny
just thinking about you in it.

270
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,721
Don César, excuse me.

271
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,973
Your grandson Bruno's waiting
in your office.

272
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,516
Thanks, Esther. I'm going.

273
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,728
I'll see you later.

274
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,276
Why are you watching a porno?

275
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,572
I'm not. No, sir, I...

276
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,199
Come with me now.

277
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,370
I just... I just... I had, uh...

278
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,122
- some homework...
- That's right.

279
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,832
Homework, with me.

280
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,089
Hey, babe.

281
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,928
What were you saying about that girl,
Clara?

282
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,313
I didn't... I didn't know how to tell you.

283
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,107
But I love you.

284
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,693
I don't know what is it about you...

285
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,073
But when I see you, it's like my heart's
gonna, like, explode or something.

286
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,449
It's making me crazy.

287
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,581
I'm sorry, I know it's a sin
and all that stuff, you know, but...

288
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,044
I swear on all my love for you...

289
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,757
I'm, you know...
I really just want to kiss you.

290
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,930
<i>Chema, I love you, too.</i>

291
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,514
Yeah?

292
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,891
Really?

293
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,980
I-I wish it was in the way
that you love me, man.

294
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,526
Because I get it, you know?
I've been in love a thousand times before.

295
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:23,115
But I'd much rather
be your brother forever, not your ex.

296
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,078
I don't want to hurt you,
but I'm definitely only into girls.

297
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,664
And I'd never be able to love you back.

298
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,208
Not in the way that... that you want me to.

299
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,418
No, all right.

300
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,504
You know what? Brothers are forever, hm?

301
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,382
- Sure.
- And I do love you like my brother.

302
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,717
- Sure.
- Are we cool?

303
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,219
- Yes.
- I really don't care that you're gay.

304
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,680
- Okay?
- That's cool.

305
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,223
I promise.

306
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,101
Could we just...

307
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,355
...keep this a secret...

308
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,856
please?

309
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,027
Uh... well, look,
I don't know how it happened,

310
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,863
but Sara has been suspicious
about all this,

311
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,405
between us.

312
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,117
And she might have told your brother,

313
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,454
- or someone else, man.
- If my father finds out, I'm dead meat.

314
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,248
<i>José María.</i>

315
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,002
What?

316
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,587
Nothing.

317
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,188
We need to talk.

318
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,982
Just give me one more shot.

319
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,862

TEMPERATURE CONTROL

328
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,512
Hey!

329
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,308
Hey!

330
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,937
You think it's wrong
to have a guilt-free conscience, Father?

331
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,982
Would you like to examine your conscience?

332
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,780
I've sinned in order to protect my family.

333
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,244
In protecting them from horrible things,
I've seen more than you can imagine.

334
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,539
- Do you regret what you've done?
- Not once.

335
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,461
<i>Family comes first.</i>

336
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,091
<i>And if a mother
doesn't protect her children, who will?</i>

337
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,469
- God.
- I'm sorry, Father.

338
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,349
But if one of my children...

339
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,477
is about to make
the worst mistake of his life...

340
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,565
I'm not going to wait for God
to come fix it.

341
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,069
Even if it means...

342
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,780
hurting myself.

343
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,954
- Elisa, we have nothing...
- Come on, Álex...

344
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,831
Please just hear me out.

345
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,710
Try to put yourself in my shoes.
I didn't know about a thing.

346
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,463
I hadn't heard your name
before that moment.

347
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,716
I know I shouldn't have
broken into your house.

348
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,219
But I needed to know who you were
and what the hell this is.

349
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,471
And I wanted to know...

350
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,182
you know, if I should be afraid of you.

351
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,265
And?

352
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,643
Are you?

353
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,645
I'm not sure.

354
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:42,897
It's up to you.

355
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,108
Was my cell phone hacked?

356
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,192
No.

357
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,069
Well, then, that's it.

358
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,363
I'm safe.

359
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,408
Hey, come on.

360
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,871
I can help you with this problem,
I promise.

361
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,458
And no one knows that I'm here, I swear.

362
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,545
And they don't know I've slept with you.
Put me to work!

363
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,589
I'll do anything you want.

364
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,217
I just want to help you.

365
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Why?

366
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,973
Because I don't trust
the assholes in my family.

367
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,776
This is Jorge Ortega.

368
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,028
He's your father's personal accountant.

369
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,405
I really need to talk to him.

370
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,324
I'll make sure.

371
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,993
You don't know what this means to me.

372
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,413
At this point,
it's so much more than knowing...

373
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,207
who murdered Sara.

374
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,225
If you want more...

375
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,144
then you need to ask me.

376
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,229
Hm?

377
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,982
I'm on it.

378
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,487
Hey, open the goddamn door!

379
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,418
Open up the damn door, come on!

380
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,686
Open the door!

381
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,857
What do you think this is?

382
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,985
Mm...

383
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,991
A VIP area?

384
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,244
Do you know what that means, "VIP"?

385
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,290
Very important person?

386
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,373
Exactly.

387
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,109
Just relax.

388
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,529
I'm doing this because I like you.

389
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,782
Look how beautiful.

390
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,910
What a body. Huh?

391
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,627
This is Imara.

392
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,548
She's about to teach you how to be a man.

393
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,468
She doesn't speak a word of English.
It's better.

394
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,888
That way you can use her mouth
for other things.

395
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,830
Hey!

396
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,471
The water's gorgeous, right?

397
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,558
I'm so happy Rodolfo invited you.

398
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,520
His girlfriends are always invited.

399
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,149
Especially when they're as pretty as you.

400
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,282
You all right, Elroy?

401
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,743
I'm fine, sir.

402
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,463
Rodolfo.

403
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,424
Rodolfo, what the hell?

404
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,768
Rodolfo, wake up!

405
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,145
What happened?

406
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,023
Hey, what happened?

407
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,106
Water.

408
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,361
What's going on?

409
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,784
I have no fucking idea.

410
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,746
- Someone locked me in.
- Álex?

411
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,626
<i>- </i>Why, was he here?
- Oh, no. No...

412
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,753
Who else would want to hurt you?

413
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,465
I don't know. Find out.

414
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,426
That's why you work here.

415
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,222
In this casino, you should know
everything that's happening.

416
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,183
Go figure it out.
Go find out who the fuck did this.

417
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,186
Go on!

418
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,953
No.

419
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,914
It's okay. I don't want to do anything.

420
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,176
No, no.

421
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,806
I won't tell César.

422
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,438
No, no. No, no.

423
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,648
No! No!

424
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,274
No.

425
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,532
Help.

426
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,870
Help.

427
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,248
Help.

428
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,583
I need help!

429
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,545
I don't understand.

430
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,964
I need help!

431
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,551
Help.

432
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,512
I don't understand you.

433
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,556
I don't understand.

434
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,266
Help.

435
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:35,976
Help?

436
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,229
Help?

437
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,313
Help.

438
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,470
Can I help you?

439
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,553
Jorge Ortega?

440
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,265
Hello, I'm Elisa Lazcano.

441
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,807
It's an honor.

442
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,354
- How are you?
- Great, thanks. Welcome.

443
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,066
There's someone who wants
to speak to you about my dad<i>.</i>

444
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,612
If I can have two minutes of your time,
I'll explain why it's a good idea.

445
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,369
Jorge Ortega will contact you
in two minutes to confirm

446
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,079
<i>a time and location for your meeting.</i>

447
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,414
<i>I hope this means I've passed the test.</i>

448
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,833
Very good.

449
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,088
Yeah, you're right.
At least you passed this test.

450
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,218
Now we just have to get together
to discuss the rest of that kiss.

451
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,522
- You want some dessert, baby?
- No!

452
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,899
It's a little doughnut.

453
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,332
Well, okay. Maybe just one.

454
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,378
This is clearly blackmail.

455
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,256
What do you want?

456
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,843
You're going to tell me about Clara?

457
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,971
I've known Clara and her mother
since I was...

458
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,722
like...

459
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,891
like eight years old.

460
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,520
And she loves me like a brother.

461
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,401
I really want her to be our surrogate.

462
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,493
No.

463
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,328
Clara's a wonderful person.

464
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,539
I'd like you to get to know her.

465
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,622
Come here.

466
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,126
Come on.

467
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,546
Mm.

468
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,214
Babe...

469
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,135
She's a sister to me.

470
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,430
I'm sure she'd be willing
to sign a contract

471
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,682
if it makes you feel any better.

472
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,769
And then we can avoid the law office,

473
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,397
the agency, all that bullshit
that will be such a pain.

474
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,607
And why her?

475
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,318
'Cause...

476
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,992
Because she's my friend,
and I really like her.

477
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,828
Yeah, no, but...

478
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,497
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

479
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,003
You're so sneaky.

480
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,004
Come here.

481
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,049
You're evil, you know?

482
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,008
What do you mean?

483
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,678
You're taking advantage,
you've got me full of oxytocin and sugar.

484
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,307
- Now I know what you're trying to do.
- No, I just...
