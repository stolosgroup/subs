1
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,052
Previously, on
"Better Call Saul"...

2
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,402
Did I mention
the signing bonus?

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:15,145
I got a name.
Rand Casimiro. Retired judge.

4
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:17,060
And what about your husband,
ma'am?

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:21,195
He must have said
something to you.

6
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,197
All roads lead back
to you.

7
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:25,242
I'd like to think
that this ends it.

8
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,070
Probably not.

9
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,333
I need to know
everything he does.

10
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,509
I let him suck me
into his game.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,035
Because you know
what's coming next.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

13
00:01:10,244 --> 00:01:12,333
And here she is.
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:13,899
Kimmy.

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,944
Really?

16
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,294
What is going on
with you?

17
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:19,122
She's never done anything
like this before.

18
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:21,255
Never.
She's a straight-A student.

19
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:22,517
She's always got her nose
in a book.

20
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:23,822
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, ma'am.

21
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:26,564
She was caught
red-handed.

22
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:28,088
A thief.

23
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:31,395
You know better
than this, Kim.

24
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:32,831
I-I'd say
I'm disappointed,

25
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:35,921
but that doesn't even begin
to cover it.

26
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,489
What happens now?

27
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,100
Well when
the merchandise in question

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,710
is over $20 in value,

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,193
it is company policy
to call the police.

30
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,282
The police.

31
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,762
You know what?
Maybe that's for the best.

32
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:51,937
Nip it in the bud.

33
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:54,375
I mean,
protecting her

34
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:57,943
from the consequences
of her own actions...I do have
some discretion here.

35
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:58,988
Um....

36
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:02,209
Our main concern
is we just don't want to see

37
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,298
the same faces
over and over.

38
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:09,564
So if you can promise me that
this was a one-time thing...

39
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:12,088
Well, Kim.
You heard Mr. Pearson.

40
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,872
Are you going to do it
again?

41
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,439
No.

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,833
I'd like
to believe that.

43
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:22,272
And what was so wonderful
that you just had to steal it?

44
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,449
Earrings.

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,670
What?
I-I can't even hear you.

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,150
Earrings
and a necklace.

47
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,544
Earrings
and a necklace.

48
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,503
Unbelievable.

49
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,722
It's part of our new
Starlight Collection.

50
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,290
It's priced at $34.50,
but that one is unsellable.

51
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,859
The chain was broken when she
tried to hide it in that purse.

52
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,210
My God. $34.50?
What about tax?

53
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,864
No, I-I don't expect you
to...

54
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,431
I'm not paying for it,
sheis.

55
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,084
This is coming out
of your allowance.

56
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,522
I don't care
if it takes 10 years.

57
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,786
She's going to wish
we called the police.

58
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:02,225
Well, including sales tax,
it's $35.53.

59
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:04,009
Thirty-five...

60
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,490
Uh, i-it's...
it's really not necessary.

61
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,493
Mnh.
This is...

62
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,279
I can... I can give you $13 right now.
Uh...

63
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,932
And we'll come back
with the rest.

64
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:18,328
Ma'am.
Really, i-it's fine.

65
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:23,115
You've been
very, very kind.

66
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,466
Well, Kim,
what do we say?

67
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,426
Thank you.

68
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:41,351
Y'know, you got
a fine mother there.

69
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:43,266
You don't want to
disappoint her again.

70
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,488
Thank you
for being so understanding.

71
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:49,490
Oh,
my pleasure.

72
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,277
Best of luck.

73
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,255
"Nip it in the bud..."

74
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:27,310
I didn't know
you had it in you.

75
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,574
Here.

76
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,621
I got you something.

77
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:35,187
See?

78
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,929
Your mom's good
for something, hm?

79
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,676
Hey, kiddo, relax.

80
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,852

Hi.

00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,862
Morning.

114
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,211
How'd you sleep?

115
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,432
Good. And you?

116
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:15,826
Alright, I think.

117
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:17,262
Didn't you say something

118
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,700
about replacing the mattress
out there?

119
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,572
It's fine.

120
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,926
That is for you.

121
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:31,494
Thanks.

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,939
We should talk about
the Abramson fundraiser.

123
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,725
Is that coming up?
Next Friday.

124
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,903
I can't believe
it's been a whole year...

125
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,513
How do you want
to handle it?

126
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:55,083
Well, however you want.
You can go, or I can go.

127
00:07:55,213 --> 00:08:00,523
Or, if it's easier,
we could both go.

128
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,525
I'll go.

129
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,093
Sure.

130
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:08,836
Probably for the best.

131
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,578
Uh, actually, t-there is
something you should know about.

132
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,101
A situation
I'm dealing with.

133
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,973
Y-You remember what was going on
with Chuck's brother, Jimmy?

134
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:20,108
You mean with the bowling balls
and...so on?

135
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:21,239
That's not over with?

136
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,981
Mmh-mmh.
I think it's getting worse.

137
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:27,898
In fact, it's possible
you might hear or see something.

138
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,205
I couldn't say what.

139
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:33,556
Just know that, if you do...
whatever it is...

140
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,558
I'm handling it.

141
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,125
I will put an end to this.

142
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,171
Whatever it takes.

143
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,521
I thought you should know.

144
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,438
Duly noted.

145
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,571
I'm having dinner
with the Appels tonight,

146
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:51,531
so you've got the house
to yourself.

147
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,010
Tell them I said hello.

148
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,273
I will.

149
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:14,641
He saw clients
starting at 9:00 a.m.

150
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:17,948
One tried to bring a pet
cockatiel into the waiting room.

151
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,995
That caused
a bit of a ruckus.

152
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,738
Then it was more clients
until lunch at 1:15.

153
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:28,437
Takeout for him and the
receptionist... Taco Cabeza.

154
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,005
After that,
another four clients.

155
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,529
He left the office
around 2:00.

156
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,707
Made a quick stop for coffee...
same place as the day before.

157
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,883
2:30 to 3:20,
he was down at the courthouse

158
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,232
for a bail hearing.

159
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,104
Then back to the office.

160
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,019
Home at 10 after 8:00.

161
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,631
Wednesday was more
of the same.

162
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,111
Out at 8:30.

163
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,026
Got to the office
by a quarter-of.

164
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,549
Clients all day.

165
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,290
Uh, that takes
to the second composite,

166
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,857
case you want to
check them out for yourself.

167
00:09:56,987 --> 00:10:00,425
He got lunch for himself
and his receptionist

168
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:01,644
at around 1:30.

169
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,559
The Vietnamese place again.

170
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,517
Then, in the... What's this?

171
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,519
Yeah, I was just
getting to that.

172
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,740
That was three days ago.
Only time he broke the pattern.

173
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,699
Stopped at Cradock Marine
over on Central

174
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,005
instead of going
straight to the office.

175
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,878
Looked like he made
a cash withdrawal.

176
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,488
I couldn't get a good angle
through the window,

177
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,883
but I counted four,
maybe five stacks?

178
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,886
I'd say somewhere
in the ballpark of 20 grand.

179
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:31,239
I'm not a lawyer,
but is there any reason

180
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:34,285
he'd need that much cash in
the normal course of business?

181
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,987
No legitimate reason.

182
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,923
Thank you so much, Doc.
Of course. Of course. Come on in.

183
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,402
We'll take a look.

184
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,448
It's gonna be okay.

185
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,624
Gonna be okay.

186
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,281
Come on.

187
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,936
Okay.
Fernando's gonna be fine.

188
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,155
The shot I gave him
will settle his stomach.

189
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,201
But I want to keep him
for a few more minutes,

190
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,159
make sure he doesn't have
any reactions.

191
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,509
After that, you're all set.
That's such a relief.

192
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,208
We were so worried.We're lucky
you were able to see us.

193
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,557
Ah, it's no problem.

194
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,732
I was already here
with another patient.

195
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:33,344
- Alright.
- Be back.

196
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,234
Alright.
How are we doing?

197
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,063
I dunno, um, I guess
my skin's a little dry

198
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:59,980
where you put that stuff on,
but otherwise...

199
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,595
Are you sure
you used enough?

200
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,901
Absolutely.

201
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:09,946
Just give it
a little more time.

202
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,992
Look all the way
to the right.

203
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,908
Now to the left.

204
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,823
What's it gonna
feel like?

205
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:20,435
Depends on how
used to caffeine you are.

206
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:24,178
I mean, you're not gonna be
trippin' balls, but...

207
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,832
it's gonna feel like,
you know,

208
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,573
two Red Bulls
on an empty stomach.

209
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:30,706
And how long
is it gonna last?

210
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,577
Is the guy
roughly your size?

211
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,754
Yeah.

212
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,930
An hour or two.

213
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,802
And if there's
a blood test?

214
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,935
This stuff is not showing up
on any blood panel

215
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,675
they're running
in this town.

216
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,982
You're gonna do this,
this is the way to go.

217
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,681
Here.
Whoa, whoa.

218
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,596
Promise me
this has been sterilized.

219
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,903
It's brand new,

220
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:57,080
and for you,
it goes under the armpit.

221
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,255
Okay.

222
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,866
Sorry.

223
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:06,046
I cannot wait to be done
with all of this.

224
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,309
I hear ya.
You know, I read somewhere

225
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,181
that vets are even more
depressed than lawyers.

226
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:12,966
Depressed?

227
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,663
No, no, no, no, no.

228
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,405
I love being a vet.

229
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,320
Look over there.

230
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,235
See that?

231
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,890
That's what
it's all about.

232
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,500
Animals are my life.

233
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,677
It's this other stuff
that's getting to be too much,

234
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,157
no offense.

235
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,510
Anyway, a guy's gotta know
when he's bagged his limit.

236
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,078
What...
so you're closing up shop?

237
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,123
Yep. Leaving town.

238
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,995
Once I sell
my little black book,

239
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,345
it's gonna be all animals,
all the time.

240
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:46,086
Black book?

241
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,088
Yeah, the keys
to the kingdom.

242
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:51,308
You know, you call me up,
you're looking for a someone?

243
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,224
Keep all my "someones" in here.

244
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,705
Can I see it?

245
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,104
Knock yourself out.

246
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,542
Oh.

247
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,587
Alright, yeah.
I think we, uh...

248
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,894
we found
the Zodiac Killer.

249
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:17,813
Well...I'm not keeping my
contacts in plain English.

250
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,555
"Best Quality Vacuum"?

251
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:24,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

252
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,344
Alright.
Let's give it another 10.

253
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,303
I'll be back.

254
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,264
What a waste.

255
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,397
You think?

256
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,139
Did you see how many
people he had in that book?

257
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,707
I mean, he's raking it in,
day in, day out.

258
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,580
It's passive income.
Minimal risk.

259
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,322
I can't believe
he's walking away from that.

260
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,368
Well...

261
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:55,503
he knows
what he wants.

262
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,374
Anything?

263
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:01,726
Not really.

264
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:03,598
Oh, my God.

265
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,208
What?
Uh...

266
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,391
Whoa.

267
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,312
Hold on. Hold on.
Let's just cut to the chase.

268
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:25,402
Your client... who has, let's
call it a "checkered" past,

269
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,275
was pulled over for a clear
violation of traffic laws

270
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:32,235
and found in possession of
a felony quantity of marijuana.

271
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,977
And now you're asking me
to throw out this evidence?

272
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,023
In words of one syllable,

273
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:40,330
how does this pass
the smell test?

274
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,333
Your Honor

275
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:46,554
this is what
this is all about.

276
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,556
According to
Officer Connell's report,

277
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,254
this is the reason
Joshua Holcome was pulled over.

278
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,692
New Mexico statue 66-3-846.

279
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:57,217
Driving with
an obstructed window.

280
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,784
This morning,
I did an informal survey

281
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,308
of the courthouse parking lot.

282
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,875
And by my count,
over a third of the vehicles

283
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,488
had something similar hanging
from their rear-view mirrors.

284
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:11,231
I believe your car
was one of them, Your Honor.

285
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:15,887
So unless you
and 47 of our colleagues

286
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,412
have outstanding tickets,
I'd argue that this statute

287
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,110
is not...
regularly enforced.

288
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,895
Your Honor, this was
a perfectly reasonable,

289
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,723
routine stop for cause.

290
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,203
Uh, what's the point here?

291
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,901
The point is
that this was not routine.

292
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,381
Officer Connell
knew my client.

293
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,470
In fact,
he arrested him five years ago

294
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,168
when Joshua was a juvenile.

295
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,691
And Officer Connell's
record shows

296
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,475
that this is only
the third citation

297
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,435
he's written for this statute
in almost 20 years.

298
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:44,873
So either this is
an incredible coincidence

299
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,658
or Officer Connell
recognized my client

300
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,312
and used the dangler
as a pretext

301
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,749
to violate
his Fourth Amendment rights.

302
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,274
Your Honor, all I'm asking
is that you take another look

303
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:55,710
at the officer's statement.

304
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,234
Ask yourself
if the state's version of events

305
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,410
passes the "smell test."

306
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,201
That was nicely argued.

307
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,072
Thanks. We'll see
what the judge does.

308
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,511
Defense like that takes time
to pull together, doesn't it?

309
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,296
Whaddya think it took...
30 hours?

310
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:19,212
Oh, probably
more like 50.

311
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,692
50 hours. Huh.

312
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,694
And the contracts office...
they pay...?

313
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,914
$700 a case. Flat.

314
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,743
So you're making minimum wage,
more or less.

315
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,227
Whew.

316
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,751
I've been meaning to ask,
if you don't mind...

317
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,319
how did you leave things
with Howard Hamlin?

318
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,238
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Howard.

319
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:49,851
I wouldn't be an attorney.
I wouldn't have met my husband.

320
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:56,205
I owe Howard and HHM a lot.

321
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,563
Have you heard of
the Jackson Mercer Foundation?

322
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,175
Of course.

323
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,351
They fund justice reform
programs on the East Coast.

324
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,353
I wish we had something
like that out here.

325
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:18,227
Well, it's a bit hush-hush
at the moment, but we will soon.

326
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,795
And that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

327
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,502
We're closed!

328
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,591
Francesca?

329
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,945
Oh, Kim!

330
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,338
Hi!

331
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,600
Hey.Come on... Come on in.

332
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,298
Thanks.
It's good to see you.

333
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,691
You, too.
Jimmy was so, uh, thrilled...

334
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,563
...when you said
you would work for him again.

335
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:52,740
Well, so far, so good.
It's no Wexler-McGill.

336
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,221
They're... They're
still working in the back.

337
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:58,789
Oh, okay.
My God, look at this place!

338
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,010
Yeah, Jimmy...
Oh, sorry, "Saul,"

339
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,055
is letting me take
a free hand.

340
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:07,189
I'm going for a vibe
that's professional and refined

341
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,410
but, still,
you know, inviting.

342
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,194
Oh,
it's definitely inviting.

343
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:13,761
It's... It's...

344
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,023
It's classy!

345
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,198
Thanks!

346
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:17,895
I don't know
if you saw it before,

347
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,333
but it's come
a long way.

348
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,292
That whole back wall
is brand new.

349
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:25,990
Um, everything
has been repainted.

350
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,644
I know
there's a lot of molding.

351
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,907
I-I found a contractor
who does it for a price...

352
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:32,867
so I just went for it.

353
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:36,958
I've also got a pair
of water features coming.

354
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,873
For serenity.

355
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,223
Wow, Francesca,
you really have an eye!

356
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:44,574
Well, it's still
a work in progress.

357
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,708
Well, I can't wait to see
the final product.

358
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,362
But I know
you were on your way out.

359
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:50,450
I don't want to
keep you.

360
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,582
Yeah,
I should get going.

361
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,802
Oh, yeah.

362
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,586
Congratulations!

363
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:58,675
The wedding?

364
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:01,591
Uh, uh, y... Saul told me
you guys got married.

365
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,464
I, um...

366
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:08,816
C-Can I ask, are...
are you registered anywhere?

367
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:13,168
That is so sweet,
but, uh

368
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,301
no, it was all
very low key.

369
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,041
We have
everything we need.

370
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:18,826
Okay.

371
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,697
Well,
it's great to see you...

372
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,699
Yeah, you, too....again.

373
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,875
Mm.

374
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,703
Have a good night,
Francesca.

375
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,415
Hm.

376
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,417
Where are
the extra batteries?

377
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:47,942
Black bag,
front pocket...

378
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,944
Umm. Well,
this could work, right?

379
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,381
No, our guy has more
of a curl on the ends.

380
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,078
Doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.

381
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,297
It's an action shot.

382
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:56,777
I'm gonna shoot
it 1/13 of a second.

383
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,257
Give it some blur.
Blur? No!

384
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,954
No blur, okay?

385
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:02,435
We need him to be recognized...
that's the whole point.

386
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,741
Kim, hey!

387
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,221
Hey, everyone.
Hi.

388
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,440
We started late
because someone took forever

389
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,702
to get the equipment.

390
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,617
I don't control
when they do inventory.

391
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:13,315
Hey. I'm playing a man
of substance, am I not?
What?

392
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,665
I see him as a man of means.
Of style.

393
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:18,102
Uh, no,
these are just stills, Lenny.

394
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:21,367
Just keep it simple.
Well, b-but just... just to ask, though,

395
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:25,327
wouldn't my character grow
something more like that?

396
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,417
It's docudrama.
Doc... reality, right?

397
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:30,767
Just keep it simple
and no improvisation.

398
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,030
Yes. Yes. Yes.

399
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,989
He's gonna be great.
C'mere.

400
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,904
Weigh in on this.

401
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:40,777
Okay. Uh...

402
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:41,909
Alright.

403
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,215
Let's try this one.

404
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,044
Just trim it a little bit
and put wax on the ends.

405
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,350
Yes!

406
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,091
That one...
trimmed and waxed.

407
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:53,094
You got it.

408
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,401
Everything okay?

409
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:59,274
Yeah, yeah.
I'll talk to you later.

410
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:02,146
Let's keep this going.
You wanna...?

411
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:04,018
10 minutes to set,
guys.

412
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:05,933
Oh. Thank you, 10.

413
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,242
You're doing great.
I am, aren't I?

The Jackson Mercer Foundation.

415
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,813

Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

416
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,816
Well, it...
it's not a done deal.

417
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,949
Uh... Some of
the foundation board members

418
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,386
are flying in next week
to meet the Lieutenant Governor

419
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,257
at a luncheon
in Santa Fe.

420
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,957
So they are inviting
a select group of people with...

421
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,481
Cliff called them
"up and coming organizations."

422
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:36,485
And, uh, yeah,
Cliff thinks I have a good shot.

423
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,357
A good "shot"?
You have more than a shot.

424
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,620
They're gonna love you
on sight!

425
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,971
The only thing is,
the lunch is on D-Day.

426
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,016
So? What? That's...

427

You don't have to be there
on the day.

00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:09,965
you're some kind of loner.

486
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,619
If someone
can come with you,

487
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,926
a boyfriend or girlfriend,
that's a good thing.

488
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,189
If you can convince your mom,
that's even better.

489
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,017
I mean, if granny's
still alive, jackpot.

490
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,453
Thank you, m'dear.

491
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,716
So, if you will just sign
on the dotted line...

492
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:25,067
...we'll have you back to
the Rusty Bucket by happy hour.

493
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,026
You made that call,
right?

494
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,723
Uh...Try to
make it legi...

495
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,030
About that. I-I just had
a couple of questions.

496
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,207
Francesca, can we sidebar
in the law library?

497
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,694
What is the holdup?

498
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,088
I just... I-I don't know
if I'm comfortable.

499
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,481
Is this even legal?

500
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,700
I'm sorry, which of us
went to law school?

501
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,702
Because I could stand here
and go through the ins and outs

502
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,489
of what's quote, unquote
legal with you, uh,
but we're on a clock.

503
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:58,622
I just don't... Francesca, let's get
something straight, okay?

504
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:02,539
We can't be holding a graduate
seminar in Constitutional Law

505
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,845
every time I give you
something to do.

506
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,630
But I...
Uh, I-I'm not sure I feel...

507
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,459
You know what I'm paying you.
It is above market.

508
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,288
To whom much is given,
much is expected.

509
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,899
We're not gonna make a habit
of this, right?

510
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,466
Of course not. Absolutely.
No, no, no.

511
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:18,381
Here. Put it on speaker
and let me hear.

512
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,255
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

513
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:25,911
Uh.
Hi, um, there.

514
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:29,697
Uh, I'm calling because my...
my mother is... is...

515
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,568
Well, I guess
she's a-a client of yours.

516
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:35,703
She lives in the
Sandpiper Assisted Living...?

517
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,487
Sandpiper? Of course.

518
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:39,925
Let me transfer you.

519
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,710
- It's just a phone call.
- Good afternoon.

520
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,234
Do you have a question about
the Sandpiper Crossing case?

521
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:48,324
Uh, yes. My mother's out
at the facility in Amarillo.

522
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:52,546
Says she's supposed to call in
to some meeting on Thursday?

523
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:55,070
Yes, you're talking about
the mediation?
That's it.

524
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,898
Uh, thing is, she lost

525
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,988
her dial-in instructions.

526
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,556
I'm just looking everywhere
and can't find them.

527
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,341
I'd be happy
to help you with that.

528
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,387
It's very important to us
that all the class members

529
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:08,605
are fully looped in.

530
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:09,955
What's your mother's name?

531
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,826
Uh, Marnie Stuber.

532
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:15,351
That's...
That's S-T-U-B-E-R.

533
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:18,354
Oh.
Bless your heart.

534
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,356
She'll be so relieved.

535
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,315
Okay. It's very simple.

536
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,708
The meeting is happening
at our offices,

537
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,493
so she just has to call
the main line,

538
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,190
the same number
you called just now,

539
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,584
press 7,
and then enter the passcode.

540
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,891
I can give that to you now.
Do you have a pen?

541
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:33,935
Uh.

542
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,372
Yeah, yeah.
Yup. I-I'm ready.

543
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:37,721
Okay.

544
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:41,856
It's 8-4-2-1-5-9.

545
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:45,381
8-4-2-1-5-9?

546
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,601
That's right.
Okay.

547
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,951
Uh, thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

548
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,257
Of course. Take care.

549
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:52,519
Mm.

550
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,608
Was that so hard?

551
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:05,314
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop!

552
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:06,359
No, wait!
Don't turn around!

553
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:07,534
What?
Finish what you're doing!

554
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:08,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Finish.

555
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,145
Uh, yeah.
Hey, where are you going?

556
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:11,886
Cleanup on aisle nine!

557
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,714
You clean it up.

558
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,415
Steady.

559
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:11,685
Need something?

560
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:14,383
Yeah.
The boss sent me.

561
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,907
He wants to know why
you took guys off your house.

562
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,648
I haven't been home
for more than an hour

563
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,042
in the last three weeks.Still.

564
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:23,392
Salamanca knows who you are.
He could show up there.

565
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:26,743
We're stretched thin.
I made a judgment call.

566
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,224
Yeah. Stretched thin.

567
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:32,053
You got guys at, uh,
the lawyers', the garage,

568
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:34,534
Varga's upholstery shop,
El Mich...
Your point?

569
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,840
Seems to me the most obvious
place to pull from

570
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,451
is Alameda Street.

571
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,192
My guys stay on Alameda.

572
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:43,064
Alameda is a long shot.

573
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:47,242
The boss has a problem,
he knows how to reach me.

574
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:51,029
If you have a problem...

575
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:52,900

Just a sec, Mike.

00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:14,808
Almost ready.

589
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:19,813
Want to know the star
closest to Earth?

590
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,771
Huh? Tell me.

591
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:22,729
It's the sun.

That's right.

593
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:25,775
Hi, Pop-Pop!

594
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,995
Hey, kiddo.

595
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,171
You ready
for some star-gazing?

596
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:31,738
Yeah!

597
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:34,828
How's your view?
Not too much light?

598
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,525
No, it's good.

599
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:39,006
Good.

600
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,181
Alright,
I want you to start

601
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:44,446
by finding
the Big Dipper for me.

602
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,622
Um...

603
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:47,841
I've got it!

604
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,539
You see the handle
and the bowl?

605
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,498
Uh-huh.

606
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:55,675
Trace a line across
the bottom of the bowl

607
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,198
till you see
a bunch of stars

608
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,246
that look like
a backward question mark.

609
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:05,685
Oh!
It's Leo the Lion!

610
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,339
I see him.

611
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:08,688
There's his head.

612
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:10,342
There you go.

613
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,387
What's that underneath?

614
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:13,997
The really bright one.

615
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:16,217
Is it a planet?

616
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,001
You know what?

617
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:21,440
That might just be
Jupiter.

618
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,224
Wow.

619
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:25,705
I think Jupiter
is my favorite.

620
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,882
Did you know it's the largest
planet in our solar system?

621
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:30,884
Is it?
Bigger than the Earth?

622
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:33,495
Uh-huh.
It's called a gas giant.

623
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,889
Ohh.

624
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,586
Now,
that's not very nice.

625
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:41,024
Pop-Pop!
It's not that kind of gas.

626
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:43,418
Oh, oh, my mistake.

627
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:44,680
What's next?

628
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:46,160
Hey. Almost bedtime.

629
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,422
Let's say good night.

630
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,076
- But, Mom...
- Hey, hey, hey.

631
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,165
You do
what your mother says.

632
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,081
The stars will still be
in the sky tomorrow night.

633
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,823
I promise. Okay.

634
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:58,216
Good night, Pop-Pop.

635
00:36:58,346 --> 00:36:59,434
Love you!

636
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,352
Love you, baby.

637
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:07,225
Thanks for doing this,
Mike.

638
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,793
How's Chattanooga?

639
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:13,753
Oh, it's...fine.

640
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:16,146
I'm, uh...

641
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:19,498
going to have to stay here
longer than I expected.

642
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:20,977
Really?

643
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:24,372
Well, I hope
they're paying you overtime.

644
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,896
They're making it
worth my while.

645
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:29,377
That's good to hear.

Good night, dear.

Same time tomorrow?

649
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,909
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

650
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,409
We didn't miss anything.

651
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:06,126
Hey, let's go out.

652
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,129
Out where?

653
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,482
Omaha Beach.

654
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:58,570
Here's to tomorrow.

655
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,093

Hey. You got this.

Alright?
Today is our day.

658
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,904
Victory in Santa Fe,
victory in Albuquerque.

659

That sounds good.

Don't worry about anything
except for your pitch. Okay?

I'll record the whole show,

Hm.

I'm sorry. I don't think
we have it, sir.

00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:51,274
Ah. You do.
I'm looking at it.

666

Upper left.

we had any left.

Gotta warn you, though,
it's on the pricey side.

670
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:05,898
$495 for the bottle.

before?

about the stopper here.

Thanks.
I'll be careful.

676

Alright.
Well, drink it in good health.
