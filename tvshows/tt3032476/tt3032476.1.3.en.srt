00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,302
Belinda here.

3
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:18,720
Yeah.

4
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,521
- Name.
- Charles McGill.

5
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,356
Client visit.

6
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:54,636
Here's Johnny!

7
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,255
Hey, I knew you'd come.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,557
All right. You're a sight for sore eyes.

9
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,759
You're looking good.

10
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,010
Jimmy.

11
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:03,228
Sorry you had to come all this way.

12
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,646
It's a long way, right?

13
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,398
- It's a long way.
- Yeah. Sorry.

14
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,818
Only two things I know about Albuquerque...

15
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,437
Bugs bunny should have
taken a left turn there.

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,440
And give me 100 tries,
I'll never be able to spell it.

17
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:22,113
Anyway. As you can see,

18
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,749
I'm in a... A bit of a pickle.

19
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,368
You certainly are.

20
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,588
Forget the property damage
and assault charges.

21
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,341
You face being labeled
a sex offender, Jimmy.

22
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:34,709
If that happens,

23
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:35,927
it'll follow you for the rest of your life.

24
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,763
That is insane, okay?

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,766
Th... That is a trumped-up load
of horse crap, Chuck.

26
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,802
- Come on.
- Is that what I tell the judge...

27
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,019
"Trumped-up load of horse crap"?

28
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,354
I'm not the lawyer here, okay?

29
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,189
But it was a simple Chicago sunroof.

30
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,809
Sex offender? That's not even remotely a...

31
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,648
Let's talk strategy, okay?

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,867
'Cause I need you to work your magic

33
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,152
and make this whole situation go poof.

34
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,789
You got a plan of attack? Huh? Come on.

35
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,624
I know I haven't made it easy for you,

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,829
but you are... you are the man!

37
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,465
Right? I know you got
a million legal loopholes

38
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,887
that we can dance through...
Big bag of tricks, you know?

39
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:22,090
Any clever technicalities, huh?

40
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:27,011
And reasonable-doubt type stuff?
Come on, Chuck.

41
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,231
I haven't seen you in what, five years?

42
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,851
We barely hear from you.

43
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,270
Now that you're in it up
to your neck, you can't even

44
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:37,071
call me yourself... you have mom call me?

45
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:39,073
Mom took it upon herself to call you!

46
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,909
I was just letting her know where I was.

47
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:43,912
- You didn't cry to her on the phone?
- What? No.

48
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,331
You didn't cry and beg mom for help?

49
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,199
What? Jesus!

50
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,618
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?

51
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,170
I'm gonna cry on a pay phone

52
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,955
in the middle of cook county jail.

53
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:56,591
Jesus!

54
00:02:56,626 --> 00:03:02,430
Can we... can we talk strategy here, huh?

55
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:05,049
Look...

56
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,269
I know I'm a lousy brother.

57
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,891
I'm a lousy brother. I'm a big screw-up.

58
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,110
And if I was just a better person,

59
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:19,314
I would not only stop letting you down...

60
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:22,734
You know what? I'd stop letting me down.

61
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,569
And it's about time

62
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,406
that I started to make both of us proud.

63
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,874
Am I right?

64
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,075
- Guard.
- Wait.

65
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,077
Chuck, wait, wait, wait, wait.

66
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,079
No, no. You can't leave me. No.

67
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,499
If I... if I don't get
out of this, my life is over!

68
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,588
So long as you understand that.

69
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,006
Yeah.

70
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:48,426
Jimmy, if I do this...

71
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:53,898
If... Do not make a fool out of me.

72
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,318
I promise I won't.

73
00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:58,686
Everything you're doing,

74
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:01,322
everything you're involved
with... that's over.

75
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:05,526
Just tell me what to do.

76
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:09,163
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

77
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,000
Just say it.

78
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,669
Please, Chuck?

79
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,537
Help me.

81
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:48,898
Hello?

82
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:50,795
Hey. It's me.

83
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:59,554
Jimmy? What's... uh...
Jesus, what time is it?

84
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,973
The clock says 2:00,

85
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,392
but I think that might be
Ho Chi Minh's time zone.

86
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,595
What? What's happening? Is Chuck all right?

87
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:10,432
Yeah. Chuck... Chuck is Chuck, all right?

88
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,267
E... everything's all right.

89
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,269
I just wanted to call you.

90
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:18,740
So, uh hey, what you doing?

91
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:23,361
Jimmy... No. I'm not talking dirty to you.

92
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:24,829
What?

93
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:26,197
Wait, you think that's the only reason

94
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,616
I would call you at this time of night?

95
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,451
I mean, can you just give me...

96
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,286
Give me a little bit of credit, okay?

97
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:33,288
And you're not talking dirty to me, either.

98
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,123
- Okay, bye.
- I knew it.

99
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:38,510
Uh, joking. Just... just joking,
having fun with you.

100
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,345
I am calling you tonight

101
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,350
with quality PG phone
conversation... PG-13 at worst.

102
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,551
Uh-huh.

103
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,303
Hand to God, you know?

104
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:54,225
Uh, but, uh, if you hang up now
and drive straight over,

105
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,610
limited time only,

106
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:58,113
I'm offering a free pedicure and foot bath.

107
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:01,950
Is that right? Well, maybe next time.

108
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:06,371
Hey, more for me.

109
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:10,375
Uh, you're, uh, probably swamped
with work anyways,

110
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,545
what, with that big, fat, giant case

111
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,763
falling right into your lap.

112
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:16,963
- Which case is that?
- I don't know.

113
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:19,966
Some, uh, some county official
or something?

114
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,385
It was in all the papers.

115
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:23,636
Craig Kettleman.

116
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:25,638
Craig Kettleman, yeah!

117
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,140
The primo client your dipwad boss

118
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,641
stole right out from under me.

119
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:32,946
Nobody stole anybody.
The Kettlemans made a choice.

120
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,365
Yeah, so did the donner party
when they took that shortcut.

121
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,984
Come on, Jimmy. Hamlin is not that bad.

122
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:42,622
And I'm gonna be second chair
if it ever goes to trial, so...

123
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:44,290
Be happy for me.

124
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:49,913
Hey, um, how much exactly
did Kettleman get away with?

125
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:53,550
Uh, excuse me,
innocent until proven guilty?

126
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:56,553
Uh, excuse me, but I'm
a taxpayer in this county.

127
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:58,755
I think I have a right to know.

128
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:02,308
And besides, it's not like
I'm his lawyer or anything.

129
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:05,311
I have to go to sleep. So do you.

130
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,013
I know you have court in the morning.

131
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:10,650
He got away with $1 million,
$1.6 million, at least?

132
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:13,653
I'm not talking details
of the case with you. Goodnight.

133
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:15,438
Where do you stash all that dough?

134
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,690
I mean, besides for buying
that idiotic boat.

135
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:19,325
Hello, guilty.

136
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:20,743
Hanging up now.

137
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,747
This guy's... yeah, he's probably a target.

138
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:28,585
Somebody might get some bad, bad ideas.

139
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,204
You know, if Kettleman
isn't careful with that money,

140
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:34,207
I mean his whole family could be in danger.

141
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,092
What do you mean, "danger"?

142
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:39,929
Jimmy, why would you say that?

143
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:42,348
What?

144
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:46,553
You said the family might be in danger.

145
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:49,772
I did? I... oh, I, uh...

146
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:52,392
I'm... I'm drunk.

147
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,229
So, I'm just, uh... I'm thinking out loud.

148
00:08:56,281 --> 00:09:00,450
I'm... I'm up, spinning, uh...
Spinning thoughts.

149
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,652
- You sure?
- Yeah.

150
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:06,289
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...

151
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:11,711
So, I will see you
down in the court bowels Maסana.

152
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,713
Goodnight, Kim.

153
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:15,748
Goodnight, Jimmy.

154
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:29,312
I'm no hero.

155
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:17,453
Hello! You've reached team Kettleman!

156
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,288
Please leave a message for Craig...

157

162

Kettlemans, you're in danger.

164
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:13,893
You're in danger.

165
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:16,512
- I'm s... I'm sorry. What?
- Craig, who is it?

166
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:17,930
I am not sure. Wait.

167
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:19,982
Say... say that again, please.

168
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:22,185
They know about your money.

169
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:23,436
Watch out.

170
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:25,021
Yeah, what are you trying to say?

171
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:30,359
This is a warning. You're in danger.

172
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,912
They're coming for your money.

173
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:35,748
This is a friendly stranger.
Your whole family's in danger.

174
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:37,583
The money... they know about the money!

175
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,419
You have a terrible connection.

176
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:40,837
I'm warning you.

177
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:43,256
They know about your money. Be careful.

178
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,792
- Do you think...
- Can you call back on a better line?

179
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,794
Kettlemans, you're in danger.

180
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:49,262
They're coming for your money. Bye.

181
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,893
What did he say? We're...

182
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:07,897
In danger. They're coming.

183
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,533
Who...

184
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:11,984
Who's coming?

185
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,525
Okay, how about this...
Time served plus counseling?

186
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,092
- Can't do it.
- It's his first offense.

187
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,911
- Can't do it, McGill.
- "Can't do it." "Can't do it."

188
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:57,359
Would you work with me here?

189
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:58,994
I'm listening, aren't I?

190
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,247
Well, you're kind of a captive audience.

191
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,249
What did you eat for lunch...
The whole roast beast?

192
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:04,667
Funny.

193
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,202
Okay. Okay.

194
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:09,038
But hear me out. Wow.

195
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
The 30 he's done, which is a 60 credit,

196
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,875
plus 60 additional days.

197
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:14,710
Can't do it.

198
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:18,347
Best offer... six months,
plus the time he's done,

199
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,349
half time for good behavior... out in 90.

200
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:22,551
- That's my final.
- That's never gonna happen.

201
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:25,771
Oh! Come on. Now, are you joking?

202
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,623
Now, that is the best deal
you're gonna get.

203
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,025
I can't do it.

204
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:32,311
Your guy drove drunk into a shopping center

205
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:33,646
and killed three people.

206
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:36,699
Wait. Shopping center? Desmond Rojas.

207
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:38,868
Armed robbery, liquor store.

208
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:41,737
He assaulted a cashier
with a bottle of Kahlֳ÷a.

209
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,572
Oh.

210
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:45,491
I was thinking of Daryl Redwood.

211
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,827
Yeah, okay. My bad.
Desmond Rojas. Okay, go.

212
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,412
Start over.

213
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:51,964
I am not starting over.

214
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,799
I'm busting my nut here
every day for 700 a throw,

215
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,334
inhaling your B.M.,

216
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,303
which is straight from Satan's bunghole,

217
00:14:57,338 --> 00:15:00,306
and you can't tell one
defendant from another?!

218
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:03,726
90 days with good behavior...
We're doing this.

219
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,728
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

220
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:08,347
Say it. Say the words, "I accept the deal."

221
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,267
Yeah, I... I accept... I accept the deal.

222
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,780
Good morning.

223
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:30,119
W... what do you mean, what did I mean?

224
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:34,123
I... I... no, I told you.
I... I was drunk. I just...

225
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:39,962
Kim, why are you...
Why are you asking me this?

226
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:42,598
Oh, damn it.

227
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:44,183
Here. I'm in a real rush.

228
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,518
I didn't have time to get the validation.

229
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:49,388
Fine. 9 bucks.

230
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:55,144
I... I don't have it.

231
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:57,146
I have $5. Please?

232
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:59,565
You know the drill...
Money or the validation.

233
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:01,400
Look, this is an emergency, okay?

234
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:02,818
A serious, serious emergency.

235
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,653
I have to get out of here.

236
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:07,072
I promise, on the souls of my forefathers,

237
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,291
I will get you the stickers
when I come back.

238
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,745
I will get you extra if you just let me go.

239
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,714
Fine!

240
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,133
Fine! You're gonna make me
walk back and get the stickers?!

241
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:21,337
I will walk back and get the stickers!

242
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,974
I'm not making you do anything.
Those are the rules.

243
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,643
Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night.

244
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:34,650
Screw you, geezer!

245
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:04,463
Copy that, dispatch.

246
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,254
Jimmy. What brought you here?

247
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,572
Me? Uh...

248
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,472
Uh, I... I was surfing the police scanner.

249
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:42,870
I heard there was big activity
out this way.

250
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:45,322
Well, there's no business for
you here, so maybe next time.

251
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,908
Uh, it was a home invasion?
Uh, the Kettlemans okay?

252
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,127
Uh, we don't know.

253
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:51,545
A neighbor was walking the dog last night

254
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:53,381
and saw the front door wide open.

255
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,583
The place was ransacked.
No sign of the family.

256
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:59,303
There's no note, so...
We're still figuring it out.

257
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:01,722
I got to get back.

258
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:05,559
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Good luck.

259
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,489
Why did you come here?

260
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,691
I'm just supporting a friend
in her time of need.

261
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:23,661
You want to be supportive? Tell me why
you said those things last night.

262
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:25,246
I'm just reading tea leaves,

263
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:26,864
same way I knew
the Kettlemans needed a lawyer.

264
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,282
All that money floating out there...

265
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:30,419
It's logical somebody would come after it.

266
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:33,234
So, the same night you worry
about them, they... Disappear?

267
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,385
Yeah, it's crazy. It's "Ripley's."

268
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,586
Jimmy, it's not just Craig
and Betsy Kettleman...

269
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:41,921
It's their two kids, as well.

270
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:46,009
You would... Say something if
you could help find them, right?

271
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:50,180
I don't... I don't know
what happened to them.

272
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,599
Really, I d... I don't know.

273
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,601
The longer you stay here,

274
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,069
the more explaining I have to do to Hamlin.

275
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:57,687
I'll talk to you later.

276
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:01,324
Hey, you'll tell me
if there's anything I can do?

277
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:21,628
Everything is gonna be fine.

278
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,847
It's gonna work out.

279
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:26,466
A okay. It's gonna be fine.

280
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,631
Nacho. Leave it.

281
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,050
Uh, yes, I'm, uh...

282
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:05,221
This is the party
you spoke to the other day.

283
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:09,926
Uh, and I sincerely want to help you.

284
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:15,765
De-escalate your situation,
uh, legally and otherwise.

285
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:22,006
Um, so call me at 146-8729
at your earliest convenience.

286
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:26,159
But soon, please.

287
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,968
Nacho. Leave it.

288
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,970
Yeah, Nacho, hi.

289
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:58,191
Uh... Just to clarify,
look, I don't know anything.

290
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:01,394
Uh, I have spoken to no one,

291
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:03,613
and, uh, there are no rats on this ship.

292
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:07,450
But for the sake of everyone involved,

293
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,453
I would just like to open a dialogue.

294
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:13,656
So... 146-8729.

295
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,074
Call me when you get this.

296
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:32,425
If I didn't say it before,

297
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:34,227
time is of the essence on this matter,

298
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:39,232
so, uh, I'm gonna hang up now...
If you're trying to call.

299
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:43,653
Uh, there's no call waiting here
if you get a busy signal.

300
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:46,072
146-8729.

301
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,825
Just keep trying. I'll be here.

302
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,247
I can put out this fire,
if there is a fire.

303
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:58,952
By hope of hopes, this is all
a big misunderstanding.

304
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:03,006
146-8729.

305
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:22,392
Hello?

306
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:26,279
Hello? Nacho?

307
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:28,898
Nacho?

308
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:44,273
Walking. Just walking.

309
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:47,477
Just strolling along.

310
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:07,880
- Oh, thank God! Help! Help!
- Down! Show us your hands!

311
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,415
- Stop! On the ground!
- Oh, you guys are cops?

312
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,218
- Show us your hands!
- I got bad knees! Ow! Ohh!

313
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:13,970
Come on, officers.

314
00:24:14,005 --> 00:24:16,172
You're making a mistake.
My name's McGill, James McGill.

315
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:17,974
I'm an attorney.

316
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:19,592
Easy, easy!

317
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:23,479
It's his lawyer.

318
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:25,431
Whose lawyer?

319
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:39,362
You sure he asked for me?

320
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:41,247
Going in or what?

321
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:53,709
Hey.

322
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:57,547
You asked for me, and I have come.

323
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,551
I want to tell you this was a wise move...

324
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:04,971
Very smart, because I'm here
to help... Everyone...

325
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,807
All parties, but mostly you.

326
00:25:10,812 --> 00:25:12,612
Uh, those two detectives...

327
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:15,815
They just gave me an earful.

328
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:20,238
And what they were telling me
is... it's problematic.

329
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,323
I'm gonna pitch it back to you

330
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:27,960
so I know we're on the same page.

331
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:30,046
A neighbor lady saw a suspicious van

332
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,665
parked across the street
from the Kettlemans' house

333
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,083
two nights in a row.

334
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:36,719
She wrote down the license plate.

335
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:38,921
It was your license plate.

336
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:42,058
Cops tracked your van and you,

337
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:46,062
searched it, and found blood on the floor.

338
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:49,265
So... Here we are.

339
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:57,941
Um... Um... They're calling
the FBI in on this,

340
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:01,577
which makes it federal.

341
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:03,329
That's a bad thing, Nacho.

342
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:04,947
That's... that's very bad,

343
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,033
but if you tell me where the family is,

344
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:08,835
if... if you give them up now...

345
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,037
Full cooperation, deep remorse...

346
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,674
I feel very good
about knocking your sentence

347
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:19,295
down to the minimum... 18 years.

348
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,852
They take this good-behavior
thing very seriously,

349
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:28,688
so start here, right here.

350
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:33,526
Tell me the family is okay.

351
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:36,562
Tell me the kids are okay.

352
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:46,289
Y... you want to tell me
your thoughts and weigh in?

353
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:51,494
Does this sound like a plan
that you can get behind?

354
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:55,882
You miserable piece of shit.

355
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:01,053
- You set me up.
- I what?

356
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,256
You gave my score to another crew,

357
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:05,258
and now you're setting me up.

358
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,394
I... what the what?
D... did the cops beat you?

359
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:10,763
'Cause you're talking
like a person with head trauma.

360
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:12,216
- You think you're funny?
- What are you saying?

361
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,084
Are you saying that you
had nothing to do with this?

362
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,352
That was your van outside the house.

363
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:20,189
- Y... you weren't there?
- Yeah, I was there.

364
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,825
I was casing the place,

365
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,443
figuring out the best way in and out,

366
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,445
what time they went to bed... all that.

367
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:29,865
They were fine when I left. That's it.

368
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:32,501
You had nothing to do with the Kettlemans?

369
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:35,755
I was never in the house.

370
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:40,376
What about the blood in your van?

371
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:42,178
They DNA my ride,

372
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:45,381
all they're gonna find is the
blood of your skate-rat twins,

373
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,016
plus whatever piss and shit

374
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:50,102
you leaked out when you were in there.

375
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:54,523
Nobody's been in the
back of that van since.

376
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,945
I... I don't understand.

377
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,950
Here's what I understand, counselor.

378
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:08,154
I told my plan to one other person.

379
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:11,374
One... you.

380
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:14,377
Now here I am, under arrest.

381
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,379
Go figure.

382
00:28:16,414 --> 00:28:19,382
I don't know anything
about a setup or another crew.

383
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:26,389
You know what? I don't even care.

384
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:29,392
The cops are out there right
now, poking into my business,

385
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:34,230
and if they find something on me
or my partners, for real,

386
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:38,684
it's gonna be bad for you... really bad.

387
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:43,739
Bad? Bad as in...

388
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:47,743
You get me out of here, today...

389
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,112
Or you're a dead man.

390
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,131
Oh, hey.

391
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,716
I asked if you knew anything.

392
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:18,266
You didn't tell me you were
representing the lead suspect.

393
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:19,817
I didn't know it at the time.

394
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,269
He give up anything?

395
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,906
- What?
- Did he tell you where the family is?

396
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:26,324
H... he doesn't know.

397
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,942
What does that mean... he doesn't know?

398
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:29,410
He gave them to somebody else?

399
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:30,828
He... he doesn't know
because he didn't do it.

400
00:29:30,864 --> 00:29:32,163
Ah, Christ. Give me a break.

401
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:34,749
Guys, can you give us just a minute?

402
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:41,122
Jimmy, that family is in real danger.

403
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:43,541
You don't have to stand behind
attorney-client privilege.

404
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:44,659
I'm not.

405
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:46,627
These people can be buried in a box,

406
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:48,045
sucking air through a straw right now.

407
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,881
And I'm sorry if that's where they are,

408
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,299
but my guy didn't do it.

409
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:53,718
How are you so sure?

410
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,437
You know what you're gonna do?

411
00:29:56,472 --> 00:29:58,639
You're gonna get
your special CSI people, right?

412
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:00,641
And you're gonna test the
blood from that van,

413
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:02,476
because I guarantee you,
one billion percent,

414
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:03,945
it's not the Kettlemans'.

415
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,563
Whose is it?

416
00:30:05,615 --> 00:30:08,199
I... It's not the Kettlemans'. Just test it.

417
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:09,817
That'll take weeks,

418
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,819
if we could even get
a DNA sample to compare it to.

419
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:14,539
Well, isn't that convenient?

420
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:17,625
You've got an innocent man
in there right now,

421
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,744
who I demand you release with an apology!

422
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:21,829
Look, there are no other suspects.

423
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:24,665
There's no evidence
that points to anyone else.

424
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,417
Well, then, I want to see the crime scene,

425
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:28,052
'cause you guys are missing something.

426
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:29,837
Screw you, "missing something."

427
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,058
No, detectives, I, um...
I think that's a good idea.

428
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:35,977
- A good idea?
- Yes.

429
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:38,563
I think we should invite
Mr. McGill to the house.

430
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:39,564
Why?

431
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,816
Yeah, why?

432
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,575
So, what did we miss?

433
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:17,802
This is the son's room...
Warren. 12 years old.

434
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:37,238
Jo Jo's room.

435
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,824
She's 7.

436
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:51,085
All right, you wanted me to crack?

437
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,087
Mission accomplished.

438
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:55,723
But I'm telling you...
My client didn't do this.

439
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:57,558
We know Varga was outside the house

440
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,393
the night the family
disappeared. That is a fact.

441
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:01,512
Advocate for the guy all you want

442
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:03,931
after we get these people back safe.

443
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:06,567
In the meantime, help us.

444
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:08,319
Where's the doll?

445
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:10,154
Where's the what?

446
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:13,357
Uh, got little shoes, a bunch of clothes,

447
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:14,992
a table and chairs, hairbrush,

448
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:16,827
but where's the doll
that goes with all this stuff?

449
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:18,663
In every picture of this little girl,

450
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:20,197
she's holding the same doll.

451
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:23,034
- So, where's the doll?
- What does it matter?

452
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:25,252
Doll is gone... girl is gone,

453
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:27,088
which means doll and girl
are most likely together,

454
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:28,339
which means...

455
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:29,840
I have no idea what that means.

456
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:32,209
Which means the kid
wasn't dragged out of the house.

457
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:34,178
- Ipso facto...
- Wait. Wait.

458
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,013
What are you saying?

459
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,884
Maybe the Kettlemans kidnapped themselves.

460
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:44,972
That's it. You're...
You're... you're done. Let's go.

461
00:32:44,974 --> 00:32:47,108
- I... it makes perfect sense.
- How does it make sense?

462
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:48,526
Why would they do that?

463
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,612
They stole a million dollars-plus, right?

464
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:53,230
You... you want to get away
with all that yummy cash,

465
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:55,066
what do you do? Run? No, you can't.

466
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:58,736
If you run, everyone knows
you're guilty. Ah!

467
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:02,289
But if you're kidnapped,
you're a victim, right?

468
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,492
They staged this to throw everyone off.

469
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,994
You guys are looking in the wrong place.

470
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:09,997
Who knows how many miles into
Mexico or Canada they could be?

471
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:12,833
You... you got to put the word out.

472
00:33:12,835 --> 00:33:14,251
Oh, co... come on.

473
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,554
You don't think it's possible I'm right?

474
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,556
It's possible... unlikely.

475
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:21,759
- Unlikely?
- All their cars are here.

476
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:24,595
There's no record of a taxi
or car service to the house,

477
00:33:24,647 --> 00:33:27,398
and they didn't get on any
planes or buses or trains.

478
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,350
- You checked all that?
- Yes, we checked it.

479
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:32,103
And the doll... it's not news.
We saw it was missing.

480
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:33,237
So where is it?

481
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:35,072
The girl was scared, crying.

482
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:37,108
Bad guy lets the kid
take the doll to shut her up.

483
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,744
What?

484
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,163
You don't think that's possible?

485
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:47,001
I need to talk to you alone.

486
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:49,620
I've got to tell you something on the Q.T.,

487
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:51,038
and promise not to be upset with me.

488
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,257
No way am I making that promise.

489
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:54,875
I called the Kettlemans.

490
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:56,710
After I hung up with you,
I gave them a warning call.

491
00:33:56,712 --> 00:33:58,462
A warning call?

492
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,881
Yeah, I was worried my guy Varga
was going after their money.

493
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:03,300
And he was. He was gonna rip them off.

494
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:05,970
I deduced it from a
conversation that we had.

495
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:07,555
It was lawyer to client,

496
00:34:07,557 --> 00:34:09,774
so there was, you know,
confidentiality issues.

497
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:13,477
But I called the Kettlemans
anonymously to warn them.

498
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:14,645
Anonymously?

499
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:17,064
You didn't... oh, God, you didn't...

500
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:18,699
You didn't do the sex-robot voice, did you?

501
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:21,118
I did, with the tube and the whole thing,

502
00:34:21,154 --> 00:34:23,988
which probably scared
the living shit out of them,

503
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,823
and they took off, which, you know,

504
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,958
file that under "unintended consequences,"

505
00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:31,162
but you... you believe me now?

506
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:33,798
- Uh...
- Great.

507
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,416
Now we have to find them.

508
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:40,254
I mean... or, better yet,
get the cops to let Varga go

509
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,557
because right now my ass is
on a highway to the danger zone.

510
00:34:43,593 --> 00:34:44,925
Well, why are you in danger?

511
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:47,812
Nacho Varga... he didn't kidnap the family.

512
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:51,432
But he's a bad guy. He's a very bad guy.

513
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,434
And if the cops keep pushing him,

514
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,819
they're gonna find something.

515
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:56,437
And when that happens, Nacho blames me,

516
00:34:56,439 --> 00:35:00,741
and then his guys turn me
into a meat piסata.

517
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:02,493
Jimmy, tell the police.

518
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,328
No, there's n... there's no way
I'm gonna rat on this guy.

519
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,330
I will never be safe.

520
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,782
No, I have to convince the cops
that I'm right,

521
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:10,534
get them to stop looking at Nacho,

522
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,336
and catch the Kettlemans on the run.

523
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:13,871
And if they never catch them?

524
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:15,706
The Kettlemans?

525
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,258
Well, you've met these people, right?

526
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,677
They're... they're not exactly
masterminds, right?

527
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:22,096
They will be caught if the cops
are looking for them,

528
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:24,098
so you tell them to, would you?

529
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,300
The FBI, too... I heard
they're getting in on this.

530
00:35:26,302 --> 00:35:28,602
Why would the FBI listen to me?

531
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,221
Well, Hamlin...
They'll listen to him, right?

532
00:35:30,273 --> 00:35:33,057
APD, at least. Y...
You... you talk to Howard.

533
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:34,942
You explain things to him.

534
00:35:34,977 --> 00:35:36,527
He has clout with these people.

535
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:38,062
What? Is... is that a no or...

536
00:35:38,114 --> 00:35:39,563
Hamlin will never agree to it.

537
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:41,148
The Kettlemans are our clients.

538
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,067
This would mean incriminating them.

539
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,070
Oh, you... you see? This is why
people hate lawyers.

540
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:49,490
It's Hamlin's call,
and Hamlin will never agree.

541
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:53,327
And even if it were up to me,
you know I couldn't.

542
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:55,546
I'm sorry. I just...

543
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:57,414
I get it.

544
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,053
Where are you going?

545
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:04,672
I'm gonna go talk to Nacho.

546
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:08,092
I'll try to make him see reason.

547
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:10,895
To beg!

548
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,652
Come on.

549
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,771
Come on!

550
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:33,117
Right. Yeah. Hey.

551
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:35,536
I was a jerk, okay?

552
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:39,173
So, I will...
I will pay you what I owe you,

553
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,625
plus interest,
if you just let me come through.

554
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:49,967
I suggest you find parking somewhere else.

555
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:52,386
Somewhere else, as in...
Where somewhere else?

556
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:53,721
Not my concern.

557
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,723
Uh, actually, uh, this is your job,

558
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,725
so, by definition, it's your concern.

559
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:01,946
So pump out the ticket and open
the stupid gate already, please.

560
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:05,783
I mean, I don't have time for this.

561
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:12,406
All...

562
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:14,625
All right!

563
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:21,248
Hey. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna park right here.

564
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,584
I don't think you want to be doing that.

565
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:26,320
Oh, yeah?

566
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:28,505
What are you gonna do? You got
a poop-filled diaper in there?

567
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:30,341
Are you gonna throw it at me?

568
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:33,594
You gonna gum me to death, huh, geezer?

569
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:34,845
Ohh! Whoa, ow!

570
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:37,264
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ohh! Ohh!

571
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:38,649
Ow! Ow!

572
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:43,919
We're talking about a family...
Mom, dad, two kids.

573
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,566
Lawyer's got this bullshit theory

574
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:50,186
about them staging this
and running off with the money.

575
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:51,487
You know the story?

576
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,757
Yeah, county treasurer embezzled funds.
I read the paper.

577
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:55,973
Yeah, well, we got this
gangbanger dead to rights.

578
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:59,810
Only problem is your guy over there.

579
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:03,230
He needs to help us get
his scumbag client to talk.

580
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:05,483
So, what do you say? You on board?

581
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,535
Help us do some good.

582
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,455
Sure.

583
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,073
Okay, here's the deal...
You assaulted this man.

584
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:15,075
Give me a break. I barely touched the guy.

585
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:16,911
But you laid hands on him first.

586
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:19,411
Finger... I laid finger on him.

587
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,945
Well, whatever your interpretation,
it was still an assault.

588
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,313
Now, this gentleman
is willing to let this go,

589
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:25,948
not press charges, if you help us out.

590
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,016
You got to get your client

591
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,602
to tell us where he has the family stashed.

592
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:32,032
Wait, guys, I'm the definition
of a broken record on this one.

593
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:34,901
Nacho is "not-cho" man, comprendo?

594
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:38,321
Nobody took the Kettlemans.
The Kettlemans took themselves!

595
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:41,541
You're gonna keep playing
that line, it's gonna go rough.

596
00:38:41,577 --> 00:38:44,377
You know what? Do your worst.

597
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:46,079
All right, let's go... to booking.

598
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:47,547
Yeah, sure.

599
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,665
Fine.

600
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:50,083
Perfect end to a perfect day.

601
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:52,469
Hey, guys, wait a second.
I changed my mind.

602
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,888
- I'm sorry. What?
- I don't want to press charges.

603
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:57,724
We talked about this.
You want to press charges.

604
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:00,143
No. No, I don't.

605
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,262
What are you doing, buddy?
I thought you had our backs.

606
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:06,349
No, I don't think I said that, buddy.

607
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,568
So, what... you get a chance to do
the right thing and you puss out?

608
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:09,986
Mm...

609
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:13,740
Yeah. Well, I guess it's my loss.

610
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:18,245
Hey, Cagney, Lacey.

611
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,864
When you realize how wrong
you are about all this,

612
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,699
I'll take an edible
arrangement as a "sorry."

613
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,534
Heavy on the pineapple.

614
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:30,590
Hey. Hold up.

615
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:32,592
How come you let me
off the hook back there?

616
00:39:32,628 --> 00:39:34,427
Look, I'm going back to work.

617
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:36,429
Why don't you quit while
you're ahead and go on your way?

618
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:38,431
No, I refuse to believe it's because

619
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,851
you have something resembling
a heart inside your body.

620
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,853
You're not gonna have
a heart inside your body

621
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:43,970
in about five seconds.

622
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:45,188
Okay, don't tell me, all right?

623
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:46,806
I already know why you did it.

624
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:49,142
Yeah? Why is that?

625
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,144
'Cause you believe me.

626
00:39:51,146 --> 00:39:53,446
That family kidnapped themselves.

627
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:57,367
All right, I believe you.

628
00:39:57,402 --> 00:39:59,569
I knew it! I knew it!

629
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:01,204
Finally, someone believes me!

630
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,374
W... why do you believe me?

631
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,660
I heard the details.
Your story makes sense.

632
00:40:06,662 --> 00:40:08,662
Of course it does! But...

633
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:11,081
Devil's advocate... like the cops said,

634
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,916
uh, the Kettlemans' cars
are still at their house.

635
00:40:12,968 --> 00:40:14,251
There's no record of them leaving.

636
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:16,253
H... how'd they get out of the country?

637
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:17,754
They didn't.

638
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:19,389
Odds are, they didn't
get out of their neighborhood.

639
00:40:19,424 --> 00:40:21,224
What? What? They... come again?

640
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,228
Look when I was still
on the job back in Philly,

641
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:26,646
we had this case...

642
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:28,398
Whoa, hold up. Hold up.

643
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,234
Now, wait. "On the job," as in
you were a cop on the job?

644
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,238
This bookie disappeared
after the super bowl...

645
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:39,492
Cowboys/steelers... took $6 million in bets

646
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:41,328
and skipped town
when things didn't go his way.

647
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:43,613
Now, everybody thought he was
on the beach in the Bahamas

648
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:48,451
or dead in the Jersey
pine barrens... wasn't the case.

649
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:52,505
He was two doors down from where
he lived in a foreclosed house.

650
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,842
Hid there for six months
without anyone suspecting.

651
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:57,877
But... but why? Why not run?

652
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:00,714
Now, that's what everybody expects.

653
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:03,550
It's human nature
to want to stay close to home,

654
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:05,769
and if this Kettleman
figured out how to do it,

655
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:08,188
that's what he did.

656
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,893
Nobody wants to leave home.

657
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:01,478
I know. It's pretty exciting.

658
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,114
Let's really sell this one. Okay?

659
00:44:04,149 --> 00:44:06,116
Let's do this. And...

660
00:44:32,894 --> 00:44:34,978
Hey, it's me. Listen to this.

661
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:40,934
You hear that?
I found your dumbass clients.

662
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,691
Look, I'm... I'm taking them
back to their place.

663
00:44:48,743 --> 00:44:50,326
We'll meet you there.

664
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:51,945
G... give me a couple hours.

665
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:58,618
Hey. Yay!

666
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,086
That was great, guys.

667
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,505
Yeah, I think we have time
for one more before bed.

668
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,756
- Do we have to?
- Oh.

669
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:05,175
Oh, hey, I don't know about you,

670
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,593
but I would love a little

671
00:45:06,628 --> 00:45:08,428
"John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt."

672
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:09,963
Yeah, and... and you know what?

673
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:12,382
Let's really have fun with
this one, okay, Kettle team?

674
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:14,133
Let's do this! And...

675
00:45:14,135 --> 00:45:15,518
Here's Johnny!

676
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:17,937
Hey. Hey, Warren.

677
00:45:17,973 --> 00:45:20,356
Hey, Jo Jo. Uh, sorry about that.

678
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:22,192
I'm your uncle Jimmy, all right?

679
00:45:22,227 --> 00:45:25,028
Now, your parents are gonna
take you down the mountain,

680
00:45:25,063 --> 00:45:27,230
back to your house. That sound good?

681
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:28,648
- Uh, we...
- Yeah, see? They're excited.

682
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,234
M... Mr. McGill, can we talk about this?

683
00:45:31,286 --> 00:45:33,653
No, we can't, okay? You're done here.

684
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:36,155
Pack up your stuff, bury your
scat, 'cause we're heading back.

685
00:45:36,157 --> 00:45:38,575
- Civilization awaits.
- Finally.

686
00:45:39,995 --> 00:45:42,212
Uh, look, could... please, could we just

687
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:44,130
- talk this through, okay?
- It's not an option.

688
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:46,216
You either do this on your own recognizance

689
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:48,301
or the cops come
and drag you by your heels.

690
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:49,502
- I...
- let's go.

691
00:45:49,504 --> 00:45:50,553
- Kettlemans.
- No.

692
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:52,088
- Time to ship out.
- No!

693
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,506
- Yes, you are!
- No!

694
00:45:53,508 --> 00:45:55,308
- This is happening!
- No, this is not happening!

695
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:57,677
Yes, it is! Yes! Kettlemans!

696
00:45:57,679 --> 00:45:59,729
- No!
- Yes, you are doing this now!

697
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:00,847
No!

698
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:19,532
Yeah.

699
00:46:20,305 --> 00:47:20,933
