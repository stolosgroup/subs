00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,836
Oh, Jesus.

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,337
It can't be done.

4
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:23,007
You sure about that?

5
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,144
Ah. There's a trick, huh?

6
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:26,345
There's got to be.

7
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:27,679
This guy wouldn't be
putting any money on it

8
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:29,015
unless there's a trick, huh?

9
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:32,186
I'm telling you... it can't be done.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,954
So you give up?

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,962
Yeah, all right.

12
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:49,977
Wait. What?

13
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,179
No way!

14
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,016
Show me that again.

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,851
Sure. You got another $20?

16
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:58,826
Screw this.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,198
Ah, don't go away mad.

18
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,200
Oh, hey, guys, you want to buy a Rolex?

19
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,498
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

20
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,967
How much for that cheap piece of crap?

21
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:09,164
- Look what the wind blew in.
- Hey, Merna.

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,662
Holy crap.

23
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,665
Jimmy, my man, I said you
would beat the rap.

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,834
Hey, Merna, set him up, would you?

25
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:15,835
Merna, no, thanks. I'm good.

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,002
No, go on. He don't mean it.

27
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,302
You just got out of jail. Come on.

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,799
You're... you're not gonna have a drink?

29
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:20,833
That'll be the day, huh?

30
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,601
Marco, settle down, okay? I'm in a rush.

31
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:24,769
My brother's outside in a taxi.
The meter's running.

32
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:26,002
What... Chuck's outside?

33
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:27,969
Tell him to pull
that broomstick out of his ass

34
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,304
and get in here. I'm buying.

35
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:31,806
No. No, no, we got no time.
We're catching a plane.

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,307
I came here to say goodbye.

37
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,811
I'm moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

38
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:38,613
Mexico? You skipped bail?

39
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:39,947
New Mexico...

40
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:42,280
You know, like, uh, Bugs Bunny
and the Road Runner, you know?

41
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:44,148
Yeah. What are you gonna do there?

42
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,650
I'm gonna work at his law firm,
like, in the mailroom.

43
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:47,887
It's a start, anyways.

44
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,059
What? N-now you're talking crazy, man.

45
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,558
You just got out of jail.
Now you want to go back?

46
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:55,026
Because working for him...
That's all that is.

47
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:57,364
Marco... I was done.

48
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:59,501
You understand? I didn't beat the rap.

49
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:02,169
Chuck flew in and saved my ass.

50
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:04,006
It's time to make some changes.

51
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,843
Hey, listen, man. You're slippin' Jimmy.

52
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,913
What do you got to change, huh?

53
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:12,219
Everything. It's time to grow up.

54
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:13,722
Yeah, according to who... Chuck?

55
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:15,891
The same goes for you, man.

56
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:19,094
You want to spend the rest
of your life on that stool?

57
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:22,398
I mean, come on, Marco. Look at yourself.

58
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:25,570
All right, that's him. I got to hit it.

59
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,074
Geez. His master's voice.

60
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,079
Really? Look, come on. Go outside.

61
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:33,116
Tell Chuckles that you... you
got some business you forgot.

62
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,283
- Marco.
- Come on.

63
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,584
Y... you got to have one last blowout.

64
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,088
We'll do the watch thing again,

65
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:39,957
but... but maybe we'll pull that, uh...

66
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,791
That tar-money scam you were talking about,

67
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,962
- get some girls...
- I made a promise.

68
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,296
Yeah, you made a promise, but it was...

69
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,164
W... Whaddyamacallit? Under duress.

70
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,968
Look, he got you out of jail, okay?

71
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:52,965
But he's your brother. I mean,
what else is he gonna do?

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,966
Marco, listen to me, all right?

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,633
Chuck's not making me do this.

74
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,968
He's giving me an opportunity,
and I'm grabbing it.

75
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:04,205
Geez, it's like watching
Miles Davis give up the trumpet.

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,941
What? What does that even mean?

77
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,442
It's just a waste, is all I'm saying.

78
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,784
All right, look. I'm gonna fly out there.

79
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,287
I'm gonna get settled,
and I'll call you. Yeah?

80
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,122
All right, Jimmy.

81
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,592
Hey, have a safe flight, all right?!

82

83
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:25,770
- Hey.
- Hey.

84
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,140
What's up?

85
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:30,642
Just waiting to talk to Howard.

86
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:33,982
Can I ask about what?

87
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,485
I'm taking your advice.

88
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,322
I'm, uh, giving the case to HHM.

89
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:41,325
Why?

90
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,160
The fact that Chuck doesn't want me here

91
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,195
has something to do with it.

92
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:50,334
I'm so sorry.

93
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:53,471
Why didn't you just tell me?

94
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:54,572
I just...

95
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:58,978
I didn't want you hating your own brother.

96
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,853
How did you find out?

97
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,623
Did Kim tell you?

98
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,961
I figured it out on my own.

99
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:12,298
It's about time, right?

100
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,634
I brought the sandpiper stuff with me.

101
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:16,302
It's down in my car.

102
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:19,139
I figure your guys could do the outreach.

103
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:21,176
If any of those geezers
don't want to sign with you,

104
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,311
just give me their names.

105
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:25,149
I'll talk them into it.

106
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:29,817
You know, Jimmy, I never
wanted it to go this way.

107
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,584
If it had been up to me,
we would have at least...

108
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:33,652
Howard, I get it.

109
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:37,659
Your brother's very important to the firm.

110
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,160
Sorry I called you a pig fucker.

111
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:43,667
Well...

112
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,138
We owe you some money, don't we?

113
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:51,481
The of-counsel fee...
I think we discussed $20,000.

114
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,983
That and whatever the common-fund proceeds

115
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,985
of sandpiper ultimately adds up to,

116
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,654
you'll receive 20% of that...

117
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:00,323
Should be a very nice payday
for you when it comes.

118
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:01,592
Yep.

119
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:04,431
I've got something for you, too.

120
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:07,769
Uh, it's a shopping list for Chuck.

121
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:08,937
I mean, he's doing better,

122
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:10,608
but he still needs deliveries every day.

123
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:13,777
I think he'd be more comfortable
with someone else doing it.

124
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,447
I see.

125
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:16,783
You don't have to do it personally.

126
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:19,053
It just needs to get done.

127
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,722
It's pretty straightforward.

128
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,794
The ice is a pain in the ass,
but he needs it.

129
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:26,490
I usually sneak into a motel
and fill a garbage bag,

130
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:30,388
but you can have
whoever you hire just buy it.

131
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,792
The most important thing is the newspapers.

132
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,127
Uh, The New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal...

133
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,128
They're a must.

134
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,295
There's a newsstand on Eubank

135
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,263
that has both of them at 6:00 A.M.,

136
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:41,432
which is good 'cause he's an early riser.

137
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,668
The Albuquerque Journal he gets delivered,

138
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,336
but somebody still has to
bring it in for him.

139
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,339
You've been doing all of this every day...

140
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:50,508
For over a year?

141
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,604
You'll take care of this?

142
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:55,942
Absolutely.

143
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,003
I'll get it done and done right.

144
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,509
I always liked you, Jimmy.

145
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:06,612
Remember?

146
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:09,281
I used to call you "Charlie Hustle."

147
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:11,752
Yeah, I remember that.

148
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:27,194
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

149
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,835
That was nice.

150
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,670
You sure you're all right?

151
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:42,171
It's not a crime to let it out.

152
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:45,006
There's nothing to let out.
Chuck's a sick man.

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,674
That's no excuse.

154
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,610
He's my brother.

155
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:51,411
He thinks I'm a scumbag.

156
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,580
There's nothing I can do to change that.

157
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:56,916
What else is there to say?

158
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,583
Wow. That's mature.

159
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:02,218
Dalai Lama's got nothing on me.

160
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:20,077
O-64, as in, "oh, to be 64 again!"

161
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,583
O-64.

162
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:28,257
All right. Next up... We got... N-32.

163
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:34,262
"N" as in "Nancy... Reagan," a
first lady with a lot of style.

164
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,731
Anybody else seen "Hellcats of the Navy"?

165
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:40,732
All right. No winners yet?

166
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:46,736
Okay, here's... B-2,
just like the B-2 bomber,

167
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,204
the stealth...

168
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:51,206
There's probably one taking off
over at Kirtland right now.

169
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,611
We would never know because it's stealthy.

170
00:08:55,646 --> 00:08:58,577
Still no winners? No?

171
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,077
Here we have...

172
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,985
B-4, another "B." How about that?

173
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:10,957
As in, "before too long, we're
gonna have another winner."

174
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,727
No? Nobody? Okay.

175
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:17,726
All right.

176
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,762
And here comes...

177
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:24,940
Hey, it's our old friend "B."

178
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:27,311
B-12.

179
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:33,419
"B," as in, uh...

180
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,754
"B," as in...

181
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:39,756
"Betrayal"...

182
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,960
Benedict Arnold betrayed The United States.

183
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:47,464
Still no winners.

184
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:49,465
No?

185
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,801
Okay.

186
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:53,302
Here it is.

187
00:09:57,204 --> 00:10:00,005
Oh, what are the odds?

188
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,007
Four B's in a row. That's...

189
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:07,509
B-7.

190
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:11,011
"B" as in...

191
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:16,881
"B" as in..."Brother"... brother.

192
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,085
B-7... "Seven brides for seven brothers."

193
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,252
I'm sure a lot of you have brothers.

194
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:25,955
It's not like mine, though.

195
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:27,458
Any winners yet?

196
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,459
Take a... take another look, okay?

197
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,893
I'll wait.

198
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:32,229
All I'm gonna say is,

199
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,500
if it's another "B,"
could have a real problem here.

200
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:44,638
And...

201
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:49,475
Hey, it is another "B."

202
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,812
B-5, as in,

203
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:56,182
"boy, this 'B' thing is
really starting to tick me off."

204
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,853
"B" as in "battleship."
"B" as in "bourbon."

205
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:03,689
"B" as in "Belize"...
Beautiful place, so I've heard.

206
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:05,855
I would love to go there.

207
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,259
But, uh, let's face it...
That's never gonna happen.

208
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:13,660
None of us is ever leaving
this godforsaken wasteland.

209
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:19,231
Sorry.

210
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:23,602
Scratch that. Moving on.

211
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,343
I mean, what is it with this place?

212
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,613
It's... it's like living
inside an easy-bake oven.

213
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:31,778
I mean, look out that window.

214
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:34,449
It's... it's like a soulless,

215
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:37,288
radioactive Georgia O’Keeffe
hellscape out there,

216
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,789
crawling with coral snakes
and scorpions and...

217
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,292
You ever see the movie
"The Hills Have Eyes"?

218
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,794
It's a documentary!

219
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,131
God forbid your car breaks down...

220
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,699
You have to walk 10 steps.

221
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,703
You got a melanoma the size of a pineapple

222
00:11:49,737 --> 00:11:52,740
where your head used to be.

223
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,042
And so you ask, "why?" Why?

224
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:57,277
If... if that's how I feel,
why do I live here?

225
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,613
Why?!

226
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:01,583
Excuse me.

227
00:12:01,618 --> 00:12:02,920
Are you gonna read that number?

228
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:06,424
Yeah. I'm gonna read your number.

229
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,094
And it's another "B."

230
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,930
It's another frigging "B." Boy, of course.

231
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,270
Why not? Why not?!

232
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:19,637
And the next number...

233
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,778
Uh, quick question...

234
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,114
Who here knows what a Chicago sunroof is?

235
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:31,348
Anybody?

236
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,851
You, sir? No? Okay.

237
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:39,188
True story... uh, back home, uh,
there was this guy named Chet.

238
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,696
Now, Chet was a real asshole.

239
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:44,201
He might have owed me some money.

240
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,868
He might have slept with my wife...

241
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:49,707
Before she became my ex-wife.

242
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:51,543
The details don't matter.

243
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:55,380
Suffice it to say, I was wronged.

244
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:57,884
All right, so, one summer evening,

245
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,221
I was out having a few drinks...
One or two, maybe three.

246
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,053
You get the picture?

247
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:06,655
And, uh, who do I see? Chet.

248
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,992
He drove up, and he double-parked

249
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:11,994
outside a dairy queen and
went in to get some soft-serve.

250
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,663
Now, Chet drove...
And this will give you an idea

251
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:17,500
of exactly what kind
of a douchebag this guy was...

252
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:21,003
Drove a white pearlescent BMW 7 series

253
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:23,202
with white leather interior.

254
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,872
So, I saw that thing,

255
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:28,876
and I had... I'd had a few, like I said.

256
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:32,880
And, uh... I climbed up top,

257
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:37,553
and I may have...

258
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:42,327
Defecated, uh, through the sunroof.

259
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:54,608
Not my finest hour... I'll grant you that.

260
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:57,111
But that's what a Chicago sunroof is.

261
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,384
Now you know. It's a real thing.

262
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:04,423
I didn't make it up. I'm not
the first person to do it.

263
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:07,929
There's a name for it.

264
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:12,436
Guy wanted some soft-serve...
I gave him some soft-serve.

265
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:16,778
I did not know that his children
were in the backseat.

266
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:19,615
There was a level of tint on the windows

267
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,451
that I'll maintain to this day

268
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,420
was not legal
in an Illinois-licensed vehicle.

269
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:28,590
But somehow, that's on me, I guess.

270
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:33,959
Who leaves two cub scouts
in a double-parked car

271
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:36,295
with the engine running?!

272
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,798
Come on.

273
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,935
Now, Chet was connected, see?

274
00:14:40,969 --> 00:14:44,104
Like, uh, Cicero connected.

275
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:46,942
So, usually, I'd be looking
at malicious mischief,

276
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:49,611
public intoxication,
disorderly conduct, maybe,

277
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:54,783
but he's got the D.A.
saying indecent exposure,

278
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:57,251
calling me a sex offender. What?

279
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:02,593
One little Chicago sunroof, and
suddenly I'm Charles Manson?!

280
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:06,096
And that's where it all went off the rails.

281
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:08,266
I've been paying for it ever since.

282
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,635
That's why I'm here!

283
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:14,943
I don't...

284
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,655
You know what?

285
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,824
Any of this stuff you want, come get it.

286
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:31,832
Kitty-cat notebooks for everybody.

287
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,247
- What can I get you?
- Old style.

288
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:47,380
Make it two.

289
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:48,748
You got it.

290
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:52,052
- What happened to Merna?
- Merna?

291
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,253
She's doing all right.

292
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,755
She's my step-mom.

293
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,756
She don't come in much anymore.

294
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:01,427
Tell her slippin' Jimmy says hello.

295
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:04,432
- Slippin' Jimmy?
- Yeah, she'll know.

296
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,967
I'll tell her. That'll be $5.50.

297
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,558
Marco...

298
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,894
You gorgeous hunk of a man...

299
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:41,165
How long will you keep me waiting?

300
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,835
Mnh! Wake up, you fat son of a bitch.

301
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,004
Bought you a beer.

302
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,213
- Jimmy?
- In the flesh.

303
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:55,351
Hey.

304
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:57,520
So, I'm not dark enough for you, huh?

305
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:01,089
No, no. I'm just saying
I don't see any color.

306
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,757
I mean, 10 years in the desert,
you should look like, uh,

307
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,928
Anthony Quinn in "Lawrence of Arabia."

308
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:09,964
Turks... They paid me a golden treasure!

309
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,833
- Yet I am poor...
- Because I am a...

310
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,669
- River to my people!
- River to my people!

311
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:16,303
Well, hey, I'm Irish, okay?

312
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,202
I spend my time staying out of the sun.

313
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:20,174
Speaking of pale sons of bitches,

314
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:22,203
how's your brother doing?

315
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:24,040
Chuck's fine.

316
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:25,375
Still working for him?

317
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,378
Sometimes.

318
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:33,049
What about you... I mean,
besides falling asleep on a bar

319
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,885
at 4:00 on a Wednesday afternoon?

320
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,024
"Lake Michigan Standpipe"?

321
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,285
- What's that?
- My brother-in-law

322
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,061
owns the company.

323
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,662
Wait. Hold it. You got married?

324
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:45,163
No, no, no. My... my...
My sister Angie's husband.

325
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:46,398
Ah.

326
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:47,733
So, what the hell's a standpipe?

327
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,734
Standpipe... You know what a standpipe is.

328
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,407
- I don't think so.
- Fire department comes.

329
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:53,909
They stick one end of the hose
on the hydrant.

330
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:55,677
The other end goes on the standpipe.

331
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,177
The water goes out the standpipe,

332
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:59,814
through the sprinklers,
and then douses the flames.

333
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:00,984
It's important stuff.

334
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:03,020
So, that's what a standpipe is, huh?

335
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:06,521
Well, it's a dry standpipe.
There's also the wet standpipe.

336
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:08,358
What's the difference?

337
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:11,196
I don't know I-if I could
explain it to a layman.

338
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:18,928
Excuse me. How's your mom?

339
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:23,166
Oh, she passed away about three years ago.

340
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,236
Ah. That's too bad. She was a great lady.

341
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,071
Yeah. From Wisconsin, right?

342
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:31,574
- Yeah.
- The funeral out there?

343
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:36,013
No, it was... Here.

344
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,016
Here?

345
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,086
Yeah, well, we were only in town
for a few days, so...

346
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,190
You were in town. You didn't look me up?

347
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:50,260
Chuck was in the middle of a big case,

348
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:52,361
and, uh, we couldn't stay around, so...

349
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,366
Can I get you guys anything else?

350
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm good. You want anything?

351
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:03,804
Nah. Your change here, too.

352
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,640
Uh, yeah, okay. Hey.

353
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:06,641
Thank you.

354
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,258
How's my cutlass running?

355
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,560
Gets me around.

356
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,162
Well, it's a classic.

357
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:28,834
Little bodywork, paint job...
Really be something.

358
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:34,741
So, what you gonna do while you're here?

359
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,411
I don't know.

360
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,244
See the sights, you know,

361
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,080
catch a Cubbies game from the bleachers,

362
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,083
get a hot dog at Henry's.

363
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:47,320
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

364
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:48,820
Uh-huh.

365
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:53,490
Correct.

366
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,990
I'm gonna see them tomorrow.

367
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,525
Yeah, both of them.

368
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:02,865
Okay. Okay, bye.

369
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:04,768
Is he a regular?

370
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,237
No.

371
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:12,811
You're buying, I'm selling.

372
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,152
All right, then.

373
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:29,696
All I'm asking is that you take a look.

374
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:30,797
I'm sorry, buddy... no offense.

375
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,465
I'm just... you know, I'm not interested.

376
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,966
Come on, man.

377
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,301
What's it gonna hurt to take a look?

378
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,637
It'll take you two seconds.

379
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,807
All right.

380
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,810
All right. Show me what you got.

381
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,812
Boom.

382
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:50,817
Okay.

383
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,482
Do you see it?

384
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:55,417
I see a Kennedy half-dollar.

385
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:57,585
Which way is he facing?

386
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,252
JFK's facing left.

387
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:02,423
Exactly.

388
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:07,094
Hey, which way is he supposed to be facing?

389
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:10,064
Right... he's supposed to be facing right.

390
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:13,701
Okay, so why...
Why is this one facing left?

391
00:22:15,237 --> 00:22:20,544
November 22, 1963...
Kennedy is assassinated, right?

392
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:22,877
The whole nation goes into mourning.

393
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,410
They start naming
everything in sight after him.

394
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,413
And the mint wants in on the act.

395
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:30,418
So, in '64, they decide to
change the Lincoln half-dollar

396
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:32,351
into the Kennedy half-dollar.

397
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:35,021
When they design it,
they put Kennedy facing right,

398
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:37,525
facing east, just the way they had Lincoln.

399
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,361
- You know why?
- Mnh-mnh.

400
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:41,030
He symbolizes the dawn.

401
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:44,467
It's why pretty much every grave
everywhere faces east, you know?

402
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,770
So the spirit of the dead person
faces the rising sun.

403
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:49,103
You know, it's a death thing.
It's a burial thing.

404
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:51,437
But there's one technician
in the Denver mint, right?

405
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,943
And this guy... he believed
in, uh, the new frontier...

406
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:56,546
Camelot, the whole deal.

407
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,977
So, the assassination just destroyed him.

408
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:01,313
When he sees that coin
with Kennedy facing east,

409
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,653
facing the American past, pissed him off.

410
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,487
And so he went rogue.

411
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,987
Without telling anybody,

412
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:11,288
he flipped things around
so that Kennedy was facing west,

413
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,456
towards the new frontier, the future.

414
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,791
Now, the mint struck about 3,000 of these

415
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:17,126
before they figured it out.

416
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,628
They canned the guy.

417
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:21,464
About 1,000 of them made it out
into general circulation.

418
00:23:21,498 --> 00:23:23,299
They managed to get most of them back,

419
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,636
melt them down, but...

420
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,139
There are still...

421
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,641
200-plus floating around out there.

422
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,912
What's that? I didn't catch that.

423
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:36,449
I didn't say anything.

424
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:37,449
Do you mind, buddy?

425
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,150
We're having a private conversation here.

426
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:43,892
This one's not in perfect condition,

427
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:46,094
but on the open market,

428
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:50,268
I'd say it's worth... 600 or 800 bucks.

429
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:51,602
$800?

430
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,868
Yeah, but I'm hard up,

431
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:57,541
so I'll take, uh, $100 for it.

432
00:23:57,575 --> 00:24:01,711
You want me to give you $100
for a half-dollar.

433
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:06,851
I want you to give me $100
for an $800 coin.

434
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:10,019
Yeah, I don't know, man. You know?

435
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,855
I'm gonna go drain the snake.
Think about it.

436
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,869
This guy's playing me, right?

437
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:23,870
Definitely.

438
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:26,174
Slick son of a bitch.

439
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,878
You know, I should...

440
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,650
You know what? I know this guy on wabash...

441
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:37,653
Coin dealer, a friend of my uncle's.

442
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,654
Hey, Joey, can I use your phone?

443
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,487
Local call. Keep it short.

444
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,824
Right on.

445
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,761
Let's see. Man.

446
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:50,095
I'm gonna call this guy, and
when he tells me this is a scam,

447
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,934
you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call the cops

448
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:55,070
and get this scumbag thrown in the can.

449
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:56,304
You're my witness, okay?

450
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,742
Facing west.

451
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:04,246
My hairy ass.

452
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,747
Hey. How you doing?

453
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:09,750
Yeah, it's Alvin, Dave Tanner's nephew.

454
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:12,587
Yeah, mm-hmm.

455
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:15,423
Yeah, that's right.

456
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:17,425
Hey, this is gonna sound like
the beginning of a bad joke,

457
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,762
but, uh, I'm in this bar,
and I've got this guy

458
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:21,430
spinning this cock-and-bull story

459
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:24,098
about this, uh, 50-cent piece
he's trying to sell me.

460
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:27,436
He says, uh...
Says Kennedy's supposed to be

461
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,105
facing west or something.

462
00:25:31,742 --> 00:25:33,574
Yeah?

463
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,943
Yeah.

464
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:42,447
Mm-hmm.

465
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:45,283
At the tone, the time will be 5:11 P.M.

466
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:49,287
Yeah. That's what he said... Denver.

467
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:52,259
Jesus. No kidding?

468
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:53,760
- At the tone...
- Well, listen, I got to go.

469
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:55,261
All right? Uh, thank you.

470
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:57,765
And I owe you one.

471
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,102
Thanks, Joey.

472
00:26:01,137 --> 00:26:03,471
So, what did he say?

473
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:05,107
Yeah, you know, he...
He didn't really know much.

474
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,113
I'll tell you what...
I'll give you $50 for it.

475
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:14,850
$50? I'm taking a bath at $100.

476
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:16,018
All right. Okay.

477
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:19,019
Look, I got... $64 right here.

478
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:21,022
It's an $800 coin, okay?

479
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,859
I'm not gonna sell it to you for $64.

480
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,028
Okay, if you wait for me,
I'll get you 100 bucks.

481
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,362
- I don't know.
- Okay.

482
00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:30,803
Hey, buddy, I got 75 bucks right here.

483
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:33,139
I... I... sorry. I need $100.

484
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,640
Hey, slick, nobody's talking to you.

485
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,308
Mind your own business, okay?

486
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:38,309
- Come on.
- Cash money... $80.

487
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:41,644
Look, if you give me a chance,
I'll be back with $110.

488
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,945
How long will that be? I don't know.

489
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,579
I got to catch a train, come back...

490
00:26:44,614 --> 00:26:45,978
- Hour, hour and a half at the most.
- Yeah, you know, this guy

491
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:47,780
- was getting ready to call the cops on you.
- No, I was not.

492
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:48,735
What? Why would you do that? That...

493
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,782
Now this guy is making shit up!

494
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,616
Hey, I got $110 right here. That's...

495
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,116
- Sold.
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

496
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:54,450
This guy's got the cash. Now...

497
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:55,952
- Don't do that.
- Here, take care of that.

498
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:57,054
That's history right there.

499
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:59,558
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Hey, money talks.

500
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:00,725
You lost. It's over.

501
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,725
No, it's not over. No, that's crap.

502
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,060
And where do you think you're going, huh?

503
00:27:04,094 --> 00:27:05,295
Hey, back off, dude.

504
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:08,299
Yeah, I'll back off
when you give me the JFK back.

505
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,433
Hey, Joey, call the cops.

506
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:10,901
This guy just tried to rip me off.

507
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:12,436
Hey, this guy's a liar.
I did not rip anybody off.

508
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,504
Yes, you did!

509
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,074
You come back in here,
and your ass is grass!

510
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,243
I got friends, buddy!

511
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:20,245
Do you hear me?!
You double-dealing bastard!

512
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,450
I got friends!

513
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:29,423
You are so beautiful!

514
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:31,258
Mwah!

515
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:34,495
Hey, everybody, next round's on us!

516
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:45,875
All right. Are you listening?

517
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:47,577
Can you keep a secret?

518
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,478
Yeah. Absolutely.

519
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:52,648
Okay, his name is Idi Abbassi.

520
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:54,484
He's 27 years old.

521
00:27:54,518 --> 00:27:56,652
He's a Nigerian prince, all right?

522
00:27:56,687 --> 00:28:00,992
He's worth, conservatively, $400 million.

523
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:03,660
The dictatorship of equatorial Uqbar Orbis

524
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:05,830
is detaining him on trumped-up charges.

525
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:07,998
Now, the Abbassi family...
They're going crazy.

526
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:10,999
They will reward whoever
helps them get their boy back.

527
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:13,135
The hitch is,
the banks have frozen their...

528
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,970
Assets... I'm talking Irish sweeps tickets,

529
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:17,306
a whole trunk full of 'em.

530
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,307
They're just sitting at O'Hare,
impounded in customs.

531
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:22,310
Now, I know what
you're saying... "So what?"

532
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:25,147
I can leave this as security,
but you got to understand...

533
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:27,816
This violin is my livelihood.
It's a valuable antique.

534
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,818
What do you mean it doesn't belong to you?

535
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:32,487
I'll pay you 900 bucks
for this... cash on the barrel.

536
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:34,489
I don't know. I hate to part with it.

537
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:35,657
It's been in my family for years.

538
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:36,659
You can keep a secret, right?

539
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:37,795
Yeah, absolutely.

540
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:39,629
But the point is, you need a good front,

541
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:41,632
so you're gonna have
the most return on your dollars.

542
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,301
But I know this customs officer...

543
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,138
That money, then make it an investment.

544
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,607
If the price is right.

545
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,442
And I'm all about investments,
all about what's coming next.

546
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,279
Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car

547
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,781
out of this bad neighborhood.

548
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:53,619
Sir, sir, could you help me?

549
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:55,689
Tell me... are these today's numbers?

550
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:57,858
Now, none of this was strictly legal,

551
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:59,861
and the import taxes would have
been a killer... have at it.

552
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:02,364
So he had to find a way to
get the money into the country

553
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,134
without anyone knowing about it.

554
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:06,137
He coated the cash with this black stuff...

555
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:07,504
Vectrol paste.

556
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,807
And the only way to get it off
is with a special chemical.

557
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:13,042
It's not cheap, but the upside?

558
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:14,809
The upside is huge.

559
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:16,543
Can you keep a secret?

560
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:18,378
You know, the guy in "dances with wolves"?

561
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:22,246
A guy like you, who's got some money,

562
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,581
who's got some money to throw around...

563
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:25,918
Now, I know what
you're saying... "Who cares?"

564
00:29:25,952 --> 00:29:27,753
No matter which one wins,
we're gonna get a piece.

565
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:29,421
He's got a gambling problem.

566
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:31,589
Nobody can ever come after you,
but you get the profit.

567
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:34,258
- The price is right.
- It's a win-win for you.

568
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,759
It's a lose-lose for everybody else.

569
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:38,095
You want to tell the guy you've got a 14.

570
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,764
He checks...

571
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:41,766
Realizes he's...
It's not gonna just be you.

572
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,602
It's gonna be a piece of the pie.

573
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:46,671
But you're gonna own a full
mountain range, guaranteed.

574
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:48,840
Can you keep...

575
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:49,942
A secret?

576
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:51,177
'Cause I really...

577
00:29:51,212 --> 00:29:52,580
Really shouldn't...

578
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:53,981
Shouldn't be telling you this.

579
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:13,628
- Hey.
- Hey.

580
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:18,537
You are not Kevin Costner.

581
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:21,106
I was last night.

582
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:24,777
Jesus.

583
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:27,549
Asshole.

584
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,052
I mean, seriously?

585
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:31,219
Oh, my God.

586
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:34,057
- Lucianne?! Lucianne!
- What?

587
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:36,026
- He's not Kevin Costner.
- What?!

588
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,360
Well, who's this guy?

589
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:39,029
Uh, not Kevin Costner's manager.

590
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:41,568
Oh, come on. Come on. Let's go.

591
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:43,838
Uh, hang on. Got to get my dress on.

592
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:46,172
Come on. Get the hell out of this dump.

593
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,178
So, are you sure he's not a manager?

594
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:52,185
Yes, Luci, I am sure.

595
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,187
But he said he was gonna give me his card.

596
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,020
Does this look like a manager's place?

597
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,456
- Maybe.
- Can I interest you

598
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,857
ladies in some mimosas?

599
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,559
At least stick around
long enough to get dressed.

600
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,394
Oh, oh. Screw you.

601
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,696
If you build it, I will come.

602
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,198
Lucy, come on.

603
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,535
Okay. Bye.

604
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,372
Come on.

605
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,745
That door sticks.

606
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,745
Yeah, okay. I got it.

607
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,746
Okay.

608
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:17,982
Go. Go.

609
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,820
Okay.

610
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,384
You have 15 messages.

611
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,220
This is Greta Muller.

612
00:32:21,254 --> 00:32:23,387
I wanted to check to see if my wi...

613
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:25,852
My name's Gary Albert Arnold.

614
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,521
I'd like to discuss making a...

615
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,190
Hi, Mr. McGill.

616
00:32:29,224 --> 00:32:31,193
I'm calling on behalf of my mother.

617
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:32,531
She's in assisted living, and...

618
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,133
Uh, yes, Mr. McGill,
this is Manny Hollinger...Again.

619
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:37,301
Uh, I hate to...

620
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:40,805
So, what's it gonna be today, pal?

621
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,074
I'm up for anything and everything.

622
00:32:45,108 --> 00:32:48,744
Marco, I'm sorry. I got to go back.

623
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,578
What?

624
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:55,246
Uh, it's be great, and I
appreciate your hospitality,

625
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:58,083
but a week's gonna have to do it.

626
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:00,418
I got to go home.

627
00:33:00,452 --> 00:33:03,251
I already called in sick.

628
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:06,423
Come on, man.

629
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,595
This is home. Y-you hate it out there.

630
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,031
What do you got to go back to?

631
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:12,898
My clients.

632
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,902
Clients.

633
00:33:14,937 --> 00:33:20,074
What... what are you...
Like a gigolo or something?

634
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:24,243
Uh, Marco...

635
00:33:24,277 --> 00:33:26,576
I'm a lawyer.

636
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,411
What?

637
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:29,613
Honest to God.

638
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:32,948
I do elder law,
which is like wills and estates.

639
00:33:32,983 --> 00:33:34,549
So you're ripping off old people?

640
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,818
No, I'm not ripping off old people.

641
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:38,754
I'm not ripping off anybody.

642
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:42,555
Holy crap. Slippin' Jimmy's a lawyer?

643
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:44,922
No wonder you want to go back.

644
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:47,722
I mean, you got to be king of the desert,

645
00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:51,024
driving around town
in a white caddy, making bank.

646
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,358
I'm not making bank.

647
00:33:52,393 --> 00:33:54,259
I'm making a living, more or less.

648
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:55,260
A living?

649
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:56,463
All due respect,

650
00:33:56,498 --> 00:33:58,967
you're a lawyer and you're not making bank,

651
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:00,303
you're doing it wrong.

652
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:02,637
Well, I'm building something. Takes time.

653
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:04,306
Well, you're gonna build
something, build it out here.

654
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,809
I mean, lawyers in Chicago
make plenty... I assure you.

655
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,811
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you, Marco. I...

656
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:11,479
Chuck's in Albuquerque.

657
00:34:11,513 --> 00:34:14,649
Again, all due respect...
Chuck's a stuck-up douchebag.

658
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:18,951
I hate to break it to you,
but he doesn't even like you.

659
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:21,455
He's my brother.

660
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,759
Okay.

661
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:30,096
I... I get it... family.

662
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:32,631
You got to go back. But...

663
00:34:40,473 --> 00:34:42,776
Remember this?

664
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:44,447
The rolex thing. What...

665
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,448
Whatever happened to the guy
who used to sell us those?

666
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:49,115
Jin Kang? He got deported.

667
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:53,484
This is the last one. I say we go for it.

668
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,153
No. Oh, come on.

669
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:56,621
Last time, we did what? $600?

670
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:59,356
The hot streak we're on,
I bet we break a grand, easy.

671
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,590
I could lend you some cash.

672
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:03,425
I don't need the money, Jimmy.

673
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,992
I need this.

674
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:06,127
Come on.

675
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:07,962
You say you're happy
doing wills or whatever,

676
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:09,929
good for you, man, seriously.

677
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:10,996
But I got to tell you...

678
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,833
Standpipes ain't cutting it for me, man.

679
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:17,802
I got nothing, Jimmy.

680
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:20,068
Give me this.

681
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:23,203
Give me this, man.

682
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:24,538
I can't do it.

683
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:26,172
Come on. Give me this.

684
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,306
Marco. Give me this.

685
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,141
Come on. Come on. Buddy, listen to me.

686
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:30,309
I'm listening. Come on.

687
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:31,644
Hey. Just one last time.

688
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,980
Come on. I'm not being hypnotized.

689
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:34,815
No? Okay. Come on, one more time.

690
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,950
I can't do it.

691
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:37,386
Just one more... one more.

692
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,889
Hey, listen to me. Just listen to you.

693
00:35:38,924 --> 00:35:40,425
- Yeah, I'm listening. Come on.
- No.

694
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:49,970
Yeah!

695
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:51,304
It's got to come from the gut, man.

696
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,473
Yeah. Yeah.

697
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,146
Oh, that's crazy.

698
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,980
Just like a wolf. Go ahead.

699
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:00,815
No, deeper, deeper.

700
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,920
Yeah, and you do that
right at the moment of,

701
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,254
you know, pure joy...

702
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:08,255
Yeah... And it will escalate it 10...

703
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:10,761
10 times.

704
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,596
- There's something...
- Hey.

705
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,797
- It's prehistoric.
- Hey, hey. Look.

706
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:27,751
$50, $200, $400.

707
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,589
Whose is it? I don't know.

708
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:32,294
There's got to be 1,000 bucks in here.

709
00:37:32,328 --> 00:37:35,296
Somebody must have...

710
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,965
Oh.

711
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:40,169
Oh, damn.

712
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:51,919
Is he, uh...

713
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:53,288
I don't know.

714
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:29,718
Hey, buddy, you with us?

715
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:33,556
Look, the guy's just had too many.

716
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:37,559
I say we move on. You want to split this?

717
00:38:37,593 --> 00:38:40,230
Marco, you okay?

718
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:42,231
Marco?

719
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:43,731
What... do you know this guy?

720
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:46,235
Hey, call 911.

721
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:48,608
Call 911!

722
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:52,579
Hey!

723
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,054
I need an ambulance.

724
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,723
My friend's having a heart attack.

725
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,728
We're in an alley,

726
00:39:03,762 --> 00:39:05,629
uh, southeast of Lasalle and Shermer.

727
00:39:05,663 --> 00:39:07,464
No, I-i don't know.

728
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,798
He was like this when I found him.

729
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:10,265
Hey, hold...

730
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,032
Marco, Marco, you with me?

731
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:14,534
You with me? I screwed up.

732
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,903
No, you did... you did good, buddy.

733
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,404
Just hold on, all right?
They're on their way.

734
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:19,738
They'll be here in a minute.

735
00:39:19,772 --> 00:39:20,738
Jimmy, you know what?

736
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:22,073
Just s-save your breath, okay?

737
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:23,540
You're gonna be fine.

738
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:27,278
This was the greatest week of my life.

739
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:35,253
Hey.

740
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:36,755
Hey, hey, hey.

741
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:37,989
Hang in there! Hey!

742
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:41,323
Hey! Hey!

743
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:42,659
Hey, wake up, man!

744
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:45,762
Come on! Marco, buddy!

745
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:49,665
Help!

746
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:53,569
Anybody!

747
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:58,002
Marco!

748
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,034
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Oh, hey, bud.

749
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,935
Can I bum one?

750
00:40:24,252 --> 00:40:26,219
Is that his?

751
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:30,225
Yeah. His mom gave it to me.

752
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,726
Thought it looked familiar.

753
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:33,225
I figured I'd wear it today,

754
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,059
but I don't know.

755
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:37,059
I'm not a big ring guy, so...

756
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:42,196
Still. Could be worth a couple of bucks.

757
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,511
Better head back.

758
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,382
See you inside.

759
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,481
Hey.

760
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,652
Is this Ferris Bueller?

761
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:28,488
Speaking.

762
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:30,121
I don't want to interrupt your big day off.

763
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,123
Just checking in. What are you up to?

764
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,127
You know, burning down the place.

765
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,764
I wouldn't expect any less.

766
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:42,272
So, whatever it was, did you
get it out of your system?

767
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:44,275
Yep, all gone.

768
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,111
Good. I want to run something by you.

769
00:41:47,145 --> 00:41:50,446
The sandpiper case...
It's getting too big for hhm.

770
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,647
Howard's decided to partner
with another firm.

771
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:54,816
Davis and Main. You heard of them?

772
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,985
- Sure, up in Santa Fe.
- Right.

773
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,421
Well, they've heard of you, too,
and they're interested.

774
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,587
They want to make you an offer
contingent on an interview.

775
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,253
They've got a partner-track
position in mind.

776
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:06,420
Wait. What?

777
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:08,924
Partner track? What are you talking about?

778
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,590
I'm talking about
there's an office in Santa Fe

779
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,592
with your name on it, or there could be,

780
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:16,030
and you'd be working on your case.

781
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:19,634
I... well, I...

782
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:23,170
I don't even, uh...

783
00:42:23,204 --> 00:42:25,705
Chuck wouldn't like it.

784
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,373
Chuck has no say in this.

785
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:28,874
You wouldn't be working for HHM,

786
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:31,543
and Chuck can't tell
Davis and Main who to hire.

787
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:32,677
Why me?

788
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:34,847
Is this like a tax write-off
or a charity thing?

789
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:36,280
What's the angle, huh?

790
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:38,950
Jimmy, we've been talking to your clients,

791
00:42:38,984 --> 00:42:40,152
the sandpiper residents,

792
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:42,489
and they ask about you
every chance they get.

793
00:42:42,523 --> 00:42:44,992
I don't know what it is,
but you have a way with them.

794
00:42:45,026 --> 00:42:48,196
Hey. Old people love me.

795
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,368
So... Sounds good?

796
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:58,874
Kim, I can't imagine what
you did to make this happen.

797
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:01,476
Thank you.

798
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,810
I didn't do anything... much.

799
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:06,481
And believe it or not,
Howard's been pushing this, too.

800
00:43:06,515 --> 00:43:08,083
Good, old Howard.

801
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,254
Listen, we're gonna be down
in judge Murray's court

802
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:11,922
on Thursday at 11:00.

803
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,923
The Davis and Main people will be there.

804
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:16,091
It'd be the perfect chance
for you to meet them.

805
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,259
Thursday at 11:00.
All right, I'll be there.

806
00:43:18,294 --> 00:43:19,762
Thanks, Kim, really.

807
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:21,598
I'll see you then.

808
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:35,917
All the originals
need to be copied and filed.

809
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:38,589
See, I've written right here
on the box... "Copy and file."

810
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:40,259
That's to make it as clear as possible.

811
00:43:40,294 --> 00:43:42,594
Got it, Mr. Mcgill. Anything else?

812
00:43:42,629 --> 00:43:43,928
Well, on the grocery front,

813
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:45,764
almost everything was right this time.

814
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:47,600
- Great.
- Almost.

815
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:50,071
Um, it's a small thing, but to my taste,

816
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:52,241
the, uh, Granny Smith apples
are a bit too tart.

817
00:43:52,275 --> 00:43:54,244
- Those are the green ones, right?
- Right.

818
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:57,080
I prefer the red ones,
but not red delicious.

819
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:58,948
Those are generally tasteless.

820
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:00,582
Fujis should be in season.

821
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:03,053
It's not a major issue, but...

822
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:04,723
- Yeah.
- Fuji apples.

823
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:05,723
Okay.

824
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:07,722
Oh, and I'd like to try soy milk,

825
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:08,956
so maybe a half gallon of that.

826
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:11,127
You got it.

827
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:12,628
Well, thank you, Ernesto.

828
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:16,296
I appreciate your attention to detail.

829
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,999
Do you need to write any of this down?

830
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,833
'Cause it's okay if you do.

831
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,668
You know, just to be sure.

832
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,839
So, Fuji apples.

833
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,199
Hey, Ernie.

834
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,034
Hey. How you doing, man?

835
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:50,203
Good, good.

836
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:52,869
So, Howard's got you
looking after Chuck, huh?

837
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,804
Yeah. It's a few extra bucks, you know?

838
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,174
How's he doing?

839
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:58,343
Seems okay, like usual.

840
00:44:58,377 --> 00:45:00,176
I'd say we could grab a beer,

841
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,345
but they're waiting on all that
paperwork back at the office...

842
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,681
You know how it is.

843
00:45:03,715 --> 00:45:05,350
Don't I, though?

844
00:45:05,384 --> 00:45:07,017
See you, Jimmy.

845
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,884
Uh, see you 'round, ernie.

846
00:45:47,553 --> 00:45:52,024
You done business with him before?

847
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:53,693
Right.

848
00:45:53,728 --> 00:45:56,361
Yeah. I'll be there.

849
00:46:24,622 --> 00:46:27,090
Davis and Main and Mcgill.

850
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:30,892
Great to meet you.

851
00:46:30,926 --> 00:46:33,557
Nice to meet you, gentlemen.

852
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:35,892
It's good to meet you.

853
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,094
Nice...

854
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,651
Well, that was quick.

855
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:08,320
- No charge.
- Help me out here.

856
00:47:08,354 --> 00:47:14,326
Did I dream it, or did I have
$1,600,000 on my desk in cash?

857
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:17,564
When I close my eyes, I can still see it.

858
00:47:17,598 --> 00:47:20,798
It's burned into my retinas
like I was staring into the sun.

859
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:23,467
No one on God's green earth knew we had it.

860
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:25,137
We could have split it 50/50.

861
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:31,140
We could have gone home
with $800,000 each, tax-free.

862
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,644
Your point being?

863
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:36,279
Why didn't we? What stopped us?

864
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:40,247
I remember you saying something
about doing the right thing.

865
00:47:40,281 --> 00:47:42,751
I don't even know what that means.

866
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:45,988
You want to know
why I didn't take that money?

867
00:47:46,022 --> 00:47:47,990
Is that what you're asking?

868
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:50,126
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

869
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,462
Me, personally... I was hired to do a job.

870
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:56,533
I did it. That's as far as it goes.

871
00:47:56,567 --> 00:48:00,538
Yeah. Well, I know what stopped me.

872
00:48:00,572 --> 00:48:04,374
And you know what?
It's never stopping me again.
