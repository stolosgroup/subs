Good to see you. Welcome home.

329
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,982
Howard, you didn't need to do all this.

330
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:57,318
Oh, I couldn't have
stopped them if I wanted to.

- Yeah. Sure.

Francis. Brenda. Jose, you shaved.

333
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:17,171
To date, we have 68
very willing plaintiffs

334
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:19,298
signed to the class action, with the hopes

335
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,801
of raising that number to 350 or more.

336
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:24,886
Many more, now that we know Sandpiper

338
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:29,558
Fraud, unfair and
deceptive trade practices,

and racketeering.

Jesus. Heh, heh. Guys, this is...

341
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,150
Well, no case is ever a slam dunk.

342
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,110
But I feel as confident about this

343
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:41,945
as anything that's come through our doors.

344

Francis, start putting together
teams to travel out of state.

345

Talk to these residents.

Pair fourths with our best second years.

Laura will take care of the arrangements.

Hey, Howard. I'm glad you're all excited.

352
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:02,132
But can we slow down a second
and discuss terms, maybe?

353
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:04,676
Oh, of course. Kind of shot
out of a cannon with this case.

354
00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:06,220
It's exciting stuff you have here.

355
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,637
I get it.

356
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:09,557
Look, Chuck is already an equity partner.

357
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:11,850
You, as the lawyer who
brought this case to the firm,

358
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:14,895
we could guarantee you, say, 20 percent

359
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:18,148
of the common fund share
of the final settlement.

360
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,526
That will work.

361
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:22,236
That's a few years down the road.

362
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:25,030
As for money for you now, uh,

363
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:27,491
we don't do referral
fees. Chuck will agree.

364
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,159
HHM doesn't view that as ethical.

365
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,619
As we discussed.

366
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,663
But what we could do is
arrange an of-counsel fee

367
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:35,457
for the time that you've already put in.

368

Time that you spent building the case.

369
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:40,212
I think we could go as high as 20,000.

370
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:45,175
That, too, will work. Great.

371
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:47,553
Give us an invoice. I'll
have Helen cut you a check.

Oh, got it right here.

And I'd like to use 312 as an office.

It's right next to Chuck's. I'm sorry?

375
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:58,730
Three-twelve. I know, it's got that view

376
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:00,441
that clients love, but you know what?

377
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:01,942
That's a waste of space.

00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:46,255
- Jimmy, no. No, no, no.
- No, no, it's perfect.

648
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,840
We've already been through all this.

649
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,135
The reasons I'm never gonna leave HHM.

650
00:41:50,136 --> 00:41:52,595
But you don't have to really quit.

651
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:55,306
Okay? You just threaten to quit, right?

652
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,684
You get in a game of chicken with Howard.

653
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,228
He's gotta blink, or HHM goes under.

654
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:03,314
It's a perfect plan. Heh.

655
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,943
- Jimmy...
- If you want us working together.

656
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:10,404
- Ahem.
- You can make it happen easily.

657
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,574
I mean, hey, that reception
you got yesterday at HHM,

658
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:18,370
how about that, right? The whole
lobby of HHM applauding for you.

659
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:20,456
They love you.

660
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,083
Now, you threaten to pull out,

661
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:25,336
Hamlin would be insane to screw with you.

662
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:28,881
You've got the nuclear option.
Launch the doomsday device.

663
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,550
Game over. If working with me

664
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,597
is what you really want, right, Chuck?

665
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,476
You called him.

666
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:43,437
You called Hamlin.

667
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:47,358
I always turn my phone off
before I put it in your mailbox.

668
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,821
Two nights ago, it was
left on. Battery drained.

669
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:55,533
I was so damn sure that
I turned it off, you know.

670
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:57,952
Because I always do.
It's a habit, right? Heh.

671
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,954
So it was nagging me. It was nagging me.

672
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:02,123
So I called the phone company.

673
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:06,418
Turns out there was a
deleted call at 2 a.m.

674
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,588
when I was asleep right there.

675
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,468
And you know whose number? Hamlin's.

676
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,555
The only person who
could have made that call

677
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:21,393
and deleted it is you, Chuck.

678
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,771
Boy, that phone, huh?

679
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:28,774
Phone must have felt like
a blowtorch in your ear.

680
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,609
All that electricity.

681
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,529
All those radio waves right up
against the side of your head.

682
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,948
My God.

683
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,742
What was so important that you had

684
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:40,327
to call Howard before our meeting?

685
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:42,288
The only thing I can think...

686
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:47,793
The only thing that makes sense
is you told him not to hire me.

687
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:51,089
It was always you, right?

688
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,174
Right back to when I passed the bar

689
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:58,096
and tried to join the
firm. You didn't want me.

690
00:43:58,097 --> 00:43:59,722
Speak up.

691
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:02,850
Tell me why.

692
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,894
It's the least you can do for me now.

693
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:06,395
I'm your brother.

694
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,107
We're supposed to look out for each other.

695
00:44:09,108 --> 00:44:12,444
Why were you working against me, Chuck?

696
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:17,698
You're not a real lawyer.

697
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,033
I'm what?

698
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:22,287
You're not a real lawyer.

699
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:25,539
University of American
Samoa, for Christ's sake.

700
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,500
An online course? What a joke.

701
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,920
I worked my ass off to get where I am.

702
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:32,297
And you take these shortcuts

703
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,299
and you think suddenly you're my peer?

704
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,925
You do what I do because you're funny

705
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,260
and you can make people laugh?

706
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,763
I committed my life to this!

707
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:43,808
You don't slide into it
like a cheap pair of slippers

708
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:46,102
and reap all the rewards.

709
00:44:46,103 --> 00:44:47,853
I thought you were proud of me.

710
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:49,730
I was.

711
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:52,108
When you straightened out
and got a job in the mailroom,

712
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,484
I was very proud.

713
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,236
So that's it then, right?

714
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:56,946
Keep old Jimmy down in the mailroom.

715
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,949
He's not good enough to be a lawyer.

716
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,327
I know you.

717
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:04,370
I know what you were, what you are.

718
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:07,290
People don't change.
You're Slippin' Jimmy.

719
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,334
And Slippin' Jimmy I can handle just fine.

720
00:45:09,335 --> 00:45:10,918
But Slippin' Jimmy with a law degree

721
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,045
is like a chimp with a machine gun.

722
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:15,547
The law is sacred!

723
00:45:15,548 --> 00:45:18,092
If you abuse that power, people get hurt.

724
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:20,594
This is not a game.

725
00:45:20,595 --> 00:45:22,721
You have to know... On some level,

726
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:24,682
I know you know I'm right.

727
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:26,185
You know I'm right.

728
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,195
I...

729
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:40,198
I got you a 20-pound bag of ice.

730
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,034
And some bacon, and some eggs,

731
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:46,162
and a couple of those
steaks that you like.

732
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:49,207
Some fuel canisters. It's
enough for three or four days.

733
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:53,461
After that, you're on your own.

734
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:56,589
I am done.

735
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:00,634
Jimmy.

736
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:02,262
Jimmy.

737
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,440
Jimmy.

738
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,027
Jimmy, come back inside.

739
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:24,158
Jimmy.

740
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,869
Jimmy.

741
