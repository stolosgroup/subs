crate onto my loading dock,

502
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,037
seems to be some kind
of spraying system.

503
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:42,606
The invoice number
is 1-9-6-8-AE35.

504
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:45,435
Okay, just, uh, give me a second
to catch up here.

505
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,742
Uh...
Uh, sprayer pump.

506
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:49,004
Yeah, I think I got it.

507
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,832
Omaha, right?

508
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,791
Yes, but I run
a department store.

509
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,705
We don't sell anything
like that.

510
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,620
Clearly this is a mistake
you need to fix.

511
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,275
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

512
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:02,104
My boss is gonna just...

513
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:04,063
Ah, great.

514
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:05,847
Ricky's booked solid.
[Chuckles]

515
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:06,935
Ricky?

516
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,589
He's the driver.

517
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,595
Well, Ricky's just gonna have
to put the box back on the truck.

518
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,727
Uh, little problem with that.

519
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,077
Cargo space.

520
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,296
He's got a pickup
at the airport in an hour.

521
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:22,124
It's a messy one, too.

522
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:25,867
It's, uh, nine hundred pounds
of Spanish mackerel.

523
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,827
Okay. I'm sorry,
but that's not my problem.

524
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,524
No, I know.
It's just... Wow.

525
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:33,527
I mean, if he's late,
that's gonna stink.

526
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,659
Pun intended.
[Chuckles]

527
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,836
Gene?
Everything okay?

528
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:40,795
Yep. Oh, I'm just, uh,
putting out fires.

529
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,405
It's a delivery issue.

530
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,276
Don't worry.Okay.

531
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,060
I got it.

532
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:47,062
Sorry.

533
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,934
You still there?
Kathy: Yes.

534
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:51,545
Look, I don't know what to
tell you about your fish issue,

535
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:53,982
it's just I can't have
a huge box just...

536
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,462
I-I understand.

537
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,743
It's just... I mean,
we both have people

538
00:30:56,767 --> 00:31:00,249
we have to answer to, right?

539
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,772
Hey, I've got an idea.

540
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:03,426
Um, I've got an extra truck.

541
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,124
I could drive over there myself.

542
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,996
Great.
How long till you get here?

543
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,390
Well, I'm just over
in Urbandale.

544
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:14,046
Um, so, if I leave right now,
be there in four hours.

545
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,265
Four hours?
No.

546
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,137
No, no, it's fine.
I don't mind the drive.

547
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,067
I'll crank the tunes,
it'll be like old times.

548
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:23,142
I mean, no, I can't wait
around that long.

549
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:26,275
We're closing
for the night here.

550
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,016
Oh. Whew.

551
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,367
[Sighs]

552
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,196
How's this?

553
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,502
Yeah?

554
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:38,505
If you promise me that...

555
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:43,336
Ricky will get back here
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow...

556
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:45,294
I'll hold the box overnight.

557
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,774
You would do that?

558
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,907
Oh, my God.
You're a lifesaver.

559
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,299
What's your name again?

560
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,084
Kathy.
Kathy.

561
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:55,261
Yeah, my guy'll be there,
10:00 a.m. on the dot.

562
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,915
With flowers.

563
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,569
Well, f-flowers
won't be necessary...

564
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,267
but thanks for the thought.

565
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,487
No, thank you.

Well, better hit it.

574
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,255
Good luck to Lizzie
on that spelling bee.

575
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:17,256
She's a little nervous.

576
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,822
Nah, she's gonna be great.

577
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,260
Yeah. Hey,
Huskers are back.

578
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,826
[Chuckling] Ohh.

579
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,326
Probably heard me screaming
all the way in Lincoln.

580
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,656
I was hoarse.

581
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,963
Uh, and Martinez... ahh.

582
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,879

That's a freshman record!

Wow.
You know what?

I love that kid.

Hey, if he and Kinnie
keep it up,

586
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,494
I think they still got a shot.
