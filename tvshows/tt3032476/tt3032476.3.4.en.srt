that I almost gave
them what they wanted.

they ran like the cowards they are.

Chuck...

669
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,508
I'm very sorry.

670
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,528
I lost my temper, and
I did some things...

671
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,908
so many things that I regret.

672
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:23,258
I shouldn't have broken down your door.

673
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:27,054
Doesn't matter how I was provoked.

674
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,115
I-I shouldn't have done that.

675
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,047
There's no excuse for that.

676
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:34,557
Or for the things that I said.

677
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:36,141
[Clears throat]

678
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,287
I regret it all,

679
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:41,035
all of it more than you can imagine,

680
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,789
because...

681
00:43:43,725 --> 00:43:45,461
'cause you're my brother,

682
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:50,296
and no one should treat
his own brother like that.

683
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,198
Not ever.

684
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,829
Okay?

685
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,406
Ada: All right, then.

686
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:02,241
On to the matter of restitution.

687
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:04,176
Mr. McGill, according to your agreement,

688
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:05,984
you have two weeks to
pay your brother back.

689
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,648
I would like to pay up now, if I may.

690
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,259
You may.

691
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:13,619
The amount is $321.

692
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:16,022
Uh, Ms. Hay. I'm sorry.

693
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:18,790
That figure doesn't
represent a full accounting.

694
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,844
Oh, no?

695
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:24,313
I believe the correct amount is $323.98.

696
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:26,932
That includes the cassette tape...

697
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:28,687
- which was destroyed.
- [Pen clicks]

698
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:30,055
Good. Thank you.

699
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,056
$323.98,

700
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:36,343
including the cassette tape.

[Elevator bell dings]

708
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,703
Howard. Chuck.

709
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:06,572
I'm putting you both on notice
regarding the bar hearing.

710
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:08,908
The first thing, I'm filing a
motion to suppress that tape.

711
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,910
The tape that Jimmy destroyed, you mean?

712
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:12,032
[Sighs]

713
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:13,428
How about we stop with the games?

714
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,081
There's no way there isn't a duplicate.

715
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,415
Really?

716
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,017
Of course there is.

717
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,405
You knew Jimmy was gonna break in.

718
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,600
You<i> wanted</i> him to.

719
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,969
There's no way you were
gonna let him destroy

720
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:25,461
the only copy of that tape,
so you made a duplicate...

721
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:27,389
- it's the first thing you did.
- Kim...

722
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:28,928
this is not how we do discovery.

723
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,029
Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.

724
00:45:31,054 --> 00:45:32,164
- [Door opens]
- [Groans]

725
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:34,404
Ah, it's fine, Howard. [Breathes deeply]

726
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,570
The original is under lock
and key, and in due time,

727
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:40,172
it will be put into
evidence for your review.

728
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:42,675
So, of course, file
whatever motions you'd like.

729
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:44,844
- It's your privilege.
- I will. Count on it.

730
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:46,946
But, Kim, you should be aware...

731
00:45:46,948 --> 00:45:48,581
because I believe this will be

732
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,583
your first disciplinary hearing...

733
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:53,474
uh, the Bar Association's
standard of proof

734
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:56,388
is far more lenient
than what you're used to.

735
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,716
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

736
00:46:01,372 --> 00:46:02,795
- Chuck.
- Yeah.

737
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:04,489
See you, Kim.
