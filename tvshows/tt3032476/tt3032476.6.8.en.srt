2
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:34,859
No! Shh...

3
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:39,385
Let's talk.

4
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:45,208
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Focus.

5
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,614
Hey!

6
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,177
Both of you, sit.

7
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:56,279
Come on. Sit.

8
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:09,328
I never turned on
you. I didn't. Never!

9
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,059
I only worked for
you in the desert.

10
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,391
I was on your side - the whole time.
- Shh.

11
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:17,771
I don't care.

12
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,644
You two.

13
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:22,559
God.

14
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,188
You two and your mouths.

15
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:25,213
<i>Dios mio.</i>

16
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,083
Now, you listen.

17
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:33,638
My car's downstairs.

18
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:35,924
Press the clicker,
and you'll find it.

19
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,908
This is where you are going.

20
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,615
Don't speed, don't weave,

21
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,275
don't cut anyone off.

22
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:44,888
Just, you know, drive nice.

23
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:47,642
From here, at this hour,

24
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,379
I'd take Forty East.

25
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:50,808
Get off at Carlisle.

26
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,564
Take the third left.
The rest, I drew a little map

27
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:54,419
for you on the back.
It's not hard.

28
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:57,855
So, big white brick house
with a solid black door.

29
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,142
You can't miss it.

30
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:00,774
It's right at the end of the T.

31
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,099
Park a little down the
street, not out in front.

32
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:05,649
It's a quiet neighborhood, so
you'll have plenty of options.

33
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:07,811
Stating the obvious here, maybe,

34
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:09,299
but turn the car off, right?

35
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:12,391
So in the glove compartment,

36
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:13,710
I left you a present.

37
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:14,735
There's a camera.

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,805
And there's a gun.

39
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,737
And you're gonna need both.

40
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:18,111
A gun?

41
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:19,456
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but don't worry.

42
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,810
I mean, it's...
it's very easy.

43
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:23,414
It's a revolver. It's
already loaded, no safety.

44
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,050
It's idiot-proof.

45
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,630
So you go up to that house,

46
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,918
you walk right up
to that black door.

47
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,643
Don't run, just be casual,
like a stroll, you know?

48
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:34,733
Keep the gun somewhere behind
you where they can't see it.

49
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,113
You ring the bell.
You count to three.

50
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:39,549
You step back.

51
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:40,963
They look through the peephole,

52
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,189
you're as innocent as can be.

53
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,989
Door opens,

54
00:04:45,123 --> 00:04:48,213
you point and you shoot.

55
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:50,638
And you keep on pulling that
trigger until it's empty.

56
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:53,605
Simple.

57
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:56,566
Y-You want me to...

58
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,898
I know, I know,

59
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,963
you're a lawyer
and not a killer.

60
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:03,658
But, look, you
can do this, okay?

61
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,755
This guy? He's a housecat.

62
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,001
Black, medium height.
Short hair. Glasses.

63
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:10,946
He kinda looks like a librarian.

64
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:12,451
But don't be fooled.

65
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,466
Even a housecat can scratch.

66
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:16,978
So, that's it.

67
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:18,196
Hard part's over.

68
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,440
Now you pull out the camera.

69
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:20,696
Same principle as the gun,

70
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,939
point and shoot.

71
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,332
Take a picture,

72
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,203
one where I can see the face.

73
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,118
Clearly.

74
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,487
And then you bring it back here,

75
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,706
where me and Mrs. Goodman

76
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,993
will be waiting for you.

77
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,224
And then you're done!

78
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:36,884
I'd say it's about a
twenty-minute drive over there,

79
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,608
twenty minutes back.

80
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:40,871
Maybe ten minutes
to do the job...

81
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,573
Let's call it an
hour all together.

82
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,962
So, you're back here
in an hour or...

83
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:46,032
Send her.

84
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,208
- What?
- She should do it.

85
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:52,372
Jimmy.

86
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:56,364
Why her?

87
00:05:57,154 --> 00:05:58,764
Don't do this.

88
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:01,264
- Don't do this.
- This guy, the, uh... The housecat.

89
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,200
Jimmy, please.

90
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,392
He looks through his peephole
in the middle of the night.

91
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,592
And he sees me?

92
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,482
"Who's
this asshole?

93
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:09,639
"What's he doing here?"

94
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,013
Maybe... Maybe
he gets his gun.

95
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,642
Maybe he calls the cops.

96
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,521
Either way, that
door stays shut.

97
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,428
- Mmm-mmm.
- But, he sees a woman?

98
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,319
- Mmm-mmm. No.
- She looks like she's in distress.

99
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:20,389
- Maybe her car broke down.
- Mmm-mmm.

100
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,783
Phew. I mean, you'd open the
door for her, wouldn't you?

101
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:24,200
Stop. Stop.

102
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,427
Yeah, but...

103
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,441
She's really clever.

104
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,027
How do I know she's
gonna stick to the plan?

105
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:31,171
- She will.
- No, no, no, no.

106
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,793
- No, no.
- No cops.

107
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,099
- You know she will.
- No.

108
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:37,014
Look, this doesn't
even make any sense.

109
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,388
I-I've, uh...

110
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,949
I've never shot a gun before.

111
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:42,865
I've never even - held one.
- Like I have?

112
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,848
Jimmy, what are you doing?

113
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:46,218
You know she's the best choice.

114
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,913
No, I'm not! I-I-I can't!

115
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,740
- I can't do it.
- She can do it.

116
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,265
- You know she can do it.
- No, Jimmy.

117
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,440
- I'll stay. Stop.
- You know I'm right!

118
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:54,466
Just stop.
- Just stop it. - Listen...

119
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:56,705
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Oh, my God. Okay, fine, yeah. Her.

120
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:57,967
Whatever. Give her the keys.

121
00:06:57,992 --> 00:06:59,297
Give her the
address. Let's go.

122
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:04,008
Don't. Don't.

123
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:10,265
You gotta go.

124
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,571
No.

125
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:14,095
No, don't. Don't.

126
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:18,229
Come on.

127
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:19,404
Hey.

128
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:22,103
Let's go.

129
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:35,724
Hold on.

130
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,302
You're gonna need
your shoes, right?

131
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,977
There you go.

132
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,806
Okay, so, one hour starting...

133
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:14,981
now.

134
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,594
Clock's ticking, Mrs. Goodman.

135
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,091
How does a <i>chichifo</i> like you
land a girl like that, huh?

136
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:47,535
Now...

137
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,322
What to do with you?

138
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:00,809
Give me your hands.

139
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,346
Sit.

140
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:22,404
You know, after I saw
you last, I went home.

141
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:24,809
My home.

142
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:26,248
<i>Mi cielito lindo...</i>

143
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:28,888
And you know what happened?

144
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,427
Men came.

145
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:34,434
Armed men,

146
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,185
in the middle of the night.

147
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:38,615
To my home.

148
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:40,771
Trying to get to me.

149
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,497
And you know what they did?

150
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,075
They killed people I care about.

151
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:50,512
They killed my cook.

152
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:52,644
My gardener.

153
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:55,150
A seventeen-year-old kid I
knew since he was knee high.

154
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,948
Never hurt a fly.

155
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,565
Butchered my
housekeeper, Yolanda.

156
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,708
<i>Una viejita, cabron.</i>

157
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:04,568
They shot her in the back.

158
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:07,832
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:12,052
Now, how did these men

160
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,232
get into my home?

161
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,257
Do you know?

162
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:20,818
I have, uh, no idea.

163
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,476
Ow.

164
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:24,888
Ignacio Varga.

165
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:27,021
He let them in.

166
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:30,677
And who did Ignacio
introduce me to?

167
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,250
You.

168
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:37,326
Ignacio? Nacho?

169
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:41,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I-I barely know Ignacio!

170
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:42,868
Whatever he did, he did alone!

171
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,435
Not with me!

172
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,350
Listen, you've
got to believe me.

173
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:47,884
Hand to God, I had
no part in this.

174
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:50,283
It wasn't me. It was... Aah!

175
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:51,834
Ignacio!

176
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,575
It wasn't me!

177
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:55,142
Listen. Listen.

178
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,810
Save it.

179
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:04,826
I'm gonna come back.

180
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:09,537
And then you are gonna
tell me the whole story.

181
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:22,264
<i>He's not so bad as
you think he is.</i>

182
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:23,974
<i>Hello.</i>

183
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,912
<i>Hello, Harry. We were
just talking about you.</i>

184
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,763
<i>Yeah? That ain't
what I pay you for.</i>

185
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,318
<i>She knows enough
about me already.</i>

186
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:32,083
Ford Taurus.

187
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,093
Taupe.

188
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:44,224
<i>What do you mean, London or
England? That's the same thing.</i>

189
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:45,216
<i>It is?</i>

190
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:48,435
<i>London is in England. London's a city.
England... England's a whole country.</i>

191
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,980
<i>I forgot. Oh, brother,
you've got patience.</i>

192
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:53,790
<i>Take it easy. How can
anybody get to be so dumb?</i>

193
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,482
<i>Well, we can't all
know everything, Harry.</i>

194
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,813
<i>Who's Tom Paine, for instance?</i>

195
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,826
<i>I didn't read by him
yet, only about him.</i>

196
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:15,439
<i>But I made a list.</i>

197
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:16,944
<i>Who's Robert Maranville?</i>

198
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:19,037
<i>Who? Robert Maranville.</i>

199
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:20,629
<i>I don't know any Robert.</i>

200
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,005
<i>Think you're so smart, huh?</i>

201
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,249
<i>He used to play shortstop
for the Braves, didn't he?</i>

202
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:26,557
<i>What are you, some kind
of genius or something?</i>

203
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,581
<i>No.</i>

204
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:45,165
Come on.

205
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:23,899
Shit.

206
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:25,422
I knew they had that fire

207
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,033
but I thought they'd fix it up.

208
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,298
I got all my fishing
shirts there.

209
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:32,472
Yeah.

210
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,174
The vented kind? Yeah.

211
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,611
You can get those at REI.

212
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:42,415
If I want to take out a
second mortgage, I can.

213
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,093
Yeah. Right.

214
00:16:22,556 --> 00:16:23,600
Oh! Aah!

215
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,915
<i>No, you don't understand.
I have to go back.</i>

216
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:35,786
<i>What... What are you doing?</i>

217
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:37,005
<i>I-I have go to...</i>

218
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,659
<i>I have to go back.</i>

219
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,673
<i>Ms. Wexler, I'd like
you to sit down.</i>

220
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,492
<i>He-He'll kill him! You
have to... You-y-y-y-you...</i>

221
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,755
<i>You sit there and be calm.</i>

222
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,244
<i>You have to let me go.
I have to get back.</i>

223
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,879
<i>I have to get back!</i>

224
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:53,866
Sit still and stay calm.

225
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:56,493
Now, you take a deep
breath. A deep breath.

226
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:59,331
Nothing's gonna happen here
until you calm yourself.

227
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:00,873
All right?

228
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,441
Now. Who is killing who?

229
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,686
Lalo Salamanca.

230
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,603
Lalo is going to kill Jimmy.

231
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,319
He's there... H-He is
there with Jimmy now.

232
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:12,781
Salamanca's at your apartment?

233
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:14,720
Yes, he sent me!

234
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:16,964
He... He wanted to send
Jimmy, but then he sent me.

235
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,476
To do what, exactly?

236
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,460
Ms. Wexler, you stay with me.

237
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:24,606
What were you
supposed to do here?

238
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,277
Shoot him.

239
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:35,079
I'm... I'm supposed
to shoot him

240
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,628
and then take a photo and
then get back. That's it.

241
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,956
I only have 20
minutes left, please.

242
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,828
- He is alone with him.
- All right. You stay put. You stay put.

243
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,637
We'll handle this.
We will handle this.

244
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,848
You call Tyrus. Get
him to the condo. Now.

245
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:47,460
You said you were watching us.

246
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,676
Where were you? Huh?

247
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,840
Who are you people?

248
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:56,973
Remember what the man said.

249
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,043
You heard all that?

250
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:25,403
All right. You
hunker down here.

251
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,986
You two, you stay with him.

252
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,815
A dog barks too loud, you
are on the phone with me.

253
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:33,285
You two come with me.

254
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,423
<i>Please.</i>

255
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:37,426
<i>Please. Tell me
what's going on.</i>

256
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
<i>Please.</i>

257
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:43,261
<i>Tell me!</i>

258
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,930
Put her on.

259
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:13,584
<i>For you.</i>

260
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:19,975
Why did Lalo send you?

261
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:22,918
<i>Who is this?</i>

262
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,069
<i>Answer him.</i>

263
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,358
<i>He didn't want to
send me. Not at first.</i>

264
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:34,007
<i>He wanted to send my husband.</i>

265
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:38,869
<i>But my husband
talked him out of it</i>

266
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:40,764
<i>because he wanted to
get me out of there.</i>

267
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,334
He talked Lalo out of it.

268
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,905
<i>That's right.</i>

269
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,853
<i>So now I've told you
everything I know.</i>

270
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:52,420
<i>Please. Tell me.</i>

271
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,139
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

272
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,680
Come with me, both of you.

273
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,297
Can't get a clear look inside.

274
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,269
Blinds are down...

275
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,227
Wait.

276
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,466
Something's moving
around in there.

277
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:37,844
Can't tell what.

278
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,867
Copy that.

279
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:42,804
Report.

280
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,920
<i>North corner, clear.</i>

<i>Parking, all clear.</i>

286
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:57,254
<i>Clear on the south.</i>

287
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:58,995
All right, hold the perimeter.

288
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,240
Everyone else, on
me. Eyes sharp.

289
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:02,800
Nice and easy.

290
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:04,836
We don't wanna
spook the neighbors.

291
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:31,797
All quiet, sir.

292
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:43,734
Is there something we
should be looking for?

293
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,268
Hey.

294
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:22,075
Hey. Hey!

295
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:25,239
She's fine. She's safe.

296
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,725
Now, the gag is gonna come off,

297
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:29,727
and I need to ask
you a question,

298
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:32,575
and I need you to answer
it quietly. Got it?

299
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,142
- Mm.
- Huh?

300
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,167
- Mm!
- Yeah.

301
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:42,552
All right. I need to
know where Salamanca went

302
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:45,731
and I need to know exactly
how long he's been gone.

303
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:47,809
Uh... I don't...

304
00:26:49,182 --> 00:26:50,911
I don't know where he went.

305
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,708
He left right after she did.

306
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:09,942
Ah.

307
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:25,938
Okay.

308
00:30:25,963 --> 00:30:27,530

I kept him alive.

315
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:31,776
Kept him broken.

316
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,661
I will save him to the last.

00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:40,659
I'm not running late, am I?

330
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,164
<i>No, Lyle. Punctual as always.</i>

331
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:47,013
Oh, okay. Good. Uh, what
can I do for you, sir?

332
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:49,431
<i>I won't be in today,
I'm sorry to say.</i>

333
00:37:49,456 --> 00:37:51,196
<i>In fact, you won't be
seeing me all week.</i>

334
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,558
<i>I've been called out of town.</i>

335
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,889
<i>Family emergency.</i>

336
00:37:53,914 --> 00:37:55,649
Oh, no. I'm... I'm so sorry.

337
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:58,154
Uh, is there anything I can do?

338
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,144
Do you need a ride
to the airport?

339
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,536
<i>Nothing like that.</i>

340
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:04,356
<i>I need you to act as
store manager in my stead.</i>

341
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:06,451
<i>Unfortunately, at
this late date,</i>

342
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:11,525
<i>this will require you to both
open and close today and tomorrow.</i>

343
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:13,401
Sure. Yes. I can do that.

344
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:16,254
<i>Would you be able to set next
week's schedule by close tomorrow?</i>

345
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:19,792
I like to give the
employees time to prepare.

346
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,171
<i>I'll take care of it.
Don't give it a thought.</i>

347
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,330
I will adjust your pay for the
extra hours upon my return.

348
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:29,055
I hope that that is acceptable.

349
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,560
<i>Of course. Not a problem.</i>

350
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:33,111
<i>Uh, if there's
anything else I can do,</i>

351
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:34,950
<i>like anything at all,
just please let me know.</i>

352
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:37,455
I know I have nothing
to worry about.

353
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,736
The restaurant is in
your capable hands.

354
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:41,580
<i>Well, safe travels, Mr. Fring.</i>

355
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:42,606
Goodbye, Lyle.

356
00:38:44,418 --> 00:38:46,376
Doc just crossed the border.

357
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:48,047
He'll be here in three hours.

358
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:54,367
Sir, you should remain prone.

359
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:55,907
Sam.

360
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:19,616
You happy with the way
things went down tonight?

361
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:21,564
'Cause I'm not.

362
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:25,571
How'd you know Lalo
would be at the laundry?

363
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:27,016
I didn't.

364
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,615
Well, the next time you get a
wild hair to play detective,

365
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,133
tell me.

366
00:39:34,234 --> 00:39:36,844
This could have gone down
a whole lot different.

367
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:41,170
It could have.

368
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:05,020
Yeah?

369
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,008
Okay. I'm on it.

370
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:22,303
What are you doing?

371
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:24,719
You're getting a
new refrigerator.

372
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,711
I'm assuming stainless will do.

373
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:32,461
- Arthur.
- Yeah, Mike?

374
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:34,008
Gloves on.

375
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,283
Downstairs.

376
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,883
Green Jaguar, vanity plates.

377
00:42:00,908 --> 00:42:02,568
It goes to the warehouse.

378
00:42:02,593 --> 00:42:03,593
Done.

379
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,905
Lalo said he was coming back.

380
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,589
He's not coming.
- No. But he said he was.

381
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:13,573
He told me... You understand me.

382
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,707
He is not coming back.

383
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,098
Let's sit.

384
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:22,106
Sit.

385
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:34,038
All right, here's
what's gonna happen.

386
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:37,104
In a few days, Howard
Hamlin's car will be found

387
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:39,505
several states
away, by the water.

388
00:42:39,952 --> 00:42:44,392
The odometer will have rolled to the exact
number of miles it took to get there.

389
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:47,356
There will be cocaine
in the upholstery.

390
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,559
That's the story you were
setting up for this guy, yeah?

391
00:42:52,942 --> 00:42:54,494
They'll call it a suicide,

392
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:56,608
hoping the body will
come washing up.

393
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,790
It never will.

394
00:42:58,815 --> 00:43:00,860
At some point, you're
gonna hear about it.

395
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,598
Someone calls you, someone at
the courthouse mentions it.

396
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:07,927
The moment that happens,
you call the cops.

397
00:43:07,991 --> 00:43:10,646
His car was here for
hours last night.

398
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,195
Good chance somebody noticed it.

399
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,809
That means you are the last
people to see him alive.

400
00:43:17,718 --> 00:43:19,494
Cops are gonna
wanna hear from you.

401
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,521
You tell the cops you saw him.

402
00:43:21,695 --> 00:43:23,175
He came here.

403
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,463
Seemed like maybe he
was chemically altered.

404
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,348
Didn't make a lick of sense.

405
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:29,708
Then he left.
That's all you know.

406
00:43:30,053 --> 00:43:33,098
You keep telling the lie
that you've been telling.

407
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,312
Now, Ms. Wexler tells me
she has court at 10:00.

408
00:43:39,564 --> 00:43:41,059
What's on your docket?

409
00:43:43,238 --> 00:43:45,066
Hey. Listen.

410
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,503
Where do you need to be?

411
00:43:47,677 --> 00:43:51,116
Uh... Office. My office.

412
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:53,637
Clients start showing
up around 9:30.

413
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:56,009
Oh, my car's gone.

414
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,488
No. It's on the way home.

415
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,364
You'll have it when you need it.

416
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,782
So, you two are gonna
go about your day.

417
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,254
Normal. Same as ever.

418
00:44:05,111 --> 00:44:07,942
Today, you're Meryl Streep
and Laurence Olivier.

419
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:10,831
No staring into space.

420
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,163
Nothing out of the
ordinary. You cover.

421
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:14,980
Anybody talks to you,

422
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,700
it's just another day that
ends in "Y," that's all.

423
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:20,512
When you get home, we'll be gone

424
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:22,887
and everything will be
back the way it was.

425
00:44:23,657 --> 00:44:28,618
Now, I need to
impress upon you...

426
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,208
None of this ever happened.

427
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,684
None of it.

428
00:44:34,768 --> 00:44:36,028
Understand?

429
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,176
Say it out loud.
I need to hear it.

430
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:41,005
We understand.

431
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:44,270
It never happened.

432
00:44:45,698 --> 00:44:47,309
All right, I'm
gonna go out there

433
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:48,901
and you're gonna get ready.

434
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:51,015
Before I shut that door,

435
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,879
is there anything you
need from the other room?

436
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:55,720
Toiletries? Clothes?
Anything to start your day?

437
00:44:55,745 --> 00:44:57,138
No.

438
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,126
We're set.

439
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,103
Hold it.

440
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,049
Go ahead.

441
00:47:10,837 --> 00:47:12,197
Easy.

441
00:47:13,305 --> 00:48:13,425
