00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,483
You can move the red five up.

3
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:38,904
Oh, yeah.

4
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,737
Thank you, sir.

5
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,326
Why do the cards have holes in them?

6
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:46,077
Oh, they're....

7
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:48,580
these are used cards from the casino.

8
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:51,348
Once the casino pulls a deck
of cards out of action...

9
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,628
they drill a hole through them
and sell them to the public.

10
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:58,048
- Just a buck or two.
- Huh.

11
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,925
Look at that.

12
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,387
I suppose that's to prevent
people from cheating with them.

13
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:06,056
Yeah.

14
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:08,158
Makes for a good souvenir.

15
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:10,685
- These are from Caesars.
- Hm?

16
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,164
I've never been.

17
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,655
Getting dark.

18
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,801
I hate to say it, but I think it
might be time to kill the lights.

19
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,120
Oh, yes, sir. Of course.

20
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,250
You sure I can't make you a cup of tea?

21
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,418
I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

22
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:37,254
All right, then.

24
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,370
Just what I needed.

25
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,985
Drink up, guys. Don't
need you falling asleep.

26
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:23,363
Hey, you take care of that battery?

27
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,032
Oh, yeah. It finally
shit the bed, but...

28
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:28,827
we swapped it out a couple hours ago.

29
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:31,805
Okay, how'd it go?

30
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,248
No problem.

31
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:36,918
- Anyone see you?
- No. Dead over there.

32
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,047
All right.

33
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:42,841
Stay awake.

34
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:31,979
Hello?

35
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:34,023
Oh, hey. Come on in.

36
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,943
Hi. I'm Francesca Liddy.

37
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:39,320
- I'm here for the interview.
- Oh. Jimmy McGill.

38
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,964
Hey, are you running
early, or am I running late?

39
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:43,758
No, sorry. I'm a little early.

40
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:46,285
It's not a problem.
Never bad to be early...

41
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:48,746
except in death and taxes, and...

42
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:51,334
some other things.

43
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:54,335
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

44
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,661
Does that look straight to you?

45
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,538
Uh....

46
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,599
I think there... that side...

47
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:04,460
I think you're a little crooked.

48
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,528
The bottom of the "M" there.

49
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:12,760
Yeah. A little crooked.

50
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,431
So you're coming off of
seven years at the MVD?

51
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,742
- I am, yeah.
- Here's a question.

52
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:23,271
How come New Mexico doesn't call
it the DMV like every other state?

53
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:25,716
Well, that's a great question.

54
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,458
Just like in Arizona...

55
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:30,837
the Motor Vehicles Division
is part of the DOT, a division.

56
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:33,081
Whereas, in most other
states, the DMV...

57
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,706
or Department of Motor
Vehicles is its own entity.

58
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,707
So I don't know if that
answers the question,

59
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:40,847
except to say that's
the government for you.

60
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:44,792
You got that right. Well, I for
one, am not calling it the MVD.

61
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:47,278
DMV all the way.

62
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,053
What do you think you learned
the most working there?

63
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,470
Patience. Diplomacy.

64
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:55,057
You meet all sorts of people down there.

65
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:57,355
And most are really
great, really friendly,

66
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,900
but you encounter some who are upset...

67
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,702
- ...belligerent.
- What about old folks?

68
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,080
- You get your fair share of them?
- Oh, lots of elderly drivers.

69
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,894
After 75, they need to
take their test again,

70
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,160
so if they don't pass...
you have to explain to them

71
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,855
why their license isn't being
renewed, which is hard for them.

72
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:14,781
What do you say then? Do you ever...

73
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:17,075
yell at them? I mean, geezers, right?

74
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:19,034
How can you not?

75
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,990
No, I would never. No.

76
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:25,583
Nor should you. That
was a trick question.

77
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,940
You passed with flying
colors. Very good.

78
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:30,046
Heh, okay. Well, then...

79
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:33,049
so Jimmy and I have
very different needs.

80
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,220
His practice is mostly
wills for senior citizens...

81
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:40,765
while I'm focused on a single
client at the moment, Mesa Verde...

82
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,810
with banking regulations that
generate a ton of paperwork.

83
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:47,306
So I'm looking for someone
with an eye for organization...

84
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:49,482
- ...and detail.
- Well, DMV's great for that.

85
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,609
Tons of detail in
those driver's licenses.

86
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,611
We did see hundreds of people every day.

87
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:56,865
And you'd never want to let a
mistake slip through on their forms.

88
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,037
You'd have a horrible
cascade of problems.

89
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:01,035
Sounds challenging.

90
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:03,489
So why the law?

91
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:06,332
I mean, why leave the DMV or MVD?

92
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:09,650
I have to imagine you'll be
giving up a good benefits package.

93
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,427
Good health care and
retirement plans, but...

94
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:15,430
there's a bureaucracy to
government work, that...

95
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:18,141
ultimately became too frustrating.

96
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:20,560
I guess what you'd call
it, too much red tape.

97
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:23,105
I just wanna be somewhere
I can make a difference.

98
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,521
Well, that's us. We're all
about making a difference.

99
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:28,396
And I see here both Word and
Excel, you're comfortable with?

100
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,136
- Absolutely.
- Excel and Word, wow!

101
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,222
Well, you had me at old people.

102
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,661
Hey, here's a question.
Can you start today?

103
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,833
- I....
- Can...

104
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:38,107
Yes?

105
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:39,538
- Fantastic.
- No, can you...

106
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,315
can you just give us
a second, Francesca?

107
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,187
Absolutely. I.... Of course. Um....

108
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,647
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

109
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,995
What are you doing?

110
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,579
What? I like her.

111
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,332
"Can you start today?"

112
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,916
Don't you think we should
see more résumés...

113
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,167
like, a lot more?

114
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,378
She is our first interview.

115
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,983
- We haven't checked her references.
- So we'll check them.

116
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,217
Kim, you've been taking forever
searching for a paralegal.

117
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,011
- We need help here.
- Haven't found the right fit.

118
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,305
Yeah, because you're
searching for perfection...

119
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,716
and perfection is the
enemy of perfectly adequate.

120
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,393
- That's the bar? Adequate?
- She's more than adequate.

121
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,803
She worked at the DMV.

122
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,699
That's like the fifth circle of hell.

123
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:24,649
Look, she's overqualified.
If it doesn't work out...

124
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,568
we can fire her. It's no big deal.

125
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,597
Don't you think someone with actual
legal experience would be better?

126
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,907
Look, I've got a commercial
airing in 11 minutes...

127
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,493
so the phones are gonna be ringing
off the hook. And I need help.

128
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,662
Can we give her a test run, please?

129
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,657
I got a good feeling about this.

130
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,244
Come on, Kim.

131
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,875
Now, getting these oldsters to
call, that's half the battle, so...

132
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,681
- they need to hear a friendly voice.
- Friendly? Absolutely.

133
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:55,595
Speak loudly and clearly...

134
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,994
but be careful with the loud and clear

135
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,244
because it can come off as angry.

136
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,644
Be folksy.

137
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:04,080
- Put a little sunshine in your voice.
- Got it.

138
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,487
Okay. You need coffee or water?

139
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:07,150
You need to hit the
head before things...

140
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,970
Oh. There it goes. Heh.

141
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,533
Offices of Jimmy McGill.
How may I help you?

142
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,727
I'm sorry. May I put you on hold?

143
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,291
Thank you.

144
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,564
Offices of Jimmy McGill. Please hold.

145
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,326
Sorry about that.

146
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,392
What can I do for you?

147
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,205
Uh.... that's right.

148
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,093
Jimmy McGill from the commercial.

149
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,650
Would you like to come
in for a consultation?

150
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,900
Folksy. Be folksy.

151
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,408
Say, is that a dog I'm hearing?

152
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:46,438
It is? Aw. What's her name?

153
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:49,657
Yeah, Cracker Barrel. It always
helps to mention Cracker Barrel.

154
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,627
Well, I think it's great
you let Margaret play inside.

155
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,269
It's a hot one out there.

156
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,135
I was thinking of
going to Cracker Barrel

157
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,103
because they've got
great air-conditioning.

158
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:03,153
Well, yes, I love their biscuits too.

159
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:06,149
Well, that's wonderful. Mm-hm.

160
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:08,861
Yes, I think a will is really important.

161
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,579
When would you like to
come in and meet Mr. McGill?

162
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,490
"Jimmy." Jimmy.

163
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:15,611
Always Jimmy.

164
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,339
Uh, this Friday is open.

165
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,742
Yes. Jimmy has a 9:00
free. Will that work?

166
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:24,755
Fantastic. Can you
spell your name for me?

167
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:29,224
And a number we can reach you at?

168
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:38,065
Okay, Dorothy. Look
forward to seeing you.

169
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,466
You betcha.

170
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,805
Bye, now.

171
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,047
I am so sorry. Thank you for
holding. How may I help you?

172
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,247
Well, I can set you
up with an appointment.

173
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,883
Jimmy is busy at the
moment, but if you'd like...

174
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,564
You sound like you're outdoors.

175
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:57,797
Are you staying out of the
sun? It's a hot one today.

176
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:02,113
I'm sorry, but Jimmy is
unavailable at the moment.

177
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,470
If you'd like to leave a message, Mr...

178
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:06,625
Ehrmantraut?

179
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:09,905
"Trout," like the fish?

180
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:14,977
Uh, I hear Cracker Barrel
has excellent air...

181
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:18,497
This one don't wanna
talk about Cracker Barrel.

182
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:20,532
Yeah, patch that one through.

183
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,025
Mr. McGill will take your call.

184
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:30,683
- Hey.
- Your new assistant's a real pip.

185
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:33,384
Yeah, thanks for crushing
her spirit on the first day.

186
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,525
Thank you, sir. You drive safe.

187
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,859
You the only one on this line?

188
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,445
Yeah, only me. What's up?

189
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,872
You free for breakfast tomorrow?

190
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:56,218
All right. This is what you're gonna do.

191
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:57,542
You're gonna go inside,

192
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,056
buy a cup of coffee, a meal,
whatever, and sit in a booth.

193
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:03,267
Sometime in the next 10 to 15 minutes...

194
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,521
a guy in an old green Chevy Blazer
is gonna pull into that parking lot.

195
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:10,357
He'll take a knapsack,
and he'll go inside.

196
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,651
I need you to keep an
eye on the knapsack.

197
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:14,486
Let me know what he does with it.

198
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:15,964
Does he take anything out of it?

199
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:18,574
Does he switch the bag with someone?

200
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,951
Does he leave something
from the bag inside?

201
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,078
Right, right, right. I got it.

202
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,039
Green Chevy Blazer, black top.

203
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,729
Yeah, what's in the bag?

204
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,834
Is it money?

205
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,455
It's gotta be money.

206
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,475
Drugs? Is it drugs?

207
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,276
Something else? Well,
um, I'm guessing money.

208
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,745
- Tell me I'm right.
- He is gonna be here any minute.

209
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,610
Now, I need you inside.

210
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:42,529
You gonna do the job or not?

211
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,606
Fine. I'll do the job.

212
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:47,125
You charmed me into it.

213
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:08,691
Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

214
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:12,660
Uh, I'll have a Pollos
Classic and a coffee, black.

215
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,103
Would you like the pollos
bonus size for 50 cents more?

216
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,688
No. Normal.

217
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,273
Dining in or to go?

218
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:19,649
Dining in.

219
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,693
- Will that be all today?
- Uh, yeah.

220
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:23,693
Your total's $3.19.

221
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,396
Thank you.

222
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:31,592
- Do you want any extra salsa?
- No. Ketchup.

223
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,525
One eighty-one.

224
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:47,010
Hi. What can I do for you?

225
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:49,804
Can I get a number four, please?

226
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:51,632
Yes, sir.

227
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,218
- Here you go, sir.
- Oh.

228
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,978
- Have a great day.
- Yeah. You too.

229
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,507
Yeah, I'll just take a diet.

230
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,571
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

231
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,626
What can I do for you?

232
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,384
Can I get a number four, please?

233
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:15,243
Yes, sir.

234
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:18,938
- Is that for here or to go?
- It's for here.

235
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:26,852
Classic.

236
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,431
Sure, if there's one open.

237
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,330
Oh, yeah.

238
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,736
Yeah. Thank you.

239
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:42,349
Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

240
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:58,448
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

241
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,978
- Will that be all today?
- Is that for here or to go?

242
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:14,172
Thank you. Have a great day.

243
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:26,029
- Really?
- Yeah.

244
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:36,536
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. Can I take your order?

245
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:39,740
Give me a number
three. Potatoes, coffee.

246
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,750
Would you like the pollos
bonus size for 50 cents more?

247
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:44,995
- No.
- Dining in or to go?

248
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:46,664
In.

249
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:47,936
Will that be all?

250
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,108
- Four eighty-nine.
- Yeah.

251
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,304
When you get behind the eight ball....

252
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,193
Sure. You're right.

253
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:55,584
Yeah, no problem.

254
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:59,014
- Do you need any extra salsa?
- Yeah. Give me that.

255
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:13,044
Here's a number three.

256
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,602
Here you go. Have a great day.

257
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:30,960
Manuel, where's my 22?

258
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:33,616
Coming up.

259
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,795
Pick it up.

260
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:18,295
Thank you for coming
to Los Pollos Hermanos.

261
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,607
Have a great day now.

262
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,689
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

263
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:43,135
You ready or are you still looking?

264
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,266
Sorry. I'm still trying to decide.

265
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,337
Okay, just let me know when.

266
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:25,849
Can I help you?

267
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:29,703
Uh....

268
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:33,397
my watch, uh, clasp is loose. It...

269
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:35,804
falls. I tried to reach it. Heh.

270
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:38,027
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

271
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:39,288
Allow me.

272
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,785
You know, they say a nice watch
band is as important as the watch.

273
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:48,030
That's what I get for cheaping out.

274
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,624
We'll find it for you.

275
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:55,711
Where the heck is it?

276
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:58,748
Oh, don't worry. If
it's in here, I'll... Ah.

277
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:00,880
There it is.

278
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,805
May I clean this for you?
We have alcohol wipes.

279
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:08,224
No, it's been in worse places.

280
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:10,601
Thank you. That was very nice of you.

281
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:12,935
No problem. It's my pleasure.

282
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,733
Is there anything else I can do for you?

283
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:16,294
Uh.... no.

284
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:17,983
Thanks.

285
00:28:17,984 --> 00:28:19,583
You take care.

286
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,739
- Tell me again.
- Jesus.

287
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,473
How many different ways
you want me to say it?

288
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,480
Just tell me what you saw.

289
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,779
He came in, like you said he would.

290
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:33,980
He ordered the number three
with potatoes and coffee...

291
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,077
went bold with the extra salsa...

292
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:39,527
and he paid cash out of
his left front pocket.

293
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,027
Took his tray of food,

294
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,610
sat in a booth on the east
side of the restaurant...

295
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:45,418
and put the knapsack on the floor.

296
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:46,637
Where on the floor?

297
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:49,199
Under his seat, between his legs.

298
00:28:49,224 --> 00:28:51,347
Nobody touched it.

299
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:55,146
He didn't talk to anybody. He
didn't even look at anybody.

300
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:57,801
Finished his meal in five
minutes tops, and skedaddled.

301
00:28:57,826 --> 00:28:59,650
Didn't leave anything behind.

302
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,696
- And you're sure of that?
- I literally checked the trash can.

303
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:06,339
There was nothing in there but trash.

304
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,327
So...

305
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:12,538
what's our next move, huh?

306
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:14,474
Are we gonna follow this guy?

307
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:18,753
Because you... you got some
real James Bond stuff in here.

308
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:21,005
This car doesn't have
an ejector seat, does it?

309
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:23,326
I think we're done for today.

310
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,865
- That's it?
- That's it.

311
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:30,201
I mean, I cleared my morning.

312
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:33,357
What, we're not gonna do, like...

313
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:35,978
tail him to a new location?

314
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,515
Or, I mean, we gotta sit
on him, at least, I...

315
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:40,967
Thanks for your time.

316
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:51,619
Hey.

317
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,945
Who's got your back, huh?

318
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,680
Me. That's who.

319
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:01,981
I'll keep that in mind.

322
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,680

323
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,441
Oh, Kim, the conference call
with the Arizona regulator...

324
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:03,731
needs to be rescheduled. Thursday okay?

325
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,581
- Oh, yeah. That's fine.
- Okay.

326
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,363
Francesca, have we got any more
of those dietetic butter cookies?

327
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,240
- I can check.
- Thanks.

328
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,956
Welcome, folks.

329
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,489
Hey, Ernie. What's up?

330
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,535
Can't you just come inside?

331
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,243
Sorry.

332
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,220
Thanks.

333
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,283
What are we doing out here?

334
00:33:55,682 --> 00:33:58,759
I didn't wanna call you because
then it would leave a phone record.

335
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,664
I was gonna come in, but...

336
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:04,292
then I thought maybe
Jimmy shouldn't see me.

337
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,781
- So...
- But you just called me.

338
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,455
Oh.

339
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,507
Guess I screwed up already.

340
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,719
Ernie, screwed what up? Why
don't you want to see Jimmy?

341
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,484
Well, it's just....

342
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,547
I'm not sure how to start.

343
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:22,812
You can start by just telling me.

344
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,855
Here's the thing.

345
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,858
I have some information, but
I don't wanna get in trouble.

346
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,776
Trouble with Jimmy?

347
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,944
No.

348
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,313
HHM.

349
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,908
I think I'm bound by
confidentiality, maybe?

350
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,702
I'm a little hazy on the legal points...

351
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,915
but if I tell you what I
heard and not Jimmy directly...

352
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,742
like....

353
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,335
like we have a buffer...

354
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,296
- ...then legally, I'm safe?
- Ernie.

355
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,656
What the hell are you talking about?

356
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,378
I'm... I'm just worried about Jimmy.

357
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,630
But if I tell him...

358
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:01,709
I don't wanna get in trouble too.

359
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,101
Tell Jimmy what?

360
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,329
Lily, I wanna thank you
for bringing your mom down.

361
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:12,776
It was a delight to
meet you, young lady.

362
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,069
Thank you, Jimmy.

363
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,363
Tell your friends, even if
they already have a will...

364
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,033
it's important to get it
updated, just like you did.

365
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,368
- I'll tell them.
- Now, you remember Francesca.

366
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,464
She'll take care of
you the rest of the way.

367
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,872
All right, who's next?

368
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,042
Mr. Witchell. Mr.
Witchell, come on down.

369
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,502
You're the next contestant
on The Price is Right.

370
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,212
Jimmy, can I have a moment?

371
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,610
Excuse me, sir.

372
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:34,910
Looks like everything is....

373
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:37,354
Apologies, Mr. Witchell.
Just be a second, folks.

374
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:38,645
Oh, my gosh. Have you guys had the soup

375
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,748
over at Cracker Barrel today?

376
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,034
What?

377
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:46,613
What?

378
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:49,339
Hey, come on. I got people out there.

379
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:51,694
- Hello. I can't...
- Give me a dollar.

380
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:53,662
- Give you a dollar?
- Hand me a dollar.

381
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:55,034
- Come on.
- Okay.

382
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:58,667
- All I got's a twenty.
- Fine. Whatever.

383
00:35:58,668 --> 00:36:00,126
All right.

384
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:01,670
I'm your lawyer now.

385
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:04,097
If anyone asks me what I
know, we have confidentiality.

386
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,456
- Why do we need confidentiality?
- Jimmy...

387
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,393
...what did you say to Chuck?

388
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:11,380
Oh.

389
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,030
Here it comes.

390
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:15,263
Howard, right? Did Howard call?

391
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:18,215
Relax. No. Let me explain, please.

392
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,574
Please.

393
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:22,118
Kim, let me set the stage for you, okay?

394
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,953
When I went to Chuck's
place last week...

395
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:26,661
it was like the inside of a
Jiffy Pop wrapper, all right?

396
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:28,187
There was Mylar on the walls.

397
00:36:28,212 --> 00:36:30,838
There was Mylar on the
ceiling. The ceiling.

398
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:32,873
He thought his brain wasn't working

399
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:36,049
because of the Mesa
Verde event and so...

400
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,426
I kind of told him that he was right...

401
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:40,178
about everything.

402
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,096
I had to. He... he...

403
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:44,599
Kim, he was broken. He was a broken man.

404
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,576
I couldn't leave him
in crazy town like that,

405
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:49,285
so I told him just to
make him feel better.

406
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,856
Doesn't matter what he says.
Doesn't matter who he tells.

407
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:55,185
- Because it's my word against his.
- Jimmy, there's a tape.

408
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:57,639
What?

409
00:36:57,664 --> 00:37:00,810
There is a tape recording
of you talking to Chuck.

410
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:04,077
What do you mean? Who?

411
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:06,572
Who... he... he taped me? How?

412
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,872
I don't know how.

413
00:37:07,873 --> 00:37:09,707
He just did, okay?

414
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,335
- Ernie told me.
- Ernie told you?

415
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:14,115
He said Chuck has a
tape recorder wrapped

416
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,297
in a space blanket in his desk drawer.

417
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:17,936
Ernie was putting new
batteries in it, for Chuck...

418
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,083
and the tape rolled for a
few seconds and he heard you.

419
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,363
Your voice saying something
about switching 1261 to 1216.

420
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:28,583
So clearly, it was this
confession of yours.

421
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:32,907
He taped me?

422
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,892
Yes, Jimmy.

423
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:52,712
But I'm not sure what
he can do with it...

424
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,942
legally, anyway.

425
00:37:58,924 --> 00:38:01,161
I'm gonna have to do some research.

426
00:38:02,052 --> 00:38:04,645
He made that tape for a reason...

427
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,997
and we just have to figure out why.

428
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:15,278
Jimmy?

429
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:20,115
I gotta get back to it.

430
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:22,321
The lobby's full of clients.

431
00:38:22,322 --> 00:38:23,521
Okay.

432
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:27,240
We'll figure this out.

433
00:38:28,454 --> 00:38:30,045
Yeah. I know.

434
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,509
Sorry for the delay, everyone.

435
00:38:34,534 --> 00:38:36,961
Mr. Witchell, thank
you for your patience.

436
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:39,196
I see you brought paperwork.

437
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:42,923
I gotta say...

438
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,074
I would never have thought
to collect bottle caps.

439
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:49,119
Oh, it's a wonderful hobby.

440
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,914
What excites me is the hunt. Heh.

441
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,916
I can imagine.

442
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,791
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Tiller.

443
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:57,753
Why, thank you, Jimmy.

444
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:01,010
- All right, then. You drive safe.
- Oh, I do.

445
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:11,475
Is that the last one, or we got
any stragglers coming through?

446
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:12,898
Last one.

447
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,668
Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.

448
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:18,360
You were great today.

449
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:19,862
You too.

450
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:21,695
Those folks love you.

451
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,864
Who doesn't?

452
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:37,129
And that's U.S. v. McKeever?

453
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,833
Right. No, it makes sense.

454
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:42,153
You were a tremendous help, Professor.

455
00:39:42,177 --> 00:39:43,902
Thanks for finding the time.

456
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:47,761
You too.

457
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:49,550
Thanks again.

458
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:58,645
Francesca, could you do me a favor?

459
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,221
Can you go through the Mesa
Verde files, in my office...

460
00:40:01,246 --> 00:40:03,486
and pull all the ones
labeled "CRA evaluations"...

461
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:04,528
and sort them by date?

462
00:40:04,553 --> 00:40:05,973
I need to make sure I
have the most recent.

463
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:08,152
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

464
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:10,394
- I'll join you in a minute.
- Okay.

465
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:14,862
So...

466
00:40:15,465 --> 00:40:18,081
just got off the phone with
my old Crim-Pro professor.

467
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,760
Oh, yeah? What'd he say?

468
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:20,970
Well, as we know...

469
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:22,269
New Mexico is one-party consent,

470
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,706
so Chuck had a right
to make the recording.

471
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:28,553
But you went to him worried
for his mental health.

472
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,856
You said the things you did to
make him feel better, which...

473
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:35,026
mitigates the admission of
guilt, at the very least.

474
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,696
We can poke holes in the custody...

475
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:41,574
throw doubt the voice on
the tape is even yours.

476
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:42,722
Even failing that,

477
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:45,536
its probative value doesn't
outweigh how prejudicial it is.

478
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:48,998
I think we can get the whole
thing bounced under 403.

479
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,128
Probably get it excluded outright.

480
00:40:53,003 --> 00:40:54,721
So then...

481
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:57,917
outside the courts, what can he do?

482
00:40:59,217 --> 00:41:01,807
Play the tape for Kevin at Mesa Verde?

483
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:05,347
He hasn't up to now. I'd have
heard something, for sure.

484
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:07,059
And you know what? I
don't think he's going to.

485
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,393
I don't think Howard won't let
him near Mesa Verde with that tape.

486
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:12,542
Howard knows it would
make HHM look terrible.

487
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:22,565
If Chuck has a plan for this
tape, I don't know what it is.

488
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,478
At this point, all we can
do is wait for his move,

489
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:27,235
then act accordingly.

490
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,500
All right, then.

491
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:36,000
Thanks.

492
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:38,102
Sure.

493
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:42,301
Oh, hey, what do you think? Um....

494
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:46,305
it's Etude in Blue
over Daydream Harvest.

495
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:49,975
I wanted it to look like
morning over the Sandias.

496
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:51,470
I like it. It looks nice.

497
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:53,766
It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash?

498
00:41:54,314 --> 00:41:57,733
No. It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash.

499
00:41:57,734 --> 00:41:59,563
It's nice.

500
00:41:59,736 --> 00:42:01,187
Thanks.

501
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:08,486
You okay?

502
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:13,434
Kim, I'm good.

503
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:56,998
Yeah.

504
00:46:13,393 --> 00:46:14,948
Oof!

505
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:55,642
Howard, what are you doing here?

506
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:57,233
Chuck, do you have a second?

507
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:59,652
Did you... you parked
over on the next block?

508
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,595
- Oh, yeah. Way over.
- Yeah.

509
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,337
Uh, phone. Keys.

510
00:47:05,244 --> 00:47:07,306
Hey, you have to hide them.

511
00:47:19,985 --> 00:47:21,360
Everything okay, sir?

512
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:22,945
Yes, thank you, David.

513
00:47:22,946 --> 00:47:25,065
- Give us a moment.
- Yes, sir.

514
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:29,844
- What's up?
- Chuck...

515
00:47:30,662 --> 00:47:32,866
this has been going on
for eight days now...

516
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,332
and really, no indication
that it's going to work.

517
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,961
It will work.

518
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,329
I think I've been very patient...

519
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:43,531
but the cost of these
around-the-clock private investigators,

520
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:46,055
is really starting to add up.

521
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,762
Howard. This is our duty.

522
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:50,806
As officers of the court...

523
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:53,392
- we have an ethical obligation to...
- Yes.

524
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:55,394
My brother broke the law.

525
00:47:55,395 --> 00:47:57,334
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

526
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,398
I'm not talking about doing nothing.

527
00:47:59,399 --> 00:48:01,278
I just want to...

528
00:48:01,303 --> 00:48:03,068
free up our minds...

529
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:06,708
and be open to alternate
strategies, please.

530
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:09,765
Meet me halfway here.

531
00:48:13,163 --> 00:48:14,880
I suppose...

532
00:48:15,582 --> 00:48:19,369
I suppose we could limit the
investigators to just night-time hours.

533
00:48:19,377 --> 00:48:21,086
- Night-time.
- Yes.

534
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:24,465
Jimmy will most likely break
in while he thinks I'm sleeping.

535
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:26,771
I mean, I wouldn't
put anything past him.

536
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:28,344
It just makes the most sense...

537
00:48:28,345 --> 00:48:30,554
he'll try to steal the tape
under cover of darkness.

538
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:32,389
You really think he's going to do that?

539
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,200
I do, indeed.

540
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:36,052
How can you be so sure?

541
00:48:37,103 --> 00:48:38,721
Howard...

542
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,513
I know my brother.

543
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:44,602
Chuck!

544
00:48:45,904 --> 00:48:47,310
Chuck.

545
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:50,435
Open the damn door, Chuck!

546
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,269
Open the door, damn it. Open it. Chuck.

547
00:48:53,294 --> 00:48:55,235
- Jimmy, go away.
- Open the door! Open it now!

548
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:57,310
- I'm not opening the door.
- I swear to God, Chuck.

549
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:58,617
I am not op...

550
00:48:58,642 --> 00:49:00,302
Jimmy. Jimmy.

551
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:01,860
You taped me?

552
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:03,445
- You asshole.
- Jimmy.

553
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:05,815
You pulled that
heartstrings con job on me?

554
00:49:05,824 --> 00:49:07,872
You piece of shit!

555
00:49:08,576 --> 00:49:10,748
"Oh, my brain used to work.

556
00:49:10,773 --> 00:49:12,538
"I'm sick. I don't know what to do."

557
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:14,114
Asshole!

558
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:16,130
No wonder Rebecca left you.

559
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,685
What took her so long?

560
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:23,489
There it is!

561
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:29,989
Here we go. Here we go.

562
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,474
Here we go.

563
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:40,810
Is this it?

564
00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:44,341
Is this it? Is this it? Huh?

565
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:47,349
For this, you destroyed our family?

566
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:49,408
You happy now? For what?

567
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:51,208
For nothing!

568
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,239
Is that all there is, Chuck?

569
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:57,420
It's all the... all there is?

570
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:00,061
Or did you make copies? Huh, Chuck? Huh?

571
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:03,414
You tell me, or I'll burn this
whole goddamn house to the ground.

572
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:05,150
Jimmy. Jimmy.

573
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:07,085
That's enough.

574
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:09,833
You need to step away.

575
00:50:11,389 --> 00:50:12,587
Howard...

576
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,728
you were a witness
to what happened here?

577
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:17,186
I was.

578
00:50:17,187 --> 00:50:18,562
And you?

579
00:50:18,563 --> 00:50:20,235
I'm a witness.

580
