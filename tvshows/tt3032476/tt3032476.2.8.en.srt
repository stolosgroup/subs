1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:02,724
Previouly, on "Better Call Saul."

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,310
I get my money, or neither
of us walk out of here.

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:09,119
I say the word, my nephews pay
a visit to your granddaughter.

4
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:12,877
I don't ever want to hear the
word "permit" again! Capiche?

5
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:13,903
It's your funeral, dude!

6
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:15,114
You're fired!

7
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,238
I'll just pack up...

8
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:18,217
Partners, you and me!

9
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:19,101
What about clients?

10
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:20,269
Mesa Verde.

11
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:21,827
It'd be a hard sell to
take them with me.

12
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:24,389
Separate firms under one roof.

13
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:27,621
You... do things your way,
and I do them mine.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:31,029
Ahead.

16
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,485
Turn to the left.

17
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:52,310
Step around the back of the truck.

18
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:12,640
Okay.

19
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:23,401
Here you go.

20

21
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,150
You know, I was willing to take you

22
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,141
to a more high-end establishment.

23
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,514
This requires a proper celebration,

24
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,349
so don't think that this counts.

25
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,468
This is perfect.

26
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:30,831
Besides...

27
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,514
we're pinching pennies now.

28
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,585
When we have a steady revenue stream,

29
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,086
make the drive up
to Geronimo every night.

30
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:39,217
- Till then...
- Yes. That.

31
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,480
Let's make that happen.

32
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,317
Okay, here's what ya gotta do.

33
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,743
Type up your resignation letter now...

34
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,136
- I mean, tonight.
- Tonight?

35
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,284
Yeah.

36
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,479
Well, I mean, finish
your hot dog first, but...

37
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:56,546
Now, you put that letter
into Howard's office tonight.

38
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:58,222
It's on his premises.

39
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,499
You've officially given notice.

40
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:00,504
Tomorrow morning,

41
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,835
while he's still out on
the back nine chasin' his balls,

42
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:05,204
you call Mesa Verde
and your other clients,

43
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,172
you bring 'em along.

44
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,473
You get to them before he does.

45
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,137
- No.
- What? No.

46
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,144
You gotta act now.

47
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:13,442
Listen, you do this the "right way,"

48
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,090
you wait, you tell Howard to his face,

49
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:18,719
he'll sink his dirty hooks
into Mesa Verde

50
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:20,987
before you get the words
"I quit" outta your mouth.

51
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:23,360
Okay, Jimmy, I appreciate the advice,

52
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:24,524
but the whole point of this

53
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,160
is for you to be your kind
of lawyer and me to be mine.

54
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:29,859
I need to find a way to do this
that's right for me.

55
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,773
Hey, Kim. Can we make this quick?

56
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,053
I'm kinda swamped right now.

57
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,929
Uh, sure. Thanks for meeting with me.

58
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,023
I only need a few minutes.

59
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:59,258
Great. What's up?

60
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:02,562
Howard, could we do this in your office?

61
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,783
Please?

62
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:15,374
- Again, thanks for taking the time.
- You can just...

63
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,743
go ahead and rip off the Band-Aid.

64
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,630
I have a pretty good idea
why you're here.

65
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:38,397
So, you're going with
Schweikart and Cokely.

66
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,443
- I'm sorry?
- I heard.

67
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:42,001
Through the grapevine.

68
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,570
I'm not going to another firm.

69
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:46,239
I'm starting my own.

70
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:49,108
I figured I'd try giving it a go
as a solo practitioner.

71
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,830
Well.

72
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,281
I, uh...

73
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,417
Wow.

74
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:01,921
I realized it was something
I needed to do.

75
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,257
The week Jimmy exits Davis & Main,

76
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,958
you decide to leave us?

77
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,294
That can't just be happenstance.

78
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:11,764
It's not.

79
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,133
We're gonna be sharing expenses.

80
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,073
One office, but two separate practices.

81
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,373
Smart... on several counts.

82
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,612
Howard...

83
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,613
I want you to know
that I appreciate my time here.

84
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,682
I'm grateful for everything you
and the firm have done for me,

85
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:31,851
especially the financial help
with my schooling,

86
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:34,153
and I'm ready to write a check
for the remainder of the loan.

87
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,095
I just need accounting
to get me that figure.

88
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,271
No need. Our gift to you.

89
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,150
I don't know what to say.

90
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,725
Um...

91
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:48,167
thank you.

92
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:49,388
You earned it.

93
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,673
Tell you the truth, I'm kinda envious.

94
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,174
Really? Why?

95
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,343
Something about a fresh start.

96
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,029
Back in the day,
right out of law school,

97
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,149
I thought long and hard
about hanging up my own shingle.

98
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:04,734
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:09,063
Oh, I was ready to take on
the world, make a difference.

100
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,910
Dad talked me out of it.

101
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,701
Wanted me to join the ranks here,

102
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:19,560
throw another "H" in the firm's logo.

103
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:26,338
Things work out the way
they're supposed to, I guess.

104
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:36,582
Kim, I want you to know
that I always pushed you harder

105
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:39,552
because I knew that
I could expect more from you.

106
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:42,888
Good luck to you.

107
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,042
Thank you.

108
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:59,646
Get me Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde.

109
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:01,974
And cancel everything
I had lined up this morning.

110
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,477
Calling now.

111
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:16,305
Sorry.

112
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:17,757
Excuse me.

113
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,988
Hi, Paige. It's Kim.

114
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,301
Yeah, hi.

115
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:24,430
Just checking that we're still
on for lunch on Monday.

116
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,818
Great. And Kevin, too?

117
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,102
Good.

118
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:31,437
Well, before we meet,

119
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,823
there's some news
you need to know about.

120
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:55,981
I am not the safe choice.

121
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:59,059
The safe choice for you would be HHM.

122
00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:02,821
I believe, however, that I am...

123
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:04,489
the right choice.

124
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,558
Why?

125
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:09,995
That suit you're wearing...
did you buy it off the rack?

126
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,130
Please don't tell me it looks like I did.

127
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,499
If it did, I wouldn't have asked.

128
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:17,335
So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?

129
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:22,360
Because it fits you and you alone.

130
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:25,143
Because each and every stitch
was fretted over

131
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:26,761
with you in mind.

132
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:30,982
Either you fit the jacket...

133
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:33,401
or the jacket fits you.

134
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:38,990
What if I want
a whole warehouse full of suits?

135
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,619
That's a hell of a lot of sewing.

136
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:44,346
How's one single tailor
gonna get that job done?

137
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,664
I know your bank's needs

138
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,200
in regard to this expansion
inside and out.

139
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,558
Having Mesa Verde as my sole client

140
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,249
will take up the entirety
of my attention, to be sure.

141
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:56,153
But if this were beyond my abilities,

142
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:58,577
I wouldn't be
throwing my hat in the ring.

143
00:14:58,612 --> 00:15:01,046
I would not waste your time.

144
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,782
Or mine.

145
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,082
Oh, hey, Kim! We're in here!

146
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:22,067
Perfect timing.
I was just getting the tour.

147
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,755
- Kim, this is Steve.
- Hi.

148
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,863
Steve's the agent for the place.

149
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,022
- Hi. Kim.
- Nice to meet ya.

150
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:29,395
Hi, Kim. Everything okay?

151
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:31,633
Ah, uh... wow.

152
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:35,150
What do you think?

153
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:36,669
I, uh...

154
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,968
I think it's a...
it's a dentist's office.

155
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:43,922
Two offices for two dentists,

156
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:48,426
each the exact same size
with a mirrored layout.

157
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:49,761
Here.

158
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:52,258
The other one is the next door over,

159
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:53,732
right beside this one.

160
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,433
Right here.

161
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:57,969
But they share one lobby,

162
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:01,201
one reception area,
so egalitarian as hell.

163
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,608
Not to mention efficient.

164
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,076
Huh.

165
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,178
Oh, also...

166
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:09,928
soundproof walls,

167
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:12,117
what with the drilling
and the pain and the whatnot.

168
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:14,615
And the location, I mean, holy crap.

169
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,117
I think this is the place.

170
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,094
Kim?

171
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,532
Yeah, it's great. Soundproofing.

172
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,665
Hey, Steve, do you mind if we just...?

173
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,470
Oh, please.

174
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,228
I'll step outside
and make some phone calls.

175
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,062
Y'all take all the time you need.

176
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:38,693
Bad lunch, huh?

177
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:41,284
Mesa Verde said no?

178
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:56,181
Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

179
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,775
I-is this a good...

180
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,881
Jimmy, I got it.

181
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,017
- You got Mesa Verde?
- Yes!

182
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,978
I mean, there's nothing in writing yet,

183
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,670
but the lunch went...

184
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,986
It kicked ass.

185
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:10,282
It was a little touch-and-go
there for a moment, I'll admit,

186
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:13,312
but Paige pitched in,
and she really talked me up.

187
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,013
And then once that door cracked open...

188
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,844
High five. Fantastic.

189
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,498
I-I had an for answer question,
every concern,

190
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:23,679
and I did not bad-mouth HHM, not at all,

191
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:26,597
but I was, like, enthusiasm, you know,

192
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:29,454
and personal service, because
that's gotta count for something.

193
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,030
- Shit, yeah, that counts!
- Exactly!

194
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,916
I mean, 'cause, like, why were they
even at HHM in the first place?

195
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:37,829
Me. So, uh... Oh, and then when
we walked out of the restaurant,

196
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:40,517
when Kevin wasn't looking,
Paige gives me a thumbs-up.

197
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,275
But not... not the regular thumbs-up.

198
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,423
The double thumbs-up.

199
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:44,916
- Two.
- Double barrel.

200
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:46,432
Boom, boom. Just like that.

201
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:47,426
I knew it.

202
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,714
- I knew you could do it!
- It was just...

203
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:53,051
God, it was perfect.

204
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,556
What?

205
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:03,595
I just... I love seeing you like this.

206
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:07,754
So, are we gonna keep these chairs?

207
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,207
Does that mean you like this office?

208
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,206
Let's do it.

209
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,206
Hell, yeah.

210
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:17,096
Let's do it.

211
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,304
Ernesto, the door's open...

212
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,623
...as always.

213
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,392
Ernesto?

214
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,404
It's me, Chuck.

215
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,963
Oh, hey, Howard, is Ernesto with you?

216
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,498
No, it's just me.

217
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:43,779
Well, I expected a round
of documents an hour ago.

218
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,339
You know we've got a filing coming up.

219
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:46,471
I know, Chuck.

220
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,406
It's very possible...

221
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:52,293
It's likely
that we're losing Mesa Verde.

222
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:54,979
Losing them? We just got them.

223
00:18:56,277 --> 00:18:57,877
Well, why? Where are they going?

224
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,994
They're going with Kim Wexler.

225
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,454
She left the firm.

226
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,332
Kim left?

227
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,426
Oh, Howard.

228
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:13,080
Well, where's she going?

229
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:14,479
Is it Rich Schweikart?

230
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,033
Or did Reeves and Green get her?

231
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:17,135
Mnh. Not another firm.

232
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:19,163
She's going into private practice.

233
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:20,271
What?

234
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,981
Well, that's completely...

235
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:26,444
H-how is she going out on her own?

236
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,643
Why is she going out on her own?

237
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,454
Well, the why is the why.

238
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,479
The how is that
she's pooling her resources...

239
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:35,653
with Jimmy.

240
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,865
Kim and my brother... partners at law?

241
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:47,293
He's Svengali.

242
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:49,033
The man is Svengali.

243
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:51,536
At any rate, back to Mesa Verde.

244
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,139
I'm gonna try one last Hail Mary.

245
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:56,452
- Uh, Chuck?
- Hmm?

246
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,398
- Mesa Verde.
- Yes, listening.

247
00:19:58,423 --> 00:19:59,952
I managed to get a meeting
with Kevin Wachtell.

248
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:01,421
He's coming in this afternoon.

249
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:04,048
But compliance law
is not my strong suit.

250
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:07,085
So if you have any details,
any arguments,

251
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,890
bullet-point them for me now,

252
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,039
'cause I got about an hour
before I have to get back.

253
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,491
Chuck?

254
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,336
I really need your help here.

255
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:22,200
Chuck?

256
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:28,840
Are you okay?

257
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,150
I'm going to that meeting.

258
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,883
Chuck, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

259
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:35,086
I can do it.

260
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:36,399
Force of will.

261
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:37,486
And I've been getting better.

262
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:38,932
I know you have, but...

263
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,753
the message that we want to send.

264
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:43,221
I know the message...

265
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:45,723
that we appear professional
and not crazy!

266
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,626
I'm going to the meeting
and the lights stay on.

267
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:50,836
Everyone keeps their phones.

268
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:54,465
Everything stays, for lack
of a better word, normal.

269
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,954
I will make it through.

270
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,390
Hmm.

271
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:21,391
Yeah?

272
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:24,434
They're here.

273
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,175
Okay.

274
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,661
Hello, everyone.

275
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:54,897
Sorry I was delayed.

276
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,461
- Oh. Hi.
- No, no. Not at all. We just sat down.

277
00:21:56,463 --> 00:21:58,575
Kevin Wachtell, Paige Novick,
this is Charles McGill.

278
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,387
Chuck.

279
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:00,514
- Pleasure.
- Kevin. Paige.

280
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,016
- Nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:03,825
Thank you both for coming.

282
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,852
And don't worry.

283
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:07,684
I'm not here
to extol the virtues of HHM.

284
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:10,879
Mm. I'm guessing you've
already had to suffer through

285
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:12,848
Howard's hard sell first time around,

286
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,160
so you've done your time,

287
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,199
as far as I'm concerned.

288
00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:18,543
What hard sell? It was enthusiasm.

289
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:19,705
I gave them cookies.

290
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,619
Cookies were good, as I recall.

291
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:23,655
No, I'm here to put your minds at ease.

292
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:28,159
Kim Wexler is, indeed, the right
choice to handle Mesa Verde.

293
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:30,495
She's the obvious choice.

294
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:34,797
She's young, she's brilliant,
she's going places.

295
00:22:35,763 --> 00:22:37,436
Let's face it, Howard.

296
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:39,049
She's the future.

297
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:41,839
Two old guys like us, we're the past.

298
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:44,642
Well, that's a sad thought.

299
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:46,385
Sad but true.

300
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:51,619
Banking law... needs to be exciting.

301
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,052
It needs the next generation
to come along

302
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:56,587
and give it a big, old kick
in the seat of the pants.

303
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:57,922
Really wake it up.

304
00:22:57,957 --> 00:23:00,325
Let me tell ya how boring I am.

305
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,353
I read FEC and ISO reports
for entertainment.

306
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:07,077
He does. I can attest to that.

307
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,311
Well, I try to stay up on things.

308
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:11,647
The rules are changing all the time.

309
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,330
With everything that's happened
with Enron and WorldCom,

310
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:16,189
the government is extra vigilant.

311
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:19,177
These days, the penalties for
even the most honest of errors

312
00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:20,678
can be devastating.

313
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:24,615
You need a sharp,
young eye to catch that stuff.

314
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:28,086
I mean, when you've specialized
in this kind of work

315
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,773
for decades on end,
you tend to get kinda...

316
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:33,775
- Stale.
- Stale.

317
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,970
You get stale.

318
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:37,616
You forget about things like,
oh, I don't know,

319
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:39,202
the Community Reinvestment Act.

320
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:42,734
Any bank such as Mesa Verde
looking to open a de novo branch

321
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:46,493
is definitely going to need
to show a healthy portfolio

322
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:48,072
of CRA compliance.

323
00:23:48,124 --> 00:23:50,408
Duh. Obviously.

324
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,910
You guys have all that covered,
I'm sure.

325
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:56,336
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking
and Branching Efficiency Act...

326
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,583
there's another mouthful, huh?

327
00:23:58,618 --> 00:23:59,852
Boring!

328
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,225
Still, if you were to run afoul of it,

329
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,264
it could hold you up in court for years.

330
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:09,058
And by the way, uh, if that
were to happen to you folks

331
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,763
as you go forward without us,
which it will not, um,

332
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,691
Howard has contacts at the Fed
who could help sort things out.

333
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:17,282
One or two. Mm-hmm.

334
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:19,251
And then there's
the SEC's interpretation

335
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:21,250
of Section 302 of Sarbox.

336
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,930
Blah, blah, blah.

337
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:24,915
Well, navigating that correctly

338
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,814
could mean savings of several
hundred thousand dollars.

339
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,853
They know that, Howard.

340
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:29,822
Oh.

341
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:30,978
I apologize.

342
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,831
When you reach your golden years,

343
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:34,919
you tend to get a little long-winded,

344
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:36,954
ramble on and on about details.

345
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:41,582
My point being,
your bank is in excellent hands.

346
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:53,137
Look, I take your point. I do.

347
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,326
But I have to say,

348
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:57,108
I have complete confidence
in Ms. Wexler.

349
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:58,309
You should.

350
00:24:58,361 --> 00:24:59,859
She was part of our team.

351
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:01,467
She learned from us.

352
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:04,315
You won't find better than Kim Wexler.

353
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:07,935
But no matter how talented
one individual may be,

354
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,822
the needs of Mesa Verde
are too big to handle alone.

355
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:13,374
I wouldn't handle
your coming expansion alone.

356
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,656
Which is why you should
consider, once again,

357
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:20,748
enlisting a team of professionals.

358
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:26,170
- Glad we did this.
- Any time.

359
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:28,020
We are there for you day and night.

360
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:29,336
Lovely to meet you, Paige.

361
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,619
And you. Thank you.

362
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,677
Talk soon, gentlemen.

363
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:40,116
Chuck, that...

364
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:43,020
That was amazing.

365
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,330
You were fantastic.

366
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:46,073
Trul... Whoa. Chuck?

367
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,426
Get me home.

368
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:49,827
Ernie!

369
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,429
Hang on.

370
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:02,469
Again, we want to thank you

371
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,526
for accommodating the Major like this.

372
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,228
You kidding? It's an honor.

373
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:09,364
For a war hero, I think we can
bend the rules a wee bit.

374
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,216
Well, we really appreciate it.

375
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:14,279
Major Talbott's grandsons are
only in town for one more day,

376
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:17,506
so it's great they get to share
this experience with him.

377
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,725
You guys are in for a real treat.

378
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,009
You excited?!

379
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,844
- Uh-huh.
- Y-yeah, excited.

380
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:24,646
So, these are your boys?

381
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,413
No, I'm... No, I'm the family attorney.

382
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:30,018
I just help when I can, so I called you.

383
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,422
Well, I am glad to be of service.

384
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:35,023
And here she is.

385
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:36,692
Gentlemen, meet FIFI,

386
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:40,555
the world's last
air-worthy B-29 Superfortress.

387
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:43,487
She's based in Texas, but she's
here for a quick visit,

388
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:45,667
just kind of a morale builder
for the airmen.

389
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:47,597
The crew's on lunch, unfortunately.

390
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,871
Otherwise, I was gonna see about
showing you the inside.

391
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,253
Isn't she a beauty, Fudge?

392
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,985
Just like the one you used to fly.

393
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,385
- Fudge?
- Yep.

394
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,877
Major Theodore "Fudge" Talbott.

395
00:26:57,902 --> 00:26:59,479
His mom used to mail him

396
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,266
care packages of fudge during the war,

397
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,718
and he shared them with his friends.

398
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,269
So that's the story. Right, guys?

399
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:04,974
- Yes.
- Yeah.

400
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,199
Well, sir, this certainly must

401
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,216
bring back some memories for you.

402
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:13,027
"Too many to count," he says.

403
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:15,224
I gotta say, Major Talbott...

404
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,199
it's a privilege.

405
00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:19,168
So thank you for your service.

406
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,450
He says, "You're welcome."

407
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:33,977
Uh, um, boy, I envy you guys.

408
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,271
I mean, the stories you must've heard.

409
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,962
You remember any good ones?

410
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,421
- Bombing stuff mostly.
- Bombing stuff.

411
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:41,256
Um, like, um... Like, the war.

412
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:43,725
Did he fly over the Hump,
or did he take off out of India?

413
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:47,979
You doing okay? You need some water?

414
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,913
Yes. Yes, sir.

415
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:53,041
Oh, nuts. I forgot his water.

416
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,595
Oh, hey. I can run back
to the office, get him a bottle.

417
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,480
You could?

418
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,274
Fudge, the captain's gonna
run back to his office,

419
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:01,493
get you some water, okay, sir?

420
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,828
All right. That's great.

421
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:04,658
And there's no rush. He's gonna be fine.

422
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,266
I'll be back ASAP.

423
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,053
Up. Up.

424
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,624
Thought I told you not to say anything.

425
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:19,512
Go stand by the front,
uh, those nose, whatever.

426
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:20,733
Where the hell'd you find this guy?

427
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,130
You couldn't get a real war hero?

428
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:24,631
Yeah, like they grow on trees.
So, this guy owes me.

429
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:26,768
I defended him a while back
when he couldn't pay.

430
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:27,686
Defended him for what?

431
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:29,404
What? You wanna be a lawyer
when you grow up?

432
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:30,608
Just fix the...

433
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:32,474
Public masturbation.

434
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:33,758
Total bullshit.

435
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:35,992
All right, keep your voice down.

436
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:37,946
You do not possess the power of speech.

437
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:39,680
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

438
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:40,532
Chop chop.

439
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,221
All right, hands on hips.

440
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:45,487
All right? Looking strong,
looking proud, all right?

441
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:48,268
See the bomber, okay? The bomber's
the main point, so see it.

442
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,458
I see the freaking bomber.

443
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,254
Couldn't just plop the dude
in front of a flag?

444
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,106
Why'd we have to come here?

445
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,213
Production value. Showmanship.

446
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,388
You rolling?

447
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:57,179
- Yeah, rolling.
- Rolling.

448
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,210
Okay, start the dolly.

449
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,320
And action.

450
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,007
You're part of the greatest generation.

451
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,510
You fought the Nazis.

452
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,916
Fought the Japanese.

453
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:12,752
- What?
- Fought Japanese.

454
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,694
I fought the Japanese.

455
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,636
This machine was used in the Pacific,

456
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:19,571
where the Japanese are.

457
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:22,928
Why don't you shut up and learn
to take some direction?

458
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:26,077
Japanese.

459
00:29:26,102 --> 00:29:27,726
All right, fine.

460
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:31,630
You fought all the dirty... Axis powers.

461
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,835
Your band of brothers came together,

462
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,395
and you saved the world.

463
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,919
You're heroic.

464
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,160
Not that heroic.

465
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:39,768
Just throw it away a little more.

466
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,504
Okay, good.

467
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,762
You've got red, white, and blue
coursing through your veins.

468
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:44,632
Look up!

469
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:46,765
Picture a bald eagle soaring!

470
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,383
Shit.

471
00:29:48,435 --> 00:29:50,568
- What?
- Okay, just keep rolling.

472
00:29:50,593 --> 00:29:52,726
Tights, wides...
just get me some good angles.

473
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:53,718
Okay. All right, back to one.

474
00:29:53,743 --> 00:29:55,554
- Back to one.
- Fudge.

475
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:56,929
Fudge, right here. Fudge.

476
00:29:56,954 --> 00:29:57,913
- What is it, Ernie?
- Fudge.

477
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,658
Jimmy, man, I'm at your
brother's, and he's bad.

478
00:30:00,781 --> 00:30:02,397
Bad? How bad?

479
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:03,956
He's... I don't know. Bad, shakin'.

480
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:05,233
I've never seen him like this.

481
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:06,568
He keeps telling me
not to call a doctor.

482
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:07,496
Lemme guess.

483
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:08,895
He's been going into the office.

484
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,481
Yeah, more and more.

485
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,355
He had a big meeting there today.

486
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:14,409
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.

487
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:16,077
Wrap him in a space blanket.

488
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:17,379
He's already under one.

489
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:18,914
Wrap him in a second one.

490
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,204
Make him some tea, or just, better,

491
00:30:21,229 --> 00:30:22,493
heat some chicken broth.

492
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:23,813
Just let it simmer.

493
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:24,811
Don't make it boil.

494
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,600
That's it? No doctor?

495
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,257
That's it. No doctor.
He's just gotta ride this out.

496
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,259
Chuck'll be fine.

497
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,202
Oh sh... I gotta go.

498
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,536
Rhubarb. Rhubarb!

499
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,874
Idiots, that's the signal.

500
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:37,933
Get him in the chair.

501
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:38,680
Okay.

502
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:41,188
Where's the air hose?
Stick it in your nose.

503
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:44,081
Come on.

504
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:48,577
Sir!

505
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,977
Hey, this is not a problem.

506
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,703
Would you mind if the guys and I
took a picture with you?

507
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,047
It would mean a lot to us.

508
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,375
Yeah, uh, p-pictures. He loves pictures.

509
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,225
Here. Give me the camera.

510
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,140
- I'll take it.
- Here's your water.

511
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:00,476
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you so much.

512
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,233
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Ooh, here.

513
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:05,460
All right, let's scoot ya in.

514
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:06,586
Swing ya around.

515
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:08,899
Okay, everybody line up?

516
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,267
Smile.

517
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:13,852
Cheese.

518
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:41,329
You ready to sign? Let's do this.

519
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,569
What?

520
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:50,078
I lost Mesa Verde.

521
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:53,839
- What?
- I had him.

522
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,200
I thought I had him.

523
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:59,514
So what happened?

524
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,349
They're s-sticking with HHM.

525
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:04,686
Paige said they went over there
this afternoon

526
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:07,848
for some kind of... courtesy meeting,

527
00:32:07,873 --> 00:32:11,076
or so she thought,
and Kevin got his head turned.

528
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:13,763
- By Howard?
- No.

529
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:16,759
Chuck.

530
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,727
Jimmy, I have to ask.

531
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,885
You still up for doing this?

532
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:40,112
What? You mean getting the office?

533
00:32:41,082 --> 00:32:42,381
All of it.

534
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:46,425
I think maybe we need to...

535
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:49,188
slow down and really, you know...

536
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:52,467
- think about this.
- Wait. Whoa.

537
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,402
- Nothing's changed.
- N-nothing's changed?

538
00:32:54,454 --> 00:32:56,571
We're about to sign
a very expensive lease

539
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:58,486
after a very sizable chunk of income

540
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:00,730
just went flying out the window.

541
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:02,441
That's why we're a team.

542
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:05,230
Something like this happens...

543
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:08,416
you're there to help me,
I'm there to help you.

544
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:09,801
Hey.

545
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:13,254
There will be other Mesa Verdes.

546
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:19,961
So you still wanna do this?

547
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:30,418
Jimmy...

548
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,004
I did everything you said,

549
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:33,613
but he's not getting any better.

550
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:34,863
You did good, Ernie.

551
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,124
Thanks.

552
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:38,259
Why don't you, uh,
go home and get some sleep?

553
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:39,627
I'll take over.

554
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,597
He told me he wanted me to stay.

555
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:44,933
It's okay. I'm here now.

556
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:47,406
And, uh, next time you see Howard,

557
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:49,687
tell him you need a raise... a big one.

558
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:59,647
Chuck, buddy?

559
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,899
How you feeling?

560
00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:28,053
Hey, how's it going?

561
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:31,056
I need an X-ACTO knife,
a ruler... wood, please...

562
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,059
Hammermill Premium paper...
20 pound, one ream...

563
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,204
and a glue stick.

564
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,444
Oh, and point me to your best copier.

565
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:39,197
- Best copier?
- Yeah. Best copier.

566
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,866
C'mon. Di di mau.

567
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:21,402
He emerges.

568
00:42:21,427 --> 00:42:23,056
Good afternoon.

569
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:26,709
Is it afternoon?

570
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:30,721
Where's Ernesto?

571
00:42:30,746 --> 00:42:32,613
He was supposed to stay with me.

572
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:34,099
Don't get mad at Ernie.

573
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:35,767
He spent the better part of a day

574
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:38,103
watching you do your impression
of a baked potato.

575
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:41,122
I told him to go home,
get some shut eye.

576
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,775
You hungry?

577
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,942
You want something besides crackers?

578
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:48,233
No, I'm fine.

579
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:58,506
I'll fix myself something
after my stomach settles.

580
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,343
Really doing a number on yourself,

581
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,462
spending so much time out of the house.

582
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,827
You just had to do it, huh?

583
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,711
Couldn't stand
to let Kim have Mesa Verde.

584
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:11,102
You had to swipe it from her.

585
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:12,637
I didn't swipe anything.

586
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,022
We retained our client.

587
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:16,641
You and Howard never even
heard about Mesa Verde

588
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:20,018
till Kim brought it to ya
on a red velvet pillow.

589
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:28,041
I need a shower, and I've got
a ton of work to do.

590
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,455
So if you're lookin' for a fight, Jimmy,

591
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,886
I just don't have it in me.

592
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:40,534
Jimmy.

593
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:43,815
Thanks for stayin' with me.

594
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,142
I know we have our issues,
but if things were reversed,

595
00:43:52,358 --> 00:43:54,866
I...I hope you know that
I would do the same for you.

596
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,016
You're doing a great job.

597
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,766
You done this before?

598
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,344
No, not like this,

599
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:31,433
but we learned about fractions
in school.

600
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,935
You did? What fractions?

601
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:39,143
1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.

602
00:44:39,168 --> 00:44:41,059
Hmm. Wow.

603
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,714
You know, I gotta tell ya,

604
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:46,064
you are much smarter than I was
when I was your age.

605
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,378
Maybe you needed better teachers.

606
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:51,688
That could be.

607
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:53,735
Can I do the drill now?

608
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,165
- You promised.
- Oh.

609
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,993
I did, didn't I? Huh?

610
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,182
Okay, get up here.

611
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,807
Now, you're gonna have to wear these

612
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:07,642
if you're gonna handle
the heavy machinery.

613
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:10,305
W-why don't you have to wear them?

614
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,092
Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up,
and grown-ups get to be stupid.

615
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,991
Now, put them on.

616
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,444
All right.

617
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:21,046
Now, I'm gonna hold this
because it's heavy,

618
00:45:21,183 --> 00:45:23,949
but you pull the trigger
when I say so, okay?

619
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:25,653
Now get your hand on it.

620
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,605
All right, you got it?

621
00:45:27,607 --> 00:45:28,940
Ready.

622
00:45:28,942 --> 00:45:32,888
All right, ready... set... pull.

623
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,449
Good job.

624
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:39,343
- Can we do more?
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:45:39,368 --> 00:45:40,772
You line them up for me.

626
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:43,121
Hello?!

627
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,351
We're back here.

628
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,436
Wow. What's all this?

629
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:53,443
We're making a special hose.

630
00:45:53,468 --> 00:45:56,677
Yeah, that's a special hose, all right.

631
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:58,871
I made marks every 3/4 inch,

632
00:45:58,896 --> 00:46:00,888
then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down

633
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:02,746
so he doesn't ruin his table.

634
00:46:02,771 --> 00:46:05,777
Then we line up a drill,
put the hole on the "X."

635
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:08,285
Huh. Wow.

636
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,950
I needed a soaker
for the rhododendrons out back.

637
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:15,514
Well, Pop-Pop's gonna have to
finish his project on his own,

638
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,444
because we have to go.

639
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:18,405
But we're not done yet.

640
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,158
No, I'll finish up.

641
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,784
But you, young lady, were a big help.

642
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,526
Give me a hug.

643
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,000
Ooh.

644
00:46:29,002 --> 00:46:30,503
Love you, girl.

645
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:33,991
- Love you.
- Thanks, Mike.

646
00:46:34,016 --> 00:46:35,452
Oh, you still good for Friday?

647
00:46:35,477 --> 00:46:36,444
Absolutely.

648
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,026
I'll think of another project by then.

649
00:46:38,051 --> 00:46:40,159
Fantastic. Bye.

650
00:46:40,184 --> 00:46:41,416
Bye.

651
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:15,564
I have a lunch date already.

652
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:17,209
- Well, break it.
- I cannot break it.

653
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,439
Will you take your hands off me?

654
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:20,595
- Why are you playing, osteopath?
- Temper, temper.

655
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:23,652
Oh, listen, Walter,
you are no longer my husband

656
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,223
and no longer my boss.

657
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:27,191
And you're not gonna be my boss.

658
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:29,944
Well, it would've worked out
if you'd been satisfied

659
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,218
with just being editor
and reporter, but not you.

660
00:47:32,243 --> 00:47:33,835
You had to marry me, spoil everything.

661
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,147
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you.

662
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:38,882
Well, you practically did,
making goo-goo eyes at me

663
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:41,579
for two years until
I broke down. "Oh, Walter."

664
00:47:41,604 --> 00:47:44,075
And I still claim I was tight
the night I proposed to ya.

665
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,007
If you'd have been a gentlemen, you'd
have forgotten all about it, but not you.

666
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:47,477
- Why, you!
- Oh, oh. Ah, ah.

667
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:48,251
You're losing your eye.

668
00:47:48,275 --> 00:47:49,586
You used to be able to
pitch better than that.

669
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:53,826
Hello? Yeah. What? Sweeney?
Well, what can I do for ya?

00:47:54,692 --> 00:47:59,692
