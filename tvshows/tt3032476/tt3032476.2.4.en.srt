‭we can handle our business.

163
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,501
Anyway, it takes hours.

164
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:46,804
Collect the cash, count it, lie detector.

165
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,440
One at a time... guy comes in,
transacts, then the next.

166
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:53,477
Then, when we're done, Tuco gets
in his car, I get in mine.

167
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:55,813
Boom. We go our separate ways.

168
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,882
That is where you come in.

169
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:01,185
You see him packing up...
wsssh... drive over.

170
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,821
Pull up in the spot next to Tuco's.

171
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,222
Pop. Head shot.

172
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,625
Roll out. Easy.

173
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,629
I-40 onramp is eight blocks up.

174
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,631
You're in the wind before
anyone has time to blink.

175
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:17,468
And here's the beauty...
all these, um, dealers?

176
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,403
They know we're here, so the story is,

177
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,572
one of them got ideas, decided to kill Tuco,

178
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:23,240
get a cut of the business.

179
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,977
Could've been any of them, as
far as the cartel's concerned.

180
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:28,846
These Tuesdays of yours...

181
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:31,082
day or night when you wrap it up?

182
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,583
- Day.
- So, full daylight.

183
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:34,218
- Mm-hmm.
- Plenty of traffic.

184
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:36,053
How exactly do I not get seen?

185
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,722
My car, at least.

186
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,157
Murphy's law tells me
somebody's gonna pull a plate.

187
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:42,226
Fine. Go to the yard. Buy a beater.

188
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:43,728
You're gonna stay in the car.

189
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:45,663
[Whistles] ‭ain't no one gonna see you.

190
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:47,264
And if they do see you, so what?

191
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,666
That's why you're perfect.

192
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,068
You're no one. You got no connections.

193
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,703
- You're a ghost.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,438
So, I pull in next to him...

195
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,607
that assumes there's a parking spot.

196
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:58,075
Our guys park next to him.

197
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,766
They come and go from the same spot.

198
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:01,334
Last one takes off, you're open.

199
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,236
Someone comes in behind me, I'm blocked.

200
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,505
Who's gonna pull in behind you?

201
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,074
Well, I'm guessing someone who likes tacos.

202
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,442
What then?

203
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:11,277
What's my exit?

204
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:12,912
I don't know.

205
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,714
Get out and run.

206
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,216
Bad knees.

207
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:19,786
Look, the details...
that's what I'm paying you for.

208
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:22,722
You've got a better plan, go on, tell me.

209
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:24,123
I'm all ears.

210
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:28,127
You sure about this?

211
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:30,630
Killing your partner...

212
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:35,335
[chuckles] That's a bell you don't un-ring.

213
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:42,141
See this?

214
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:44,911
You know how I got this?

215
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:47,947
Back in '96, '97, Tuco and I

216
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:50,550
were working with these bikers
out of riverside county.

217
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,585
They were running
‭this peanut-butter crank...

218
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,287
real shit, y'know?

219
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:55,955
But cheap, and we could sell it
as fast as we got it.

220
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:59,759
Anyway, ‭Tuco develops a taste for it.

221
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:02,895
And crank does not bring out
the best in people.

222
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:04,330
Made Tuco erratic.

223
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,833
Our connect was a guy called Dawg Paulson.

224
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,402
One day, ‭Tuco's settling up with Dawg.

225
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,904
He decides ‭to put on his lie detector.

226
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,007
Dawg's like, ‭"what the hell?" You know.

227
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,808
Tuco just keeps staring at him.

228
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,277
Then he goes real quiet.

229
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,811
"You think I'm an idiot, Dawg?"

230
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,780
He thinks dawg is supplying his competitor,

231
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:22,849
trying to cut Tuco out.

232
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,817
Dawg... he denies it.

233
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:27,787
"No way! Not me!"

234
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:30,757
Tuco doesn't even
‭raise his voice, but suddenly,

235
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,692
he's got a sawed-off and...

236
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,361
Right in Dawg's face.

237
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,463
I was behind him.

238
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,533
Sickest thing I ever saw, to this day.

239
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:41,801
And this?

240
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:43,770
A piece of dawg's skull...

241
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,339
under the skin, a little piece of him.

242
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,541
I tried digging it out,
but it's in there pretty good.

243
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,810
Anyway, not the kinda thing
you go to the doctor's for.

244
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:55,948
The thing about it was,
Tuco really liked Dawg.

245
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:57,850
Kind of felt bad afterwards.

246
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:00,687
But when he's using,
[Pops lips] Loco, crazy.

247
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,789
There's no other way to put it.

248
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:04,490
And he's using again, Crystal.

249
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,959
Much bigger kick.

250
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:09,128
So... it's like you said.

251
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:13,499
If Tuco finds out about my,
y'know, independent ventures,

252
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,336
it's gonna be Dawg all over again.

253
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:19,339
It's him or me.

Lawson: That's the Armalite AR-50...

state of the art,
‭accurate to 2,400 meters.

I got the Leupold Mark 4 on it now,

behind cars, ‭small-diameter

374

As always, I've gone to the trouble

of grinding down the serial number.

376
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:03,148
Well, unless you
‭ground a hole clean through,

Well, that would be true,

34 pounds,

not including your bipod,
which adds some heft.

389
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,411

Stoner design, semi-auto.

392

That's about 11 pounds there.

393
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,758
Not quite the range
or the punch of the AR-50,

394
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:49,494
but you're still talking about a .5 M.O.A.

395
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,630
At well past 1,000 meters.

396
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,265
I've heard they're prone to jam.

397
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,433
Well, it's been known
to happen in the field,

398
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:59,004
but there's not a semi-auto
built can boast it never jams.

399
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,173
If that's a concern,
you ought to stick to bolts.

400
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:05,010
Good bolt-action rifle... if you jammed it,

401

I'd wager ‭you were setting out to do so.

404

Essentially, the same rifle used
by marine snipers since 1966.

405
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:24,062
It's light, accurate, good for soft targets

406
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:26,498
in the 800 to 1,2000-meter range.

There's not much change from the original.

412
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:44,349
Biggest difference is the stock...

413
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:46,818
it's fiberglass instead of wood.

414
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:49,321
It changed it over in 1970 or so.
