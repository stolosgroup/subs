00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:25,198
Hey, Gene.

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,416
Thanks, Jimmy.

4
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:29,085
- Trina.
- Hey, Jimmy.

5
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,955
Got a package, Dan.

6
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,378
How's it going?

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,380
What's up?

8
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:06,706
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

9
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:09,576
Jimmy, I'm really slammed.
Just tell me what you need.

10
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:13,496
What is it?

11
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:20,720
I can't open it.

12
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:45,779
So, what does it say?

13
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:54,587
I must call to your attention

14
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,256
the newly passed Environmental Impact

15
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,925
and Sustainability Assurance Act,

16
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,927
a statute that, as you
know, went into effect

17
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:03,930
without any ex post
facto provisions in place.

18
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,265
You got a second, Chuck?

19
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,433
Um, not really. I'm I'm kind of...

20
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,101
It'll just take two seconds. I promise.

21
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:09,102
All right.

22
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,306
What's this?

23
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,611
Is this a joke?

24
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:21,281
No. No joke.

25
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:23,950
You... you passed the bar?

26
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:26,786
Yeah. I did.

27
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:30,123
I... I thought if Kim could do
it, maybe I can, too, you know?

28
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,959
So I got my last few credits for undergrad

29
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,294
from a community college.

30
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,578
I mean, they're not just for draft Dodgers

31
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,713
and yoga classes, all right?

32
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:40,166
Then I found a law school
that would accept me.

33
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:42,502
You know, wasn't Georgetown
or anything, but...

34
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:46,172
The University of American Samoa.

35
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,841
Oh. Correspondence school.

36
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,509
Well, I wasn't gonna quit work, right?

37
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,679
Day... nights, weekends, you know?

38
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,348
They call it "distance learning" nowadays.

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,852
But they're accredited. Go, land crabs.

40
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:00,353
So, you know, I did that.

41
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,522
And, um, the bar exam's a mother.

42
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,024
I mean, for me it was.

43
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:06,026
I failed it the first two times,

44
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:08,661
but I guess it's like
losing your virginity...

45
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:09,829
third time's the charm.

46
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,999
How... this must have taken you years.

47
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,668
And you kept it a secret all this time.

48
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:18,838
Why? You didn't come to me for help?

49
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:21,174
Jesus, Chuck, you're
the busiest guy I know.

50
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,543
I mean, you're doing important shit.

51
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:26,546
Wow!

52
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,214
I don't know what to say.

53
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,884
Well, are you proud of me?

54
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:33,887
Hmm? Oh... Yes!

55
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,222
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

56
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:40,226
Chuck, that means a lot.

57
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:41,461
Oh, hey.

58
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:45,115
I was hoping, you know, if
you think it's appropriate,

59
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,451
um, once I get sworn in and everything...

60
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,737
Consider hiring me?

61
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,572
As what?

62
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,457
Oh. A... a lawyer.

63
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:55,959
Obviously. Yeah.

64
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,795
Well, that's a question
I'm gonna have to take up

65
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,246
with Howard and the other partners.

66
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:04,751
Uh, you know, it's not my decision alone.

67
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:08,088
But how could they say no?

68
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,639
So much drive.

69
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:12,642
Jimmy, look what you've done here.

70
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,813
- _
- Oh, yeah! Whoo!

71
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,314
- Oh, man. I told those guys devil's food.
- All right, all right!

72
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,150
Yeah. Well, I will sue the store for you.

73
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:22,652
Good. Just remember us when
you're all big-time, huh?

74
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,320
I don't remember you now, Burt.

75
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:25,655
You're representing mail room,

76
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,991
so you show those upstairs
jackholes how it gets...

77
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,659
Hey.

78
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:31,661
What are you folks up to? Having a party?

79
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:33,997
Just a little celebration

80
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:35,999
on behalf of New Mexico's newest attorney.

81
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:39,002
I heard. Jesus, Jimmy, you're
a regular Charlie Hustle.

82
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:41,004
- Congratulations, my friend.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks.

83
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,338
Uh, would you like some cake?

84
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,674
Oh, here. Uh, don't mind if I do.

85
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,343
Really, really impressive, Jimmy.

86
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,680
We're all proud of you.
Hey, I hate to interrupt.

87
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:52,682
But could you guys give
Jimmy and me a moment?

88
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,717
- Sure.
- Yeah, absolutely.

89
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:02,392
Please, sit down.

90
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:42,065
Uh, let's reassess in six months.

91
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,400
Thanks for understanding, Jimmy.

92
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,903
Uh, you want the door open or closed?

93
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:48,404
Closed.

96
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:32,532
How's it going?

97
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,368
Uh, settling back in.

98
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,203
Great.

99
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:39,206
So, apparently, they are ready for us.

100
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:42,209
Oh, thanks, but I want to
get a couple things done

101
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:44,094
before lunch, and I'm
still trying to settle...

102
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,713
Come on, Kim. You deserve this.

103
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,550
Come bask in the glow.

104
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,272
Thank you all for coming.

105
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:58,275
I appreciate you making time
in the middle of your busy days.

106
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,444
I'm pleased to announce
that working closely

107
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,779
with the Bernalillo County
district attorney's office,

108
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:04,281
we have reached a plea agreement

109
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:06,617
for former treasurer Craig Kettleman.

110
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:09,453
We believe this is a just and fair outcome

111
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:10,704
and brings to a close

112
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:13,573
an incident Mr. Kettleman deeply regrets.

113
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,242
He is committed to making
amends for his mistakes...

114
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:16,576
Can I help you?

115
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:18,578
Yeah, I'm here to see Mrs. Landry.

116
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,713
Oh.

117
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:23,717
Sign in right here, please.

118
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,085
Are you a relative?

119
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,970
Lawyer.

120
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:29,973
But I treat my clients like family.

121
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,809
Oh. Uh, y... you know where to find her?

122
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:36,229
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Ah.

123
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,900
Hey.

124
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:42,069
Good morning, folks. Hi.

125
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,438
Jimmy McGill. I... oh.

126
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,108
Hey, pick a card, any card.

127
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,611
All right. How's it going there?

128
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:53,280
Good. Whoa! Not so t...

129
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:56,750
Oh. Shh.

130
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:59,419
Little surprise from the card fairy.

131
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:03,090
Give me back squeeze.

132
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,591
Squeeze whatever you got
that's below the water

133
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,926
that I can't see.

134
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,961
Oh, yeah.

135
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,464
All right, Mrs. Landry,
just a few more signatures,

136
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:13,300
and, uh thy will be done.

137
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,302
Would you like another hydrox?

138
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:17,304
No, thank you. I'm all hydrox'd out.

139
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:20,140
Well, please help yourself
if you change your mind.

140
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:23,276
All right. That one.

141
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:26,697
Okay. And that one.

142
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:30,117
And that is it.

143
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,451
What a relief.

144
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,652
I should have done this years ago.

145
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,655
Well, people do tend to put it off.

146
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,158
- Hmm.
- But everybody should have a will.

147
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,327
Please tell your friends.

148
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:43,997
And that comes to $140.

149
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,503
And I'm happy to take, uh,
cash or a check or, uh... cash.

150
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:59,346
O... one moment.

151
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:13,193
Could you write me a check?

152
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:14,828
Well, it's been so long,

153
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:18,248
I... I... I really don't know
if I have enough in my account.

154
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:19,583
I am so sorry.

155
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,084
Thi... this is awful, but...

156
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,756
... All I have is $43.

157
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,374
Okay.

158
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:28,875
Now, I could ask for an advance.

159
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:31,178
I... I... I am so sorry.

160
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:32,345
It's fine.

161
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:35,015
I... I don't know what
to say. This is awful.

162
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,353
Uh, oh, you could keep the
will until I get my allowance,

163
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,690
and... and that should only
be until the end of next week.

164
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:46,193
Okay, that's not necessary.
Here's my address.

165
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:49,529
Just mail it to me when
you've got it, all right?

166
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:54,701
And why don't we, uh... we'll
just make it an even $120.

167
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,203
All right?

168
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:59,289
Oh. Oh. Thank you.

169
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:01,291
You have a nice day.

170
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:12,419
Excuse me. Allowance?

171
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,421
Your family has you on an allowance?

172
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,973
Oh, no, no. It's... it's my money.

173
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,309
I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing.

174
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,094
$500 a month...

175
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,179
I don't understand.

176
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:24,014
You should have social security checks...

177
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,682
... Plus that pension we talked about.

178
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:27,684
So how are you on an allowance?

179
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:30,020
Well, the checks go to Sandpiper,

180
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:34,441
and then they take out my
fees and... and my expenses.

181
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:35,775
Why don't you just come on in?

182
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:37,777
I'm afraid I'm not explaining it very well.

183
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:44,417
I... I have statements here... somewhere.

184
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,753
Somewhere. Okay. Here...

185
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:48,922
So your pension and social security

186
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:51,591
goes straight to the Sandpiper people?

187
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:55,595
They take out... they
take out what they need,

188
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:58,765
and then... and then I get my allowance.

189
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,050
Here.

190
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:03,386
And... and all the rest
goes into my savings account.

191
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,889
It's really all very above-board.

192
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:09,059
A lot of places do it this way.

193
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,061
This is how they do it
for everybody around here?

194
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:15,282
Well, yes, they... they try
to make everything easy for us.

195
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,204
Mrs. Landry, are any of your friends around

196
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,707
who I could talk to?

197
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,165
I see you spent... now, I
don't know if you noticed...

198
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:35,168
$187.50 on 4-10-12.

199
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,337
Do you know what 4-10-12 is?

200
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,174
No. In order to find out,
you have to look on the back.

201
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:43,343
Okay? And see this key.

202
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:46,179
I see you have reading glasses.
Can I borrow your glasses?

203
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,848
Yes. Thank you.

204
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,684
Oh, these are gonna help me,

205
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:52,686
but I don't know if they'll do the trick.

206
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:55,355
So tiny.

207
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:58,074
4-10-12...

208
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,661
I think it might be Q-tips. I can't tell.

209
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,613
It's probably an accident,
but we should look into it.

210
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:04,698
don't you think?

211
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,366
They're not doing this intentionally.

212
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,201
Okay? This could be a mistake.

213
00:12:08,203 --> 00:12:10,370
But if we correct the mistake,

214
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:13,757
then you'll get some money
back, and it'll be fair.

215
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:16,293
Hey, Chuck.

216
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:21,765
My boxes, the ones I left...

217
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,300
Oh.

218
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,558
Sandpiper Crossing...

219
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,727
Sandpiper Crossing...

220
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,562
Did you do my wills?

221
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:36,563
Yes, I did.

222
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,565
Hey. Would you look at that?

223
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:40,400
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

224
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:41,735
This was a one-time thing,

225
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,904
and don't think I don't see
what you were doing here.

226
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:48,241
You wanted to play Tom Sawyer,
wanted me to paint the fence,

227
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,910
and god help me, it worked.

228
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,245
You need help?

229
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,798
Hire a paralegal, stand
on your own two feet.

230
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,133
Yeah. Sure. I'll do that.

231
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:58,752
You're not even listening to me.

232
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:00,920
No, I... I hear you, Chuck, okay?

233
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:04,090
Self-reliance. It's great
stuff. Would you look at this?

234
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:05,425
What did I just say?

235
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,762
Ta... take a look, okay? Just right here.

236
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:11,264
Do you see what I see?

237
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,433
All I'm asking is for you
to take a look. Please?

238
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,769
"Sandpiper Crossing... "

239
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,937
It's a retirement home, assisted living.

240
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:20,106
It's... this is one of
their monthly invoices

241
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:21,107
they send their residents.

242
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,942
What exactly am I looking for?

243
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:24,027
It's nothing earth-shaking.

244
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,862
Just little things, little things like...

245
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,864
like this right here.

246
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,951
$14 for code 118-62. What's 118-62?

247
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,953
I wonder.

248
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:40,343
How could you even read
this? It's like microfilm.

249
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:52,806
118-62 is facial tissue.

250
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,808
14 bucks for a box of Kleenex.

251
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,109
Yeah, I found others.

252
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,778
There's $3.50 for a single
roll of toilet paper,

253
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:00,780
22 bucks for a bottle of aspirin.

254
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:03,483
It's a clear pattern of overcharging.

255
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:05,652
Nothing huge, but it adds up to real money.

256
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:07,320
I mean, here, look.

257
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:10,990
This woman... she got soaked
for like 400 bucks last month.

258
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:12,325
And there's a pretty solid attempt

259
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:13,993
at concealment of that fact,

260
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,996
which to my way of thinking, makes it...

261
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:21,835
Fraud. This was in work I did?

262
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,336
Yeah, you must have missed it.

263
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:28,842
Um, look, Chuck, I got lucky, right?

264
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,226
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.

265
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:32,562
And this is no mom-and-pop outfit, okay?

266
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:33,930
I dug around a little.

267
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:36,099
They're owned by some kind of
real-estate investment trust.

268
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:39,769
I'm working at getting more
info, but this could be big.

269
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,771
I mean, this could be a big case, right?

270
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:45,442
Well... if it's more
than a few errant billings

271
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:49,779
and if it's systematic and
you establish a pattern,

272
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:53,616
it could be class-action.

273
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:55,618
What do I do now? I mean, what next?

274
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,454
Well, you're gonna need more information.

275
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:59,205
You don't want to go off half-cocked.

276
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,708
Full cock. Okay.

277
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,710
No, I... I'm gonna head back there.

278
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:06,880
Thank you. You're the best.

279
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:22,028
Back to see Mrs. Landry.

280
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,400
Okay. What gives?

281
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:29,736
Sorry, sir. New policy.

282
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:32,906
We're concerned about
solicitation on premises.

283
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:36,042
I'm not a gigolo, if
that's what you're implying.

284
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:38,128
Legal solicitation.

285
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:42,549
We are obligated to protect our
residents from being harassed,

286
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:44,217
and we have the right to refuse entry.

287
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:47,387
I have clients in there.

288
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:49,389
Now, they have the legal
right to meet with me.

289
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:53,092
Well, you'll just have to
arrange to meet them elsewhere.

290
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:58,815
Oh, come on, guys. Seriously?

291
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,934
What, are you making
soylent green back there?

292
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:03,269
It's... all right, okay.

293
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:06,606
I... I'm backing away. Yeah?

294
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:13,580
You know what? Uh... This...

295
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:16,249
Hey, this has gotten me a
little bit stirred up down there.

296
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:17,917
Can I use your restroom?

297
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:20,670
Please, it's... I've got I.B.S.

298
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,172
Go ahead.

299
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:52,151
"To Sandpiper Crossing...

300
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:54,320
... clients of James M. McGill...

301
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,573
This is to inform you to stay...

"We believe that... breach of contract... "

304
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:05,331
Come on, now, sir. I've been very patient.

305
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:08,334
"... clear pattern of malfeasance...

306
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:10,303
This is a negligent infliction
of emotional distress."

307
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:12,505
Sir, I really need you to
finish up and come out now.

308
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:13,506
"... contact by the end of the week

309

or I will be forced to move forward."

310
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:18,228
- Sir, I need you to finish up...
- This is a demand letter informing Sandpiper Crossing

311
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:19,646
of pending litigation

312
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:21,848
for defrauding my clients
through systematic overcharging.

313
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,851
You're shredding in there! I'm not deaf!

314
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:25,985
I can hear you! Stop right now!

315
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,022
This here... this makes it official, right?

316
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:30,356
If you don't stop shredding right now,

317
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:32,859
that's destruction of
evidence... spoliation!

318
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,577
That's what it's called, and it's a felony!

319
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:37,580
So call your lawyers right now
and tell them I said that...

320
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:39,365
me... James McGill esquire!

321
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:43,586
I'm telling you guys, big mistake! Aah!

322
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,334
Hey.

323
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,836
Hey.

324
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,671
Am I calling at a bad time?

325
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,139
No, not at all.

326
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,474
How you doing?

327
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,226
Uh, pretty good. Getting by.

328
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,728
How about you?

329
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,847
Getting by.

330
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,849
It's good to hear from you.

331
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,352
Yeah. I... I've been...
there's been a lot going on.

332
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,687
You know how it is.

333
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,856
Yeah, I know.

334
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,023
Uh, listen.

335
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,360
I was... was hoping maybe
you could do me a favor.

336
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,662
Do you think you could watch Kaylee?

337
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,999
It'd be during my shift
the day after tomorrow.

338
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,835
Look, I hate to ask, but
my regular sitter's down...

339
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,172
anything you need, I'll be there.

340
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,674
You can get off work? I don't
want to impose or anything.

341
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,544
No. Anytime.

342
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,018
It's not an imposition.

343
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,189
Thanks. Appreciate it.

344
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,358
Yeah, no problem.

345
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,026
At a quarter to 2:00?

346
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,112
I'll see you then.

347
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,115
Okay.

348
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,705
Ohh! Jesus!

349
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,604
Aah.

350
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,638
Come on.

351
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,975
Where is it?

352
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,143
Oh.

353
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,678
Oh!

354
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,349
Oh! God damn it!

355
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,406
And it didn't even make it fit.

356
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,360
And I'm like, "it's not like
we're close to being done."

357
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,696
I mean, can't you get
somebody else to do it?"

358
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,864
Right.

359
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,999
They don't pay any of
us enough for this shit.

360
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,584
You know what? And it's
going on and on and on.

361
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,369
And so I'm like,

362
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,706
"why are you making your
problems my problems?"

363
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,375
Right. Like you don't have
enough problems of your own.

364
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,044
Exactly! That's exactly what I'm saying.

365
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,379
Thank you. But he just...

366
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,725
James McGill.

367
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,060
Mr. McGill,

368
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,028
Rich Schweikart of Schweikart and Cokely.

369
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,364
We're the law firm representing
Sandpiper Crossing assisted living.

370
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,699
How are you this evening?

371
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,368
Quite well, thank you. How are you?

372
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,570
Doing fine. Doing fine.

373
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,123
I'm sorry to call so late.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

374
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,125
No, no. No, it's fine.

375
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,127
It's just that you're whispering.

376
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,629
I'm at the opera.

377
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,632
Oh. What opera?

378
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,967
"Magic Flute."

379
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,552
Mozart! Lovely.

380
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,387
Well, I'll try not to keep you.

381
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,890
We received... something from you today,

382
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,726
and we're not quite sure what.

383
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,594
It's a demand letter.

384
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,262
Ah.

385
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,431
Well, it was a little confusing
'cause it was written on, uh...

386
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,600
Well, I had to write it quickly

387
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,937
because your clients were in the
process of destroying evidence.

388
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,440
Mr. McGill, if you're talking
about shredding documents,

389
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,743
that's neither irregular nor illegal.

390
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,411
Every business in America does it.

391
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,246
You say potato, I say spoliation.

392
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,614
Mm-hmm.

393
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,750
Maybe you should walk me through
what you're alleging here.

394
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,752
I believe it's all in the letter.

395
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,420
Uh, uh, I... I'm not saying it's not,

396
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,289
but it's a bit hard to read.

397
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,425
Next time, I'd use double-ply.

398
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,427
Let's not fixate on the medium, okay?

399
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,429
Let's look at the message.

400
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,933
Now, your clients are facing
multiple counts of elder abuse

401
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,354
and... and fraud and deceptive
and unfair trade practices,

402
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,190
and that's just the start, okay?

403
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,859
I'm not a betting man, but I
bet the farm I'll find more.

404
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,029
Mr. McGill, are you
related to Charles McGill?

405
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,031
He's my brother.

406
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,283
Yeah? How's he doing these days?

407
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:27,954
I... I fail to see the relevance of this.

408
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,373
Frankly, the only reason
that I made this phone call

409
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,041
was out of respect for Charles

410
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,876
on the off chance that you
might be related to him.

411
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,661
My partner suggested that the best response

412
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,330
would be to send a rule 11
letter and have you sanctioned,

413
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,166
but I didn't want to jump
to that immediate length.

414
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,501
Hey, how about you stop
trying to rattle my cage

415
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,221
and just, you know, respond to the merits?

416
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,639
This is my response, Mr. McGill...

417
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,308
you have no good-faith basis
to threaten any litigation.

418
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,311
This is a shakedown, and we both know it.

419
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,981
Now, if you push this any
further, my hands will be tied.

420
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,817
Sorry for interrupting your evening.

421
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,318
Enjoy "The Magic Flute."

422
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,739
Blow my magic flute.

423
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,701
Aah!

424
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:23,677
Son of a bitch!

425
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,650
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

426
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,320
Oh, uh, Chuck, um...

427
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,655
Sorry to... show up like this.

428
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,991
I just needed space to work.

429
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,826
What is all this?

430
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,328
What have you done to my dining room?

431
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,830
They were spoliating, the Sandpiper people.

432
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,165
They wouldn't let me in,

433
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,633
and I could see that they were shredding.

434
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,668
I wrote them a demand
letter, and I gave it to them.

435
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,004
- You broke in to a nursing home?
- Assisted living.

436
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,389
And you stole their garbage.

437
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,058
My god. No, it was in public.
There was no lock, no nothing.

438
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,677
I just lifted the lid, and there it was.

439
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,346
There's no reasonable
expectation of privacy

440
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,014
in that situation, is there?

441
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,517
You can't say it's private if
a hobo can use it as a wigwam.

442
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,186
That's... that's the standard, right?

443
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,188
If animals or vagrants can get in?

444
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,024
More or less, yes.

445
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,860
Okay, so this is all legal.

446
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,363
I mean, it's completely
above-the-belt legal.

447
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,499
I just need to figure out what
they're trying to cover up.

448
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,034
You know, you don't shred like this

449
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,003
unless you got something
to hide, am I right?

450
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,537
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, come on, Chuck.

451
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,872
A lawyer shows up,

452
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,875
starts figuring out their
little scheme, and suddenly this?

453
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,428
No, it's not a coincidence. It's in here.

454
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,598
Well, at least it's not crosscut.

455
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,766
Look, you won't even know I'm here, okay?

456
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,102
I just need some space and some quiet,

457
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,937
and I'll be out of your
hair as soon as I c...

458
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,440
Stop, stop. It's okay. You can work here.

459
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,891
Thanks.

460
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,395
I don't mind the company.

461
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,398
You look like you could
use a cup of coffee.

462
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,567
Good god, yes.

463
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,286
I'll put it on.

464
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,579
Up, up. Up.

465
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,916
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

466
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,587
God's sweet sake.

467
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,145
Yeah.

468
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:16,018
Oh, good. You're up.

469
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:21,573
Well, Jesus, Chuck, how
long have I been asleep?

470
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,608
Chuck, how did you... ?

471
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:27,529
I... I can't believe this. Uh...

472
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,034
Uh, thank you. This is a huge help.

473
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:35,037
I felt like I was shoveling
snow in a blizzard.

474
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,539
Well, it gets better.

475
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,374
What's this?

476
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:41,376
It's your smoking gun.

477
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:44,212
It's a, uh... invoice for syringes.

478
00:29:44,264 --> 00:29:45,881
Yes. From?

479
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:49,217
Morrissey Medical Supply Lincoln, Nebraska.

480
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:52,054
- So?
- Trust me.

481
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,723
Meanwhile, we need to
start pulling case law...

482
00:29:54,775 --> 00:30:00,062
any precedent dealing
with 18 U.S.C. 1961 to '68.

483
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:03,065
Probably not a bad idea to pull 30.47.1

484
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:06,735
from NMSA... Uh, 1978.

485
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:09,237
I don't think that's gonna play, really,

486
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:12,541
but it's a good opening salvo for us.

487
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:15,043
Wait, "us"?

488
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,878
We're working together on this?

489
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:20,549
Mm. That's up to you, Jimmy.

490
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:23,385
'Cause...

491
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,053
Well...

492
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,389
All right.

493
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:30,926
All right. All right. Let's get to work.

494
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:49,778
- Kim Wexler.
- Hey, gorgeous.

495
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,781
Oh, man. Sweet-talking
right out of the gate?

496
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,950
You want something. Make it fast.

497
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:56,618
- I want to go home.
- Okay, okay.

498
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,121
Will you look something
up for me on Westlaw?

499
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,956
Please?

500
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,958
You're lucky I'm a pushover.

501
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,793
All right. Hit me.

502
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:06,011
Thank you.

503
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:09,631
Uh, anything on Sedima v. Imrex,

504
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,800
Slesinger v. Disney, Holmes v. S.I.P.C...

505
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:14,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow
down, slow down. V. Disney.

506
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:17,139
Holmes v. S.I...

507
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,306
D.C., yeah.

508
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:23,645
And, uh, anything on
57.12.1-24 NMSA, 1978.

509
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:25,147
Uh, okay.

510
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:27,482
It would help if I knew what
you were looking for here.

511
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:28,984
Anything, everything.

512
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:30,819
What? You want me to just read
you the head notes or something?

513
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:32,821
No, no, print it... full cases,

514
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:34,656
and any cases that cite to those cases.

515
00:31:34,658 --> 00:31:37,709
Shepardize like the wolf's at the door.

516
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:39,878
Jesus, Jimmy, that's gonna
be thousands of pages.

517
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:41,880
Pretty please with sugar on top?

518
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:43,882
Come on. You owe me one.

519
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:47,002
Yes, I do, but this is gonna take hours.

520
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:49,221
- And who do I bill it to?
- Bill it to Howard.

521
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:50,555
I still remember his code...

522
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:53,225
1933, same year Hitler came to power.

523
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,228
You're not funny. I'm
not billing it to my boss.

524
00:31:56,263 --> 00:31:58,230
How about yours? I'll pay you back.

525
00:31:58,265 --> 00:32:01,233
Jimmy, this is 300, 400
bucks worth of printing.

526
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:02,734
The accountants will find
it and I'll get fired,

527
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:05,020
which sounds fun and all, but no.

528
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:07,405
Okay. Hold on a sec.

529
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:12,077
Hey.

530
00:32:12,112 --> 00:32:13,912
Uh, Kim can't print without a code.

531
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:15,747
Should I go over there,
take notes, and come back?

532
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:16,770
No, no, no. It would take too long.

533
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,417
Use mine... 1868.

534
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:22,204
Yeah.

535
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,775
1868. Use that. It's Chuck's.

536
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:28,276
You're using Chuck's number?

537
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:30,078
Does Chuck know you're
using Chuck's number?

538
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,329
We're working on something together.

539
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:32,781
And bring it over to his place after.

540
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,583
- You're a lifesaver.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

541
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:36,284
You're working a case together?

542
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:39,121
Yeah. Keep this under your
hat, but it's gonna be huge...

543
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,123
maybe a class-action, even.

544
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,292
We think it'll settle for
$1 million, maybe $2 million.

545
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:46,511
How does that work?

546
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,346
- Chuck's a partner at HHM.
- So what?

547
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:51,016
Look, I know Chuck's partnership
agreement chapter and verse.

548
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,684
He can work with outside parties.

549
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:55,187
That clause is intended
for small-time stuff,

550
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:56,188
pro bono cases.

551
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:57,856
So? I'm bono. I'm very bono.

552
00:32:57,891 --> 00:33:00,192
Chuck's a rock star,
okay? They'll work it out.

553
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:03,195
And Chuck can handle this?
Last time I saw him, he was...

554
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,697
Last time you saw him,
he wasn't himself, okay?

555
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:07,649
This is good for him.

556
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,952
Okay.

557
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:12,204
What?

558
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,872
I don't know. I'm just...

559
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:15,874
Whatever. I'll see you in a couple hours.

560
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:17,375
Okay. We're ordering a pizza, okay?

561
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:18,710
I'll save you a slice.

562
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,147
Now, you know, if you don't separate those,

563
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,482
you're gonna end up with brown.

564
00:33:42,352 --> 00:33:43,652
Hello?

565
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,020
Hey.

566
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:48,356
We're in here.

567
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,525
We're playing sculptor.

568
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:55,030
She's Michelangelina. How's work?

569
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:59,034
Eh, you know... work. How did it go?

570
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:02,704
Kid's a dream. She's easy.

571
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:04,706
And you better stay that way.

572
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:09,377
How you doing, sweetie? Huh?

573
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,213
Hmm?

574
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,882
Well, I better be going.

575
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,217
Oh, wait. Hang on a sec, would you?

576
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,520
I want to talk to you about something.

577
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,388
What's up?

578
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:27,028
I want to know what I should do with this.

579
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:30,115
I've been carrying it around for weeks,

580
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,450
like holding on to it.

581
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:35,287
Every place I put it feels wrong.

582
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:38,039
I thought about putting it in
the collection plate, but...

583
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:41,910
It seemed... I don't know.

584
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,079
Look, with Matty gone, I have expenses,

585
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:47,749
and the death benefit helped, but...

586
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,585
What I want to ask you is...

587
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:53,255
... Can I spend this?

588
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:58,260
Stace, if this money helps you and Kaylee,

589
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,762
if it does a single
good thing in this world,

590
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:04,099
then you spend every penny.

591
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:08,436
That's a relief. It'll help a lot.

592
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:16,778
Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket.

593
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,553
I swear, everyone I know
has had problems with them.

594
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,221
I had one. The computer in the engine...

595
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:28,390
it locked in the middle of the Rockies.

596
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,827
Yeah, it decided I was
overheating, and that was it.

597
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,829
Yeah. I couldn't get it
fixed for a hundred miles.

598
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,330
I had to have it towed to Telluride.

599
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:36,331
It was unbelievable.

600
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:38,000
Huh.

601
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:41,917
No, it's... it's the
chip. It's the little...

602
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:45,420
Yeah, it's like 800 bucks, not counting...

603
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:46,922
Labor.

604
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:52,928
Hey, Mel, can I call you back?

605
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:06,441
Chuck, the Sandpiper has landed.

606
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:17,252
Gentlemen, I'm Jimmy McGill.

607
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:18,587
- Welcome.
- Rich Schweikart.

608
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:20,756
This is Alvin Reese. Phil Jergens.

609
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,923
Thanks for coming.

610
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,792
Oh, whoa. I have to ask you.

611
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:25,794
Uh, please leave electronics in the car...

612
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:28,463
laptops, blackberries,
palm pilots, watches.

613
00:36:28,515 --> 00:36:31,183
If you lick it and it
goes bzzt, leave it here.

614
00:36:31,218 --> 00:36:32,684
Why?

615
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,020
My brother Chuck has a certain sensitivity.

616
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:36,855
It's a medical condition.

617
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,024
This is the price of admission.

618
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:40,358
Yeah, I heard about this.

619
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:44,079
Go ahead. It's fine.

620
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,698
Here you go.

621
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:53,121
Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.

622
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:54,339
I'll be right back.

623
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:58,543
All right.

624
00:37:02,516 --> 00:37:06,635
Chuck. Come on, buddy.

625
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:08,970
I...

626
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:10,806
I don't... I don't know if I can do this.

627
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:13,308
You... oh, you can do this, all right?

628
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,143
These guys...

629
00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:18,146
Those guys... they're nothing. Okay?

630
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:20,816
They're the Pistons, and you're the Bulls.

631
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:22,150
All right?

632
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:26,655
All you got to do is sit
there and look intimidating.

633
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:30,325
They're scared of you
already, and they should be.

634
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,994
You're Charles McGill.

635
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:35,380
Let's go. Let's go get 'em.

636
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:43,054
Ah.

637
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,006
Hey.

638
00:37:45,058 --> 00:37:46,391
Do you remember me, Charles?

639
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:49,094
We were on a co-defense...
Church's Donuts v. Amendola?

640
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,428
Oh.

641
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,097
It was... Jesus 9, 10 years ago.

642
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,099
Yeah.

643
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:56,234
Oh, our guys were suing the other guys,

644
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,736
and they were suing us right back,

645
00:37:57,771 --> 00:38:00,605
and the city had some
grievance with everyone,

646
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:02,774
so we had to bundle like
four actions together,

647
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,776
and I was sure that we were sunk.

648
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:08,113
But you... you quoted... what was it?

649
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:11,783
Huh? Addyston Pipe & Steel.

650
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:13,618
You turned it all antitrust,

651
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,287
and the whole thing went
away in summary judgment.

652
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:16,454
It was amazing. It was amazing.

653
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:18,623
I figured you'd be arguing

654
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,126
in front of the Supreme Court someday.

655
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,297
Well, it's, uh, good to see you.

656
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:26,298
Yeah.

657
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,716
All right, well, let's get started.

658
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:36,054
Um, we've read your revised demand.

659
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,223
It's, uh, quite a laundry
list. Very creative.

660
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,724
Yeah, creative, like the way

661
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,560
your clients have been billing my clients.

662
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:45,280
'Cause that's like Salvador Dalם creative.

663
00:38:45,315 --> 00:38:47,449
That's cute. Y... you know,
you're not gonna make this stick.

664
00:38:47,484 --> 00:38:49,200
Setting aside evidentiary concerns...

665
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:52,370
whoa, whoa. Your guys couldn't
afford 10 bucks for a padlock?

666
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:55,123
That's on them. Public property.

667
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:58,627
Maybe a judge sees that
your way, maybe he doesn't.

668
00:38:58,662 --> 00:39:00,629
But the damages for elder abuse?

669
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:04,249
The statute requires proof that
there was some undo influence...

670
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:07,585
someone threatening the
residents of Sandpiper Crossing.

671
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:09,587
As far as I understand it, no one
has claimed there's a guy with a knife

672
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,756
telling them to hand
over their lunch money.

673
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,092
There are a lot of
assisted-living facilities

674
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,593
out there that may be disreputable,

675
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:17,929
but that's not the case with
our client, not even close.

676
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,931
All their facilities all 12 of them...

677
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,933
every single one, five-star rated.

678
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,234
You go to any one of them right now,

679
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,269
and you know what you'll see?

680
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,104
You'll see happy, healthy residents.

681
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,323
Sandpiper takes care of these people.

682
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:29,574
They don't bilk them.

683
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,576
But we looked into it,

684
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:35,246
and some of your clients
have, in fact, been overbilled.

685
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:37,248
It's... it's an accounting error.

686
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:39,751
It doesn't rise to the level
of fraud, not even close.

687
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:44,289
We've calculated the damages.
All told, it's $46,320.

688
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:48,293
Mm-hmm, so here's what
we're prepared to do.

689
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,762
We're gonna make your clients whole...

690
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:53,515
a check for the $46,000
and change right now.

691
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,684
And on top of that,

692
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:58,853
we'll give you another
$46k to cover your expenses.

693
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:00,188
So what's that? $92,000?

694
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:02,774
Let's call it $100,000 even.

695
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:05,193
We admit to no wrongdoing,

696
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:09,397
and your clients release all claims.

697
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:17,072
I think you're gonna need
to do better than that.

698
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,043
Ah, this was in your demand letter.

699
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,212
They're syringes. So?

700
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,880
I... I don't know if you know this,

701
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,465
but that's a pretty standard item

702
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,000
in an assisted-living facility.

703
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:31,002
Correct. But it's not
what it is that matters.

704
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:32,303
It's where it's from.

705
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:35,507
Lincoln, Nebraska.

706
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,842
Go, cornhuskers.

707
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,348
Well, since you're not picking
up what I'm putting down,

708
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,016
I'll explain it to you.

709
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:49,521
Um, Nebraska, although they
both begin with the letter "N,"

710
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:53,825
actually turns out to be a
different state than New Mexico.

711
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,693
So your client accepted shipments

712
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:59,531
across state lines for its enterprise.

713
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,535
I... in the U.S. mail, no less.

714
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:06,371
Are you trying to make this a RICO case?

715
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:08,006
Like our client is John Gotti or something?

716
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,175
Well, you know as well as I do

717
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,510
RICO's used mostly for business beefs.

718
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:14,846
Sedima establishes a pretty low threshold

719
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:17,182
for RICO provisions to kick in.

720
00:41:17,217 --> 00:41:20,852
Interstate commerce is a bitch, huh?

721
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:22,687
As soon as we establish a pattern to...

722
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:25,356
what was your word? Uh, "overbillings"?

723
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:28,893
I prefer the classic term of "fraud."

724
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,112
You're looking at treble damages.

725
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:34,816
So your 100 grand... I think
you know where you can stick it.

726
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:44,075
Will you give us a moment?

727
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:57,388
Well...

728
00:41:57,424 --> 00:41:59,390
What number exactly did you have in mind?

729
00:41:59,426 --> 00:42:02,260
$20 million.

730
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:04,929
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

731
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,264
Oh, you can't expect...

732
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:10,151
$20 million.

733
00:42:10,187 --> 00:42:13,321
Or we'll see you in court.

734
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:23,781
Hmm.

735
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:27,836
$20 million?

736
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:29,087
Didn't you hear them?

737
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:33,091
This is a big company.
12 separate facilities.

738
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:35,593
They can't possibly all be in New Mexico.

739
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:38,096
This is potentially a multi-state

740
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:39,514
federal class-action lawsuit

741
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:41,432
with a RICO kicker at the penalty phase.

742
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:43,601
$20 million? That's conservative.

743
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:47,605
Now, class cert... that's where we start.

744
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:49,858
I'll draft our complaint, try
to get us a conditional one.

745
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,109
They'll try to pierce it,

746
00:42:51,144 --> 00:42:53,778
but it should hold long
enough to start discovery.

747
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:55,613
And we need to get you back on the grounds,

748
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:58,116
quash this prohibition against you.

749
00:42:58,151 --> 00:43:02,036
Uh, some injunctive relief. Maybe a T.R.O.

750
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,823
Jimmy?

751
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:07,825
Do you want to get started on the T.R.O.?

752
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:09,127
Yeah. Yes.

753
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:38,823
It looks good. No heartworm, no mange.

754
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:42,493
- Where did you get her?
- Shelter.

755
00:43:42,529 --> 00:43:45,997
Good. There's too many
puppy mills out there.

756
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:48,166
I had a dachsie in the other day.

757
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:50,835
Some douche bred her so much, poor thing,

758
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,171
she just had one giant hernia for a belly.

759
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:55,840
Couldn't even walk.

760
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,508
Those people can go straight to hell,

761
00:43:57,544 --> 00:43:59,377
as far as I'm concerned.

762
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:04,882
Anything else I can do for you?

763
00:44:04,884 --> 00:44:08,770
You still in touch with your people?

764
00:44:08,805 --> 00:44:10,939
Depends on the type of
work you're looking for...

765
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:14,392
your dos, your don'ts,
your wills, your won'ts.

766
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,227
Well, if you tell me what you've got,

767
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,230
I'll tell you what I'll do.

768
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,578
I signed up three more
clients at the mall today.

769
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,747
Jesus, those mall walkers...

770
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,749
Those geezers are faster than you think.

771
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,053
I could sleep for a decade.

772
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:51,429
Did you get what I asked?

773
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,098
- The, uh, code provisions?
- Ohh.

774
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,901
Shit.

775
00:44:56,936 --> 00:45:01,489
Uh, it's in the car.

776
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:05,159
Just give me a minute. I'll, uh...

777
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:07,779
I'll go.

778
00:45:13,036 --> 00:45:15,370
Where's the...

779
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:51,489
Chuck? Hey.

780
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:06,003
Chuck?

781
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:08,056
Yeah.
