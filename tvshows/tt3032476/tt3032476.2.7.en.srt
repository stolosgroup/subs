Last two nights, I heard gun shots.

We're getting you and Kaylee
out of this house.

You took the Davis and
Main job because of me.

10
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:23,205
I took that job because
it was the right decision.

11

maybe you could help me.

Yeah?

[Sighs] Well, I drove into
the city this morning.

25
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,501
U-Usually, I take the train,
but I was in just such a rush

26
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,803
to get some
medicine for my son, Freddie.

27
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,773
He has epilepsy.

28
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:27,275
He had an attack this
morning, but during his fit,

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,009
he knocked the bottle of medicine

30
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,312
out of my wife's hand and just...

31
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:33,314
bam, one huge puddle.

32
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,782
That's terrible.

33
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,785
Well, long story
short... drove into town,

34
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,188
bought the new medicine with every
last nickel in my pocket,

35
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,656
and then my car died.

36
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:44,725
Oh, God, that's... that's just, uh...

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,192
[Chuckling] I know.

38
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,828
When it rains, it pours,
right? [Chuckles]

39
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:53,333
I-I tried the ignition,
just nothin'... not firing.

40
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,471
And, anyway, now I've [Sighs]
convinced myself

41
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:59,472
that Freddie's gonna
have another seizure

42
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:02,675
before I get back with the medicine.

43
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,812
So, I-if you can help
me, I would be so grateful.

44
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:09,248
Well, I could come out and
check your car for ya.

You know, maybe it's just a spark plug.

I-I-I got a box of plugs
back in the stockroom.

Thanks, and I-I appreciate that,

possibly just spare $5 instead...

it and tried to throw it away.

325
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:45,365
- Brian, come on in!
- We have clients out there!

326
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,501
- Sure, you can! Two coming right up!
- Jimmy...

327
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:50,069
Sometimes, it gets a little jammed.

328
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,571
You just got to force it. Yeah!

329
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,741
Oh! Oh, shit!

330
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,141
Oh!

331
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:57,697
Shi... I'm... I'm spreading it around.

332
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,244
- Did I get you?
- Nah.

333
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,846
- I... Oh, now I got you with this.
- You got me now.

334
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:03,582
For Chrissakes, Jimmy!

[Music continues]

Backwards only... solo backward-o, yeah?

337
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,534
Because, uh, you've got suction
that way, leverage.

338
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,703
It's physics... el physico!

339
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:29,774
Oh, Don Clifford wants his floors
clean... limpio, limpar.

340
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:31,174
Uh. ¿Comprende?

341
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,075
Dude, I'm from Michigan.

342
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:36,446
So you don't understand
a word I've been saying.

343
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:37,714
Well...

344
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:39,215
[Sighs] Good night.

345
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,784
No, you try. Backwards.

346
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,454
[Music continues]

347
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:53,261
CLIFF: Excuse me.

348
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:55,631
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

349
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,299
Everyone can hear me? Good.

350
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:59,218
Frankly, this is not a conversation

351
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,236
I ever thought I would
have in my professional career,

352
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:03,371
but it's been brought to my attention

353
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:06,241
that we have an ongoing situation
in the washroom.

354
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:07,708
Someone is not flushing.

355
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:09,811
Once is an accident... maybe even twice.

356
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,712
Three times... no, that's a pattern.

357
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,047
And we're not talking
about a number one.

358
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:14,715
Yes. Thank you, Erin.

359
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,552
Now, I'm not here to shame anyone...

360
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:19,138
nor do I even want to
know who did it, but...

361
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,288
Uh, Cliff, it was me.

362
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:23,257
Jimmy, I just said I
didn't want to know.

363
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,459
Hey, we need the water.

364
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:28,495
I read somewhere that
the Santa Fe watershed

365
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,964
is down two full inches this year.

366
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,232
Every time you flush a toilet,

367
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:36,736
you waste a gallon of water... a gallon!

368
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:38,171
What could be greater than this?

369
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,106
They're low-flow toilets, Jimmy.

370
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,440
From now on, flush.

371
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:44,142
Low-flow... that's good.

372
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:45,744
Good thinking.

373

Jimmy, what's going on in there?

380
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:40,129
Jimmy!

381
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:42,632
Oh, you could hear
this through the door?

382
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,066
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

383
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,668
What do you think you're doing?

384
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,202
Uh, I took your advice.

385
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:48,537
I'm blowing off steam.

386
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:50,005
Blowing off steam?

387
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,974
Yeah, yeah, like you and
your guitar, you know?

388
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,309
Um, I got to say... you're right.

389
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:57,812
I mean, it really helps with stress.

390
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:00,148
I know I don't sound very
good, but I'm just learning.

391
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:02,918
I heard that the key is you have
to keep this bag inflated.

- [Sour notes play loudly]
- Enough!

393
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:06,353
Put that down. Now.

00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,355
I want you in my office.

What do I win?

398
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:22,069
You're fired.

399
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,370
What? Cliff, if this
is about the bagpipes...

400
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,706
It's not about the bagpipes.

401
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:28,708
Well, of course it's the bagpipes.

402
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:30,376
It's the bagpipes, and
it's the not flushing

403
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:31,691
and this... this optical migraine

404
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,512
you call a business suit.

405
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:36,950
It's about [Sighs]... It's
about you keeping your bonus.

406
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,851
That's what this is about.

407
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,753
Been brushing up on your
contract law, haven't you?

408
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,421
You want outta here, clearly,

409
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:46,024
but you can't just up and
quit and expect to keep your bonus.

410
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,559
And if I fire you for cause...

411
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,294
like I should have
done for the TV commercial...

412

again, no bonus.

413
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,965
However, if I fire you not for cause

414
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,801
but for being an all-around jackass...

415

been some malfeasance here...

Oh, save it.

418
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,737
I could fight you on this, but
you're not worth my time.

419
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,293
I'd rather just have you gone.

I'm sorry you feel that way.

421
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:14,784
I'll just, uh... pack up.

422
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,586
First... do me the favor

423
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:19,255
of not treating me like a fool for once.

424
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,058
Tell me... how exactly
did I mistreat you?

425
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,893
What did I do to
deserve this kind of behavior?

426
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:25,929
We gave you
opportunities, encouraged you to excel.

427

We got you a car, an apartment.

428

Hell, that cocobolo desk.

429
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,133
Do you see a desk like that in here?

430
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:32,801
You never gave this a chance.

431
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:34,369
Why?

432
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:39,008
I tried to make it
work... really, I-I did.

433
00:21:39,043 --> 00:21:42,611
I'm just... a square peg.

did you take the job?

I'm sorry.

436
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,623

$7,000.

00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:59,794
I'll write you a check.

00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:03,197
Fine, for whatever good that does.

Hey, Cliff, for what it's
worth, I think you're a good guy.

think you're an asshole.

00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,391
build our own future.

488
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,927
"Be our own bosses." [Chuckles]

489
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:33,262
What about clients?

490
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:35,597
Mesa Verde just
signed with you, didn't they?

491
00:24:35,632 --> 00:24:38,033
[Scoffs] It'll be a hard
sell to take them with me.

492
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,002
So, then there will
be another Mesa Verde.

493
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:42,204
That was all you, Kim.

494
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:45,274
You did it once. You can do it again.

495
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:48,675
You make it sound easy.

496
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:50,544
No. You're talking to a guy

497
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,947
who lived in the back of a nail salon.

498
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:55,616
No, this is gonna be a whole
lot of blood, sweat, and tears...

499
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:57,418
at least, at the start.

500
00:24:57,453 --> 00:25:00,687
But in the end, we'll have a
practice that is 100% ours...

501
00:25:00,723 --> 00:25:02,390
- that's worth it.
- [Sighs]

502
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:04,691
Or we fail and we end up with nothing.

503
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:06,859
Well, you're right... it's a gamble.

504
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:08,128
It's a big one.

505
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:10,063
Yeah, but you're betting on yourself,

506
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:12,966
and from where I sit, the
odds are in your favor.

507
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,467
You're an amazing lawyer.

508
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:17,070
This is your chance to
show the world that.

509
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:21,607
So, why not go to Schweikart?

510
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:22,975
They'll make me partner,

511
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,944
and they are a solid, respectable firm.

512
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:26,412
You can't deny that.

513
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:28,480
You deserve more than
just a lateral move.

514
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:30,715
Bottom line... that's
what Schweikart represents.

515
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:32,751
He's just Howard
Hamlin by a different name.

516
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:34,619
You keep talking about
me and Schweikart.

517
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:36,221
What about you and Davis & Main?

518
00:25:36,257 --> 00:25:38,457
That's over. I quit today.

519
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:41,025
Well, technically, I got fired.

520
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:43,894
What happened?

521
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,464
It was mutual and a long time coming.

522
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:48,666
That job was never the right fit for me.

523
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:50,634
This is.

524
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,941
If we're gonna be law
partners, I need to know one thing.

525
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:03,013
What kind of lawyer are you gonna be?

526
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:05,282
I don't mean what kind of
law are you gonna practice.

527
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,850
I mean [sighs]

528
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:10,253
Are you gonna play it straight,

529
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,689
or are you gonna... be colorful?

530
00:26:13,724 --> 00:26:17,994
I'm gonna play it
straight, right down the line.

531
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:22,131
I'm gonna dot every "I,"
and I'm gonna cross every...

532
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:34,009
There's no point in me doing
this if I can't be myself.

533
00:26:34,044 --> 00:26:37,045
Every time I try to do
things someone else's way,

534
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,713
it blows up in my face.

535
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:41,149
That's what happened at Davis & Main.

536
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,950
Look how that turned out.

537
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:46,787
I almost derailed your
career, pissed everyone off.

538
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:48,489
I've been trying to be

539
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:51,225
the person someone
else wants me to be for...

540
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,826
I don't know how long.

541
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,728
I mean, first, it was Chuck,

542
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:57,498
then it was you... and
that's not your fault.

543
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,649
That was my choice.

544
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,137
But if we're gonna do
this, I got to go into it as me.

545
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,139
So, yeah.

546
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:08,574
Colorful, I guess.

547
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,576
What do you say?

548
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,546
I just...

549
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:16,149
I don't see why it's so important to you

550
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:17,583
that we work together.

551
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:19,352
I mean, we're already...

552
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,653
[Chuckling] Why do you need me for this?

553
00:27:21,688 --> 00:27:25,590
I don't need you... I want you.

554
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,892
You've got me...

555
00:27:27,928 --> 00:27:31,729
just not as a law partner.

556
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:44,007
I have to get back to work.

557
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:45,376
You okay?

558
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:46,710
Yeah.

559
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,580
No, I'm fine.

560
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:51,748
Go on.

561
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:55,085
- See you later?
- [Scoffs]

562
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,752
[Chuckling] Yeah.

563
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,056

[Telephone rings in distance]

566
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:06,129
It's move-in ready, as you can see.

567
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:09,199
And they've renovated within
the past three years...

568
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,201
new floors, new kitchen.

569
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,601
[Inhales deeply]

570
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:15,370
And it's a good amount of space.

571
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:18,273
It's not too much house, you think?

572
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:19,908
No, not at all.

573
00:28:19,943 --> 00:28:22,244
And look at that backyard.

574
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:24,813
They're leaving the playhouse.

575
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,781
- Isn't that amazing?
- [Chuckles]

576
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:28,617
Kaylee will go crazy for that.

577
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:30,618
You'll never get her outta there.

578
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:32,720
I know, right?

579
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:34,155
And the most important part...

580
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,124
the schools are good and
the neighborhood is great.

581
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,127
I called the local precinct
and asked about the crime stats...

582
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:41,129
they're some of the lowest in the city.

583
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:42,930
Plus, I got a good vibe from him.

584
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:44,898
Like, they sounded really responsive.

585
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:46,133
That sounds perfect.

586
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:47,667
Yeah. [Sighs]

587
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:49,169
Do you like it?

588
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:51,971
If you're happy, I'm happy.

589
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:53,473
Do you like it?

590
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:55,842
Yeah, I do, but I'm...

591
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:58,845
- But what?
- It's a lot of money.

592
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,847
I know... I'm like a
broken record, but it is.

593
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,282
You don't worry about that.

594
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:04,150
We'll make it happen, whatever the cost.

595
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,584
- Mike.
- Hey, I'm serious.

596
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,986
Not another thought.

597
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:10,422
If you want it, it's yours.

Oh, it's perfect.

- Let's do it.
- Fantastic.

Do you have another hour?

604
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:28,606
We could go down to the office,

605
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,974
get the pre-approval
in order, all that.

Oh, sounds good. We'll meet you there.

Sure. See you in a few.

so much as scratched it.

You don't think it's a good idea now?

816
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:28,327
Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

817
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:31,898
No, I'm... I'm
surprised, is all. [Chuckles]

818
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:34,166
Hey, I s... I said all along,

819
00:40:34,202 --> 00:40:35,902
you're too good for those clowns.

820
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:37,203
I mean, this is, uh...

821
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:39,906
Shit, yeah. Wow!

822
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,607
It's great.

823
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:43,108
Good.

824
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:47,479
To that end... I have a pitch for you.

825
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:58,589
Not Wexler-McGill, but Wexler...

826
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,625
and McGill.

827
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,861
We find an office,
share the housekeeping costs,

828
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:06,363
the rent, electricity... everything.

829
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:09,266
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law,

830
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,235
and you are Jimmy
McGill, attorney at law,

831
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,471
both free to practice as we see fit.

832
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:17,273
Separate firms under one roof?

833
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,976
We're both headed uptown, so
why can't we share a taxi?

834
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:23,613
You do things your
way, and I do them mine.

835
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:25,281
We'll have freedom,

836
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,785
but we aren't each
trying to go it alone.

837
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:34,423
Not partners... solo
practitioners, together.

838
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,792
What do you think?

839
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,663
[Chuckling] I don't know what to say.

840
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,198
Say yes.

841
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:54,037
