00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:16,278
Oh, yeah? Schweikart and
Cokely keep referring to

351
00:21:18,282 --> 00:21:20,248

of residents' contracts.

352
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:22,884
Not a single one has opted out,
which makes me think

353
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,620
it's more of a mandatory
financial arrangement.

354
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:27,422

the "failure to state a claim"

thereby voluntary.

357

I think we can counter that

358
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:35,530
if "opting in" is a requirement
for residency,

00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,018
They've buried us in paperwork,

501
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:39,820
but nothing actually relevant
to the particulars in this case.

502
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,355
No real surprise there.

503
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:43,524
We may have to subpoena their bank records.

504
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,793
Thank you, Erin. Jimmy.

505
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:47,328
How we doing with client outreach?

506
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,497
Oh, while we're waiting on those subpoenas,

507
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,632
I'm thinking we should t
wrangling some of this stuff

508
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,234
from the clients themselves.

509
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:56,003
Most of these folks
have hard copies of everything

510
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,839
going back to the
Eisenhower administration.

511
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,342
Of course, given some of their, uh...

512
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,578
Inconsistent organizational practices,

513
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:06,914
- it's gonna be slow going.

514
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:10,084
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

515
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,920
Uh, this one lady, um, she's sweet,

516
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:15,189
but, uh, deaf as a doornail.

517
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:19,026
She keeps all of her paperwork
in, um, she keeps it...

518
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,494
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jimmy.

519
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,729
I'm gonna need everybody's phone,

520
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:23,898
key fobs, and electronics.

521
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:59,767
Chuck. Welcome.

522
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:01,802
Please. Have a seat.

523
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:04,138
Don't mind me.

00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:07,374
Hey, everybody.

[Clears throat]

526
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:14,448
Sorry for the interruption.

527
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:16,117
Just pretend I'm not here.

528
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,619
Happy to have you.

529
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:20,654
Jimmy, where were we?

530
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,791
Uh, yeah.

531
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:26,127
So, I was saying...

532
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:31,098
Um...

533
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,769
Uh, getting the documents
from some of the clients...

534
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,642
We definitely have some pack rats.

535
00:33:41,677 --> 00:33:43,444
God bless 'em.

536
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:47,014
I was visiting Mrs. Gusdorff
at, uh, Sandpiper Santa Fe,

537
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:51,652
and I spent the whole afternoon
sorting through just a haystack

538
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:55,122
of recipes and half-off coupons
from big lots.

539
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:59,126
But now we've got copies of
this woman's monthly statements

540
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,695
going back to March 1997,

541
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:04,431
so it might be a little labor-intensive,

542
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:08,602
but our clients will always be
our best resource.

543
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:10,704
Plus, they have ribbon candy.

544

00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,002
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.

It's Ehrmantraut. [Sighs]

557
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,600
You still morally flexible?

558
00:35:12,635 --> 00:35:16,370
If so, I might have a job for you.

559
00:35:18,207 --> 00:35:21,242
Where and when?

560
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:28,703
Take a seat.

561
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:34,443
Mr. Wormald, thank you
for coming in and talking to us.

562
00:35:34,478 --> 00:35:35,744
Yeah, of course.

563
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:37,245
Yeah, we've been looking at the reports

564
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:38,980
that the officers took at the scene,

565
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:41,516
and we have a few
‭small follow-up questions.

566
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:44,252
Uh, sorry to waste your time.
Just standard stuff.

567
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:45,987
There's really no need
for a lawyer to be here.

568
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:48,790
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.

569
00:35:48,826 --> 00:35:51,960
Dan just, uh, wanted
a friendly face next to him.

00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:54,296
Coleman: ‭Well, we're all friendly here.

[Chuckles]

573
00:35:58,202 --> 00:35:59,801
We just want to get the facts straight

574
00:35:59,837 --> 00:36:02,137
so we can, um, help you get
your property for you.

575
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:04,206
Yeah, you know, uh, it's fine.

576
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:07,275
Uh, yeah, there's no need to, uh...

577
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:09,311
No, it's just standard procedure.

578
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:10,846
You know, ‭officers don't always get

579
00:36:10,881 --> 00:36:13,215
all the information we need in their report.

580
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,151
We just want to find the guys
who took your baseball cards.

581
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:18,820
Yeah, that's, uh...

582
00:36:18,856 --> 00:36:21,556
You know, my uncle
‭had a Ty Cobb tobacco card.

583
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:24,626
Kept that thing behind six inches of glass

584
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,361
like it was the Mona Lisa or something.

585
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:28,396
Wow. Ty Cobb?

586
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:29,831
Tell him to keep the lights low.

587
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:32,167
Even artificial lighting
has a certain amount

588
00:36:32,202 --> 00:36:37,506
of ultraviolet radiation
that can, uh, you know...

- Over the long term...
- Yeah.

590
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:41,343
Um, can you just remind us

591
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:44,312
exactly where you kept
your cards in the house?

592
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:49,050
Yeah, well, uh, as I was trying
to say, it's no longer an issue.

593
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:51,753
I found them.

594
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:53,221
So you found the cards?

595
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:55,056
Uh, yep.

596
00:36:55,092 --> 00:37:00,028
I just wanted to come down and
tell you, you know, in person.

597
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:01,830
You found them?

598
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:03,565
Where? Around the house?

599
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,835
No. I, uh, I hired a private investigator,

600
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,004
and he tracked them down.

601
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,405
So, yeah.

602
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,342
Really? So, where were they?

603
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:16,444
You know, it's fine. It is.

604
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,180
I really... I ought to get out of your hair.

605
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:21,850
Uh, you've wasted enough time on me.

606
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:24,686
No, no, it's... ‭it's okay. It's our job.

608

I just... I know how much, you know,

612
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:37,608
you guys have on your hands,

613
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:41,190
like murderers and robbers
and gangs and stuff. I...

Hey, Danny, ‭why don't you get some air?

You can have some coffee.

00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,797
I'll finish up ‭with the detectives here.

617
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,774
Okay, let's get down
to brass tacks here, guys.

618
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,011
I'm guessing your two
fine uniformed officers

619
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,946
found Mr. Wormald's little hidey hole,

620
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:06,015
and that's why you two are so interested

621
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,850
in "helping" my friend here.

622
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,819
I get it.

623
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,387
A hiding place in the baseboard...

624
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,222
it's gonna make anyone suspicious.

625
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:17,159
But let me assure you there's
nothing illegal going on here.

626
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,828
Then why is he so nervous?

627
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,630
Mm-hmm. 'Cause I must say, the
flop sweat is kind of suspect.

628
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,633
We all have our secrets, don't we?

629
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,003
And who among us is without sin?

630
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,040
But those sins aren't all
of the criminal variety,

631
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,542
and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?

632
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,745
They are, however, very private.

633
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,014
Private, like drug dealer, maybe?

634
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,648
No, no!

635
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,251
He's being evasive because
it's a sensitive subject,

636
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:46,222
very delicate, and of no concern
to law enforcement.

637
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:49,492
You know, as much as we'd love
to, um, take your word for it,

638
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,327
we're gonna need a little more than that.

639
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,331
All right, well, this all comes
down to a personal dispute.

640
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,699
That's all.

641
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,368
It's... it's between, um, Mr. Wormald

642
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:04,473
and, uh... his art patron.

643
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,043
- "Art patron"?
- Yeah.

644
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:12,448
Uh, my client has an arrangement
with a wealthy gentleman

645

for whom [clears throat]
Mr. Wormald provides...

Art in exchange for
‭this gentleman's generous, uh...

647
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:25,928
We'll call it patronage.

648
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:29,098
Art? Like... like what? Paintings?

649
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,901
It's more like digital media.

650
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,203
Digital media?

651
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,906
He made videos for the man.

652
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,140
What kind of videos?

653
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,976
Private videos of an artistic nature.

654
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,145
That's what was in the hiding place.

655
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,814
That's what it's for.

656
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:51,921
So, this art patron stole the
videos and the baseball cards?

657
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,956
Well, there was a misunderstanding.

658
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,492
I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.

661
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:05,734
Guys, this all comes down
to just a lovers' spat, okay?

662
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,437
Two consenting adults had a falling out.

663
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:09,738
That happens.

664
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,175
And the, uh, "patron" stole the videos

665
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,945
and the baseball cards, uh,
to "make a point," I guess.

666
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,248
But the headline here is, it's all settled.

667
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,583
Hearts have mended,

668
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:24,453
and Mr. Wormald will not
be pressing charges.

669
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,857
What was on these videos?

670
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,493
- They were private.
- You've said that.

671
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,961
[Sighs]

672
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:38,902
They were videos intended
to titillate the senses.

673
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,138
- Okay, so porn.
- Not... no.

674
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,873
Not as such.

675
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,343
Technically, they would be
categorized as fetish videos.

676
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,178
But nothing illegal.

677
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,981
Just a man... a fully
clothed man, I might add...

678
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,183
just all by himself.

679
00:40:54,218 --> 00:41:00,489
Just... just Mr. Wormald
fully clothed, uh, yeah.

680
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,359
So... all right.

681
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:10,366
So, fully clothed Mr. Wormald
by himself doing what?

682
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,434
Yeah, come on, man. What?

683
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,706
[Sighs] Squat cobbler.

684
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:21,310
What's a s-squat cobbler?

685
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,712
Squat cobbler.
‭You know what squat cobbler is.

686
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,548
No, I don't... I don't know
what a squat cobbler is.

687
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,983
No, me neither. What is it?

688
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,052
What? And you two guys are cops?

689
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:33,689
Hoboken squat cobbler.

690
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,258
Full moon moon-pie.

691
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:40,029
Boston cream splat. [Chuckles]

692
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,263
Seriously?

693
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:44,099
Simple-Simon-the-ass-man.

694
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,534
Dutch apple ass.

695
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,604
Guys, am I not speaking English here?

696
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,105
What the hell is a squat cobbler?!

697
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,007
It's when a man sits in pie!

698
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,910
He sits in a pie!

699
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:58,614
And he... he wiggles around.

700
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:02,084
Maybe it's like hellmann's mayonnaise.

701
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,286
It has a different name west of the rockies.

702
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,088
I don't know. But, uh, technically,

703
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,958
he does a crybaby squat, so there's tears,

704
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,026
which makes it more specialized.

705
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,128
Not all pie sitters cry.

706
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,730
But I'm gonna tell you something.

707
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,866
This guy is a regular Julianne Moore

708
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,101
once he gets ‭the waterworks cranked up.

709
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,070
Pies?

710
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,404
What? Like apple?

711
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,106
Guys, I'm not ‭the
filmmaker here, all right?

712
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:28,544
Banana cream. I... uh, peach.

713
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,081
Oh, and there... And there
is a costume involved.

714
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,783
[Snorts]

715
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,986
You got to be shitting us.

716
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:40,422
Yeah, like I would make this up.

717
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:44,827
Hey, the world is
‭a rich tapestry, my friends.

718
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,563
But trust me on this.

719
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,665
You don't want to see it.

720
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,133
[Chuckles]

721
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:00,409
So, uh, we're good, right?

722
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,946
Yeah. Great. [Chuckles]

723
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,615
There is, however, one little,
tiny hanging Chad.

724
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,651
Well, what? What Chad?

725
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,719
You're gonna have to make a video.

726
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,324
[Keys jingle]

727
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,860
[Insects chirping]

728
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,468
[Grunts]

729
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,345
Kim: [Laughs] Wait. Wait.

730
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,515
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?

731
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,717
Both. Whatever you want.

732
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,552
Which comes first?

733
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,387
Uh, it's dealer's choice.

734
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,489
That's where the crying comes in, right?

735
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,325
That's a safe bet.

736
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,726
[Laughs]

737
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,895
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?

738
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,863
If you gave me a million years,

739
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:56,565
I still would not have come up with that.

740
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,633
The muse.

741
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,168
She speaks through me.

742
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,303
I am but a humble vessel.

743
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:02,571
And they bought it?

744
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,340
- Yeah.
- Wow.

745
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,974
I've heard some far-out
scenarios used to sow doubt,

746
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,743
but this definitely takes the cake.

747
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,912
Kim, Kim, Kim.

748
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,080
- Takes the pie.
- Yeah.

749
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,548
[Chuckling] Sorry.

750
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,249
I should just jump off the roof right now.

751
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,819
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

752
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,088
Jesus, can you tell a story.

753
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:23,926
Well, to be fair, I think it was
the video that clinched it.

754
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:26,195
What video?

755
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,231
Wait, wait. You...
‭You actually made a video?

756
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,101
I got to say, in the end,
ol' Dan really committed.

757
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,570
I believed the tears.

758
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:39,408
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.

759
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:42,945
I wasn't sure how many takes
we would need, so I over-bought,

760
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,949
but I promise you,
‭untouched by human buttocks.

761
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,685
You fabricated evidence?

762
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,453
I made a video.

763
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,122
Not exactly evidence.

764
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,757
You used it to exonerate a client.

765
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:58,861
You used falsified evidence
to exonerate a client.

766
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,429
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.

767
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,064
I'm not splitting hairs.

768
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:06,268
What if Davis & Main find out
you faked evidence?

769
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,036
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

770
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,773
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.

771
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,908
It was off the clock. It was,
uh, totally my own thing.

772
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:13,976
Why?

773
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,947
Why would you risk
‭the best job you've ever had

774
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,916
for some pro-bono case?

775
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,785
I was doing a favor for a friend.

776
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,721
Risking disbarment?
That's... that's some friend.

777
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,223
It's fine! It... it worked out.

778
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,092
Davis & Main are none the wiser.

779
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,960
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.

780
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:34,596
I didn't see you complaining

781
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,900
when, um, Ken the douchebag paid
our bar bill the other night.

782
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,636
No, that was a little bit
of rule breaking right there.

783
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,272
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.

784
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,573
A lot.

785
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,909
That is so not the same thing.

786
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,343
How? What's the difference?

787
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:49,912
That had nothing to do with work.

788
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,915
And we were just... just screwing around.

789
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,949
This?

790
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,819
Fabricating evidence.

791
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,754
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.

792

If they find out, if you get caught...

00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,758
It... they're never gonna find out.

794
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,093
Seriously? You sound like
every dumb criminal out there.

795
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,696
If you keep this up, they will find out.
