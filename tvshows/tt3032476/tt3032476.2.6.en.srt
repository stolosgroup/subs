168
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,434
that the plaintiffs
produce their medical records

169
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:21,369
or, barring that, a signed HIPAA release

170
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,738
so that we can examine
the records ourselves.

171
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,873
Your Honor, our clients' medical records

172
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,076
have no bearing on the merits of this case.

173
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,744
The medical records are plainly relevant,

174
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,779
as they bear directly on our contention

175
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:35,149
that the plaintiffs are not
adequate class representatives.

176
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:37,552
This is a transparent
attempt at intimidation.

177
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,765
- Nothing more.
- How so?

178
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,124
Many of our clients have information

179
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,227
in their medical records that
they prefer to keep private.

180
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:46,244
They're fearful, as any of us would be,

181
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,913
at the thought of a bunch of strangers
poking around in their personal files,

182
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,807
and by forcing them
to reveal this information,

183
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:53,877
the defense is banking on them
simply dropping out of the case.

184
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,613
Your Honor, this is about class
certification. That's all.

185
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:59,658
If the named plaintiffs
are suffering from dementia

186
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:01,616
- or other mental deficiencies...
- You're saying they're incompetent?

187
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,154
I'm saying we have the right to any record

188
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,622
that would speak to their competency,

189
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,057
as regards this class-certification issue.

190
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:08,515
Your Honor, it seems that the defense
wants to have it both ways, then.

191
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,183
If our clients are suffering from dementia,

192
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,252
then the residency contracts
they signed with Sandpiper

193
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,853
couldn't have been entered into knowingly.

194
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,155
No, no. That is not what we're...

195
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,456
The defense wants to claim

196
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,258
that their residents are competent enough

197
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,161
to be held to their contracts
but too incompetent to sue.

198
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,695
So which is it?

199
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,864
Many of the residents signed
their contracts years ago,

200
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,500
and at the time,
they were perfectly competent.

201
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,102
But that can change,

202
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,538
especially when we're talking
about elderly individuals.

203
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:34,107
Or maybe Sandpiper preyed
on mentally incompetent seniors

204
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,775
and bilked them out of their money.

205
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,043
Miss Wexler.

206
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,380
I am simply trying to defend our clients

207
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,148
from bullying by the defense.

208
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:44,951
Your Honor, as stated
in the brief in front of you,

209
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,619
this is a standard request,

210
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,621
granted in every case of its kind.

211
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,390
This is not about bullying.

212
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,492
Granting this invasion of privacy

213
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:55,128
allows our clients to be doubly victimized.

214
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:58,198
I ask that you deny the
defense's motion, Your Honor.

215
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm leaning toward granting the motion,

216
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:03,536
but I would like to review
the pleadings and briefs again.

217
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,705
I'll have my decision for you shortly.

218
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,507
Adjourned.

219
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:15,715
I'm gonna meet you back at the office.

220
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,659
Ms. Wexler. Hey.

221
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:29,095
I just wanted to say, good work in there.

222
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,998
Thanks, but I... I'm pretty sure I lost.

223
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,334
Oh, of course you did.
It's an unwinnable position.

224
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,502
That's why your boss
didn't bother showing up.

225
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:39,505
But you went down swinging,
and I admire that.

226
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,174
Thank you.

227
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,109
What are you doing for lunch?

228
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,113
Um, probably just grabbing something
from the vending machines.

229
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,381
Oof.

230
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,049
We can do better than that.

231
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,786
Mr. Schweikart, good to see you, sir.

232
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,455
- Ah, how you doing, Sean?
- Very well.

233
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,857
Can I get some drinks for
you two? Your usual Moscow Mule?

234
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,859
Absolutely. You want one?

235
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,128
Best Moscow Mule in the city.

236
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,199
Fresh ginger, real copper mug, the works.

237
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,868
That's very vintage, but I'm good.

238
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,203
Just an iced tea.

239
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,571
Ah. You sure?

240
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,106
All right, then.

241
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,474
I'll be the sole degenerate

242
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,109
who's drinking in the middle of a work day.

243
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,111
That, too, is vintage.

244
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,545
[Chuckles] I'll get those started.

245
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,047
Mm.

246
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:25,952
So, you've been with HHM, what... 10 years?

247
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,289
Uh... Yeah, last August.

248
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,791
And you started in the mail room?

249
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,093
I did. I was six years there.

250
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:35,461
How did you know that?

251
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,163
Oh, I asked around. It's a small town.

252
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,966
You know, it sounds like
you certainly paid your dues.

253
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,501
I was very fortunate.

254
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:43,670
HHM put me through law school
while I worked.

255
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:46,172
That's great that
they foster talent like that.

256
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,274
And I imagine you're paying it
off as part of your deal?

257
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:49,509
Yeah, happily.

258
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:50,910
It's a pretty standard arrangement.

259
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,613
I have to say, watching you in court today,

260
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,582
it sure did bring back
some old memories for me.

261
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,351
One in particular, anyway.

262
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,919
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

263
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:02,155
I was a year out of law school
at this firm in Boston,

264
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,790
and I was finally put
on my first big case...

265
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:06,592
this huge employment-discrimination suit.

266
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:09,095
That thing kept us in billing for a decade.

267
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,464
Anyway, we landed this monster,

268
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,033
and I find out I'm second chair
to one of the partners

269
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:15,802
on the preliminary hearing,

270
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,171
and I think, "This is it.

271
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,140
This is what will define
the rest of my career."

272
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,476
So, the hearing's getting closer and closer,

273
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,878
I even get this new suit
that I can't afford...

274
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,814
I split it over three credit cards.

275
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,183
I'm probably still paying it off
to this day.

276
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,718
[Chuckles]

277
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:34,287
So, I go in bright and early,
I'm wearing my new suit,

278
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,390
prepping my table, and in walks
the opposing counsel.

279
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:40,949
There's four of them, one senior partner

280
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,506
and three high-level associates.

281
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,631
These guys have been litigating
longer than I've been alive.

282
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,201
But I think, "Mm, I'm good.

283
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,069
I got my boss coming.

284
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,404
"It'll be fine."

285
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,640
So, I'm sitting alone, at my table,

286
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,143
waiting for my boss to show.

287
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,544
And I'm waiting.

288
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,046
And I'm waiting.

289
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,181
And then, suddenly,
they're calling us to order,

290
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,851
and I realize that no one
from my firm is coming.

291
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,219
It's just me.

292
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,221
So I think, "All right, then.

293
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,889
This is the moment."

294
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,393
And I get up there, and I argue
like my life depended on it.

295
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,662
I'm sweating, and I'm citing
statutes left and right.

296
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,064
And I'm doing okay.

297
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,432
Respectable.

298
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,702
But I'm just a BB gun
to these four howitzers.

299
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,106
And I lose, of course.

300
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,775
It was inevitable.

301
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,843
But later, it hit me

302
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:35,047
that my boss never intended to show.

303
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:36,883
And they all laughed about it.

304
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,552
They patted me on the back,
said it was my trial by fire,

305
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,288
and I laughed with them, but, you know,

306
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,690
it never really sat well with me.

307
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:47,026
You want them to have your back.

308
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,228
Because at the end of the day,

309
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:51,697
it wasn't about proving my mettle.

310
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,134
My boss had a tee time
that he didn't want to miss.

311
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,738
I wasn't there long.

312
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,912
Could I ask why we... are here?

313
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,380
[Clears throat]

314
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:10,283
You know, I've had my eye on you
for a while.

315
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,884
Since that Kettleman thing.

316
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,120
That was an excellent deal you got for him.

317
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,289
And I'm wondering why someone

318
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,991
who could put together a deal like that

319
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,028
is arguing a losing position with no backup.

320
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,132
I have no complaints about HHM.

321
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,800
That's great.

322
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:32,738
However, if on the off chance,
if you're pondering a change,

323
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,507
Schweikart and Cokely
would be more than happy

324
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,175
to put your talents to good use.

325
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,678
Uh...

326
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,313
Of course, we'd have to have

Let's get you a drink.

So, what do you do, Dale?

503
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,134
I'm an engineer.

But you could still
wear the hat, though, right?

No, Dale's a good guy.
He's not gonna do anything.

Thank you.

All right, I am off
to the little girl's room.

So, Giselle was telling me
you two are starting a business.

What exactly did she tell you?

540

Oh, nothing much.

541
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,217
