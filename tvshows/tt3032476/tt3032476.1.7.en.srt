00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:06,562
- Jesus, Chuck.
- [Chuckling] Yeah.

166
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,749
Two days ago, I could
barely stand 30 seconds.

167
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,016
I'm trying to get up to
five minutes by next week.

168
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,467
That is just...

169
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:15,780
Uh, but why now?

170
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:18,548
Well, after what happened with the police

171
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,243
and the hospital,

172
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,682
I almost lost everything, Jimmy.

173
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:25,152
I can't go on like this.

174
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,874
I have to find a way to get better.

175
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:29,257
I've got to.

176
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:30,952
I have to get back to work.

177
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:32,365
Sitting here,

178
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:34,054
rotting away...

179
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,405
this is no kind of life
for me... for anyone.

180
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,535
I need to be useful again.

181
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,803
- [Sighs]
- Chuck...

182
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,918
I am so proud of you.

183
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,283
Oh. [Chuckles]

184
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:49,986
It'll be a long process,

185
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,255
but one to which I'm very much committed.

186
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:55,569
I have to be.

187
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:57,571
[Clock ticking]

188
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,054
[Sighs]

189
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:01,205
God, I... I'll be right back.

190
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,098
I got to get a few more
things out of the car.

191
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,511
All right.

192
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,200
[Groans]

193
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:10,138
Ahh.

194
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,570
Ohh.

195
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,112
[Chuckles]

196
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,102
[Laughing] All right.

197
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,045
What's all this?

198
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:23,470
It's just some case files.
I'm out of room at the office.

199
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:24,889
I don't want to leave them in the car.

200
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,051
There's a lot of sensitive information.

201
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:29,203
Y... you're not planning
to leave them here.

202
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,390
Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.

203
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:34,217
It'll just be for a little while, okay?

204
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,933
I'm practically sleeping on
these things back at my place.

205
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,230
Business is that good?

206
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:42,056
[Chuckles] It's booming streets of gold.

207
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:45,335
Yeah. I'll get these out
of here as quick as I can.

208
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:48,040
I just need to file the
4-13s on some of these wills,

209
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:50,264
and, uh, I'll be out of your hair.

210
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:51,290
4-13s?

211
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,378
Personal property statements.

212
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,443
- You mean 5-13s.
- Yeah.

213
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:57,762
Sorry. I was just working
with these seniors.

214
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,227
Maybe the dementia's
contagious, huh? [Chuckles]

215
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:01,962
Uh-huh.

216
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:04,387
- Uh...
- [clears throat] So, uh,

217
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:05,803
we good here?

218
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,746
See you tomorrow. Same time.

219
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,567
[Door closes]

220
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,195
[Sighs]

221
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,202
[Birds chirping]

222
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:46,797
James McGill.

223
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,925
Scott said he'd leave the keys to 801,

224
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:50,884
the suite that's for lease.

225
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:53,856
Here you go. Just bring
them back when you're done.

226
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:54,834
You got it.

227
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:57,517
Wow, this is, like...

228
00:11:58,564 --> 00:11:59,891
<i>really</i> nice. [Chuckles]

229
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:01,980
- Why do you sound surprised?
- Not...

230
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,843
surprised, no. Just,

231
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,571
you know, could you afford this?

232
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,772
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?

233
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:11,224
Those seniors have been very good to me.

234
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,874
- I've been meaning to expand, you know?
- [Telephone rings]

235
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,835
It's time to invest in myself.

236
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,436
Figure this may be just the place.

237
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,550
Well, won't you miss the nail salon?

238
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,215
Oh, I can always visit, you know,

239
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:26,135
get some French tips.

240
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,014
[Elevator bell dings]

241
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,211
[Elevator doors open]

242
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,342
[Lock turns, door opens]

243
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:34,739
[Chuckles]

244
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,113
Wow.

245
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,183
It's a clean slate. [Sighs]

246
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:41,451
Put the, uh, reception desk right here.

247
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:44,188
Uh, get some comfortable
seating for the clients.

248
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,835
I... it's big... lot of offices.

249
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,008
Yeah, I like the openness.

250
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:51,603
I feel like I can
breathe in here, you know?

251
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:52,670
It's not some

252
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,218
claustrophobic, little closet
that smells like acetone.

253
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,127
[Chuckles]

254
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:58,759
Room to grow.

255
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:01,304
Dream big, I say.

256
00:13:01,702 --> 00:13:02,538
[Clicks tongue]

257
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,651
Got a decent-size conference room...

258
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,797
not as big as Hamlin's, but, you know,

259
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:11,749
it's cozy. Our elderly
brethren prefer that, I find.

260
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,344
Yeah. Could be cozier, though.

261
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:15,392
Maybe you could embroider
some little cushions,

262
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,511
crochet a runner for the table.

263
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,022
- And rocking chairs all around?
- Yes.

264
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:22,657
Make it look like the front
of a cracker barrel, huh?

265
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:24,628
- [Both chuckle]
- Now you're talking.

266
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,034
This is me.

267
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,671
[Sighs]

268
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:29,981
[Chuckling] I love it.

269
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,795
Got to look successful to<i>
be</i> successful. Am I right?

270
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,004
Well, this definitely
looks like success. [Laughs]

271
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,537
Great view.

272
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:40,961
Get you a big, fancy desk in here.

273
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:42,554
Cocobolo desk.

274
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,305
A what?

275
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:45,680
I don't know what it means,
but I just like saying the word

276
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:46,947
"cocobolo."

277
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,085
Okay, well, whatever it is,

278
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:50,659
you deserve it.

279
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,416
And, uh, I want you to see this one.

280
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:02,610
Here we are.

281
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,270
[Chuckles] Whoa.

282
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:10,303
This is way better than the other one.

283
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,549
- You think?
- Uh, yeah.

284
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:13,487
Who goes in here?

285
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:16,475
'Cause I'd be all up in here if I were you.

286
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:19,228
Yeah. [Inhales sharply]

287
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:22,934
Yeah, you know, you're
right. It is real nice.

288
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,111
It's a corner office. You got
to go with the corner office.

289
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,606
Eh, I was saving it for someone.

290
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,424
- Who?
- Well, my partner.

291
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,145
Your partner? Who's...

292
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,303
[Chuckles]

293
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:33,841
Who would that be?

294
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,453
Well, you said you were
interested in elder law.

295
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:40,083
That's...

296
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:41,491
That is so...

297
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,719
[chuckles]

298
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:43,594
Thank you.

299
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:44,828
Really.

300
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:48,805
But you know I've got
a lot invested at HHM.

301
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:50,545
With what's going on now,

302
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,117
I... I'm closer than ever to partner...

303
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:53,985
like, maybe two years, and I'm in.

304
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,592
[Chuckling] Yeah, I know.

305
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,882
Yeah, it's...

306
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,364
- it's just a thought.
- Plus,

307
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,980
you know, they put me through law school.

308
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,190
I feel like I owe them.

309
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,928
Actually, I<i> do</i> owe them...

310
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,673
literally, you know?

311
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,821
But it's a nice thought, Jimmy.

312
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,722
Just, uh, you know,

313
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,309
playing with ideas.

314
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,063
So, I had the extra office
and everything, so...

315
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:17,554
Yeah. No, I get it. It's...

316
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:25,512
I... want to see the kitchen.

317
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:32,428
- Wow!
- [Sighs]

318
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:35,078
They have stainless in here.

319
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:37,307
I don't even have stainless at home.

320
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,065
Kim: I know this is the
last thing you want to hear.

321
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,229
I think your chances of
getting a favorable ruling

322
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:50,865
from a jury are very slim.

323
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:55,004
Mr. Kettleman: What does that mean?

324
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:57,166
We're not in a great
position to win at trial.

325
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,744
But we came to you people

326
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,818
because we were told you win cases.

327
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:02,081
Winning doesn't always mean

328
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,580
getting a favorable verdict at trial.

329
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:05,418
We try to achieve the best possible outcome

330
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,876
for our clients, given
each individual case.

331
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:12,468
Frankly, we've worked very
hard to stave off an arrest.

332
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:15,329
After the misunderstanding about your, uh,

333
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:18,804
camping trip, the D.A. was
concerned you might be a flight risk.

334
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:20,937
[Scoffs] A flight risk? We...

335
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,680
we were practically in
our own backyard. [Laughs]

336
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,429
That's exactly what we told the D.A.

337
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:28,139
In any case, I think we've
managed to come up with a deal

338
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,223
- that is very favorable under the circumstances.
- A deal?

339
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:31,353
I hate that terminology.

340
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:32,621
A deal is what they got O.J.

341
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,729
- Well, Betsy, maybe we should, you know, hear it.
- I'm just saying, it's terrible term.

342
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:37,460
What kind of... deal?

343
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,528
If the prosecution decides to file,

344
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:42,565
which is definitely the
direction this seems to be headed,

345
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,295
and if they choose to stack charges,

346
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:45,077
Craig,

347
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,094
you're looking at 30 years in prison.

348
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:48,309
30 years?

349
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,574
That's the maximum, and
given the nature of the charge

350
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:52,005
and the current political environment,

351
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:53,407
I'd say we should expect it.

352
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,391
The public outcry in

353
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:57,510
cases like these is a big factor.

354
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:01,304
However, after much
discussion with the D.A.,

355
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:04,335
who is also invested in
keeping the press to a minimum,

356
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,371
we have arrived at an arrangement,

357
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:09,305
which would include 16
months in a county facility.

358
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:10,670
16 months.

359
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:12,926
Down from 30 years.

360
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:15,027
And you most likely
wouldn't serve all of it.

361
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:17,515
But he would have to say he was guilty.

362
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,749
Admitting wrongdoing and

363
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:22,038
making the county whole
again goes a long way here...

364
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:25,326
- hence the minimal sentence.
- Uh, "making the county whole again"?

365
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,723
It includes the stipulation
that you return $1.6 million

366
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,167
in misappropriated funds.

367
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:31,627
- Give back the money?
- But there is no money.

368
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,852
- There's no money.
- We told you... Craig is innocent.

369
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:35,774
I understand.

370
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:37,082
However,

371
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:39,189
I'd like to emphasize again that

372
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,415
this deal is Craig's best
chance of minimizing jail time.

373
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:43,792
You're telling us

374
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:46,217
there are drug dealers and murderers

375
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,283
walking the streets,

376
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:48,706
but instead of going after them,

377
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,487
they want to put an innocent man in jail.

378
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:52,528
There's no other... way?

379
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,994

under the circumstances,

- You have to take this to trial.
- Look,

you have a difficult,

387
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:10,856
but nevertheless straightforward
choice to make here.

388
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,825
- On one hand, you give up the money,
- Ah!

389
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,872
- plead...
- I just told you... there is no money.

390
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:16,899
... plead guilty...

391
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,665
it's painful, I know...

392
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,430
and go to jail for a year and a half.

393
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:22,818
But your other choice...

394
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:24,559
that is no choice at all.

395
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,419
If you go to trial,
you'll most likely lose,

396
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,973
and Craig goes to prison for decades.

00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:24,241
So, your previous objections to
my representing you are now...

489
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,453
Oh, I'm sorry about my

490
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:28,673
ט bluntness at our last
encounter. ט [Chuckles]

491
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,339
- Unfortunate.
- Mm-hmm.

492
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:31,529
- Yeah, I...
- But we really...

493
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:32,811
we're very sorry about that.

494
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:35,366
We thought long and hard
about it, and, um, we...

495
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:38,334
And, you know, given your passion

496
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:40,840
- and your can-do attitude...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

497
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,681
... we really...

498
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:44,244
- we just believe that you're the lawyer for us.
- For us, yes.

499
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:48,249
Well, as flattered as I am by this,

500
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,939
um, since we last spoke,

501
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,181
I've changed my area of specialization,

502
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:54,811
so I concentrate on elder law now.

503
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,539
But, I mean, you said that
you would fight for us.

504
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,473
- Yeah, you...
- You, you were you were adamant.

505
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:01,334
You promised to get us
a not-guilty verdict.

506
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:03,826
I don't think I exactly<i>
promised</i> that.

507
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:05,600
You said we would be client number one,

508
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:06,553
morning, noon, or night, and...

509
00:23:06,597 --> 00:23:07,944
Yes, and I meant what I said,

510
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:09,521
at the time, but

511
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,003
times change.

512
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:14,833
But we've already paid you a retainer.

513
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:18,734
Right.

514
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,723
A retainer.

515
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:22,762
That<i> is</i> what you called it.

516
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,710
That was your specific terminology.

517
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:25,968
It...

518
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:28,178
could you excuse me for a moment?

519
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:31,225
I, uh, had a big gulp on the way over.

520
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,742
- Ohh.

- [Urinating resumes]
- Funny story.

528
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:49,278
I found something that
belongs to you... again.

529
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:51,081
- Yeah? What?
- "Who?"

530
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:54,460
Picture "The 25th Hour,"
starring Ned and Maude Flanders.

531

Oh, Christ. The Kettlemans?

532
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:58,845
You lose any<i> other</i> clients today?

533
00:23:59,137 --> 00:23:59,861
[Chuckling] Yeah.

534
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,307
Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo Bananas

535
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,836
just offered me the plum
job of defending them.

536
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,204
They came to you?

537
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:06,452
Yeah, I know.

538
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:08,012
I don't know what you did to piss them off,

539
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,211
but it must have been good.

540
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:10,724
W... what did they tell you?

541
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,935
Not much, just, uh,

542
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:16,114
- that you treated them like they were guilty.
- [Chuckles]

Jesus.

544
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:18,836
Look, Jimmy...

545
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:20,993
I know...

546
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:23,444
[Inhales deeply] I know
this is a lot to ask,

547
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,958
but you have to convince
them to come back to HHM.

548
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:27,610
- I do, huh?
- Yes.

549
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:29,697
- [Urinal flushes]
- Please. It's important.

550
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:31,588
What's it worth to you?

551
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:32,868
Jimmy, I'm serious.

552
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:34,529
They left because they
think they can win this case,

553
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:35,560
but they can't.

554
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:37,570
I managed to scrape together...

555
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,634
from practically nothing, I might add...

556
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,197
a deal they should feel lucky to have.

557
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,971
This is their absolute best bet.

558
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:45,730
Please...

559
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,299
Make them understand it's better
for them if they come back.

560
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,369
Tell me about this deal.

561
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:54,690
Elder law?

562
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:57,377
- I don't know what that is.
- Yeah, me neither.

563
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:01,229
Elder. Do you think...

564
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,665
- Maybe if we were old...
- Sorry. Whoo! Oh.

565
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:07,187
- [Chuckles]
- The mysteries of the bladder. Right?

566
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,485
- [Chuckles]
- So, how do we get started?

567
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,821
Do you need us to sign that little paper?

568
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:13,136
I am...

569
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:16,454
I am very sorry, but I'm
afraid I can't take your case.

570
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:19,747
My schedule is just... it's
just chock-full right now.

571
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:23,089
I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.

572
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,496
I'm certain they would
welcome you with open arms.

573
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,583
No, we're not going
back there. They were...

574
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:31,409
- incompatible.
- I understand.

575
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:33,269
They asked you to face
some harsh realities,

576
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:34,425
and I get it...

577
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:36,257
no one likes that. But

578
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:37,953
bottom line here...

579
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:39,947
Kim Wexler is a fine attorney.

580
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,376
She has a great relationship with the D.A.

581
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,881
Much as I'd love to sing my own praises,

582
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,701
I doubt I could get you a deal

583
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:48,663
as good as the one she already has.

584
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:51,478
Okay, we don't want a deal.

585
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:55,387
We want you, our lawyer,
to exonerate Craig.

586
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:56,248
"Exonerate"?

587
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:58,046
That is, uh... that is a big word,

588
00:25:58,061 --> 00:26:00,955
- particularly in your case.
- Yeah, there will be no deal.

589
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,862
There is no money with which
to make a deal. [Chuckles]

590
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:09,805
We... can we all three just

591
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:12,785
parachute down from cloud cuckoo land?

592
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:16,265
'Cause we know, without
question, there<i> is</i> money.

593
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,620
- No, there...
- I distinctly remember a spirited game

594
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,659
of tug-of-war <i>over</i> this money,

595
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:22,679
money which we then discussed at length.

596
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:24,433
You made many excuses

597
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,395
justifying your possession of said money.

598
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:27,358
It's there.

599
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:29,467
- It exists. S-shh. Now, just... 
-  [Stammers]

600
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:31,663
please, for my own sanity...

601
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:34,386
[Clears throat] You can't
hide a big bag of cash forever,

602
00:26:34,396 --> 00:26:37,129
and you certainly will never
be able to spend any of it.

603
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:41,350
So, go back to HHM,
apologize to Ms. Wexler,

604
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,280
and for Christ's sakes, take the deal.

605
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:49,670
- If there were any money...
- Lady, enough!

606
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,173
<i>If</i> there were any money,

607
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,434
there would have to be
a full accounting of it.

608
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:58,283
Every penny would have to be present...

609
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:02,369
every single penny.

610
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,388
You understand?

611
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,877
All of it.

612
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:10,556
- That includes the $30,000 that you...
- Craig, yes, he gets it.

613
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:11,809
Okay. Yeah, he gets it.

614
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:15,312
We're in this together, Mr. McGill...

615
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:16,938
Come what may.

616
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:19,853
Now [Breathes deeply]

617
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:22,161
where do we begin?

618

[Telephones ringing]

619

[Indistinct conversations]

There you go. Kettleman that's all of it.

621
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:48,617
Where's Kim?

622
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:50,883
We moved her over to the east wing.

623
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,664
The east wing? That's the cornfield.

624
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:56,183
Why are you sending her
to the cornfield, Howard?

625
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:57,639
Never heard it called<i> that</i> before.

626
00:27:57,823 --> 00:27:59,580
[Chuckling] Well, that's what you call it.

627
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:01,546
You gonna punish her

628
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:03,687
just 'cause you lost those
two batshit Kettlemans?

629
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,385
You notice I'm not exactly crowing over

630
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:07,230
- how I snaked them away from you.
- Jimmy,

631
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,542
here are your files.

632
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,209
I'm not gonna discuss my
employee policies with you.

633
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:14,228
[Sighs] I'm gonna need some help here.

634
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:15,774
Yeah...

635
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,107
You sure are.

636
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:23,441
[Grunting]

[Breathing heavily]

638
00:28:55,773 --> 00:28:57,480
That prick firing you?

639
00:28:57,822 --> 00:29:00,165
Best-case scenario is my 2-year plan

640
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:01,652
just became a 10-year plan.

641
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:03,438
That schmuck.

642
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,940
You didn't do anything wrong.

643
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,609
- I lost the client.
- Not your fault.

644
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:10,406
They're not really playing with
a full deck those Kettlemans.

645
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:13,000
You had to take their case?

646
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,161
I'm sorry, okay? I tried.
I r... I really did.

647

I doubt you'll be able to do more
for them than we were offering.

You think very highly
of my skills, obviously.

It's not that, Jimmy. It's a loser case.

654
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,930
That deal was their best chance.

655

- You'll lose.

job covering his tracks.

And I can't even challenge
their admission into evidence

663
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,762
because he wrote them to himself.

666
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:06,756
he's guilty as sin.

667
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:08,616
Yeah, but there has to be something...

668
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,136
- some loophole or...
- None that I could find.
