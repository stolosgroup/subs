and his dream was to be his own boss...

817
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:41,836
put everything he had into that place.

818
00:39:41,871 --> 00:39:46,207
I was away at college when
he put Jimmy to work there.

819
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:50,278
Jimmy grew up in that
store, watching our father.

820
00:39:52,882 --> 00:39:56,017
But Dad was not the world's
greatest businessman,

821
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:58,853
and eventually, he ran
into money troubles.

822
00:39:58,888 --> 00:40:01,256
I, um, had a clerkship at the time,

823
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,658
but I came home to help him
get his books in order,

set the ship straight.

825
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:07,862
Now, I'm no accountant,

826
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:13,168
but I discovered $14,000 was just gone,

827
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,805
vanished over the years.

828
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:22,377
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered
it in dribs and drabs...

829
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:24,546
just took it out of the till.

830
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,919
My dad wouldn't hear it.

831
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:34,122
Nope. Not his Jimmy.

832
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:39,928
He ended up having to sell.

833
00:40:39,962 --> 00:40:42,764
Six months later, he was dead.

834
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:48,937
At the funeral, no one
cried harder than Jimmy.

835

My brother is not a bad person.

He has a good heart.

837
00:41:01,817 --> 00:41:04,152
It's just...

838
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:07,922
...he can't help himself.

839
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:12,761
And everyone's left
picking up the pieces.

840
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,500
Is there any coffee left?

841

Sorry. I know you?

The young man who did that to you.
