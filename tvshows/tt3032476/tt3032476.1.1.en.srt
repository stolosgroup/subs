Yeah, you do. [Clears throat]

156
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:43,981
But if you're being honest...
I mean, well, really honest,

157
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:45,816
you'll recall that you also had

158
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:48,485
an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain.

159
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:52,906
Me, personally, I... It...
If I were held accountable

160
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:55,326
for some of the stupid decisions I made

161
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:58,746
when I was 19... [chuckling] Oh, boy, wow.

162
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:03,167
And I bet if we were in church
right now, I'd get a big "amen!"

163
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:05,369
Which brings us to these three...

164
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:09,373
Now, these three knuckleheads...

165
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,375
And I'm sorry, boys,
but that's what you are...

166

They did a dumb thing.
We're not denying that.

167
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,798
However, I would like you
to remember two salient facts.

168
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,635
Fact one... Nobody got hurt, not a soul.

169
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:23,604
Very important to keep that in mind.

170
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,807
Fact two... Now, the prosecution

171
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:30,644
keeps bandying this term
"criminal trespass."

172
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:33,063
Mr. Spinowzo, the property owner,

173
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,700
admitted to us that he keeps
most portions of his business

174

open to the public both day and night.

175

So, trespassing? [Clicks tongue]

176

Don't you think, Dave?

[Chuckles, inhales sharply]
Here's what I know...

178
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:53,834
These three young men,
near honors students all,

179
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:55,836
were feeling their oats one Saturday night,

180
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:59,473
and they just... Went a little bananas.

181

[Chuckles] I don't know.

182
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:04,094
Call me crazy, but I
don't think they deserve

183
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,513
to have their bright futures ruined

00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:17,020
Brenda, looking good. Nice do.

471
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:19,022
Uh, where's Lord Vader?

472
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:20,857
Uh, he's not quite ready for you yet.

473
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:22,692
South conference room.

474
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:24,110
How about you wait out here?

475
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,946
How about I don't? [Scoffs]

476
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:29,782
- Oh, Sir Francis.
- James.

477
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:31,417
Well-groomed, as always.

478
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:33,620
- Okay.
- All right.

482

You have meddled with the primal
forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin,

483
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,192
and I won't have it!

484
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:57,610
Brenda: Do you want me to call security?

485
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,228
It's okay, Brenda, we got it.

[Button clicks]

487
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:03,066
Hey, Jack. Hey, Nate. Hey, Aaron.

488
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,034
What can we do for you, Jimmy?

489
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,870
I'm sorry. It's... It's this table.

490
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,740
Something just comes over me.

491
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:19,499
You can tell me what this, uh, $26,000

492
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:21,918
is supposed to be for.

493
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,837
That's money for Chuck.
Isn't that what you wanted?

494
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,057
A measly 26 grand? [Scoffs]

495
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,059
Jesus, you're like Peter
Minuit with the Indians.

496
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,061
Throw in some beads and shells
while you're at it.

497
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,731
It's just a start. There'll be more...

498
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:35,380
Unless you're gonna just tear them all up.

499
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:38,383
And why was it made out to me...
Why not Chuck?

500
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,851
Can he make his way to the bank?

501
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:42,687
[Inhales sharply]

502
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,667
I just assumed it was best

503
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,302
to have the money go through you.

504
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,721
We can do it any way you want.

505
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,141
This isn't going away, Howard.

506
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,144
What Chuck did for this firm...
And damn near single-handedly...

507
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,347
1/3 of this place belongs to him.

508
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,766
Yeah. What do you got... 12 chairs here?

509
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,185
Four of these chairs are Chuck's.

510
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:04,821
You got five of these light thingumajigs?

511
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:09,025
Uh, mm, 1 2/3 are Chuck's.

512
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:12,028
Yeah. Six... How many
danishes... Six danishes?

513
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,863
You can have all the Danish
you want, Jimmy. No, no.

514
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:16,282
They're Chuck's danishes,
and Chuck isn't greedy,

515
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,034
so h-he'll just take two...

516
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:21,871
Plus $17 million... In that ballpark.

517
00:26:21,923 --> 00:26:23,506
I mean, we'll know

518
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,925
once we get the accountants
poking around here.

519
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,761
Until then, no more penny-ante checks

520
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,763
designed to make it look like
Chuck still works here.

521
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,966
He doesn't. He never will again.

522
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,969
It's time to do right by him
and cash him out.

523
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,272
So, these are Chuck's own wishes
that you're conveying?

524
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,774
- This is what's best for him.
- Mm.

525
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,060
So he personally told you
that it's his wish

526
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:45,612
to withdraw from the firm?

527

[Scoffs]

528
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,950
See, that would surprise me.

529
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,702
It's been nearly a year
since he's set foot in here.

530
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,579
I'm just doing what's in his

531
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:56,289
- best interests.
- So am I.

532
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:59,909
And I, for one, believe
he's gonna lick this thing.

533
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:02,328
Until then, his office
is just as he left it.

534
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,963
His secretary's still on payroll.

535
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,382
If Chuck can call this
an extended sabbatical,

536
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,334
then so can we...
He's that important to us.

537
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:12,255
You know what?
Let's let a jury figure it out.

538
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:15,808
[Sighs] Yeah, they're
gonna love you, Howard.

539
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,094
You're so down-to-earth and relatable.

540
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:24,684
And you... Will... Atone!

541

Chuck doesn't work here anymore.

You think I'm gonna help you
establish a paper trail?

- Now, Jimmy...
- No, stop trying

to pawn that shit off on him.

You know, Jimmy, sometimes,
in our line of work,

555
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:07,560
you can get so... Caught
up in the idea of winning

631
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,769
there's nothing more to talk about.

632
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,221
I will beat this.

633
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:05,059
Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci.

634
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:06,944
- Meaning?
- That's not...

635
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:07,961
- Meaning?
- That's the one about

636
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:09,146
false principles, but it's not...

637
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,148
You proceed from false principles.

638
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,983
Your argument is built on quicksand.

639
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:15,870
- Therefore, it collapses.
- Yeah, yeah. You're not listening.

640
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,872
[Sighs] Fine.

641
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:20,491
Let's take this to its logical conclusion.

642
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,126
[Sighs]

643
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:23,961
In order to pay out my share,

644
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,914
suppose my partners are forced
to liquidate the firm.

645
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:28,883
- Then what?
- That's their problem.

646
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,751
My clients are out in the cold.

647
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,920
My cases are scattered to the winds.

648
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:35,556
126 people lose their jobs.

649
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:39,260
What happens to your cronies
in the mailroom, the assistants,

650
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:40,678
the paralegals, the janitorial staff?

651
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,346
All of them, out on the street.

652
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:44,481
Your friend Kim... a promising
career... over and done with.

653
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,483
Hamlin owes you everything.

654
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,185
You built that place single-handedly

655
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,821
while he was out at four hills
working on his bunker shot.

656
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,440
Let's not exaggerate. I helped. You helped.

657
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:54,858
- [Scoffs]
- [Scoffs]

658
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,610
All the more reason not to tear it down

659
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,078
just for a little bit of cash.

660
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:01,699
Look... Chuck, I'm going under, okay?

661
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:05,336
For the third time with these
bull-crap contract counsel...

662
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,388
- "Bull crap"?
- Bull-crap, pissant P.D.

663
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:08,980
Cases at 700 bucks a shot.

664
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:12,593
Public-defender work is some of the
best experience there is.

665
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:16,013
I just had a case, Chuck,
with three clients...

666
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:18,432
Uh, arraignments, voir dire, jury trial...

667
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:19,850
The whole nine yards.

668
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:22,469
You know what I took home? 700 bucks.

669
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,472
Yeah, I might as well head down
to skid row and sell plasma.

670
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,808
You're representing people
who have nowhere else to turn.

671
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,643
The money is beside the point.

672
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:32,646
Money is not<i> beside</i> the point...
Money <i>is</i> the point.

673
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:35,065
I keep telling you... Have patience.

674
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,317
There are no shortcuts.

675
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,735
Do good work, and the clients will come.

676
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:39,737
The clients will come. Yeah, I know.

677
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:41,739
Okay.

678
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:47,211
Hand to God, I wasn't gonna
say this, but you are broke.

679
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,830
I can't carry both of us.

680
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:53,834
I've been trying like hell, but I can't.

681
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:56,837
[Chuckling] Well, you're saying what?

682
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,472
You think you have to provide for me?

683
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:00,674
I never asked you that.
You didn't have to ask, okay?

684
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,093
I've been doing my damnedest,

685
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:04,928
but the day of reckoning is here.

686
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,348
Soon, Chuck, you're gonna be
out on the street

687
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,769
with all the electromagnetism in
the world raining down on you.

688
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:13,771
Now, please, please, picture that,

689
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:16,106
then tell me
that money is beside the point.

690
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,075
This is what has you all worked up?

691
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,493
Yeah!

692
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:23,113
Jimmy... There's nothing to worry about.

693
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:26,116
- Here.
- What is this?

694
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:28,335
A stipend...
There's gonna be one every week.

695
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:31,538
$857 from Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill?

696
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,874
I'm gonna pay them back... Every penny.

697
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:36,510
I didn't want to take anything,
but Howard was very insistent.

698
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:38,679
And I'm gonna pay <i>you</i> back, too.

699
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:40,681
Wait, Hamlin was here?

700
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:43,100
It's not like I'm a recluse.

701
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:45,102
What? He put his cellphone in the mailbox?

702
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:46,520
He understands the situation.

703
00:36:46,555 --> 00:36:48,522
- He grounded himself?
- Of course.

704
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:51,141
And the two of you agreed
that since, as everybody knows,

705
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:52,976
you're going back to work any day now,

706
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,479
that the firm should help you
make ends meet.

707
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:57,781
That's correct, minus the sarcasm.

708
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:59,450
Hamlin's making you a chump!

709
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,869
I'm going to get better!

710
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:03,203
I'm gonna go back to work,

711
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,907
and I'm picking up where I left off!

712
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,542
[Sighs]

713
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:10,744
[Chuckles, sighs]

714
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:12,796
[Clock ticking]

715
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,515
Sorry.

716
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:34,351
Sorry, Chuck.

717
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,939
[Inhales deeply]

718
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:42,576
I understand that you're
trying to look out for me,

719
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:45,079
but you're missing the bigger picture.

720
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:47,698
I got it.

721
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,501
[Sighs] Speaking of which...

722
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:54,338
Howard brought this.

723
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,256
He's concerned.

724
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:57,591
What?

725
00:37:57,626 --> 00:37:59,460
You have to admit...
It could be confusing...

726
00:37:59,512 --> 00:38:01,095
Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill?

727
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,297
- James M. Mcgill?
- That's my name.

728
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:06,383
- I was born with it. I...
- Still...

729
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:12,973
How about Vanguard law?

730
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,776
Or gi... Gibraltar legal... Wait, wait.

731
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:19,980
So I'm not supposed to use
my name o... On Hamlin's say-so?

732
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,399
What's he gonna do... Sue me?

733
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:25,068
Nobody wants to create
an adversarial situation.

734
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,287
I'm sure Howard would gladly pay the cost

735
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:29,289
of new matchbooks and so on.

736
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:30,657
[Sighs]

737
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:34,661
It's simply a matter
of professional courtesy.

[Ticking continues]

739
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,167
Chuck, whose side are you on?

740
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:44,171
There are no sides.

741
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:48,809
But, Jimmy... [sighs]

742
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:51,929
Wouldn't you rather
build your own identity?

743
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:55,182
Why ride on someone else's coattails?

744
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,823

[Insects chirping]

00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,697
You want to dance, Howard?

747
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:15,202
[Chuckles] Let's dance.

748
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,810
Go!

749
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,287
No, you can get closer
than that, you bitch.

750
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,120
Come on.

751
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,038
And here it comes.

752
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:39,875
There you go. Better.

753
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,495
- [Cheering in distance]
- How was that?

754
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,130
It's right on here. Take a look.

755
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:45,965
Still, tighter is everything.

756
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,967
Tighter? What? T... Tighter what?

757
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:50,169
I don't know. Just stand... Tighter.

758
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,471
You know what I mean? I
don't know what you mean.

759
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:55,091
That sucked. We can call that
a stylistic choice, I guess,

760
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,726
- if you want to...
- Hey, fellas.

761
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,977
We got business.

762
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,263
How did you find us?

763
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,418
I know... Eerie, right.

764
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:09,405
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.
Give me 30 seconds.

765
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,943
Could be the most profitable
30 seconds of your lives.

766
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,196
[Indistinct conversations]

767
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:26,205
Let me tell you about a young guy...

768
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:29,425
Actually, he's about your age.

769
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,044
He lived a long way from here

770
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:36,682
in a town called Cicero, Illinois.

771
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:40,302
And in Cicero, he was the man.

772
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,304
I mean, when he strolled down the street,

773
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,941
all the corner boys
would give him the high five.

774
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:49,562
All the finest babes would smile at him

775
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:53,399
and hope that he would smile back.

776
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:57,403
They called him "slippin' Jimmy,"

777
00:40:57,405 --> 00:41:02,241
and everybody wanted to be his friend.

778
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:04,460
"Slippin' Jimmy"?

779
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,463
What the hell kind of name
is [chuckling] that?

780
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:08,998
Well, I'll tell you, now...

781
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,834
Winters in Cicero are murder. [Chuckles]

782
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,470
You guys growing up
out here in the golden west...

783
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,305
Y... You don't know, okay?

784
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,159
I'm talking cold that'll freeze
the snot right in your nose.

785
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,977
I'm talking wind
that'll cut through your jacket

786
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,180
and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.

787
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,600
In fact, most folks in Cicero
were scared of winter,

788
00:41:27,602 --> 00:41:30,436
but not Jimmy.

789
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:32,354
Jimmy waited around all summer,

and when September finally rolled around

791
00:41:34,776 --> 00:41:36,776
and he'd feel that first cold wind

792
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:41,347
come sweeping off lake Michigan,
he knew<i> it</i> was coming.

793
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:44,166
Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa?

794
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:48,587
Better... It was slip 'n fall season.

795
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:50,423
Soon as it was cold enough,

796
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:53,592
he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice.

797
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:56,429
State street was good.
Michigan Avenue was better.

798
00:41:56,464 --> 00:41:59,265
He'd pick his spot,
wait for it to get busy,

799
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,184
then he'd walk out on the ice, and... Boom!

800
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
He would biff it so hard,

801
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,440
people would come running
from five blocks away.

802
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:09,809
- Yeah, but did he collect?
- "Did he collect?"

803
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:12,027
Slippin' Jimmy had it dialed in, all right?

804
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:15,448
One good fall... He'd clear 6, 8 grand.

805
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:16,866
That'd keep him in old Milwaukee

806
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,984
and Maui Wowie right through labor day.

807
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,619
8 grand?

808
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:22,154
8 grand.

809
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:24,790
Now, see, I look at you guys,
I see potential.

810
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:26,208
The skateboard's a nice wrinkle...

811
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:28,043
That makes it a year-round gig.

812
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,298
And clearly, you know
how to take a header, right?

813
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,500
But I got to ask you... Your best day ever,

814
00:42:34,502 --> 00:42:36,502
how much did you clear?

815
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,307
$630. $630.

816
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:44,727
[Scoffs] 630 bucks.

817
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,428
Was that for one fall?

818
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,648
Two. Two falls in one day. [Chuckles]

819
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:51,650
Even at your age, that's got to hurt.

820
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:53,486
True that.

821
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:56,689
All right, well, I got a job for you.

822
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:58,757
How's 2 grand sound?

823
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:00,960
2 grand for one hit?

824
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,162
One hit.

825
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:06,265
Plus, you get to learn from the best.

826
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,667
Nice boat.

827
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:11,871
Yeah, discreet, like
a stripper pole in a mosque.

828
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:14,290
Yeah, forget the boat. Look at the car.

829
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,875
You know what that is?

830
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:17,376
I don't know. A station wagon?

831
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:21,113
It's a Mercury, a 1988 Mercury sable wagon.

832
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:23,716
Remember it. Burn it
into your brains. You got it?

833
00:43:23,718 --> 00:43:26,218
It's a Mercury sable wagon, sure.

834
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,521
Jimmy: Close your eyes. What color is it?

835
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:30,139
- Brown.
- Brown.

836
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,359
No, it's medium sandalwood.
Keep your eyes closed.

837
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:35,194
How does the license plate start?

838
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:36,362
- 4.
- 4.

839
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:38,814
Give those gentlemen a gold star.

840
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,033
Betsy Kettleman's her name.

841
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:44,036
Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50,

842
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:46,238
she comes through here
on her way to pick up her kids

843
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
at Kit Carson Elementary.

844
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:50,075
Now, you need a place
where she's gonna slow down...

845
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:51,627
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

846
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,480
All right. Well, there you go.
She slows down.

847
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:58,467
She hangs a right.
You come shooting out of there.

848
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,303
You do what you did to me.
You go ass over teakettle.

849
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:02,922
You make it a blue-ribbon special.

850
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:04,306
When she gets out of the car,

851
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,508
you're sufferin' St. Sebastian, right?

852
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,928
You're the hammer, okay?
You get in her face.

853
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,563
You scare the bejesus out of her.

854
00:44:10,598 --> 00:44:13,399
Give me your phone. [Sniffs]

855
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:15,017
It's kind of busy here, don't you think?

856
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,503
- [Beeping]
- Well, witnesses are good.

857
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:19,104
[Indistinct conversation]
Witnesses are pressure, all right?

858
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,941
Now, once you've got her good and rattled,

859
00:44:21,943 --> 00:44:23,576
then you call for an ambulance,

860
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:25,527
but really, you're calling for me.

861
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,745
I'm number one on your speed dial,

862
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:28,581
right next to your weed dealer.

863
00:44:28,616 --> 00:44:30,416
You call me. I hotfoot it over here.

864
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:32,618
I just "happen" to be driving by.

865
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,453
I stop to see what the trouble is,

866
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:37,289
and this is the most important
part... You don't know me.

867
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,124
We've never met. You got it?

868
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:40,960
- Sure.
- Okay.

869
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:43,963
Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight.
We go mano a mano.

870
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:47,800
You light into me, okay?
Get nasty. And no touching.

871
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:49,134
Leave the hair alone.

872
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:51,770
But otherwise, you know, open season.

873
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:54,306
Yell. Stomp. Call me a douche bag.

874
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:55,608
I'm gonna play it cool,

875
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:57,359
give you back some of the razzmatazz.

876
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,978
And once she's seen the fireworks,

877
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,396
you fold like a lawn chair...

878
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,031
Happy ending.

879
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,450
When do we get our money?

880
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:05,985
After.

881
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:08,404
After. After.

882
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,872
You get paid when I get paid.

883
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,074
I'm the rising tide
that raises all dinghies.

884
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,909
Now, pop quiz... What's the car?

885
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,545
- Mercury sable wagon.
- Baby-poop brown.

886
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,631
- Okay. Do you know me?
- No. No.

887
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:22,251
Damn straight. Go with God.

888
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:31,067
Jimmy: Well, I'm just glad
I happened to be passing by.

889
00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:34,333
Happy to be of help, Betsy.
May I call you "Betsy"?

890
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,752
[Clears throat] Please, call me "James."

891
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:39,972
Hmm. Oh, the kid will be fine. Don't worry.

892
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:41,390
He just got his bell rung a little.

893
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:45,177
I'll... I'll handle that. Oh, no.

894
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,762
Oh, no, no.

895
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:49,348
I wouldn't think of, uh,
taking your money for this.

896
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,767
- The embezzlement case?
- [Engine turns over]

897
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:55,187
Mm, yes, I'd...
I'd be happy to talk it over.

898
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:58,824
[Chuckles] Oh, shit.

899
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,696
[Sighs]

900
00:46:04,698 --> 00:46:07,916
[Dialing]

901
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:10,335
Two-minute warning. Two-minute warning.

902
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:12,004
Got it.

903
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:53,378
[Breathing heavily]

904
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:13,765
[Tires screech]

905
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:15,233
[Woman screams]

906
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:17,269
Oh, my God!

907
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:18,520
Man: What happened?

908
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:20,522
- [Crowd murmuring]
- Woman: Call 911.

909
00:47:20,574 --> 00:47:23,742
Oh, my God! Cal! Cal!

910
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:24,293
Look at me! Are you okay?!

911
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:27,412
Buddy, say something. Cal, what are you...

912
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:28,464
[Groans] Come on already.

913
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:29,545
- What is she doing in there?
- I don't know. Shh.

914
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,130
Is she making a sandwich?

915
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:33,582
Where's her sense of responsibility?

916
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,050
- [Tires squeal]
- What?

917
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:38,470
- What?!
- Hey! What the f...

918
00:47:38,506 --> 00:47:39,972
Funny to run into you, Betsy.

919
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:42,808
I was just, uh, strolling the neighborhood.

920
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:45,811
You... You were in accident.

921
00:47:45,846 --> 00:47:49,598
Oh, it's... [sighing]

922
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,605
Come on.

923
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,274
[Breathes deeply]

924
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,247
[Cellphone rings]

925
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,665
- [Beep]
- Yeah?

926
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:08,867
- Lars: She took off on us.
- She what?

927
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,336
It was textbook, man.

928
00:48:10,371 --> 00:48:12,538
We were diamonds,
but then she just took off.

929
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,540
Okay, wait. She... She hit-and-run?

930
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,959
That's what I'm saying.
She bailed and wailed.

931
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,795
O... okay. Just stay where you are.
I'll come get you.

932
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:21,263
No, no, no. Screw that, man.
[Engine sputters]

933
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:22,715
We're following her.

934
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,133
You're... How are...
You're following her how?

935
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,934
We got our ways, yo.

936
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,221
Okay, okay, okay, new plan...
New plan. You<i> do</i> know me.

937
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,857
I'm<i> your</i> lawyer. You got that?
I'll meet you at the school.

938
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:33,692
- No, she's way past the school.
- [Engine grinding]

939
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:35,394
She hooked a left on Juan tabo,

940
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,229
and she's coming into holiday park.

941
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,114
Okay, stay with her.

942
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,949
When she gets where she's going,
wherever that is,

943
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,151
just don't do anything.

944
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:43,402
- Wait for me.
- Wait for what?

945
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:45,037
You haven't been right even once!

946
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,405
Slippin' Jimmy, my ass!

947
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,240
You fell into the honeypot, kid.
