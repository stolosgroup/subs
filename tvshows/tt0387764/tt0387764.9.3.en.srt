MARK: <i>Hmm.</i>

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,246
<i>Once upon a time, I might have woken
to the sound of a song thrush.</i>

7
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:29,095
<i>Now it's a couple of guys pounding
the living daylights out of each other.</i>

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,554
<i>I mean, it's fine.</i>

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,831
<i>It's just...When Jeremy had sex
with women, I hated the noise,</i>

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,871
<i>but at least there was</i> something <i>in it
for me.</i>

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,197
<i>Now it's like there are two Jeremy's
in there humping each other.</i>

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,470
<i>- That would be his dream.
-</i> JEZ: Fuck!

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,480
So, just to be clear, for my records,

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,752
you're sleeping with Joe regularly now.

15
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,432
- Can't handle it.
- I can handle it, I'm fine with it.

16
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,754
Just, what, you've gone gay?

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,137
- Your word, not mine.
- Sure, but...

18
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:56,991
let's say you had a Wikipedia page,

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,158
which obviously you don't, regardless of
how many times you try and put one up.

20
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:04,306
Would it say that Jeremy Usborne
was gay or straight?

21
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,190
I don't fit in to your tiny little boxes.

22
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:08,753
I'm just looking for that sacred
connection, and for that,

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,599
I'd fuck any single member
of the human race.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,432
Yes. Yes, I believe that. You know I've always
been a bit gay. I've always liked a bit of that.

25
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,793
Like with Pej in Darty.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,989
You and Pej?

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,202
We used to get pissed
and pull each other off. Didn't you?

28
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:21,417
You should've. It was great.

29
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,391
I have a long and varied list of regrets,

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,070
Jeremy, but not being pulled off by Pej
isn't one of them.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,793
The thing about sex with a guy,

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,514
it's like getting your car fixed
at the actual dealership.

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,063
They've got all the codes.
You just plug right in.

34
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:35,732
I mean, you like blowjobs,
don't you, Mark?

35
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:37,432
I'm eating a Fruit Corner, Jeremy.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,879
Of course you do. But...

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,673
what's the most blowjobs
you've ever had in one day?

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,030
Like in the first happy days
of a relationship?

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,117
- One.
- Right.

40
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,358
Well, my life now
is a 24/7 blow-job bonanza.

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,869
I very much regret
starting this conversation.

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,910
Put it this way.

43
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:57,045
I'm moving out and I've got a new address
for you to forward my post to -

44
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,345
Blow-job City.

45
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,076
Jez, I've got to make a move.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,090
Cool. Um, here's that Beastie Boys CD
I was telling you about.

47
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:06,076
Thanks, but I don't own a CD player.

48
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:08,593
Oh. Yeah.
Well, download the shit out of them.

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,000
- They're cool.
- Yeah?

50
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,844
I think they started before I was born,
and one of them is dead.

51
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,392
- Listen, gotta go.
- (KISSES)

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,555
- See you.
- Bye.

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,796
MARK: The gay <i>couple.
1</i> five with a gay <i>couple.</i>

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,797
<i>It's political correctness gone normal.</i>

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,990
I really like him, Mark.
Do you think it matters

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,671
if I'm not young, dumb and full of cum?

57
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,158
Oh, no. I mean...

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,157
you're older and...

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,555
- intelligent and full of cum.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,511
Except I'm not that intelligent,

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,155
because I don't really understand
almost any of what the news is about,

62
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,918
and I'm not even certain that

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,359
- I'm full of cum.
- Oh, I'm sure...

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,232
<i>How did I get here?!</i>

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,999
I'm sure you're full of cum.

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,228
That's nice. Thank you.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,516
- So, thank you...
- The one <i>that</i> got away.

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,709
<i>Lovely April.</i>

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,196
<i>But you can't get away from Google, April.
Corrigan and Google -</i>

70
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,595

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,555
Yup, she's just as beautiful as she was
when I failed to sleep with her in Darty.

72
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,384
<i>And she knows a fuckload
about the Ottoman Empire.</i>

73
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,393
<i>If she voices the audiobook,</i>

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,353
<i>then it's, "Look out, St Basil!" because
I'm going to buy a box of wet wipes</i>

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,242
<i>and have me a wanky Byzantine party.</i>

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,951
Um, things haven't been great
between me and Joe lately.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,513
JEZ: Yeah, <i>that will happen when</i> he's <i>busy</i>

78
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,996
<i>- sucking</i> off <i>your life coach.
-</i> Maybe we should have a big chat.

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,635
And I should just say, like,
"Are you ready to commit? Because I am."

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,875
What do you think?

81
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,797
- No.
- Oh.

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,592
- Right. Why not?
- The point is,

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,393
you do your thing, yeah,
and let him do his thing.

84
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,273
And don't talk about upsetting shit.

85
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,469
That's the key to happiness.

86
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,638
- That's not what I expected you to say.
- I'm a straight-shooter.

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,751
<i>And I'm fucking your boyfriend.</i>
Time's <i>up,</i> I think.

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,029
Oh, right.

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,673
I'm going to call him.

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,631
<i>No, don't call him!</i>

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,909
Fuck it, I'm going to lock him out.

92
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,155
<i>Yeah! Lock him out!</i>

93
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,634
Do you want to, um...

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,755
...stay for a glass of wine?

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,473
Er... She's sexy,

96
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,717
<i>artistic, confused. It'd be rude not to!</i>

97
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,958
<i>We studied Ancient History at Dartmouth -</i>

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,311

Ha-ha-ha!</i>

99
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,680
<i>No.</i>

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,030
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

101
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,230
Hi. I love the Ottoman Empire.

102
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,717
I think I feel an affinity because
some ingeniously savage children

103
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,673
at my secondary school
called me "the sick man of Europe".

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,472
<i>Sorry. TMI.</i>

105
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,114
No! I was actually ostracised by

106
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,118
some horrible girls
who called me Joan of Snark.

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,390
<i>Two peas in a fucking pod.</i>

108
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,512
- Er, who should I sign it to?
- Mark. Mark Corrigan.

109
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,930
- OK
<i>- Does she recognise me?</i>

110
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:37,393
<i>I should say something.</i>

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,839
<i>Could come clean.</i>

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,952
”You <i>sold me</i> some <i>brogues
and I followed you 200 miles</i>

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,230
”and <i>faked being a mature student
to see you.</i> ”

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,679
There you go. Thanks again for coming.

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,075
<i>My</i> pleasure. <i>This is my chance.</i>

116
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,679
<i>And I'm doing nothing.</i>

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,757
<i>I am now, this instant,</i>

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,360
<i>missing</i> my <i>chance.</i>
Sorry to flout the queueing system

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,118
like some syphilitic sultan,

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,312
but I just wanted to say that
we did actually meet once before.

121
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,271
Years ago, at Dartmouth Uni.

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,880
I thought I remembered you!
But I wasn't sure...

123
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,753
I transferred from Coventry,
then I transferred back again.

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,634
It was complicated. I think Bez
won Big <i>Brother</i> around then.

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,910
Kilroy started Veritas. Crazy times.

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,716
I'm rambling. But how would you like
to have a glass of wine?

127
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,391
I have to say, this is the first time
I've ever betrayed the ethics

128
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,431
of my life-coaching organisation.

129
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,914
Well, it was outside

130
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,554
- our coaching window.
- Yeah. I mean...

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,433
I bet it's fine if football coaches
have sex with their players, so long as

132
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,269
- it's outside the coaching window.
- Listen, Joe'II be back soon, so...

133
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,994
- you should probably go.
- Oh, I'd <i>love</i> to <i>hang</i> out <i>with</i> Joe,

134
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,236
<i>but maybe tonight isn't the best night.</i>

135
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,318
I'm going to have to book a double session
just to talk this shit through!

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,159
<i>I'm creating my own work!
I'm living off my own</i> mess.

137
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,840
<i>Like when they fed all the cows
to the other cows in the 90s</i>

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,951
<i>and we got... what was it? Super-burgers?</i>

139
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,989
My day job's lecturing
at South Thames College.

140
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,077
So this is your secret identity.

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,191
- Sort of like Indiana Jones.
- Yes.

142
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,278
I'm very much like Indiana Jones.
Except I don't have a whip.

143
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,277
And I ain't afraid of no snakes!

144
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,190
<i>An Indiana Jones reference mixed with
a Ghostbusters reference! I love you,</i>

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,230
<i>April Danecroft.</i>

146
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,999
I couldn't help noticing
that your book's co-written.

147
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,474
<i>» That's my husband.
- Shit!</i>

148
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,840
I still use my maiden name for books.

149
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,518
<i>Of course. Of course she's married.</i>

150
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,631
You write together? That sounds like a...

151

did anything happen between us

Tomorrow. It's a date.

- with Joe?
- Whatever.

183
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,480
It'll start with half an hour of adverts

like it's perfectly natural.
No-one makes hummus.

- It's only hummus, Jeremy.
- What are you going to do next?

- I have made my own pasta.
- Jesus, Mark.

The girl from the shoe shop?

You finally tracked her down
and you're luring her back to your Iair

It isn't a lair, it's my flat!

And my sole subterfuge

198

is that she thinks
she's coming to a dinner party.

199

But I've got a feeling that the other
guests may cancel at the last minute.

She just texted, saying,
"Professor Jones has her whip ready."

206
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,716

More than hilarious. It would be a hoot!

It would be a bit of a hoot, wouldn't it?

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,549
Right, we're getting somewhere.

305
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,159
Cooking's all about confidence.

306
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,910
I'm just going to mix it all together.

307
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,157
I need to go Nigella.
I'm going to be the Hairy Biker.

308

JEZ: <i>That's not Nigella.
That's not even Ainsley, mate.</i>

00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:42,190
How about some lovely filling lettuce?

310
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,917
- What are you doing?!
- I'm improvising.

311

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,714
Are they? Yeah?

316
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,118
You know what? Maybe it's fine.
Is it... Moroccan?

317
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,275
Maybe it is Moroccan.

318
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,709
JEZ: Yeah, <i>Morocco.
Anything goes in Morocco.</i>

319
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,878
Right, OK! I like it that way.
They can't prove otherwise.

- Fuck them.
- Exactly.

- Listen, Mark.

323
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,758
The pasta will be fine. It'll all be fine.

324
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,199

- Absolutely.

getting rid of the love message

- Not... exactly.

330
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,031
Jeremy, did you use permanent marker?

331
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,559
I might have used permanent marker.

332
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,671
I'm going to have to bleach my eyes.

333
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,438
Good idea. Although...

334
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,074
eyes, bleach - is that a bad one?

335
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,715
I'm going to have to keep my eyes open
all night. Is that possible?

always brings wine, don't they?

344
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,270
Oh... Lovely.

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,497
<i>That'll be one bottle of wine
between six, then. Perfect!</i>

346
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:04,840
So, you and April
were at Dartmouth together?

347
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,995
Yes. Briefly.

348
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,600
<i>Almost unbearable urge to blink.</i>

349
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,553
<i>Ahh! Lovely, lovely blink.</i>

00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:15,074
Shall we go through?

352
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,191
Help yourself to hummus.

353
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,757
It's freshly made
and, if I say so myself, quite delicious.

354
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,598
<i>Unlike the rest of the meal.</i> Cocktail?

355
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,998
<i>Mmmm, rum, water, lettuce, vinegar
and the secret ingredient - salt.</i>

356
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,873
April said you were off to a conference.

357
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,399
Yes. Date mix-up.

358
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,080
But I think April will be able to join me.

359
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm actually talking tomorrow

360
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,101
on transcultural memory
in the Ottoman Empire.

361

<i>Oh, look who's won the lettuce lottery.</i>

362
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,353
- Wow, this is, um...
- It's Moroccan. I love it.

363
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,674
It... It's quite subtle.

<i>Blink impulse off the scale
and drink disgusting.</i>

365
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,479
Um... I might take it slow,
leave some for your other guests.

366
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,753
Good idea. I'll just go and see
where the other guests have got to.

367
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,029
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

368
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,789
OK, can you haul in the mannequins,
the normalisers?

369
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,515
Also, Megan, would you happen to have
a small make-up bag about your person?

370
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,997
Oh, my <i>God.</i> Yeah, that'll work.

371
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,634
- Yeah?
- Yeah, mate.

372
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,061
Do I claim fancy dress or go full English,

373
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:18,116
- button down, hope they don't mention?
- Look,

374
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,471
you probably need to know,
Joe thinks Megan's fucking around on him

375
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,477
and Megan thinks
Joe's fucking around on her.

376
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,557
- Right. God.
- And...

377
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,352
I happen to know that they're both right.

378
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,936
Because I've sort of ended up
sleeping with both of them.

379
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:34,222
- You're humping them both?
- To be honest, it's getting quite tiring.

380
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,077
Especially when I have to do them
both in one day.

381
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,556
Oh, that must be really hard.
I'm so sorry for you, Jez.

382
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,318
Uh, uh... Eh-heh-heh-heh.

383
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,670
Uh, uh, uh, eh-heh-heh-heh.

384
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,949
Yeah.

385
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,058
Oh the plus side, she's fucking around
on him and he's fucking around on her.

386
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,031
So, if they find out about each other

387
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,436
then I don't see
that they can make much of a fuss.

388
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,199
Well, you can't fuck them both, I'm
afraid. That's not how civilisation works.

389
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,709
<i>JEZ: Civilisation, schmiviiisation.</i>

390
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,551
Did Maggie mention
that she's actually an artist?

391
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,558
- It's Megan.
- Oh, of course!

392
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,637
Maggie's just a nickname.

393
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,036
- That she hates.
- Are you wearing eyeshadow, Mark?

394
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,549
Er, yes. That's s-something I'm doing.

395
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,151

but, er, I may have been misinformed.

<i>Serve up, move on.</i>

397
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,716
So, you two are writing a book together?

398
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,118
I do the bulk of the writing, but Angus's
ideas are what the book's built on.

399
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,596
April's doing herself a disservice.
She's the real historian of the two of us.

400
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,029
I think of myself more as a...

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,354
as a theologian, really.

402

409
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,349
Can I ask you a question, Angus,
of a theological nature?

410
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,075
- I'll see what I can do.
- Did Jesus have...

411
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,758
a cat?

412
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,111
I wouldn't have thought personal pets
in the sense that we...

I'd hate to call you a racist
at my dinner party,

424
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,115
but I think it's a little more
sophisticated than that.

425
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,514
It's from the Atlas Mountains.

To be honest, er,
I've never really got it about Jesus.

429
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,800
I mean, apart from all the Christian
stuff, what did Jesus actually do?

430
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,275
What did Jesus do...
apart from Christianity?

431

I'm just saying, you know, apart
from that, what did he actually achieve?

434
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,309
You know, I'm not saying I like him,
but at least Hitler did some paintings.

435
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,239
If you're comparing Hitler and Jesus,

453
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,593
- My boyfriend is fucking my life coach.
- JOE: No, Megan.

454
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,551
- Can we talk about this, please?
- MARK: Oh, <i>brilliant.</i>

455
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,671
<i>Freak-show sideshow at the shit-show.</i>

456
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,994
MEGAN: What the fuck were you doing?

457
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,687
JOE: What was I doing?
What the fuck were you doing?

458
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:57,992
I might leave them to it.

459
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,350
<i>Ohh, the Corrigan stare.</i>

460
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,629
<i>The full Paddington.</i>

461
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,594
I need a cigarette.
Has anyone got a cigarette?

462
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,835
I thought you'd given up.

463
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,393
I thought things, you thought things.

464
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,800
Turns out, people can surprise you.

465
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:11,750
<i>Hello!</i>

466
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,041
Go on. Fine. Choke yourself.

467
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,478
At least I tell you
when I'm breaking a promise.

468
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,254
<i>Stop actually rubbing my</i> hands.

469
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,695
Sorry, it's just a...
bit of a flashback to Corfu.

470
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,172
- Corfu?
- ANGUS: Er, it's nothing.

471
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,012
Not nothing.

472
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:29,720
When we were in Corfu last summer,
we had a little relationship trouble.

473
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,878
I'm sure all's well now.
I-I don't want to pry.

474
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,196
<i>Wheedle, wheedle, pry and needle.</i>

475
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,551
We've had counselling, we've dealt
with the issues, we've moved on.

476
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,671
But the wounds are still there.

477
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,315
That can happen with wounds.
It can be good to give them a good...

478
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,237
inspection now and again.

479
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,433
As a penance, I went to live with
the monks on Mount Athos for three months.

480
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,993
Ten weeks.

481
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,872
Ten weeks, whatever.

482
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,151
Apparently, he lived on nothing
but dry bread and goat's milk.

483
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,511
But when I picked him up, there were
a lot of Nutella jars in his recycling.

484
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,870
I know, and I'm sorry.

485
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,407
I can be weak.

486
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,277
Weak how exactly, Angus?

487
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,485
You don't have to achieve sainthood.

488
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,591
Just, ooh, try not to fuck anyone else.

489
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,297
<i>This is amazing.</i>

490
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:14,998
<i>So uncomfortable.</i>

491
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,634
<i>This could be my night
of greatest triumph.</i>

492
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:21,871
<i>If we weren't all about to die
from eating these poisonous eggs.</i>

493
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,960
For the cheese course,
I have a soft cheese...

494
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,197
<i>Dairylea moulded together
with my bare hands.</i>

495
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,440
- ...plus a tasty young Stilton.
- Ingenious. But totally mental.

496
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,391
<i>MARK: Out of bread and crackers.</i>

497
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,351
<i>Just need to state it with conviction.</i>

498
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,180
It's time for cheese and lettuce.
Most <i>natural combination</i> in the <i>world.</i>

499
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:46,151
- So, we've got good news.
- We're going to make a go of it.

500
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,961
We're looking at the possibility
of moving forward as a three.

501
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:51,513
Becoming a... triangle.

502
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,872
A very respectful, very boundaried,
rather horny triangle.

503
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,207
With guidelines.

504
00:20:57,232 --> 00:20:58,594
Three-ism.

505
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,869
Th... Three-ism?

506
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,560
Well, I think it's great
you're trying to approach the situation

507
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,954
in the most adult way possible.

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,037
My God. Is that what you want?

509
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,995
To give it a go with her and me
in some kind of triangle?

510
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,399
MARK: <i>Oh, Angus. You just can't</i> seem <i>to
say the right thing, you lovely</i> arsehofe.

511
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,567
(SIGHS) I'm sorry this all happened here.

512
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:22,555
<i>Just very sensitively shut her in.</i>

513
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,421
I am upset.
It's obviously still a bit raw.

514
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,713
But I do still love him.

515
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,195
Of course. Of course you do.

516
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,153
- Can you tell him I need to talk to him?
<i>- Maybe I will, April.</i>

517
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,272
<i>Although you might have picked
a slightly corrupt postman.</i>

518
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,349
OK, I mean, this is very exciting, but I
might need to make a move home, so, Joe...

519
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,489
Oh, I thought Joe
was staying here tonight,

520
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:46,648
um... according to the guidelines.

521
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,233
No, it's Saturday,
so it's a Joe and Megan night.

522
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,230
Right, but you spent last night together.

523
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:56,021
Um... "On no two consecutive nights
shall..." Et cetera, et cetera.

524
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:58,798
Yeah, but you two already fucked today.
It's my turn for a go on Joe.

525
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,142
Oh, OK.

526
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:04,069
Well, then, yeah, I mean,
I guess it's up to Joe.

527
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,590
Is it? Is there a rule for...?

528
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,995
Oh, this is fucking bullshit!

529
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,838
(ANGUS CLEARS HIS THROAT)

530
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,791
- What did she say?
- Look,

531
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,377
don't shoot the messenger,
but April said she...

532
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,519
doesn't want to speak to you.

533
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,599
She loves you,
but she's not sure she likes you.

534
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,916
- Right.
<i>- Naughty postman.</i>

535
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,792
<i>Drink down my lies, Angus.</i>

536
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,597
<i>They taste good, don't they?</i>

537
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:29,550
Is this Ribena?

538
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,035
Yes, it's Ribena. I'm an alcoholic.

539
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,232
I'm a complicated guy
with a complicated past.

540
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,351
Like you and April.

541
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,950
- Why did you have to sleep with her?
- I'm right here!

542
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,753
Oh, everything was all right when you were
humping two people, but when I started,

543
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,632
- that's not allowed?
- No, no,

544
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,432
you knew we were humping
when we humped.

545
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,706
You kept Megan a secret
because you like her more than me.

546
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:50,954
Admit it.

547
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,073
No! I won't fucking admit it,
because it's not true.

548
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,302
Angus loves you, but...
he doesn't know if he respects you.

549
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,831
- April...
- I was just explaining.

550
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,589
- I-I think I got it right, that...
- I need some space to think.

551
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,109
Uh-huh. That's wise.

552
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,605
I understand. I'll go.

553
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,463
<i>That's right, off you fuck.</i>

554
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:17,115
April, if you like, there's a B&B nearby,

555
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,549
or I can take the sofa and you can...

556
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,187
That's kind, Mark, but I want to go home.

557
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:24,356
- Gus, do you mind staying here?
- Of course.

558
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,536
Let's talk anon.

559
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,111
Bye, Mark.

560
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
And thank you.

561
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:34,719
<i>Great. She's gone and I'm left with the
Jesus lunk who, because of manners,</i>

562
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,277
<i>- I</i> can't <i>simply push</i> out the window.
- MEGAN: For God's sake, this is pathetic.

563
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,436
- I never asked you to fight over me.
- Get off!

564
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,917
Yeah, the fighting phase
seems to be ending, actually.

565
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,429
Oh, for fuck's sake!

566
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,985
Thank you, Mark, for letting me stay.
You're a good man.

567
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,353
I feel like I want to talk.

568
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,676
You know, really talk, about...

569
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
sin and man and God and love

570
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,592
and the mystery of the Trinity.

571
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,551
Right.

572
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,432
Yes? <i>Yep,</i>

573
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,709
<i>let's sit here, me and my make-up,</i>

574
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,515
<i>and drink vinegar and lettuce and rum
and eat moulded Dairylea</i>

575
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,432
<i>and scribbled Cheddar
and talk it all through forever,</i>

576
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,835
<i>while those two gently hump in the corner.</i>
