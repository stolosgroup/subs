THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE,
 THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SPEAKING.

5
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:44,100
   DO I SOUND
LIKE A CHINESE TAKE-AWAY?

6
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,100
 I AM A HIGHLY DESIRABLE
PRIVATE RESIDENCE

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,200
IN AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING
NATURAL PROPERTY VALUES.

8
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:55,334
 AND I'M WAITING
FOR YOUR APOLOGY,

9
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:57,734
   UNLESS, OF COURSE,
   THE THOUGHT OF BEAN SHOOTS

10
00:00:57,734 --> 00:01:01,300
   AND CRISPY WON TON
 HAVE TOTALLY STIR-FRIED
YOUR BASIC GOOD MANNERS.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,767
   NOW, KINDLY
CLEAR THIS LINE.

12
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:07,100
  THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SUBSTANCE
IN THIS COMMUNITY

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,901
WHO ARE PROBABLY QUEUING
 TO RING ME AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

14
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,334
 YOUR SUGGESTION
IS NOTED,

15
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,634
BUT I SEE LITTLE
 PRACTICAL MERIT

16
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,767
 IN HAVING THE TELEPHONE
  UP MY JUMPER.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,133
 I'VE JUST BEEN INSULTED
 ON MY OWN TELEPHONE.

18
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,133
I EXPECT
   THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE RARE

19
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,834
OF BEING INSULTED
   ON OTHER PEOPLE'S.

20
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,300
I THINK
IT'S TIME, RICHARD,
THAT YOU COMPLAINED.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,267
   ABOUT WHAT?

22
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:37,501
  ABOUT THESE WRONG NUMBERS
  FOR THE CHINESE TAKE-AWAY.

23
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,200
  YOU MUST RING
 THE AMBASSADOR.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,567
WHAT AMBASSADOR?

25
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,801
 THE CHINESE, OF COURSE.

26
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,701
  I DON'T THINK
IT'S REALLY HIS PROVINCE.

27
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:49,968
 - THEN WHAT'S HE HERE FOR?
 - PROBABLY FOR MORE THAN THAT.

28
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,868
 THEY'RE A VERY
  ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.

29
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:55,634
  OH, RICHARD,
  DON'T JUST SIT THERE,

30
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:57,834
  GET DIRECTORY
  INQUIRIES.

31
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,400
THAT'S IT!
FINISHED!

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,167
  NO MORE MEN.
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.

33
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,634
   IN THE END,
  THEY ALL DECEIVE YOU.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,000
 AFTER ALL I'VE
  DONE FOR THAT SWINE,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,100
   TO LEAVE ME
   FOR ANOTHER WOMAN,

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,334
  I DON'T CARE
   IF SHE IS HIS WIFE.

37
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:23,200
 WELL, IT'S OVER.
 I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON.

38
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:26,300
   I ONLY WANT ONE.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
I WISH YOU'D
FIND YOURSELF

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,667
A NICE STEADY BLOKE.

41
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,033
   GIVE YOUR HORMONES
   A CHANCE TO SETTLE.

42
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,567
STOP LIVING
ON YOUR NERVES...

43
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:40,267
AND MY FAGS.

44
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:42,267
MY HORMONES
HAVE SETTLED!

45
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:44,634
I'VE FINISHED--
NO MORE MEN!

46
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:47,000
   THE SWINE!

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,801
  HE SWORE HE'D LOVE ME
  TILL THE END OF TIME!

48
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,534
I DIDN'T REALIZE
 HE MEANT CLOSING TIME.

49
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,868
  GO ON THEN,
  READ ME SOME BOOK.

50
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:01,033
"'I LOVE YOU'
HE SAID,

51
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,367
LIFTING HER GENTLY
ONTO THE BALCONY.

52
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,934
  'OH, JEREMY,'
   SHE SAID."

53
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:08,334
   OH, CHUFFIN' HECK.

54
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:21,934
 HELLO!

55
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,901
   GOOD MORNING,
   MR. PENWORTHY.

56
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,634
  GOOD MORNING,
  MRS. BUCKET.

57
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:29,968
   - "BOUQUET."
   - WERE YOU GOING TOO FAST?

58
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:32,534
IT'S THE MODERN DISEASE.

59
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:36,300
 HAVE YOU HURT YOURSELF?
   I DO HOPE YOU'VE SUSTAINED
   NO INJURY.

60
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
 NO, THANK YOU,
I'M FINE.

61
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,801
   YOUR WAVING
 DISTRACTED ME.

62
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,300
 REALLY?

63
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,367
 I'D ASK YOU IN,
 ONLY MY HUSBAND'S BUSY

64
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,734
ON THE TELEPHONE
  WITH THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR.

65
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,801
I WONDER IF I
MIGHT ASK YOU

66
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:59,801
   NOT TO COUGH
   OR SNEEZE TOO LOUDLY.

67
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,901
  MY HUSBAND'S ON THE TELEPHONE
  WITH THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR.

68
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:07,634
 THEY'RE A VERY ANCIENT
  CIVILIZATION.

69
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,167
WELL,
WHAT DID HE SAY?

70
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,801
I HAD TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.
IT WAS AN ANSWERING MACHINE.

71
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,634
OH, WAS IT
A CULTURED VOICE?

72
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:24,400
   - YES.
   - WELL, THAT'S IT, THEN.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,901
   YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING
   TO THE AMBASSADOR.

74
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:30,033
   I HARDLY THINK SO.

75
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,968
   NOW, DON'T CONTRADICT ME,
   RICHARD,

76
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:33,767
  IT'S VERY TIRING.

77
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,634
  YOU OUGHT TO BE
  VERY PLEASED
  THAT YOU'RE

78
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:37,834
  ON CHATTING TERMS
  WITH THE CHINESE
  AMBASSADOR.

79
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,868
   - WHO IS?
   - WE ARE.

80
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:43,801
  YOU LEFT A MESSAGE
  ON HIS MACHINE,

81
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:47,667
   THEREFORE,
   HE WILL RING US BACK.

82
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,000
 I MUST TELL
 MY SHERIDAN.

83
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,067
 NO SIGN OF HER.
  LET'S GET IN THE CAR

84
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:05,033
AND AWAY
  BEFORE SHE SPOTS US.

85
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:07,567
 YOU'RE GETTING PARANOID
 ABOUT HYACINTH.

86
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,868
 WHICH SEEMS A VERY
 SENSIBLE WAY TO BE.

87
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,000
  - NOT SO LOUD.
  - EMMET, I'M AT MY OWN HOME

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,267
   IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.
 I SEE NO REASON
 TO CREEP ABOUT.

89
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,534
  I CAN GIVE YOU

90
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:33,167
ONE DAMN GOOD REASON
TO CREEP ABOUT.

91
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:37,033
NO, I'VE GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

92
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,033
LET'S FREEWHEEL
DOWN THE DRIVE

93
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,767
   AND START THE CAR
   IN THE STREET.

94
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,901
   - THERE ISN'T ANY SLOPE.
   - I'LL GIVE YOU A PUSH.

95
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:45,200
 - EMMET!
 - IT'S WORTH IT, LIZ!

96
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
  BELIEVE ME,
  IT'S WORTH IT.

97
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,667
 IF SHE SPOTS US SHE'LL WANT
 TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.

98
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,167
  YOU'LL TELL HER
  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LIE.

99
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:57,968
WHY IS IT?
YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN
AND YOU CAN'T LIE?

100
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,767
   HAVING TROUBLE
   WITH THE CAR?

101
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,934
 I'LL GET RICHARD
 TO GIVE YOU A HAND.

102
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,767
 THAT'S IF HE'S FINISHED
  HIS DIPLOMATIC CALL.

103
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,801
 IT'S ALL RIGHT,
   HYACINTH, HONESTLY.

104
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,934
   NO, I WON'T
  BE DISSUADED.

105
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,934
   THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS
ARE FOR.

106
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:39,767
* PEOPLE,
PEOPLE WHO NEED PEOPLE *

107
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,868
<i>* ARE THE LUCKIEST
PEOPLE... *

108
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,868
QUICK,
START THE CAR!

109
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,634
 IT'S TOO LATE NOW.  WE'LL HAVE
 TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

110
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,968
   I'LL GO WHERE THERE
   ARE NO MEN.

111
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:56,968
   I'LL EMIGRATE

112
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,767
   SOMEWHERE DESOLATE,

113
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,767
WITH NONE
OF THE CREATURE COMFORTS

114
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:06,534
   SCRUB THAT,
   TOO MUCH LIKE HOME.

115
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,667
MEN!

116
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:15,133
HOW CAN YOU GO ON
READING ROMANTIC DRIVEL

117
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,200
WHEN YOU KNOW
WHAT MEN ARE LIKE?

118
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,667
   IN THIS BOOK,

119
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,667
   THEY'RE TERRIFIC.

120
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:25,534
 JEREMY HAS HAIR
LIKE GOLDEN CORN.

121
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:28,701
HE'S TALL
  AND SLENDER,

122
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:32,634
A MAGNIFICENT FIGURE
ON A HORSE.

123
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,968
   SO HOW COME I'M STILL
   IN LOVE WITH ONSLOW?

124
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:42,200
   YOU MUST BE COMING
   UNGLUED IN THE HEAD.

125
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,601
   - ANY MORE CRISPS?
   - GET 'EM YOURSELF.

126
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,601
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET THEM.

127
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,501
  YOU'D THINK HIS HAIR
  WAS LIKE GOLDEN CORN.

128
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,601
  SMOKEY BACON FLAVOR.

129
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:56,767
THERE'S NO SMOKEY
   BACON FLAVOR LEFT!

130
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,801
OH, NICE.

131
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,534
  IT COULD BE
  THE ALTERNATOR.

132
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:06,133
RIGHT.
TRY NOW, LIZ.

133
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,000
( engine starts )

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,100
  - WELL DONE, RICHARD.
  - YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

135
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,934
I DIDN'T
DO MUCH, REALLY.

136
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,033
   DON'T BE SO MODEST.

137
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,868
IT WAS VERY
KIND OF YOU.

138
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:21,067
- I DON'T THINK I DID ANYTHING.
- YOU DID ENOUGH, DEAR.

139
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,767
AND NOW ELIZABETH
AND EMMET

140
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,734
   CAN BE OFF TO WHERE
 THEY'RE GOING.

141
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,901
WHEREVER THAT IS.

142
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:33,701
  - ARE YOU GOING FAR?
  - NO, NOT FAR.

143
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,467
WELL, THAT'S VERY
   MYSTERIOUS.

144
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,834
  IS IT A VERY
 INTERESTING "NOT FAR"?

145
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,400
IT'S JUST
THE CHURCH HALL,
HYACINTH.

146
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,200
OH, THE CHURCH HALL.

147
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,334
   I DIDN'T KNOW
   THERE WAS A FUNCTION.

148
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,767
   NO, NO, NO,
 NOT A FUNCTION, REALLY.

149
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,801
<i>AH--

150
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,968
 THE VICAR ASKED EMMET
 IF HE'D JUST--

151
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,367
 J-JUST A BIT MUSIC

152
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,501
   OH, EMMET,
WHAT A GOOD IDEA.

153
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:00,901
RICHARD,
 WE'D BETTER GET ALONG.

154
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,734
  MUSTN'T DELAY
  THESE PEOPLE.

155
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,067
   I THOUGHT SHE'D
   PUSH HER WAY IN.

156
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,033
  I COULD HAVE SWORN
  SHE'D WANT TO SING.

157
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,901
 WELL, THERE YOU ARE.
 YOU'RE BEING UNFAIR TO HER.

158
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,868
   I'VE JUST HAD
   A WONDERFUL IDEA!

159
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:16,767
   WHY DON'T
   I JOIN YOU?

160
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,767
   YOU PLAY
   AND I'LL SING.

161
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,601
   FOR THE OLD PEOPLE,
   BLESS THEM.

162
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,934
HOW THEY'LL ENJOY IT.

163
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,033
I'LL RING
THE VICAR NOW

168
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:46,000
 NOT AVAILABLE,
   IS HE BUSY?

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,501
 OH, RINGING THE BELLS,
   OH.

170

  RINGS HIS OWN BELLS,
 HOW DEMOCRATIC.

171
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:58,067
 OH, I CAN JUST PICTURE
  THE VICAR AT THE END
  OF HIS ROPE.

GONE DOWN THE WRONG WAY?

A LITTLE MESSAGE

WON'T JUST BE PIANOFORTE,

A TALK, I MEAN WITH ME
TALKING, TOO.

  HE COULD HAVE,
  YOU KNOW.

 ANYONE WHO'S IN
 AN OPERATIC SOCIETY

00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,667
SHOULD HAVE
SOME LEATHER SHORTS.

282
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,033
 OF COURSE HE'S PROBABLY
 LEFT THEM BEHIND.

  YOU COULD GO AND FETCH
  THEM FOR HIM, RICHARD.

284
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,767
TURN LEFT, DEAR.

285
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,434
YOU'RE GOING TO PROMISE ME
THAT WHEN WE HAVE OUR TALK,

286
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,834
THAT YOU'LL MAKE AN EFFORT
AND TRY TO LISTEN

WHEN YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
SAYING ANYTHING.

288
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:56,968
 RICHARD, ARE YOU LISTENING?
 ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION?

289
00:16:56,968 --> 00:17:01,000
  - YOU'VE NOT BEEN LISTENING.
  - TURN RIGHT, DEAR.

290
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:09,400
  WHAT ARE WE
  DOING HERE?

  TURN RIGHT.

  AT THE NEXT JUNCTION.

294
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,968
YOU WERE GOING TO ALLOW ME
TO GO ALL THAT WAY

295
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,901
WITHOUT FURTHER
INSTRUCTIONS.

296
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:23,834
 I WANT YOU TO START
 REVERSING NOW, RICHARD.

297
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,067
 THIS IS NOT
 THE KIND OF AREA

298
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:30,100
 IN WHICH I WISH
 TO BE SEEN PARKING.

 RIGHT, I'M OFF.

300

  - OF COURSE YOU GET A KISS.

301
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,334
KEEP AWAY
FROM THE LADIES.

302
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,567
NOW, HOW CAN I
KEEP AWAY FROM THE LADIES?

303
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,467
98.5% OF MY CONGREGATION
ARE LADIES.

304
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:46,467
 AND THEY ALL ADORE YOU.
 INCLUDING ME.

305
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,634
- YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.
- OF COURSE I'M JEALOUS.

306
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,000
   KEEP AWAY
   FROM THE LADIES.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
   I MUST GO.
   AH!

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,167
NOW WHERE ARE THOSE
DATES FOR THE YOUTH CLUB?

309
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,267
  WHY THE VICARAGE?

310
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,434
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SINGING
AT THE CHURCH HALL.

311
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,434
   WELL, I THOUGHT
   I'D ASK THE VICAR

312
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:10,367
IF THERE WERE ANY LITTLE
FAVORITES HE WISHES ME
TO INCLUDE.

313
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,534
   IT'S THE SORT OF COURTESY
   HE WOULD EXPECT FROM ME.

314
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,734
  ( groans )

315
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,234
   HAVEN'T YOU FORGOTTEN
   SOMETHING, DEAR?

316
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:23,601
   - HMM?
   - THE DOOR.

317
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:28,133
  EARLY RETIREMENT.

318
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,133
  HMM?

319
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,567
 OH, THAT WAS QUICK.

320
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,534
YOU SAID,
"KEEP AWAY FROM THE LADIES."

321
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:54,634
OH, I SEE.

322
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,067
  I MEANT KEEP AWAY
  FROM ALL OF THEM,
  NOT JUST THAT ONE.

323
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,067
TELL HER I'VE BEEN
CALLED AWAY.

324
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,701
   - WHERE TO?
   - VLADIVOSTOK.

325
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,968
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,
RICHARD.

326
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:12,434
WHATEVER'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

327
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:15,934
<i>REALLYWANT TO KNOW?

328
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:18,000
OF COURSE
 I WANT TO KNOW.

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,167
  WHATEVER CONCERNS YOU
  CONCERNS ME.

330
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,200
VERY WELL THEN,

331
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,467
I'LL TELL YOU.

332
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,968
THE THING THAT'S
BOTHERING ME--

333
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,300
YOU SEE HOW MUCH
BETTER IT IS WHEN WE
TALK THESE THINGS OUT.

334
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,601
 I HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

335
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,200
   THAT'S WHAT WIVES
   ARE FOR--

336
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,167
   TO LISTEN.

337
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,167
  WELL,

338
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,834
   YOU THINK OF ALL THE TERRIBLE
   THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU

339
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:47,000
<i>( bells ringing )

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,801
 OH, MY GOODNESS,
 LOOK AT THE TIME.

341
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:52,534
WE MUSTN'T KEEP EMMET WAITING,
HE'LL WANT TO REHEARSE.

342
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:54,534
I'LL TALK
TO THE VICAR LATER.

343
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,567
 WE MUST GO STRAIGHT
 TO THE CHURCH HALL!

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,133
   * DO-DO-DO-DOOT-- *

345
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,968
 YOU CAN'T HIDE
 THERE ALL DAY.

346
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:08,200
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'D BE SAFER IN THE KITCHEN.

347
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,033
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER
CUP OF COFFEE.

348
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:21,000
   JUDGING BY THE LENGTH
   OF HER SKIRT,

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
   IT MUST BE ROSE
   UNDERNEATH THAT VEIL.

350
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,267
WHAT WOULD ROSE
BE DOING HERE?

351
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,434
WOBBLING AS IF SHE'S
BEEN DRINKING,

352
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,734
WELL, SHE CAN WOBBLE OFF
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

353
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:36,067
   I WILL NOT HAVE
   A SISTER IN BLACK

354
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,934
   WOBBLING
   INTO OUR CHURCH.

355
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,868
  ROSE!

356
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,200
   INCREDIBLE.

357
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:49,067
   YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE
   MY SISTER HYACINTH.

358
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,934
  ROSE, HAVE YOU
  BEEN DRINKING?

359
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:53,367
   I HAVEN'T
   BEEN DRINKING.

360
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,334
   I TOOK A PILL--

361
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:58,634
AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE GONE
STRAIGHT TO MY KNEES.

362
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,534
  I WISH WE COULD SAY
  THE SAME ABOUT YOUR SKIRT.

363
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:05,834
   - WHY ARE YOU HERE?!
   - I WANT TO SEE THE VICAR.

364
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:09,033
  YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION
  TO SEE THE VICAR.

365
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,200
I WANT TO BE A NUN.
PUT ME DOWN!

366
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,534
   - I WANT TO BE A NUN!
   - RICHARD, GIVE ME A HAND.

367
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:16,234
  FUNNY HOW YOU
 MISHEAR THINGS.

368
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,634
 I COULD HAVE SWORN SHE SAID
 SHE WANTED TO BE A NUN.

369
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:21,934
   - I DO!  I DO!
   - WE'LL HAVE TO
     TAKE HER HOME.

370
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,734
  THERE'S NO TIME.

371
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:26,234
  OH, RICHARD,
  DO REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE.

372
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:29,167
 WE HAVE TO HIDE HER
 IN THE HALL UNTIL SHE
 PULLS HERSELF TOGETHER.

373
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,100
   PULL MYSELF TOGETHER?

374
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:35,834
   GOOD GRIEF,
  OUR HYACINTH,

375
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,767
   YOU'RE NOT
 EVEN SATISFIED

376
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:40,067
  WHEN A PERSON
   WANTS TO BE A NUN.

377
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,200
  HOW TOGETHER
  DO YOU HAVE TO GET?

378
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:49,033
Hyacinth:
  NO, DON'T GET
  IN THE WAY, RICHARD.

379
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:55,133
OH, MIND WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, DEAR!

380
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,701
  ROSE!

381
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:59,334
   I KNOW IT'S BEEN
   A LIFETIME'S DEDICATION,

382
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:01,334
BUT I WISH YOU'D TRY
TO BREAK THIS HABIT

383
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,334
OF WANTING
TO LIE DOWN EVERYWHERE.

384
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:07,200
DO TRY AND STAY
ON YOUR FEET.

385
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,901
 KNEES!
IF I'M GOING TO BE A NUN
I SHOULD BE ON MY KNEES.

386
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:14,334
   IT'S ME THAT WILL
   BE ON MY KNEES.

387
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,868
OH, RICHARD WANTS
TO BE A NUN, TOO.

388
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:21,367
 SHE'S SURPRISINGLY
 HEAVY

389
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,601
 FOR A SHORT-SKIRTED
 PERSON.

390
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:26,234
UHH!

391
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:28,234
 HOW MANY PILLS
 DID SHE TAKE?

392
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:30,934
  ( giggling )
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,

393
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:34,434
THIS BEING A NUN
   MAKES YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD.

394
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,801
I FEEL UPLIFTED!

395
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,501
  ( giggling )

396
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:41,200
LOOK, POP HER
IN THE STORE CUPBOARD,

397
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
  UNTIL SHE GETS BACK
  THE USE OF HER LEGS.

398
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,667
   I CAN'T HAVE
   HER SEEN LIKE THIS.

399
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,534
 OH, DEAR.

400
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,000
OH, HYACINTH!

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,434
   ELIZABETH, DEAR,

402
00:22:52,434 --> 00:22:54,334
ABOUT OUR
 LITTLE CONCERT,

403
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,934
   I THOUGHT I'D BEGIN
WITH SOMETHING CLASSICAL.

404
00:22:56,934 --> 00:23:00,667
 I THINK EMMET'S ALREADY
 GOT A PROGRAM IN MIND.

405
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,701
OH GOOD, AND THEN A SELECTION
FROM "THE SOUND OF MUSIC"

406
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:05,734
AND FINISH WITH
"ANNIE, GET YOUR GUN."

407
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,734
 I'M NOT SURE
 THAT EMMET WAS

408
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,701
  QUITE THINKING
  ALONG THOSE LINES.

409
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:12,634
OH, HE'LL LOVE IT.
EVERYBODY LOVES
MY ANNIE OAKLEY.

410
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,133
   I THINK I'D BETTER
   WARN HIM--

411
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:17,100
TELL HIM.

412
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,968
RICHARD,
HOW DO I LOOK, DEAR?

413
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:23,634
I KEEP SEEING YOU AS
A KIND OF RECURRING MOTIF

414
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:25,834
RUNNING THROUGH
MY EARLY RETIREMENT.

415
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,434
  THAT'S NICE, DEAR.

416
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:31,968
   - AND THE HAT,
     HOW'S THE HAT?
   - YES, THAT, TOO.

417
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:41,434
   SHE'S GONE!

418
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:43,200
   SHE'S GONE!

419
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,467
SHE WAS HERE.
SHE WAS HEADING THIS WAY,
AND NOW SHE'S GONE.

420
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,467
   AND STILL THERE ARE PEOPLE
   WHO REFUSE

421
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:50,467
   TO BELIEVE
 IN THE POWER OF PRAYER.

422
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,567
  OFF YOU GO,
  THEN.

423
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:56,100
AND KEEP AWAY
FROM THE LADIES.

424
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,300
( off-key )
* WITH A GUN *

00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:18,501
 * A MAN--
 A MAN-- *

433

PLAYING THE RIGHT NOTE?

00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,767

   HAVE YOU LOST
   YOUR PLACE AGAIN?

439
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:48,167
   I THOUGHT YOU HAD.
   FROM THE BEGINNING.

440

 HE'D BEEN CERTIFICATED.

445
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,868
DA CAPO,
BACK TO THE BEGINNING,
PLEASE.

446
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:16,734
   NO, NO!

447
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:19,400
 ENOUGH!
 THAT'S IT!

448
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,968
 I'M ONLY FLESH AND BLOOD.
 I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY LONGER!

449
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:24,367
  PSST!

450
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,767
   WHAT IS IT HE CAN'T
TAKE ANY LONGER?

451
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:30,334
THE CHAIR.  HE'S GOT
THE WRONG SIZE CHAIR?

452
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:32,667
HE'S VERY PARTICULAR
ABOUT HIS CHAIR.

453
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:36,033
IT AFFECTS THE STYLE
OF HIS PLAYING.

454
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,133
  WHY DON'T YOU GET
  ANOTHER TYPE OF CHAIR.

455
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:40,133
   ( whispering )
   TAKE A WALK OUTSIDE.

456
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,934
  YES.
   YES, I'LL--

457
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:45,300
I'LL GET
 ANOTHER CHAIR!

458
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:50,267
   OH, SHUT UP!

459
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,534
  I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
  THE INTERRUPTION,
  HYACINTH.

460
00:25:56,534 --> 00:25:58,434
  OH, NO APOLOGY
  NECESSARY.

461
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,200
   YOU DON'T HAVE
   TO EXPLAIN TO ME

462
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,601
ABOUT THE LITTLE ERUPTIONS
OF THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT.

463
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:05,467
I'M THE FIRST TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT.

464
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:07,434
 RICHARD WAS SAYING SO,
ONLY THIS MORNING

465
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:09,234
 TO THE CHINESE
   AMBASSADOR.

466
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:13,133
 - ( giggling )
 - ROSE!

467
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:15,534
   SHE WAS IN THE ROOM
   WITH THE CHAIRS!

468
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,834
   ( screams )

469
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,567
ROSE!  PUT MY ACCOMPANIST
DOWN AT ONCE!

470
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:24,133
 THIS IS NO WAY
 TO BEGIN YOUR VOCATION!

471
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,701
THE BUCKET WOMAN!

472
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,934
   AH, VICAR!

473
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,434
  VICAR, MY SISTER'S
  HAD A CONVERSION,

474
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:35,701
<i>PROFOUNDLY.

475
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:39,067
  WHY DON'T YOU PLAY
  "MISTY" FOR ME?

476
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:42,100
  LET'S PUT HER BACK
  IN THE CUPBOARD,AGAIN,

477
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,467
  SHE CAN MEDITATE
  IN THERE FOR A WHILE.

478
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:50,801
 HAS ANYONE SEEN MY HUSBAND?
 HE'S WANTED ON THE PHONE.

479
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:52,868
<i>( crashing, clanking )

480
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:55,634
<i>OH, VICAR!

481
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,601
   EXCUSE ME!

482
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,601
  WELL!

483
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,467
  IT'S ALL RIGHT.

484
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:09,334
   I'M GOING TO BE
   A NUN.

485
