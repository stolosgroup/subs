00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,400
I THINK THAT'S HOW
RICHARD SURVIVES.

153
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,601
   YOU'RE RIGHT, LIZ.

154
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,467
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

155
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:38,334
I'M A GROWN MAN.
  I'M MARRIED--

156
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,834
 WELL, DIVORCED.

157
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,601
   WHY SHOULD I
   CREEP ABOUT

158
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,701
IN MY OWN SISTER'S
FRONT GARDEN?

159
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:50,334
  YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT.
  IT'S RIDICULOUS.

160
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,934
 ( both laugh )

161
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,934
  ELIZABETH?!

162
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:00,167
 DID I JUST SEE
   SOMEONE DISAPPEARING ROUND
THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE?

163
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,400
DID YOU?
I NEVER NOTICED.

164
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,634
 I THOUGHT I SAW
A MOVING FIGURE.

165
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,434
I WONDER WHO THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN.

166
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,567
 I'M JUST
 OFF TO TOWN.

167
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,567
  I HAVE SOME
  PURCHASES TO MAKE.

168
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,133
  WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT
  SOCIAL OCCASION TOMORROW.

169
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,267
  OH, THAT'S NICE.

170
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:20,667
   WE'RE HAVING A MEAL
   WITH MY SISTER ROSE'S
   WEALTHY GENTLEMAN FRIEND.

171
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,834
 HE'S CALLING FOR US
 IN HIS LIMOUSINE.

172
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,901
- VERY STYLISH.
- HE'S GREEK, YOU KNOW.

173
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:28,767
 IT'S TERRIFYING
  HOW WEALTHY THEY ARE.

174
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,968
I EXPECT WE'LL BE
  IN FOR A BORING TIME

175
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:35,067
   AS HE TALKS
  ABOUT HIS OIL TANKERS
 AND HIS OFFSHORE FUNDS.

176
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,667
  WELL, I MUST BE OFF.

177
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,667
  UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE
TO CATCH THE BUS.

178
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,567
  GIVE MY LOVE
TO EMMET.

179
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:54,234
<i>THESE ARE RATHER LOVELY.

180
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,868
 I'LL BE WITH YOU
 IN A MOMENT, MADAM.

181
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:58,000
NO HURRY.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,400
 I'LL JUST HAVE A BROWSE
   THROUGH YOUR QUALITY ITEMS.

183
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:06,667
WE DON'T USUALLY BUY
ONSLOW ANYTHING EXPENSIVE.

184
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,767
 WELL, HE IS FAMILY,
 AFTER ALL.

185
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,934
HE'S BEEN FAMILY
FOR A LONG TIME,

186
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:14,868
THIS IS THE FIRST
OCCASION HE'S BEEN IN LINE
FOR ANYTHING EXPENSIVE.

187
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:20,701
 RICHARD, WE SHALL BE
 QUITE AN INTIMATE GROUP
 AT LUNCHEON TOMORROW.

188
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,300
 YOU SURELY DON'T IMAGINE
 THAT I COULD PRESENT ONSLOW

189
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,367
 WITH SOMETHING CHEAP
 AND TAWDRY

190
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:27,501
   IN FRONT OF ROSE'S
   WEALTHY GENTLEMAN FRIEND.

191
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,534
   OH, I SEE.

192
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:32,267
I HAVE MY PRIDE.

193
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,167
LUCKY FOR ONSLOW.

194
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,400
   I THOUGHT SOMETHING

195
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,734
EXPENSIVE BUT TASTEFUL--

196
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:41,200
   A PAIR OF CUFF-LINKS.

197
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,501
   CUFF-LINKS,
   FOR ONSLOW?

198
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,200
 HE NEVER WEARS A SHIRT.

199
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,100
   PRECISELY.

200
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,334
   SO WE MUST
 ENCOURAGE HIM--

201
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:53,534
  AND A PAIR OF GOLD CUFF-LINKS
   MIGHT DO THE TRICK.

202
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:55,267
  GOLD-PLATED,
 I HOPE.

203
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:57,567
CERTAINLY NOT.

204
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,400
NOTHING LESS
THAN 18 KARAT.

205
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:04,367
 HOW WEALTHY IS
ROSE'S GENTLEMAN FRIEND?

206
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,601
HE'S GREEK, DEAR.
MARINOPOLOUS.

207
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,133
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD
THE NAME.  HE'S ALWAYS
IN THE GOSSIP COLUMNS.

208
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:14,434
OR THE FINANCIAL PRESS--
OIL TANKERS AND THINGS.

209
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,133
THAT WAS ONASSIS.

210
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,934
  HMM?

211
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,934
NO, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

212
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:22,534
  MAR-IN-OP-OLOUS?

213
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:24,534
YES,
I'M SURE IT WAS.

214
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:29,100
   - YES, MADAM?
   - OH. ( laughs )

215
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,133
 I'M LOOKING
 FOR SOMETHING

216
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:34,067
 VERY EXPENSIVE
 BUT TASTEFUL,

217
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,234
  FOR MY BROTHER
  IN-LAW'S BIRTHDAY.

218
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:40,033
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
   SOMETHING EXQUISITE
 IN CUFF-LINKS.

219
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,400
WITH PLEASURE, MADAM.
IF YOU'D CARE TO TAKE A SEAT,

220
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,667
I'LL SHOW YOU
THE BEST I HAVE.

221
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,667
  OH, THANK YOU.

222
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,534
ARE YOU SURE THAT ROSE'S
GENTLEMAN FRIEND IS WEALTHY?

223
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:54,634
  THEY'RE NOT
  USUALLY WEALTHY.

224
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,100
  THEY'RE USUALLY--
  THE WORD DESPERATE
  SPRINGS TO MIND.

225
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,501
  THIS ONE HAS
  A HUGE CAR.

226
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,968
  ROSE WAS MOST CLEAR
  ABOUT THAT.

227
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:05,000
   WE'LL BE PICKED UP
 BY IT IN THE MORNING.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,167
AND YOU WON'T
HAVE TO DRIVE,

229
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,634
SO YOU CAN ENJOY
A LITTLE DRINK.

230
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:15,501
  WHAT ABOUT ROSE'S
  GENTLEMAN FRIEND?
  WON'T HE WANT A DRINK?

231
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,267
I DON'T EXPECT
HE'LL BE DRIVING.

232
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:21,000
WHY DO YOU THINK
 HE EMPLOYS A CHAUFFEUR?

233
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,734
  HERE YOU ARE,
 MADAM.

234
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,100
THESE ARE THE BEST
WE HAVE IN 18 KARAT.

235
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,334
OH, YES.

236
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,067
  RICHARD?

237
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,267
   DON'T YOU THINK--?

238
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:48,000
 WE SHOULD
 HAVE THEM ENGRAVED.
 WHAT A GOOD IDEA.

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,801
<i>CERTAINLY, MADAM.

240
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:53,067
- BY TOMORROW MORNING,
  COULD YOU DO THAT?
- OF COURSE, MADAM.

241
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,400
IT WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE
  AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

242
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,367
HE MUST BE YOUR FAVORITE
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

243
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,300
HMM?

244
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
  HMM?

245
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:16,400
 AND DON'T BE LATE
 THIS EVENING.

246
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,467
TRY NOT TO PHONE ME
IN ANY MORE MEETINGS.

247
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:21,534
I WANT YOU
TO BE ON TIME

248
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,501
PARTICULARLY
THIS EVENING.

249
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,634
  THERE'S A GREAT DEAL TO BE
  DONE IF I'M TO HAVE

250
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:28,067
 A FEW PEOPLE IN
 FOR PRE-LUNCHEON
 COCKTAILS TOMORROW.

251
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,601
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO ONSLOW'S PARTY.

252
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,400
   WE ARE.

253
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,834
BUT I SEE NO REASON
WHY I CAN'T HAVE

254
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,133
   A FEW PEOPLE IN
   FOR PRE-LUNCHEON
   COCKTAILS.

255
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,934
  IT'LL GIVE
  THE RIGHT IMPRESSION
  WHEN MR. MARINOPOLOUS ARRIVES.

256
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:45,000
   LET HIM SEE WE HAVE
A SOLID SOCIAL POSITION.

257
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,267
  SO THAT HE KNOWS
  FROM WORD ONE

258
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:50,701
  THAT HE'S AMONGST
  HIS OWN KIND.

259
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,968
HAVE WE GOT
ANY COCKTAILS?

260
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,868
 PEOPLE MAKE THEM, DEAR.

261
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:00,834
THEY MIX THINGS.

262
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,801
BUT THEY HAVE TO HAVE
THINGS THEY CAN MIX.

263
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,434
   BRING A FEW
  THINGS HOME.

264
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,934
  YOU EXPECT ME
 TO THINK OF EVERYTHING?

265
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,601
BUT CAN WE AFFORD COCKTAILS
WHEN WE'VE JUST SPENT

266
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,267
THE BUDGET
ON ONSLOW'S CUFF-LINKS?

267
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,167
RICHARD,

268
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:18,100
 WE'RE ABOUT TO MINGLE
   WITH A OIL, DEAR.

269
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,901
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE A PINCHPENNY.

270
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,834
   THANK YOU, DRIVER.

271
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,934
- ARE WE GETTING A TAXI?
- WHAT?

272
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:54,234
   - TOMORROW?
   - NO.

273
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,868
   IF I HAVE TO DRIVE,
   I SHAN'T BE ABLE TO DRINK.

274
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,033
  WE'RE ALL GOING
  IN MR. MARINOPOLOUS'S CAR.

275
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,033
   AH.

276
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:07,567
 WHO THE HECK'S
MR. MARINOPOLOUS?

277
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,667
 IT'S OUR ROSE'S
  NEW GENTLEMAN FRIEND.

278
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,634
HE'S GIVING US
ALL A LIFT, IS HE?

279
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,334
  IT'S ALL ARRANGED.

280
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,334
   THEY'LL DROP US
   OFF AT THE RESTAURANT

281
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:24,267
   AND THEN PICK UP
   HYACINTH AND RICHARD.

282
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:27,033
  HOW LONG'S SHE KNOWN
 THIS MARINOPOLOUS CHAP?

283
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:30,100
- DOES IT MATTER?
- OF COURSE IT MATTERS.

284
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,901
YOU KNOW YOUR ROSE.

285
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,467
  THEY DON'T LAST LONG
 WITH YOUR ROSE.

286
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,834
JUST MAKE SURE SHE
DOESN'T FINISH WITH HIM

287
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,834
  TILL AFTER WE'VE
  ALL HAD A DRINK.

288
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,367
HERE, ELIZABETH, THIS IS
ALL VERY SHORT NOTICE.

289
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,167
  IT WILL THEREFORE REQUIRE
  ALL MY ORGANIZATIONAL TALENTS.

290
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:53,300
  BUT IT WILL BE
  MARVELOUS IF YOU COULD
  HELP ME, ELIZABETH.

291
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,267
I'D LOVE TO,
HYACINTH,

292
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:59,133
- BUT I PLANNED TO GO--
- HAVE YOU?  THAT'S NICE.

293
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,267
  NOW I WANT YOU TO LOOK
  THROUGH MY COLLECTION

294
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:04,834
   OF HAUTE CUISINE
   COOKERY BOOKS--

295
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,167
   WITHOUT, OF COURSE,
   CREASING THE PAGES.

296
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,200
 FIND LITTLE THINGS THAT WE
 CAN DO QUICKLY ON STICKS.

297
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,934
   YOU KNOW THE SORT
   OF THING,

298
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:15,834
TASTY LITTLE MORSELS
OF THE HIGHEST SOCIAL CALIBER.

299
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:18,100
WHOOP, HA-HA.
NOW, THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME

300
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,133
   AND THERE'S A LOT
   FOR US TO DO,

301
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,133
SO YOU'LL HAVE
TO WORK MIRACLES.

302
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:25,801
MEANWHILE, I'LL HAVE
TO SEE WHO I CAN INVITE
HERE AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

303
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:28,501
I BETTER MAKE A LIST.

304
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,834
THERE'S YOU AND EMMET,
OF COURSE.

305
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:32,934
NO, NO, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT EMMET.

306
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,267
I THINK HE MIGHT
 HAVE SOME REHEARSALS TOMORROW.

307
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,234
HE CAN SPARE
AN HOUR, DEAR.

308
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,367
YOU WOULDN'T WANT HIM
TO MISS THE OPPORTUNITY

309
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,300
OF MEETING A GREEK
SHIPPING MILLIONAIRE.

310
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,601
SO THAT'S YOU AND EMMET,

311
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:46,234
OH, AND I'LL
INVITE THE VICAR.

312
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,367
  I'LL RING
  MRS. BARKER-FINCH.

313
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,334
   SHE WON'T COME
   OF COURSE

314
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,801
   BUT SHE'LL BE FURIOUS
   WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
   WHAT SHE'S MISSED.

315
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,634
  I WONDER
  ABOUT THE MAJOR.

316
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:59,000
OH, JUST FOR AN HOUR
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
IN A CROWDED ROOM

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,567
  I SHOULD BE SAFE
  WITH THE MAJOR.

318
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,934
 HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY
 TROUBLE WITH THE MAJOR?

319
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:05,100
 - TROUBLE?
 - NO, I DON'T SUPPOSE
   YOU WOULD HAVE.

320
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
  I'LL RISK IT.

321
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,767
   MAJOR ALWAYS ADDS
   A LITTLE TONE.

322
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,901
   MAKE MR. MARINOPOLOUS
   REALIZE

323
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:17,000
 THAT WE MAY NOT ALL BE
 MILLIONAIRES, BUT WE DO
 HAVE OUR STANDARDS.

324
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,968
   YOU HAVEN'T GOT
   VERY FAR, DEAR.

325
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,834
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
GREEKS COMING?

326
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,767
  HMM?  OH NO, DEAR,
  THEY BREAK PLATES.

327
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,300
HE MAY HAVE A TANKER
IN EVERY PORT,

328
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,968
BUT I AM
NOT SACRIFICING
MY ROYAL DOULTON

329
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,767
   WITH THE HAND-PAINTED
   PERIWINKLES.

330
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,534
  THERE AREN'T
 THAT MANY LEFT.

331
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:47,167
<i>( phone rings )

332
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,167
 CAN YOU GET IT,
  DEAR?

333
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:54,567
   THE VICARAGE.

334
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:58,734
   - IT'S THE BUCKET WOMAN.
   - OH, NO!

335
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,601
DO YOU WANT TO GO
 FOR COCKTAILS TOMORROW?

336
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,534
   OF COURSE,
  WE'D LOVE TO,

337
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:17,167
  BUT THE VICAR WILL BE
HEAVILY ENGAGED TOMORROW.

338
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:19,968
  HE'S VISITING
   A VERY OLD

339
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,000
SICK PARISHIONER.

340
00:18:25,701 --> 00:18:28,234
   NO I DON'T
 THINK WE COULD DO THAT.

341
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:31,834
 I DON'T THINK
   WE COULD BRING HER
 AND LEAVE HER OUTSIDE.

342
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,968
  OH, THE VICAR
   CAN'T COME.

343
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:41,133
   OH, I AM SURPRISED.

344
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:43,534
  PERHAPS IT'S THE IDEA
  OF COCKTAILS.

345
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,167
I HOPE I HAVEN'T OFFENDED
 HIS RELIGIOUS SCRUPLES.

346
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,567
OH, IF YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND ANYTHING IN THESE,

347
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:49,667
I'VE GOT
SOME MORE BOOKS.

348
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,501
<i>( phone rings )

349
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,467
THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE,
 THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SPEAKING.

350
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,934
  OH, IT'S YOU,
 VIOLET.

351
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:04,200
  HOW ARE YOU,
  DEAR?

352
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,300
 IT'S MY SISTER VIOLET,

353
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,667
   THE ONE WHO MARRIED
  THE TURF ACCOUNTANT,

354
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:11,400
<i>- SWIMMING POOL,
  ROOM FOR A PONY.

355
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,267
   - I KNOW THE ONE.
   - CALLING FROM THEIR VILLA
     IN IBIZA.

356
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP,
  VIOLET, DEAR.

357
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,634
 THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME
INTERFERENCE ON THE LINE.

358
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:25,200
 IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE'S SOBBING, DEAR.

359
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,701
OH, THAT'S BRUCE?

360
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:33,667
  WHY IS BRUCE
SOBBING?

361
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,767
 BUT IS IT A LARGE TEAR
 IN HIS FLAMENCO FROCK?

362
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,734
CAN'T YOU MEND IT
 FOR HIM, DEAR?

363
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:45,334
  UH-UH, LOOK,
VIOLET, I'M SORRY, DEAR,

364
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,601
BUT I HAVEN'T TIME TODAY
  FOR ALL THIS.

365
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:50,100
   I HAVE A VERY FULL
SOCIAL CALENDAR.

366
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,400
  IT'S ONSLOW'S
 BIRTHDAY PARTY TOMORROW

367
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,601
   AND COCKTAILS WITH A GREEK
  SHIPPING MILLIONAIRE.

368
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,601
OH, I KNOW I'VE
NEVER MENTIONED

369
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:00,267
 ANY GREEK MILLIONAIRE TO YOU,
 BUT I'M NOT THE SORT OF PERSON

370
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,968
   WHO BRAGS ABOUT HER
SOCIAL OCCASIONS.

371
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,367
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO COPE
WITH BRUCE, DEAR.

372
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,367
KEEP HIM
 OUT OF THE SUN.

373
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:13,067
   I'M SORRY, VIOLET,
I'LL HAVE TO GO.

374
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:16,968
   YES, I KNOW
IT'S A HARSH WORLD, DEAR.

375
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:19,601
  BUT THERE ARE
FAR WORSE THINGS
THAN YOUR HUSBAND

376
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,100
  DANCING ON RESTAURANT TABLES
 WITH HIS HAIR IN A BUN.

377
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,400
  THANK HEAVEN
THEY'RE IN IBIZA.

378
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,167
 ( phone rings )

379
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:33,033
3-5-4-9.

380
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,934
  AH, THE BUCKET FILLY,

381
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,767
  PRONOUNCED "BOUQUET."

382
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,767
   TO A WHAT?

383
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:45,067
  A COCKTAILS
AND CANAPE, EH?

384
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:48,000
   MY GOD YES,
  I MUST HAVE A RICKY AT THAT.

385
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,501
I'M AFRAID THE OLD BALL
AND CHAIN'S AWAY AT THE MOMENT,
BUT I CAN COME.

386
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,567
DO I SPEAK GREEK?

387
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,534
   ONLY WHEN SERIOUSLY
   UNDER THE INFLUENCE
   OF A GIRL,

388
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,234
THEN THEY TELL ME
   I'M FLUENT.

389
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:06,234
   A MILLIONAIRE IS HE?  OH.

390
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:09,100
  WELL, SOMETHING SHADY
   I SHOULDN'T WONDER.

391
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,033
 I SHOULD WATCH
 YOUR LITTLE SELF THERE.

392
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,033
YES, OF COURSE I'LL COME,
YOU LITTLE MINX.

393
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,033
  COUNT ME IN.
 RATHER.

394
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,567
   WHAT IS IT,
   THINGS ON STICKS, I EXPECT?

395
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:22,968
  WELL,
IT'LL BE WORTH IT

396
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:27,167
   IF I CAN SNATCH JUST FIVE
MINUTES  MADNESS
IN YOUR COMPANY.

397
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,267
   SEE YOU ON PARADE.

398
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,801
WHAT DID
THE MAJOR SAY?

399
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:35,801
  I THINK HE'S COMING.

400
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,567
   - OH, THAT'S GOOD.
   - YES, ISN'T IT?

401
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,167
   AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER
   TO KEEP ON THE MOVE.

402
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,033
   AH!

403
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:48,934
 OH!

404
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:02,434
 LEAVE YOUR TIE ALONE,
 ONSLOW.

405
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:04,667
 WHAT A WAY
 TO SPEND YOUR BIRTHDAY.

406
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,834
 HE'S HERE!
 MR. MARINOPOLOUS IS HERE!

407
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,834
 I DON'T CARE
 IF HE IS GREEK,

408
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,834
 I'M NOT HAVING
 ANY KEBABS.

409
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,701
 ESPECIALLY
 ON MY BIRTHDAY.

410
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:15,701
  OH, BE NICE
  TO HIM, ONSLOW.

411
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,501
I'LL BE NICE TO HIM,
AS LONG AS I'M NOT
EATING KEBABS.

412
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:21,734
   I CAN'T COPE WITH
   YOUR HYACINTH AND A KEBAB.

413
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:27,767
  THIS IS MY GENTLEMAN FRIEND,
   MR. MARINOPOLOUS.

414
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:31,100
   THIS IS MY
BROTHER-IN-LAW, ONSLOW.

415
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,267
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
ONSLOW.

416
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,167
- YOU THINK SO?
- OH, YES.

417
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,567
  WAIT TILL YOU MEET
  OUR HYACINTH.

418
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,968
AND THIS IS
MY SISTER, DAISY.

419
00:22:39,968 --> 00:22:42,367
PLEASED TO MEET YOU,
I'M SURE.

420
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:44,133
  VERY NICE.

421
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,000
 OH, OH.

422
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,133
   OH.
   ( laughs )

423
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,767
WELL, WE OUGHT
TO BE OFF, THEN.

424
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,834
   SHALL WE,
   MR. MARINOPOLOUS?

425
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:58,734
SHE'S RIGHT.
HE'S VERY SMART.

426
00:22:58,734 --> 00:23:00,734
OH, NICE.

427
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:03,467
  YOU'VE KNOWN HIM TWO MINUTES
   AND HE'S BITING YOUR HAND.

428
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:07,234
BY THE WAY, MR. MARINOPOLOUS
WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

429
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,701
HIS LIMOUSINE'S HAVING
A GEAR-BOX CHANGE,

430
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:12,133
SO HE'S HAD TO BRING
HIS OTHER VEHICLE.

431
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:15,167
  - IS THERE ROOM
    FOR ALL OF US?
  - OH, ROOM TO SPARE.

432
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,868
COME ON, ONSLOW.
COME ON.

433
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:20,634
 COME ON.
 COME ON.

434
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:42,334
YOU LIKED HIM KISSING
YOUR HAND, DID YOU?

435
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:45,801
WAIT TILL MIDNIGHT, HE'LL
PROBABLY GO FOR YOUR NECK.

436
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,601
Hyacinth:
...TO MY DARLING MUSICAL
SHERIDAN COMING HOME.

437
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:54,767
HE AND EMMET WILL BE DUETING
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

438
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,567
   ANYONE FOR
   A PRUNE SURPRISE?

439
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,501
  THERE ARE PLENTY MORE.

440
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:01,434
NO-- WHAT?
OH!

441
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,234
  DOCTOR'S ORDERS I BELIEVE,
  NO, NO, TO YOU.

442
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,701
   WOULD YOU LIKE ONE
   OF THE SPECIALITIES
   OF THE HOUSE?

443
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:09,868
  I'M SO--  MY SHERIDAN SAYS
  THESE ARE WHAT I DO BEST.

444
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:12,567
  AND THEY ALWAYS GO
  LIKE HOTCAKES.

445
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:17,334
ANY CHANCE OF ANOTHER TOPPER
FOR YOUR DEVASTATING CREATURE?

446
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:19,334
  I THINK YOU'VE REACHED
  YOUR LIMIT, MAJOR.

447
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,734
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW ME
AROUND YOUR MARRIED QUARTERS?

448
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:23,734
   NOW, PULL YOURSELF
   TOGETHER, DEAR.

449
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:25,634
   YOU'RE WEARING
   THE REGIMENTAL TIE.

450
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,367
WELL, COME ON,
BE A SOLDIER'S GIRL!
ENLIST!

451
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,901
OH, GET--!

452
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:33,634
<i>I'LL GO, DEAR.

453
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:35,667
  I'LL GO!
  I'LL GO!

454
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:43,033
   HELLO, HYACINTH.
   YOU LOOK NICE.

455
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:53,868
HE CAN'T HELP IT.

456
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,734
 HIS LIMOUSINE'S HAVING
A GEARBOX CHANGE.

457
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,100
   ( laughs )

458
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,534
 JUST GO OUTSIDE
 AND TELL HIM

459
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,934
TO DRIVE ROUND THE BLOCK
UNTIL I GET RID OF MY GUESTS.

460
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:09,901
WHAT ABOUT MY COCKTAIL?

461
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,734
   THANK YOU SO MUCH
   FOR COMING.  GOODBYE.

462
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,767
  THERE--
  GOODBYE.

463
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:25,200
GOODBYE.

464
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,767
  AREN'T THEY'RE LOVELY?

465
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:34,434
YOU KNOW THERE ARE
SOME BEAUTIFUL ONES

466
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:37,501
   DOWN THE AVENUE,
   THAT WAY ON THE LEFT.

467
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,868
 BYE, ELIZABETH!

468
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:43,434
   BYE, EMMET.

469
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,434
  ( laughs )
  OF COURSE,
  I'VE GOT THE TIME.

470
00:25:49,434 --> 00:25:51,434
GOODBYE, MAJOR.

471
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:54,767
SO GLAD
YOU COULD COME!

472
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:58,167
   IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
  TO MY LITTLE PARTY.

473
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:04,901
   OH, BY THE WAY,
   HAVE YOU NOTICED
   OUR NEW FLATTINGS?

474
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:08,133
 THE LEAD CAME
FROM A DISUSED MONASTERY
 JUST OUTSIDE TOULOUSE.

475
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,400
   I HOPE YOU ENJOYED
MY PRAWN AND DAMSON DIP.

476
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,701
  I'LL LET YOU
HAVE THE RECIPE.

477
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:19,501
   MUCH OF THE CREDIT
  MUST GO TO MY FRIEND
AND NEIGHBOR ELIZABETH.

478
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:23,000
 BUT OF COURSE,
   SHE DID WORK UNDER
MY SUPERVISION.

479
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:28,601
 WHERE DOES RICHARD GET
  HIS RESERVES OF PURE COURAGE?

480
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,300
WELL, RICHARD HAS
A VERY PATIENT

481
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,501
AND KINDLY NATURE.

482
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:37,300
 ALSO, I THINK HE LIVES
 IN A QUIET LITTLE WORLD
   OF HIS OWN.

483
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,100
 HE DESERVES
 THE NOBEL PRIZE...

484
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,167
   FOR PEACE.

485
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,067
<i>YOU SEE THE ONE
I'M POINTING TO, THERE?

486
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:48,033
 - THAT ONE IN THE MIDDLE.
 - I THINK IT'S CALLED
   A FASIA JAPONICA.

487
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:50,701
YOU SHOULD SEE MINE
IN THE CONSERVATORY.
PLUMES THIS BIG.

488
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:53,534
I'M SURE IT WOULD
INTEREST YOUR GOOD LADY.

489
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:06,133
WELL, IT'S THE DAMN
GREEN-FLY, YOU KNOW?

490
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:08,667
I'M SURE THE MAJOR'S
ANXIOUS TO GET HOME.

491
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,767
OH, NO RUSH,
MY DEAR.

492
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:13,067
  THEY'RE A VERY
  CLOSE COUPLE.

493
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,968
  OF COURSE
  THEY'RE CLOSE.

494
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,133
  SHE HAS HIM
   ON A LEAD.

495
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:20,400
WELL, AT LEAST
THEIR MARRIAGE SURVIVES.

496
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,801
  MY HUSBAND
  WORKS ABROAD,

497
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:25,100
YOU'RE DIVORCED.
WHO ARE WE TO CRITICIZE?

498
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,467
   ANYWAY, IT'S NONE
   OF OUR BUSINESS.

499
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,367
   GOOD GRIEF,
   WOMAN,

500
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,667
THIS IS A PIECE OF PURE
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.

501
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,000
IF RICHARD CAN PUT UP
WITH HYACINTH,

502
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,601
 IT MEANS MAN
 IS INDESTRUCTIBLE--

503
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:40,133
NO LIMITS TO HIS
  POWERS OF ENDURANCE.

504
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:48,834
   I AM SORRY
 TO HURRY YOU,

505
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,901
 BUT I HAVE AN IMPORTANT

506
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:53,000
  LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT.

507
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,701
  WHAT DO YOU THINK
  OF LOST CONVERSIONS?

508
00:28:00,701 --> 00:28:04,834
OH, YOU MEAN
AN EXTRA BEDROOM, HUH?

509
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:08,868
  SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU
  CAN HIDE AWAY, EH?

510
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:12,267
HYACINTH,
WHY DOES THAT HEARSE

511
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:14,267
 KEEP GOING ROUND
 AND ROUND?

512
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:16,167
   I'LL TELL YOU LATER,

513
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:19,067
   BUT THIS MUCH
   I'LL TELL YOU NOW.

514
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:21,734
   THERE'S A PAIR
   OF CUFF-LINKS

515
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,234
   THAT'S GOING BACK
   TO THE JEWELER'S

516
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:26,634
   FIRST THING
   IN THE MORNING.

517
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:31,701
   HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
   ONSLOW.

518
