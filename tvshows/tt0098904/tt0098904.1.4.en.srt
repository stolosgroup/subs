1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,137
MOST MEN LIKE
WORKING ON THINGS--

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,939
TOOLS, OBJECTS,
FIXING THINGS--

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,774
THIS IS WHAT MEN ENJOY.

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,610
NOTICE WHEN A GUY'S
OUT IN HIS DRIVEWAY,

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:12,945
WORKING WITH TOOLS,

6
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,813
ALL MEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,182
ARE MAGNETICALLY DRAWN
TO THIS ACTIVITY?

8
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,419
THEY COME WANDERING OUT
OF THE HOUSE LIKE ZOMBIES.

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,124
MEN HEAR A DRILL,
IT'S LIKE A DOG WHISTLE--

10
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,258
JUST...

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,829
THEY GO RUNNING TO
THAT LIVING ROOM CURTAIN--

12
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,033
"HONEY, JIM'S WORKING
ON SOMETHING OVER THERE."

13
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,567
SO THEY RUN OVER.

14
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,837
NOW, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY
HELP THE GUY. NO.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,808
THEY JUST WANT
TO HANG AROUND THE AREA

16
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,944
WHERE WORK IS BEING DONE.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,815
THAT'S WHAT MEN
WANT TO DO.

18
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,850
WE WANT TO WATCH THE GUY.

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,255
WE WANT TO TALK TO HIM,
ASK HIM DUMB QUESTIONS--

20
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,291
"WHAT ARE YOU USING,
A PHILLIPS HEAD THERE?"

21
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,796
YOU KNOW, WE FEEL INVOLVED.

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,798
THAT'S WHY,
AT CONSTRUCTION SITES,

23
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,300
THEY NEED THOSE FENCES
AROUND IT.

24
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,270
THAT'S JUST
TO KEEP THE MEN OUT.

25
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,305
THEY CUT HOLES FOR US

26
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,141
SO WE CAN SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

27
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,976
UNLESS THEY CUT
THOSE HOLES,

28
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,778
WE ARE CLIMBING
THOSE FENCES.

29
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,146
RIGHT OVER THERE.

30
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,616
WHAT ARE YOU USING,
THE STEEL GIRDERS DOWN HERE?

31
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,585
YEAH, THAT'LL HOLD.

32
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,542
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
COLUMBIA TRISTAR
DOMESTIC TELEVISION

33
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:39,721
I HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING.

34
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:42,123
HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

35
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:44,125
EVERYTHING
WAS GOING SO WELL.

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,827
I HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING.

37
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:47,796
YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.

38
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,131
I TOLD HER
I LIKED HER.

39
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,300
WHY DID I TELL
HER I LIKE HER?

40
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:53,835
I HAVE
THIS COMPULSION

41
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:56,338
TO TELL WOMEN
HOW I FEEL.

42
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,640
I LIKE YOU. I
DON'T TELL YOU.

43
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:01,409
WE CAN ONLY
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

44
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:03,378
I'M OUT
OF THE PICTURE.

45
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:04,913
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

46
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:07,415
HA HA!
MATTER OF TIME NOW.

47
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,917
YOU'RE IMAGINING
THIS. REALLY.

48
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,353
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

49
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:16,391
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

50
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:19,894
WHEN THAT FLOSS
CAME FLYING
OUT OF MY POCKET.

51
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:22,630
WHAT FLOSS? WHEN?

52
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:24,966
DURING
THE INTERMISSION
OF THE PLAY,

53
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:29,437
I WAS BUYING HER A
CONTAINER OF ORANGE
DRINK FOR $5.00.

54
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,973
I REACH INTO
MY POCKET TO PAY,

55
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:34,909
THERE'S THIS
GREEN FLOSS HANGING
FROM MY FINGERS.

56
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,077
AH, MINT.

57
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:37,112
OF COURSE.

58
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:39,114
SO I'M LOOKING
AT IT.

59
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:42,417
I LOOK UP AND SEE
SHE'S LOOKING AT IT.

60
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,452
OUR EYES LOCK.

61
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:46,755
IT WAS
A HORRIBLE MOMENT.

62
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:47,822
I JUST...

63
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,760
SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

64
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:53,328
SHE SAW THE FLOSS.

65
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,798
YOU PANICKED,
AND YOU TOLD HER
YOU LIKED HER.

66
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:59,334
WITHOUT THAT FLOSS
IN MY POCKET,

67
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:03,071
I'D BE CRAWLING
AROUND HER BEDROOM,
LOOKING FOR MY GLASSES.

68
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:05,373
YOU SURE FLOSS
WAS THE CATALYST?

69
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:06,941
YES, I AM.

70
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:10,645
YOU DON'T THINK
IT HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT?

71
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,213
YOU DON'T LIKE THIS?

72
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:16,084
LOOKS LIKE YOUR BELT
IS DIGESTING
A SMALL ANIMAL.

73
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:19,421
THEY GOT
A CURE FOR CANCER.

74
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:22,424
SEE, IT'S ALL
BIG BUSINESS.

75
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,893
OH, HEY, JERRY
JUST WALKED IN.

76
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:27,429
HI, GEORGE!

77
00:03:27,463 --> 00:03:29,731
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
TAKE MY NUMBER.

78
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:33,902
UH, IT'S 555-8643.

79
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:37,238
OK. HERE HE IS.

80
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:38,907
WHO IS IT?

81
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:40,408
TAKE IT.

82
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:41,509
WHO IS IT?

83
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,178
IT'S FOR YOU.

84
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:45,413
HELLO?

85
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,449
OH, HI, JOEL.

86
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:49,918
NO, I WAS
OUT OF TOWN.

87
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:51,453
I JUST GOT BACK.

88
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:52,954
KRAMER DOESN'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

89
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,422
HE'S JUST
MY NEIGHBOR.

90
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:56,925
UH, NOTHING MUCH.

91
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,860
TUESDAY?

92
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:00,562
UM, TUESDAY, NO,

93
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:02,363
I'M MEETING...
SOMEBODY.

94
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:05,200
UH, WEDNESDAY?

95
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,935
WEDNESDAY'S OK.

96
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,239
ALL RIGHT,
I'M A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

97
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:12,907
CAN WE TALK
WEDNESDAY MORNING?

98
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:16,411
OK. YEAH, RIGHT.
THANKS, BYE.

99
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:19,414
WHY PUT ME ON
THE PHONE WITH HIM?

100
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:22,417
I HATE JUST BEING
HANDED A PHONE.

101
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,819
HE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

102
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,888
MAYBE I DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK
TO HIM.

103
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:27,889
WHY NOT?

104
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,457
HE BOTHERS ME.

105
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:32,494
I DON'T ANSWER
THE PHONE
BECAUSE OF HIM.

106
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:34,929
HE'S TURNED ME
INTO A SCREENER.

107
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,632
NOW I GOT TO
SEE HIM ON WEDNESDAY.

108
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,435
WE HAD TICKETS
TO THE KNICK GAME
WEDNESDAY.

109
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,604
WHAT HAPPENED?
WE'RE NOT GOING?

110
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:46,141
WE'RE GOING.
THAT'S NEXT WEDNESDAY.

111
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:48,910
OH. WHO IS
THIS GUY?

112
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:50,445
HIS NAME'S JOEL HORNECK.

113
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,281
HE LIVED NEAR ME
WHEN I GREW UP.

114
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:56,651
HE HAD A PING-PONG TABLE.
WE WERE FRIENDS.

115
00:04:56,685 --> 00:05:01,122
SHOULD I SUFFER
ALL MY LIFE BECAUSE
I LIKE PING-PONG?

116
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,657
I WAS 10!

117
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:05,393
I WOULD'VE BEEN
FRIENDS WITH STALIN

118
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:08,930
IF HE HAD
A PING-PONG TABLE.

119
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:12,367
HE'S SO SELF-INVOLVED.

120
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,369
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

121
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:15,870
[RING]

122
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,338
THAT'S FOR ME.

123
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:20,909
KRAMERICA INDUSTRIES.

124
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:22,944
OH, HI, MARK.

125
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:26,447
NO, NO. FORGET THAT.
I GOT A BETTER IDEA--

126
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,917
A PIZZA PLACE WHERE
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN PIE.

127
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,452
CAN YOU CONDUCT
YOUR BUSINESS...
ELSEWHERE?

128
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,455
I'M TALKING ABOUT
A WHOLE CHAIN OF THEM.

129
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,657
YEAH.

130
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,930
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU BOTHER
WITH THIS PING-PONG GUY.

131
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:44,399
HE'S BEEN CALLING
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

132
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,967
I NEVER CALLED HIM.

133
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,970
HE'S GOT
THE ATTENTION SPAN
OF A 5-YEAR-OLD.

134
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:53,441
I MAKE UP THINGS
JUST TO SEE IF HE'S
PAYING ATTENTION.

135
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:56,611
WHY DO YOU SPEND TIME
WITH THIS GUY?

136
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:58,947
WHAT CAN I DO--
BREAK UP?

137
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:01,849
TELL HIM WE'RE NOT RIGHT
FOR EACH OTHER?

138
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:03,551
IT'S A GUY.

139
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:06,054
WITH A WOMAN
THERE'S A PRECEDENT.

140
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:08,456
THE RELATIONSHIP
SOURS, YOU END IT.

141
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,058
NO, NO, NO, NO.

142
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:13,061
APPROACH THIS
AS IF HE WAS
A WOMAN.

143
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:14,262
BREAK UP?

144
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:15,663
ABSOLUTELY.

145
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,065
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

146
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:18,333
THE TRUTH?

147
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:28,676
SO MY SHRINK
WANTS MY MOTHER IN
FOR A SESSION.

148
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:30,178
THIS GUY
IS BRILLIANT.

149
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:32,513
LENNY BRUCE
USED TO GO TO HIM,

150
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:34,349
AND, I THINK,
UH, GERALDO.

151
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:36,985
I READ THE LENNY BRUCE
BIOGRAPHY.

152
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,520
I THOUGHT IT WAS--

153
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:40,989
HEY, WE'RE
STARVING HERE!

154
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:41,990
INTERESTING--

155
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,791
WE'VE WAITED 10 MINUTES.

156
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:45,293
THAT HE WOULD...

157
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:51,099
DO YOU THINK
I NEED A HAIRCUT?

158
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:52,500
ARE YOU READY?

159
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:55,236
I'LL HAVE
THE EGG SALAD
ON WHOLE WHEAT.

160
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,272
LET ME ASK
A QUESTION.

161
00:06:57,306 --> 00:07:01,209
THIS TURKEY SANDWICH--
IS THAT REAL TURKEY
OR TURKEY ROLL?

162
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:04,145
I DON'T WANT
PROCESSED TURKEY.
I HATE IT.

163
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:06,581
I THINK
IT'S REAL TURKEY.

164
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,549
THERE'S A BIRD
IN BACK?

165
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,585
NO, THERE'S NO BIRD,
BUT--

166
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:13,621
HOW DO YOU KNOW
FOR SURE?

167
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:17,058
YOU GO IN THE BACK
AND FIND OUT. OK?

168
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,561
UNBELIEVABLE.

169
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:26,634
HOW CAN YOU TALK
TO SOMEONE LIKE THAT?

170
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,169
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

171
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,505
YOU LIKE TURKEY ROLL?

172
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,942
LISTEN, JOEL,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

173
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:39,113
WAIT. YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHO I RAN INTO.

174
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:41,683
HOWARD METRO.
HOWARD METRO.

175
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:44,485
HE ASKED ME
IF I STILL SAW YOU.

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,788
I SAID, "SURE,
WE'RE GREAT FRIENDS."

177
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:50,058
ANYWAY,
HOWARD SAYS HELLO.

178
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,896
LISTEN, JOEL...

179
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,266
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD SEE
EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

180
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:01,002
WHAT?

181
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:03,671
THIS FRIENDSHIP,
IT'S NOT WORKING.

182
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,840
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

183
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:09,644
WE'RE JUST NOT SUITED
TO BE FRIENDS.

184
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:11,612
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

185
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,147
YOU'RE A NICE GUY,

186
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:15,483
BUT WE HAVEN'T
ANYTHING IN COMMON.

187
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:17,051
WHAT DID I DO?

188
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,387
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I DID.

189
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:20,955
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.

190
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:22,724
IT'S NOT YOU,
IT'S ME.

191
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:27,061
IT'S--THIS IS
VERY DIFFICULT.

192
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:29,063
I CALL YOU TOO MUCH.

193
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,732
YOU'RE A BUSY GUY.

194
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,533
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

195
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:36,504
YOU'RE ONE
OF THE FEW PEOPLE
I CAN TALK TO.

196
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:39,407
LOOK, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

197
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,909
I ALWAYS TELL EVERYBODY
ABOUT YOU,

198
00:08:41,944 --> 00:08:44,412
TELL EVERYBODY
TO "GO SEE HIS SHOW!"

199
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:48,850
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

200
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,151
I KNOW.

201
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:52,019
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

202
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:54,689
BEST FRIEND?
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO YOUR APARTMENT.

203
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:57,358
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

204
00:08:57,393 --> 00:08:59,761
OK, OK,
FORGET IT. IT'S OK.

205
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:01,162
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

206
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:02,230
MEAN WHAT?

207
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:04,766
I'VE BEEN UNDER
LOTS OF STRESS.

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,702
<i>YOU'VE</i> BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS.

209
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:11,139
CAN WE JUST FORGET
THE WHOLE THING
EVER HAPPENED?

210
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:12,673
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

211
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,243
I TOOK IT OUT
ON YOU.

212
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:17,645
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.
STILL FRIENDS.

213
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:21,282
OK, LOOK.
I TELL YOU WHAT.

214
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:22,950
I GOT KNICK TICKETS.

215
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:23,985
THIS WEDNESDAY.

216
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:25,953
GREAT SEATS
BEHIND THE BENCH.

217
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:27,388
COME ON.

218
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,090
TONIGHT?

219
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,826
NEXT WEDNESDAY.

220
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,495
IF IT WAS TONIGHT,
I WOULD'VE SAID
TONIGHT.

221
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,998
YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO GO?

222
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,068
YES.

223
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,306
OK.

224
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,408
HERE, TAKE THESE.

225
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:48,843
OK. GREAT.

226
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:51,712
THAT WOULD BE--
THAT'D BE GREAT.

227
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:53,815
SO, NEXT WEDNESDAY.

228
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,516
NEXT WEDNESDAY.

229
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:58,519
SAY, WHERE IS
THAT WAITRESS?

230
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,420
HEY!

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,074
iSubDB.com - fast, modern, simple
Subtitles search by drag & drop

232
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:18,005
SHE CALLS ME AT THE OFFICE,
SHE SAYS, "WE HAVE TO TALK."

233
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,341
OH, THE FOUR
WORST WORDS

234
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,343
IN THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE.

235
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:25,646
THAT OR
"WHOSE BRA IS THIS?"

236
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,348
HMM, THAT IS WORSE.

237
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:29,851
WE ORDER LUNCH,
AND WE'RE TALKING.

238
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:32,820
FINALLY, SHE BLURTS OUT
HOW IT'S NOT WORKING.

239
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:33,821
REALLY.

240
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,490
AS SHE'S SAYING THIS,

241
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:39,360
I'M THINKING, GREAT.
THE RELATIONSHIP'S OVER
BUT EGG SALAD'S COMING.

242
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:43,331
SO I HAVE A DECISION--
DO I WALK OR EAT?

243
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:45,066
YOU ATE.

244
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,169
SAT THERE
FOR 20 MINUTES
CHEWING,

245
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:49,704
STARING AT EACH OTHER

246
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:51,706
IN A DEFUNCT
RELATIONSHIP.

247
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,742
SOMEONE SAYS "GET
OUT OF MY LIFE,"

248
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:56,444
AND THAT
DOESN'T AFFECT
YOUR APPETITE?

249
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:58,279
EVER HAD
THEIR EGG SALAD?

250
00:10:58,313 --> 00:10:59,447
UNBELIEVABLE.
UNBELIEVABLE.

251
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:01,949
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE
IS UNBELIEVABLE.

252
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:05,253
I PICKED UP THE CHECK.
SHE DIDN'T EVEN OFFER.

253
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:06,821
SHE ENDED IT.

254
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:10,291
AT LEAST SHE
COULD'VE SENT ME OFF
WITH A SANDWICH.

255
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:13,094
HOW MUCH COULD YOU
POSSIBLY HAVE IN THERE?

256
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:15,162
LOOK, IT'S MY MONEY.

257
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:17,665
SHOULD I THROW IT
OUT THE WINDOW?

258
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,434
I KNOW A GUY
WHO VACATIONED
ON HIS CHANGE.

259
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:23,304
YEAH?
WHERE'D HE GO--
TO AN ARCADE?

260
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:25,773
THAT'S FUNNY.
YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY.

261
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:27,341
COME ON, MOVE UP.

262
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,843
OH, GREAT.
EWING'S HURT.

263
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:31,345
HOW LONG
WILL HE BE OUT?

264
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,947
A COUPLE DAYS,
BUT...

265
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:34,115
OH, SHEESH.

266
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,316
OH, GOD.

267
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,553
I GOT SCARED THERE--
THE KNICKS WITHOUT EWING.

268
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:41,522
LISTEN, GEORGE,
A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH THE GAME.

269
00:11:41,557 --> 00:11:42,590
WHAT?

270
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:46,294
YESTERDAY,
I KIND OF, UH...

271
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:47,328
WHAT?

272
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:51,432
I GAVE YOUR TICKET
TO HORNECK.

273
00:11:56,338 --> 00:11:57,805
YOU WHAT?

274
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,776
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
I HAD TO GIVE IT
TO HORNECK.

275
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:04,712
NAH.

276
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:09,383
MY TICKET?

277
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:11,619
YOU GAVE MY TICKET
TO HORNECK?

278
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:12,787
MOVE UP.

279
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:14,655
WHY GIVE HIM
MY TICKET?

280
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,290
YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM.

281
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:18,759
COME ON.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

282
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:20,795
I HAD TO DO IT.

283
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,297
CAN YOU CHANGE THIS
INTO BILLS?

284
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,299
SIR, WE CAN'T
DO THAT.

285
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,268
YOU WANT TO GO
WITH HIM?

286
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:28,469
IT'S OK.

287
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:31,238
NO. I DON'T EVEN
KNOW THE GUY!

288
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,474
THEY DID THIS
FOR ME BEFORE.

289
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:35,977
YOU TAKE THESE.
ROLL THEM YOURSELF.

290
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,813
YOU WANT ME TO ROLL
6,000 OF THESE?

291
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:41,248
WHAT? SHOULD
I QUIT MY JOB?

292
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:44,318
I'VE HEARD THE EXPRESSION

293
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:47,088
LAUGHING ALL THE WAY
TO THE BANK.

294
00:12:47,122 --> 00:12:50,291
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
ACTUALLY DO IT.

295
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,126
AND THOSE BANK LINES.

296
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,097
I HATE IT WHEN THERE'S
NOBODY IN LINE AT ALL.

297
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:57,531
THE BANK IS EMPTY,

298
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,768
AND YOU STILL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THE LITTLE MAZE.

299
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:03,771
GET SOME CHEESE FOR ME.
I'M NEARLY THERE.

300
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:06,540
I'D LIKE A REWARD
FOR THIS, PLEASE.

301
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:08,576
32, 33...

302
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,577
GEORGE.

303
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:12,580
NOT NOW. 33...

304
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:13,614
30...

305
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,082
COULD YOU
STOP COUNTING?

306
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:17,218
OOH, OOH, OOH...

307
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:19,987
WHAT?

308
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:23,591
I'M SORRY.
I'LL GIVE YOU $50
FOR THE JUG.

309
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,593
YEAH, SURE.
KEEP YOUR MONEY.

310
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:27,628
THEN I WON'T GO
EITHER.

311
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,597
I'LL GIVE HIM
BOTH TICKETS.

312
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:30,598
AW, GEE...

313
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:31,732
GO. GO!

314
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:40,007
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GO.

315
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,742
HE WAS REALLY CRYING?

316
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,277
I GAVE HIM TISSUES.

317
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:44,745
I'LL CALL
HIS MACHINE

318
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,116
AND MAKE SOME EXCUSE
WHY I CAN'T GO
TO THE GAME.

319
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:50,151
WAIT, WAIT.

320
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:51,652
IF YOU'RE
GOING TO LIE,

321
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:54,121
TELL HIM YOU LOST
BOTH TICKETS.

322
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:55,690
THEN WE CAN GO.

323
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:58,826
GEORGE, THE MAN WEPT.

324
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,762
OH, HEY, GUYS.

325
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,265
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS PIZZA IDEA

326
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:05,700
IS REALLY GOING
TO HAPPEN.

327
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:11,572
THIS IS THE THING WHERE
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN PIZZA?

328
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,107
WE GIVE YOU DOUGH.

329
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,009
YOU SMASH IT,
POUND IT,

330
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:16,811
FLING IT IN THE AIR.

331
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:19,613
YOU PUT YOUR SAUCE,
YOUR CHEESE,

332
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:23,784
AND THEN YOU SLIDE
IT INTO THE OVEN.

333
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,853
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW.

334
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:29,090
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE
SHOVING THEIR ARMS

335
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:30,991
INTO A 600-DEGREE OVEN!

336
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,626
IT'S ALL SUPERVISED.

337
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:33,894
OH. WELL...

338
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:37,298
ALL OF IT!
YOU WANT TO INVEST?

339
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,800
MY MONEY'S
TIED UP IN CHANGE.

340
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,802
PEOPLE REALLY
WANT TO MAKE

341
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,304
THEIR OWN
PIZZA PIE!

342
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:46,707
I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.

343
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:50,077
I JUST NEVER--
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE,

344
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:53,080
IN ANY WALK OF LIFE,
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE,

345
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:56,050
WANTING TO MAKE
THEIR OWN PIZZA PIE.

346
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:58,285
BUT THAT'S ME. OK?

347
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
THAT'S YOU.

348
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,521
ALL RIGHT?

349
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,523
JUST CHECKING
WITH YOU GUYS.

350
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:04,024
THIS WILL
BE BIG.

351
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,961
I JUST WANT TO--
OK. UH-HUH.

352
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:12,867
ONE DAY, YOU'LL BEG ME
TO MAKE YOUR OWN PIE.

353
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:21,909
JOEL, THIS IS JERRY.
I HOPE YOU GET THIS
BEFORE--

354
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,478
HI. OH, YOU JUST CAME IN.

355
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:28,482
LISTEN, UH, I CAN'T
MAKE IT TO THE GAME TONIGHT.

356
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:31,285
I, UH, HAVE TO TUTOR
MY NEPHEW.

357
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,088
YEAH, HE'S GOT
AN EXAM TOMORROW.

358
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:35,623
GEOMETRY.

359
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,292
YOU KNOW,
TRAPEZOID, RHOMBUS.

360
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,795
ANYWAY, LISTEN,
YOU TAKE THE TICKETS.

361
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,797
THEY'RE AT
THE WILL-CALL WINDOW.

362
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,766
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

363
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:47,768
WE'LL TALK NEXT WEEK, OK?

364
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:50,437
YEAH. YEAH, I DON'T--FINE.

365
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:51,639
FINE, BYE.

366
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:56,143
TRAPEZOIDS?

367
00:15:56,178 --> 00:16:00,181
I KNOW. I'M REALLY
RUNNING OUT OF EXCUSES
WITH THIS GUY.

368
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:03,017
I NEED SOME KIND
OF EXCUSE ROLODEX.

369
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:11,625
LET'S GO DO SOMETHING.

370
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,093
WANT TO GET
SOME FOOD?

371
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:14,228
WHERE?

372
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:16,564
I DON'T CARE.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

373
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:21,001
LET'S GO
TO ONE OF THOSE
CAPPUCCINO PLACES.

374
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:23,270
AND DO WHAT, TALK?

375
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,307
WE CAN TALK.

376
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:30,077
I'LL GO IF I DON'T
HAVE TO TALK.

377
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,413
THEN WE'LL
JUST SIT THERE.

378
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:35,349
OK, I'M GOING TO CHECK
MY MACHINE FIRST.

379
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:42,723
"PICKING SOMEONE UP
AT AIRPORT, JURY DUTY,

380
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:44,225
"WAITING
FOR CABLE COMPANY."

381
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,861
OK, JUST HAND
THAT OVER, PLEASE.

382
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,395
OH, WHAT IS THIS?

383
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,364
IT'S A LIST
OF EXCUSES

384
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:51,932
FOR THAT GUY HORNECK

385
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,935
WHO'S AT THE GAME TONIGHT
WITH MY TICKETS.

386
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,872
I HAVE THAT
SO IN CASE HE CALLS,

387
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:01,775
I JUST CONSULT IT,
AND I DON'T
HAVE TO SEE HIM.

388
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,776
OH, GOD.

389
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:04,245
I NEED IT.

390
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:06,780
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

391
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,782
I GOT SOME FOR YOU.

392
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,751
I DON'T NEED ANY MORE.

393
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:12,720
NO, THESE ARE GOOD.
LISTEN.

394
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:14,722
"YOU RAN OUT
OF UNDERWEAR

395
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:16,790
AND CAN'T
LEAVE THE HOUSE."

396
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:17,992
VERY FUNNY.

397
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:20,895
HOW ABOUT,
YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED

398
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:22,863
AS A MULTIPLE
PERSONALITY?

399
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:24,365
YOU'RE NOT EVEN YOU.

400
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,933
YOU'RE DAN.

401
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:30,938
I'M DAN. CAN I HAVE
MY LIST BACK, PLEASE?

402
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,340
HERE, HERE.

403
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,810
GOD, JERRY SEINFELD,
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

404
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,812
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
INFANTILE.

405
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:41,215
OH!

406
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:42,950
WHAT CAN I DO?

407
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:45,252
DEAL WITH IT.
BE A MAN.

408
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,387
OH, NO.

409
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,892
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I'D RATHER LIE
THE REST OF MY LIFE,

410
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:53,861
THAN GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

411
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:56,030
HE WAS CRYING--

412
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:58,899
TEARS, ACCOMPANIED
BY MUCUS.

413
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,770
YOU MADE A MAN CRY?

414
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:05,272
I NEVER MADE
A MAN CRY.

415
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:09,643
I KICKED A GUY
IN THE GROIN ONCE,
AND HE DIDN'T CRY.

416
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:11,045
I GOT THE CAB.

417
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:14,949
A COUPLE OF TOUGH MONKEYS.

418
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:18,886
HI, ELAINE.

419
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,355
YOU MISSED A GREAT
GAME TONIGHT.

420
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:22,389
GAME?

421
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,391
KNICK GAME.
HORNECK TOOK ME.

422
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:26,493
TWO ROWS
BEHIND THE BENCH.

423
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:29,396
WE WERE GETTING
HIT BY SWEAT.

424
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,899
WAIT. HOW DOES
HORNECK KNOW YOU?

425
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,902
LAST WEEK, WHEN I
GAVE YOU THE PHONE.

426
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:37,871
HE'S REALLY INTO
MY PIZZA PLACE IDEA.

427
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,373
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

428
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,508
WHAT PIZZA PLACE IDEA?

429
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:43,577
YOU MAKE
YOUR OWN PIE.

430
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:47,781
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GREAT IDEA.
IT WOULD BE FUN.

431
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:48,782
KRAMER!

432
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:49,783
YEAH!

433
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:50,918
PERFECT.

434
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:52,019
HEY!

435
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:55,823
OK, UH, WHO WANTS
MEAT LOAF?

436
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,292
NO, THANKS.
NO, NO.

437
00:18:58,326 --> 00:19:01,228
NO? IT'S
GOING TO BE HOT
IN A MINUTE.

438
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:04,231
SO, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TUTORING
YOUR NEPHEW.

439
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:05,866
OH, WE FINISHED EARLY.

440
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,701
I'LL BET.

441
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:10,170
SO ARE YOU GOING
TO INTRODUCE ME

442
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:12,239
TO YOUR NEPHEW?

443
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:14,675
ELAINE BENES,
THIS IS
JOEL HORNECK.

444
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:15,709
HI.

445
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:18,879
WHOA, NELSON.
THIS IS ELAINE.

446
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,382
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
SPLIT UP.

447
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,883
WE'RE
STILL FRIENDS.

448
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,051
HMM.

449
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:26,887
SO...THANKS AGAIN
FOR THOSE TICKETS,

450
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:29,890
BUT NEXT WEEK,
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU.

451
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:32,393
HOW ABOUT NEXT TUESDAY?
YOU, TOO.

452
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:35,396
OH, NO, NO,
TUESDAY'S NO GOOD

453
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,065
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT, UH,
CHOIR PRACTICE.

454
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:41,402
RIGHT. I FORGOT
ABOUT CHOIR.

455
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:44,238
WE'RE--WE'RE DOING
THAT, UH, EVENING

456
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:46,206
OF EASTERN EUROPEAN
NATIONAL ANTHEMS.

457
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:47,441
RIGHT.

458
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:51,178
YOU KNOW,
THE WALL BEING DOWN
AND EVERYTHING.

459
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:53,180
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THURSDAY NIGHT?

460
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,582
I MEAN, THEY'RE PLAYING
THE SONICS.

461
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:56,650
HMM.

462
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,018
THURSDAY IS NOT GOOD

463
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:00,687
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT
TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL

464
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:04,191
TO SEE IF WE QUALIFY
AS THOSE ORGAN DONORS.

465
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:06,994
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD TRY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

466
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:09,163
YOU REALLY SHOULD.

467
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,200
WELL, LET'S JUST
TAKE A LOOK HERE.

468
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:15,335
41 HOME GAMES.

469
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,838
SATURDAY NIGHT
WE'VE GOT THE MAVERICKS.

470
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:20,374
IF NOT,
NEXT TUESDAY--LAKERS.

471
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:22,309
YOU GOT TO LIKE
MAGIC, RIGHT?

472
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:24,244
LET'S SEE.
ON THE ROAD,

473
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:27,181
ON THE ROAD,
BACK, BACK ON THE 14th

474
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:28,615
THEY PLAY THE BULLS.

475
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,517
YOU CAN'T MISS AIR JORDAN.

476
00:20:32,353 --> 00:20:35,222
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
COLUMBIA TRISTAR
DOMESTIC TELEVISION

477
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:41,196
I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THERE ARE CERTAIN FRIENDS,

478
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:42,531
THEY'RE ALWAYS YOUR FRIENDS,

479
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:44,400
AND YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

480
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:46,902
YOU SEE THEM,
YOU DON'T WANT TO.

481
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:49,905
YOU DON'T CALL THEM,
THEY CALL YOU.

482
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:52,808
YOU DON'T CALL BACK,
THEY CALL AGAIN.

483
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:55,244
TO GET THROUGH
TALKING WITH PEOPLE

484
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:57,746
YOU HAVE NOTHING
IN COMMON WITH,

485
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,749
PRETEND YOU'RE HOSTING
YOUR OWN LITTLE TALK SHOW.

486
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:03,719
PRETEND THERE'S A LITTLE
DESK AND CHAIR THERE,

487
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,254
AND YOU INTERVIEW THEM.

488
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:08,757
THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAY,

489
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,727
"IT'S BEEN GREAT
HAVING YOU ON THE SHOW.

490
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:13,529
WE'RE OUT OF TIME."
