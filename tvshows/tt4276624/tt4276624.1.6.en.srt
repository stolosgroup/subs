1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,243
This is only a casing,
used to contain a Sentry.

2
00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:07,400
Once the Sentry is out of
the shell, it seeks a host.

3
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:11,200
Then uses that host
to gather information

4
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:12,939
about whatever planet it's on.

5
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:14,835
Once it's gathered all the
information required,

6
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:16,703
it uploads it to Brainiac,

7
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:19,270
and leaves the host body for dead.

8
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,822
My mom's not coming home, is she?

9
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:23,451
No, sweetheart, she's not.

10
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:25,218
Val, I'm headed your way...

11
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:27,155
Tell me what you know about Brainiac.

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,062
- Who are you?
- I didn't bring you here

13
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:30,548
to ask me questions.

14
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,554
I need you to tell me how
to get us out of here.

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,040
We go straight.

16
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,731
Whoa, hey, friends, friends.

17
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:43,865
This is a sacred place.
You do not belong here.

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,887
Commander Zod, it is by Rao's word

19
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,927
that you are hereby eby
chard with treason.

20
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:49,398
I have come to make you an offer

21
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:52,218
- that could save Lyta's life.
- For the cost of what?

22
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:54,123
Pledge your support for my father.

23
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:57,618
What makes you think Jayna
is ready to join us

24
00:00:57,643 --> 00:01:00,157
and go against everything
House Zod stands for?

25
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:02,105
Our plans rest on Jayna's militarism...

26
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,748
Oh, you think I don't know that?

27
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,167
Tell us where you took
that Cythonnite woman.

28
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,731
She holds the key to stopping Brainiac.

29
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,238
Stay here.

30
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:22,517
- Who gave you that?
- You did.

31
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,024
I'm your son.

32
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:31,294
You made me work for this
when I was just a boy.

33
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,993
Then you put it on me, and said,

34
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,558
we kneel for no one.

35
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,003
This...

36
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:43,375
It can't be. It's impossible.

37
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:49,748
Don't listen to a goddamn
word this asshole says, Seg.

38
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,126
- You know him?
- I know who he is.

39
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:55,969
In my time, we all know who he is.

40
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,474
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

41
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,976
General Zod.

42
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,128
This son of a bitch is
Superman's greatest enemy.

43
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:07,383
So trust me on this, we
need to kill him now.

before time began,

47
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:37,062
Almighty Rao, who kindled the
sun and created all life,

48
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,990
I submit to thee.

49
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:42,650
What makes you think
Rao created all life?

50
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:45,922
Because I have faith.

51
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,629
My mother told me faith's a journey

52
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:53,607
that begins in hope and ends in
belief of what you can't see,

53
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,643
but know to be true.

54
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:58,329
Or it could be considered a delusion.

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,719
The sign of a species not
given to clear thought.

56
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,050
Is this a test?

57
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:13,571
Yes.

58
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,963
Do you think my faith
isn't strong enough?

59
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,932
What are you testing?

60
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,197
Your worthiness.

61
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:29,788
Your city's, your world's.

62
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,360
Do you deserve eternal life?

63
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:36,699
What happens to those
who aren't worthy?

64
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:43,958
I think you know the opposite
of eternal life, Ona.

65
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:02,857
Killing a man directly runs
the risk of witnesses.

66
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:06,082
A bomb, though, that can
be attributed to anyone.

67
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:09,444
Tonight, the Voice of Rao
closes the Nova Cycle festival

68
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,918
with the Ascension Ceremony
at the Hall of Justice.

69
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:15,658
It's private, so there will
be minimal collateral damage

70
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:17,643
and we can rig the
explosive ahead of time.

71
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,151
I hope you've chosen your support

72
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,284
among the Guilded carefully.

73
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,800
Oh, we know who will back
us when the time comes.

74
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,725
- What about you?
- There's only one left

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,698
to complete the team. Commander Dev-Em.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,164
He's used to working with the
Voice's security detail,

77
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,112
and the Voice is used to him.

78
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:36,480
How sure are you that he'll commit?

79
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,832
The Ems are a traditional house.

80
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:40,524
Dev goes through the motions of Raoism,

81
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:41,846
but it's not where his heart lies.

82
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,301
That's with my daughter.

83
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,773
As for his loyalty, that's with me.

84
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:48,730
- I hope you're right.
- And I hope you're ready.

85
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,887
Come now, you're obviously
not built for this.

86
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,969
You're only resting
that weapon on my chest

87
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:04,362
to stop your hands from shaking.

88
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:06,051
Go on, say one more word.

89
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,169
And you'll see exactly
what I'm built for.

90
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,088
All right, all right.
Just take it easy.

91
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:13,375
- And start explaining.
- This sorry bastard

92
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,737
has travelled back through
time to get here.

93
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:19,484
I don't know how, but
it's not hard to see why.

94
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:23,077
He's obviously working with
Brainiac to destroy Krypton.

95
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,896
Why would I destroy our world?

96
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm here to save Krypton.

97
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,336
Oh, so it's just a coincidence

98
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,105
you're here at the
same time as Brainiac?

99
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,057
Of course not. History tells us this

100
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,953
is when that creature
ripped Kandor City

101
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,778
away from the planet and made
it part of his collection.

102
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,781
I'm here to prevent that tragedy.

103
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:43,166
I'm confused, you're
saying that Brainiac

104
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:44,730
isn't from the future?

105
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:46,364
That's exactly what I'm saying.

106
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,266
Brainiac didn't travel through
time to launch this attack.

107
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,040
This is what he's always done.

108
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:55,351
No, that...

109
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,067
That can't be right.

110
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:02,537
It's elementary Kryptonian history.

111
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,864
The beginning of the end
for our civilization.

112
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,123
Brainiac takes Kandor City,

113
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:09,714
which destabilizes Krypton's core.

114
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,803
Causing the planet to
explode in 200 years.

115
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:18,857
The planet explodes in 200 years?

116
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,598
That, that, that's insane.

117
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:25,314
- That's insane.
- Wait.

118
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,374
Your friend here didn't mention that?

119
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,011
It's true, isn't it?

120
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,530
That's not the point.

121
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:42,001
This whole time, you knew
and you said noth...

122
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,415
Seg, you cannot trust this man.

123
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,110
Oh, so he's lying?

124
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:46,726
But you've confirmed he's a Zod,

125
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:49,157
- and he's from your time...
- And if he's really your son,

126
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:52,032
then I'm sorry, but
believing anything he says

127
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:55,151
is a mistake. You got
to trust me on this.

128
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,854
He's here to destroy Krypton,

129
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,936
and make sure Superman is never born.

130
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,644
No Zod would ever destroy Krypton.

131
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:07,235
It's our duty to defend
our city, and our world.

132
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:10,182
Our duty, and...

133
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:13,077
Our proud privilege.

134
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,766
Oh, this is some grade-A,
premium bullshit.

135
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,531
Seg.

136
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:23,262
You know you can trust me, don't you?

137
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,105
Well?

138
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,902
Hey, man.

139
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:50,144
Seg!

140
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:55,683
Cuff them both.

141
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,365
Come on.

142
00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:59,397
Seg...

143
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:02,584
Oh, I think there's some
explaining to be done.

144
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,468
All right.

145
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,407
You first.

146
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:16,448
You said you're here to stop Brainiac,

147
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:19,876
that you've studied him.
Let's hear the plan.

148
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:20,984
Firstly, you have to understand

149
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:23,156
that Brainiac is virtually immortal.

150
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,607
Existing for thousands of years.

151
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,007
He possesses the intellectual plunder

152
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:30,665
of countless advanced civilizations.

153
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,255
He's far beyond us.

154
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:35,711
And as history has proven,
Krypton's current weapons

155
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:39,141
- are useless against him.
- Yet here you are.

156
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:42,829
And we still haven't heard
a plan yet, General.

157
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,326
That's because he doesn't have one.

158
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:47,842
On account of he's full of shit.

159
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:51,992
When Brainiac took Kandor,
both our families made it out.

160
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,165
They made their way to Kryptonopolis.

161
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,649
In that city's ancient archives,

162
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:59,075
I learned of the location
of a hidden weapon.

163
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:03,416
A pre-cataclysm instrument
of violence so powerful,

164
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:05,865
it would give even Brainiac pause.

165
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,769
That's why your base is down here?

166
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,060
I've been searching these
catacombs for months.

167
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,816
With only one clue.

168
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:15,213
Inside pocket.

169
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,136
Don't come crying to me

170
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,914
if he's hiding some kind
of freaky ass space spider

171
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,809
in there that bites your hand off.

172
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,517
Just saying.

173
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,649
According to the archive,

174
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:42,094
we find that symbol,
we find the weapon.

175
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:50,341
It looks like a house sigil.

176
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:53,120
It doesn't match any house
currently on Krypton.

177
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:59,007
You recognize it.

178
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:01,280
All you have to do is take me there.

179
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:03,577
- Seg, you can't...
- Shut up.

180
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,295
You'll have your turn.

181
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:10,154
The people who live down
here, the Cythonnites.

182
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:14,383
This weapon is what they're
sworn to protect, isn't it?

183
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:17,642
Yes, and they will guard
it with their lives.

184
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,734
Because that is how powerful it is.

185
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,320
Which is why we need it.

186
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:37,947
I received a message.
You wanted to see me?

187
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,606
Commander Em, sit down.

188
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,446
What I need to say to you,

189
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,114
I say because I trust you, Dev.

190
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:55,740
Thank you, Primus. That means a lot.

191
00:10:56,985 --> 00:11:00,219
The Rankless Initiative.
That was shit, wasn't it.

192
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,161
Complete shit.

193
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:06,333
It only made things worse,
and Lyta didn't deserve

194
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:09,926
to be made a scapegoat for
the Council's bad decisions.

195
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,664
Over your lifetime,
would you say things

196
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,750
have gotten better in Kandor?

197
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:16,609
No, I wouldn't.

198
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:19,485
But there is nothing
we can do about it.

199
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:22,874
We are Sagitari. We don't make policy.

200
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,164
What if I told you there are some

201
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:30,880
who would like to see a
change in who makes policy?

202
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:33,972
And the person they'd
want to change out?

203
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:43,619
The Voice of Rao.

204
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,818
You've committed to this?

205
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:55,548
Just by my being here,

206
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:57,517
being here and not turning you in,

207
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,642
I'm committed.

208
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,689
Are you?

209
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,105
You could still walk out and
call officers to arrest me.

210
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,257
Would you let me do that?

211
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,724
We could find out.

212
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:13,132
No need.

213
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:17,525
Everything I learned
about being a Sagitari

214
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:19,911
was by following your lead.

215
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:24,528
If you ask it of me, I'll back you.

216
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:26,989
All the way.

217
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,783
You guys can't seriously be considering

218
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:37,609
giving this wackjob a
weapon of mass destruction.

219
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,229
Seg.

220
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:45,689
I'm sorry. Really, I am.

221
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:48,123
I know I should have told you before,

222
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:50,781
but what was I supposed to say?

223
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,380
Hey, man, let's go get a drink.

224
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:54,271
By the way, your world's
going to explode.

225
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,480
Why even lay that burden on you?

226
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:58,777
Wouldn't you want to know?

227
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,504
All right.

228
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,935
I didn't tell you because it was hard.

229
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,661
It's not a conversation
anyone wants to have.

230
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:14,160
Look, I don't, I don't know.

231
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,687
Maybe Zod's lying. Maybe...

232
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:21,108
Maybe I was wrong.

233
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:25,914
All I knew was Superman's
enemy was going back

234
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,610
to change the timeline,
which means that

235
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:29,055
your grandson would never be born.

236
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,829
So you're telling me
you didn't even hear

237
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:35,016
the full story, but you came
to me, so sure of yours...

238
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,341
I had to. I couldn't just stand around

239
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,918
and do nothing if it meant no Superman.

240
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,234
Regardless of what you got wrong,

241
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:44,801
Brainiac is still coming.
We can all agree on that.

242
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,797
We all want to stop him, so
why don't we work together?

243
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:54,456
Because, if the warning I received

244
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:58,262
wasn't about Brainiac, it
must have been about Zod.

245
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,991
And if we're to preserve the timeline,

246
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,002
maybe we have to step back, and let...

247
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:09,470
Let Brainiac take Kandor.

248
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:20,810
In honor of the Nova
Cycle, by Rao's mercy,

249
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,170
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

250
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:29,089
Go, meditate on your sins,
and perfect yourself.

251
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:33,791
In honor of the Nova
Cycle, by Rao's mercy,

252
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,217
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

253
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:41,065
Go, meditate on your sins,
and perfect yourself.

254
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:46,337
In honor of the Nova
Cycle, by Rao's mercy,

255
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,539
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

256
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:53,114
Go, meditate on your sins,
and perfect yourself.

257
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:57,560
In honor of the Nova
Cycle, by Rao's mercy,

258
00:14:57,585 --> 00:14:59,353
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

259
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,375
There must be some mistake.

260
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,576
A late addition to the list of pardons.

261
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:20,821
- I see nothing wrong.
- But Commander.

262
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:23,062
It says he's Black Zero.
He's a bomb maker.

263
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,719
- Is something wrong?
- Excuse me,

264
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:27,281
but there's been an error.
Zeroes are never pardoned.

265
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,339
Rao's mercy is infinite.

266
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:31,593
If His Eminence sees
something in this prisoner

267
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,754
that we do not, it is
not for us to question.

268
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,145
But shouldn't we follow this up?

269
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,547
- Make sure...
- Lieutenant.

270
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,672
You're aware that the
Rankless Initiative

271
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:40,907
created an ill feeling in the city.

272
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,461
There are those who
think the authorities

273
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:44,931
are obsessed with Black Zero.

274
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:47,533
This is a chance for us to show them

275
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:50,213
that Rao sees us all as his children.

276
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:53,024
Let it go, Lieutenant Ran.

277
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,885
The politics are above our pay grade.

278
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,984
Commander Em, there's
a lot of animosity

279
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,594
towards Black Zero, understandably.

280
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,117
Perhaps you could
accompany this prisoner

281
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:04,927
safely out of the building.

282
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,009
In honor of the Nova Cycle...

283
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,007
He's clearly insane, Seg.

284
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:21,567
Come on, don't waste another
moment thinking about him.

285
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:24,589
Seg, I know how this
sounds, but please.

286
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,649
This is a key moment in history.

287
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,581
Things need to unfold the way
that they originally did.

288
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,471
Okay, any changes could set off history

289
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:35,389
in some new and crazy
way, and something huge,

290
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:38,081
like stopping Brainiac,

291
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,977
that could ruin everything.

292
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,894
By everything, you mean my grandson.

293
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,308
Your obsession.

294
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:50,791
Tell me, how is it that
my world goes extinct,

295
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,037
but he ends up on yours?

296
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:02,395
He was sent off just before
this planet exploded.

297
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:06,565
That's why he's called
the Last Son of Krypton.

298
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:10,365
I don't have all the answers here.

299
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,125
I admit it.

300
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:14,798
I guess if...

301
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,426
If Brainiac doesn't take Kandor,

302
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:21,794
if Krypton doesn't explode,
then anything can happen.

303
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:25,615
And maybe Kal-El will exist.
Maybe he won't.

304
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:29,742
But what I do know is that is a
risk we cannot afford to take.

305
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:32,306
One might argue that
the millions of lives

306
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:33,276
on Krypton are more important

307
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:34,959
than one immature survivor on Earth.

308
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:36,261
And one might argue how many times

309
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:38,640
Superman saves the universe,
if you want to count numbers.

310
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,653
Forget the numbers!

311
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,428
I care about my world.

312
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,171
My friends.

313
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,184
What's the point of any of it?

314
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,255
Of making the world a better place?

315
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:55,185
Of having children? Of
protecting our loved ones?

316
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:57,769
If it all just ends

317
00:17:57,794 --> 00:18:00,652
in fire and death?

318
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:03,845
Everything that we are.

319
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,307
Everything we've built.

320
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,064
You're asking me

321
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:11,852
to sacrifice all of it.

322
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,303
For an idea.

323
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:16,920
An abstraction.

324
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:20,209
A future if.

325
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:23,016
Seg...

326
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:25,890
Please.

327
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:30,057
This is the most important
moment in all of our lives.

328
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,044
I know that I've given
you reason to doubt me,

329
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,756
and I'm sorry.

330
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:39,635
But I'm asking you to put
that aside right now.

331
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,107
I'm asking you to trust me.

332
00:18:58,642 --> 00:19:01,242
- Keep both eyes on him.
- He's not to be trusted.

333
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,591
Copy that.

334
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,034
When we met,

335
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:25,166
you said you knew my family.

336
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:27,904
I counted your son as
my closest friend.

337
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:30,999
It's true I disapproved
of your grandson.

338
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,693
Why?

339
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:35,400
There are immigrants
who turn their backs

340
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,291
on their history and their culture.

341
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,809
Passively accept the standards
their new world offers,

342
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,301
as though no others
could possibly exist.

343
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,994
He let himself be cut down to size.

344
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:55,713
He was proud of it. Proud
of burying his heritage.

345
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:59,106
I'm sorry, but your friend was
right about one thing at least.

346
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,931
We were enemies.

347
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:04,174
Though I take no pleasure
in that, and never have.

348
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:22,236
Why is faith important to you?

349
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,654
It means that everything has a purpose.

350
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,723
That the purpose is good.

351
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,214
That I'll see my mother again one day.

352
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:32,951
It's faith that leads us
to the Blessed Place.

353
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,739
Is that important to
you, Little Sundrop?

354
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,489
How did you know my
mother called me that?

355
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:47,134
A few of the worthy, the special ones,

356
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,587
I take into myself.

357
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:54,111
I take their memories, skills, dreams.

358
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:57,643
Everything that makes
them what they are.

359
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:01,736
Their template lives forever

360
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:04,391
in me.

361
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:07,951
A template, that's a soul?

362
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,040
Your mother is here in me.

363
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:13,098
You could join her.

364
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:18,041
Together forever. Would
you choose that?

365
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,516
Sevi, why are you afraid? What's wrong?

366
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,522
Sevi has nothing to be afraid of.

367
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,583
She's answered her questions well,

368
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:33,099
and been promised eternal life.

369
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:37,221
Sevi, that's wonderful, isn't it?

370
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,409
Yes, I'm so happy.

371
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:45,382
Your choice will determine
your fate for eternity.

372
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:49,997
Take time to consider it well.

373
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,899
He's been asking questions.

374
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:59,581
Wondering why the last minute pardon

375
00:21:59,606 --> 00:22:02,040
for a Black Zero bomb maker.

376
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:04,909
Noting that the prisoner hasn't
returned to his dwelling,

377
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:07,745
or been seen in the
city since his release.

378
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,042
Of course not, he's in
a Rankless safe house

379
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:12,144
under guard, waiting to
be found and arrested

380
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,570
for the Voice's death, and
killed while avoiding capture.

381
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,095
What good does that do us
when one of your officers

382
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,689
is encouraging people to
scrutinize the chain of events?

383
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,755
He's from a prominent family.
People might listen to him.

384
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:27,209
Couldn't you have replaced
him with one of our people?

385
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:29,396
I already slipped Dev in.

386
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,478
If you want to attract suspicion,

387
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:34,103
a good way to do it would be
to shift assignments around

388
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:36,064
just before an assassination.

389
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:38,319
Most officers wouldn't
have questioned the order.

390
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:39,940
- We were unlucky.
- You need to silence him,

391
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:42,178
quickly, before he draws attention.

392
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:46,169
Well, it's too late to
bring him on board now.

393
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,714
And any attempt to scare him

394
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:49,274
would only deepen his
suspicion further.

395
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:51,009
No, there is only one
way to handle this.

396
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,333
- I'll speak to him.
- No, don't...

397
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:55,613
I do not need to be schooled
on the danger here.

398
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,526
The lives of every Sagitari
I've recruited are in my hands,

399
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:02,104
and they've put them there
because they have faith in me.

400
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:04,494
If I'm committed, they're
willing to back me.

401
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,970
What are you committed
to, except yourself?

402
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,045
You've only ever been
out for number one.

403
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,120
Am I supposed to justify myself to you?

404
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:14,405
Two decades ago, you
came out of nowhere,

405
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,346
and married into House Vex, and
spent the rest of your life

406
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:20,338
trying to make the Vex
name seem important.

407
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,735
My honor, that's my own problem.

408
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,861
But what did I sacrifice it for?

409
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:28,291
And am I supposed to
kill a junior officer

410
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:30,901
to prop up your ego? My ego?

411
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:32,964
You take a good look at this city

412
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:35,291
that you are supposedly
protecting, Jayna.

413
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:37,424
Kandor is stagnating.

414
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,784
We are barely surviving on
our dwindling resources.

415
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:43,533
It is time to look to the future.

416
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:46,976
To look beyond, and start
to build new alliances

417
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,700
with the eight other cities.

418
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:52,164
To combine our expertise,
and develop new resources.

419
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,173
If the other, more illustrious houses

420
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,658
are too hidebound to do it, I am not.

421
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:04,183
This world will only improve
when our cities work together.

422
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:07,348
Under your leadership?

423
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:13,060
You know, you're right.

424
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:15,962
I do look out for number one.

425
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,440
But the people of
Kandor are number two.

426
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:22,588
Where do you suppose they feature

427
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,866
on the Voice or Rao's list?

428
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,143
He only cares about the
glorification of his god,

429
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:31,666
and he expects the people to
dedicate themselves to that.

430
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:37,115
At least from me, they get
a chance at a decent life.

431
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,992
I am a selfish bastard, Jayna.

432
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:43,206
But people do things for
more than one reason.

433
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:59,951
Everything all right, Lieutenant?

434
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:02,230
I don't know.

435
00:25:02,572 --> 00:25:04,577
The bomb maker who was freed.

436
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:07,523
Why pardon someone with
such lethal expertise?

437
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:09,920
I feel I should seek an
audience with the Voice.

438
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:13,058
- Ask what he meant by it.
- I'd advise against that.

439
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,298
You'd be implying the Voice
made a bad decision,

440
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:16,994
and that's never a good
idea, career-wise.

441
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,943
I get that, but...

442
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:22,047
Did you know the prisoner vanished?

443
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:24,896
The whole thing feels
wrong, don't you think?

444
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,562
You could be on to something.

445
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:32,975
Let's find somewhere to talk
it over, figure it out.

446
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,651
That's okay. You're right.

447
00:25:36,723 --> 00:25:38,489
I probably should stay out of it.

448
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,289
It's no trouble.

449
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,948
- I've got the time.
- No.

450
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,571
Thank you, Commander Em.

451
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,616
It's really okay.

452
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,994
Oh, I hate to say this,
but I got to pee.

453
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,664
So unless you want to hold it for me,

454
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:00,916
you're going to have to
unlock me for a moment.

455
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,556
Real soon.

456
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:06,361
I'll take the third option,
which is ignoring you.

457
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:27,526
Hey, wait, wait, wait, I've
got something to tell you

458
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:29,623
about the weapon that you're guarding.

459
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:37,621
The prisoner was only added to
the list at the last second.

460
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,009
And no one can tell me
where the order came from.

461
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:42,406
He was last seen with Commander Em.

462
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:44,789
Since then, he's
disappeared from the city.

463
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:47,890
You were right to come to me
with this, Lieutenant Ran.

464
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,800
I feel I should also tell you,

465
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,467
I've requested an audience
with the Voice of Rao.

466
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:03,985
You are a fine officer.

467
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,179
You have your commander's praise.

468
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:05,394
- I have a million questions.
- Yes?

469
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:07,539
Aren't you afraid revealing
things to your mother

470
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:09,296
might mess up your timeline?

471
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,199
A man who travels into the
past to change things

472
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,760
is in no position to be picky.

473
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,894
Very true.

474
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,353
It's amazing to see you like this.

475
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:23,089
- Young?
- Happy, open.

476
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:24,863
Smiling.

477
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:27,408
What I remember most
about you was how heavy

478
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:30,418
the loss of Kandor
weighed on your heart.

479
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:32,673
You didn't like to talk about it,

480
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,624
but I learned that you were in
one of the military vessels

481
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:37,729
attacking Brainiac's ship

482
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,672
when he ripped the
city from the ground.

483
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:44,566
You never forgot your
failure to defend the city.

484
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:46,202
It made you bitter.

485
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:50,251
I guess you're saying I'm
not a perfect mother.

486
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:52,868
Maybe, but you taught me

487
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:55,852
to put the defense of this
world above all else.

488
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,687
You fashioned me into a weapon.

489
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:01,313
I take pride in that.

490
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,645
What was he telling you?

491
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,603
Apparently, one day, I wake up to find

492
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:19,393
I've turned into my mother.

493
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:22,496
Well, it seems I have a grandson

494
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:26,815
who's decisions are morally
dubious, so there's that.

495
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,032
Can't help but worry, though.

496
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:34,538
Our future?

497
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,953
I have a son who recognizes
me as his mother,

498
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,370
but only knows you as the
father of his best friend.

499
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:46,304
I suppose I thought...

500
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:49,485
Now that you're Guilded,
maybe there'd be a way.

501
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,978
I still want to believe
we have a future.

502
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:58,168
Let's stick with today.

503
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:07,268
We already know the
future is confusing.

504
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:15,189
Hold.

505
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:18,126
- What is it?
- I heard something.

506
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:49,863
Glad we're on the same side.

507
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,449
Not bad for a bitter old lady.

508
00:30:57,757 --> 00:30:59,357
The prisoner's given up the location

509
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:01,116
of his bomb-making equipment,

510
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:02,402
and I've put the finishing touches

511
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,080
on one of his creations.

512
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,659
Did you remove all remote detonators?

513
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:10,170
Yes, there's nothing that's
traceable back to us.

514
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:12,520
Once the timer's set,
nothing can stop it.

515
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:15,507
And no one can point a finger
at anyone else but Black Zero.

516
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:18,867
And the rogue officer
asking all the questions.

517
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:20,893
Has he been...

518
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,096
dealt with?

519
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:26,448
- Yes.
- Good.

520
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,291
Then please feel free
to conceal your bomb

521
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:33,018
in the Tribunal, Commander.

522
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:55,932
Have you decided, Ona?

523
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,611
Are you ready to give
yourself over now,

524
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:00,659
and join your mother?

525
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:03,424
That's not what I've chosen.

526
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:05,524
I want to serve you here.

527
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:08,548
You are a surprising child.

528
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:10,159
I'm sorry.

529
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:14,877
One gets tired of always being right.

530
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:22,846
I think I like surprises.

531
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,948
Perhaps it's time you saw

532
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:39,510
who it is you've vowed to serve.

533
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,057
Your Eminence, we're here to
escort you to the ceremony.

534
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:49,307
There will be a slight delay.

535
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:50,854
In speaking with my protégé,

536
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:52,479
I've realized I need more contact

537
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,205
with the people of Kandor.

538
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,065
I have much to learn

539
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,510
and to judge.

540
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:00,487
I don't understand, Your Eminence.

541
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,572
The ceremony must be
open to the public.

542
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:06,470
I want the hall packed with citizens.

543
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:08,815
Young, old, Guilded, Rankless.

544
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,087
Turn no one away.

545
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:13,354
Your Eminence, I'm not sure we can

546
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:15,198
get the people there in time.

547
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:18,854
Then begin now.

548
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,557
Thank you, Seg.

549
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:33,572
If you hadn't guided me here,
I might never have found it.

550
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,996
Well, let's just hope this
ancient weapon actually works.

551
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:56,905
Where did you get those?

552
00:33:56,935 --> 00:34:00,050
They're military-grade explosives.

553
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:03,005
Perks of using Black Zero.

554
00:34:26,318 --> 00:34:29,698
Here goes.

555
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:51,090
You're telling me there
will be collateral damage?

556
00:34:51,115 --> 00:34:53,822
I'm telling you the
room will be stuffed

557
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:55,447
with collateral damage.

558
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:58,587
This is no longer a
controlled situation.

559
00:34:58,612 --> 00:35:00,212
We have to abort.

560
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,281
Proceed as planned.

561
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:04,364
There comes a point in any
coup when it's more dangerous

562
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:06,478
to back out than to go forward.

563
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:08,471
Too many people are
involved to depend on

564
00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:09,863
none of them betraying the secret.

565
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:12,556
- Even inadvertently...
- Let me be clear.

566
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:17,626
Your opinion means nothing to me.

567
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,367
Primus?

568
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:25,171
We can't withdraw now.

569
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:27,758
We've already paid too much, Dev.

570
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:41,069
People of Kandor City.

571
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:47,745
The time for holding
myself apart is over.

572
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,841
I look forward

573
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:53,670
to coming to know you intimately.

574
00:35:54,297 --> 00:35:57,298
Soon, you will have

575
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:00,475
no secrets from me.

576
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,286
Bomb! Bomb! Clear the room!

577
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,685
There has to be a way in.

578
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,570
I know if we work
together, we can find it.

579
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:34,299
I think you might be more
right than you realize.

580
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,380
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

581
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:39,078
Doesn't that symbol
look familiar to you?

582
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:45,551
It's the El and Zod sigil
superimposed on each other.

583
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,485
I think our families
put this vault here.

584
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,623
Raika, Raika said that
because I'm an El,

585
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:55,757
I have the power to destroy everything.

586
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,150
And the power to open the vault.

587
00:36:59,704 --> 00:37:01,978
Maybe this is a lock of some kind.

588
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,439
Blood of the house.

589
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:10,149
Blood of the house. Um,
do you have a knife?

590
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:11,750
Yeah.

591
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:19,831
Okay.

592
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:41,807
An El and a Zod.

593
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,113
I'm not used to being in this position.

594
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:01,035
No!

595
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:02,924
Don't do it.

596
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:06,484
That thing in there will kill
us, and everyone in Kandor.

597
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,620
Everyone in the universe,
if it can, okay?

598
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:39,838
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

599
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:42,495
- Whoa.
- He betrayed us.

600
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:47,181
Hey, just surrender.

601
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:49,323
Okay, they promised not to hurt you.

602
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:53,313
That thing in there, they
told me it's called Doomsday.

603
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:55,104
Okay, I know that name.

604
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:58,104
It's a soulless killing machine
that can't be destroyed.

605
00:38:58,214 --> 00:38:59,832
Or controlled.

606
00:38:59,857 --> 00:39:02,306
Seg, if you let that thing loose,

607
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,950
it will kill everything
that it comes across.

608
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,056
It's true.

609
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:09,522
That's why we have given over our lives

610
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,036
to protecting the
universe from Doomsday.

611
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:14,695
My people were here when
the weapon arrived.

612
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,346
The Els and the Zods, they
thought that together,

613
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:20,740
they were creating something great.

614
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:22,920
But we've seen it.

615
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:27,247
We understand the unending
cloud of hatred they birthed.

616
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,357
You do not know the danger we are in.

617
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:39,919
It doesn't matter what may
have happened in the past.

618
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,477
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

619
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:45,777
Our world.

620
00:39:47,514 --> 00:39:48,537
No!

621
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:57,766
Shit!

622
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,236
Hey.

623
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:07,455
Cover me, I see a way out.

624
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,343
Seg!

625
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:17,818
Go, go, go.

626
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:29,381
Go!

627
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,491
Just have the skimmer ready.

628
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:10,322
This is going to be a hot extraction.

629
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:12,303
They'll be there, you can trust me.

630
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:13,995
- I believe you.
- You understand why

631
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,485
I had to do that, right?

632
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,442
The timeline is too important to risk.

633
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:18,833
We're still friends, Seg.

634
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:20,736
You can come with us back to Kandor.

635
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,627
Find your Zeta-Beam
gadget and ride it back

636
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:24,979
to wherever you came from
and never come back.

637
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:33,266
- Does this mean you're in?
- I'm with you.

638
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,989
But no Doomsday. We find another way.

639
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:46,388
I have His Eminence. We are
headed to his chambers.

640
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:51,142
- You do your job well.
- Thank you.

641
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,444
