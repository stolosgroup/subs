00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,740
<i> - Last season ... </ i>
<i> - </ i> It's closed.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,420
Are you Mr. Antonio?
The captain has sent me here.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,740
Next time he comes by himself.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,780
These people are insignificant.
But you are completely different.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,700
Work hard and stay low.
Do not brag about it.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,980
- Do you have a family?
- No.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,660
A family is good to have,
but it's also your Achilles heel.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,020
- Is it yours? Then when do you have two?
- Do I need your permission?

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,700
- You have lasted up.
- I can not continue.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,420
The thread you work for
always have a crowbar ready.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,700
From now on
We keep low profile, Relu.

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,740
If you have left the trash inside
you won't get rid of the cockroaches.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,820
Teddy, my son. Take him with you
- Stay here.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,820
Hello.

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,620
- Were you out with that punk?
- Who?

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,500
If you owe me something, I'll send
then you to break your legs?

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,460
- I have not taken any money!
- You did not come with any either.

19
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,380
I took 28000 from you and now
you want 60000. That's a lot.

20
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,940
He just got a hole in the throat.
He was in coma, but now he is better.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,860
He is the leader
and always lands on the feet.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,780
- We're leaving from here.
- I'm married and have two children.

23
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,460
Go, Pop Puiu. We are busy.

24
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,380
Good night, kids!

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,580
Pop Puiu screwed it.

26
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,620
It's 50250 euros.
You have until Friday.

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,300
Leave Cocos outside,
someone hit him on a parking lot.

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,020
It was the Captain. Captain!

29
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,100
If you lie to me
do i take your family

30
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,180
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,220
Now that he has knocked her up
we are more than brothers.

32
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,860
We are Siamese twins.

33
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,860
Do you want some snacks, Mr. Relster?
A cracker?

34
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,940
We have smoked salmon and the sea's delights.

35
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,460
You may not remember me,
I'm Beebes son.

36
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,060
Gypsies Bebe. You knew each other
when you went to the gym Titan.

37
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,300
I am his youngest son, Cãlin.

38
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,980
You must remember me.
They called me Cãlinache.

39
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,460
Mr Relster, I just want to say-

40
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,820
- that if you need a jumping boy ...

41
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,340
I can keep a secret.
And I have a driving license.

42
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,220
What do you say?

43
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,540
- Is that caviar?
- Yes, fish room.

44
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,700
You there, vanish from here!
Off you go!

45
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,220
Relu, Mr. Relu, Relu-Grab ...

46
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,420
Congratulations to the shock! Good luck.
You won the highest win.

47
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,300
I do not mean you planned
that your daughter would roam around

48
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,100
- What are you trying to say?
- Just that, nothing else.

49
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm just saying happy!

50
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,460
Now that you are ... if you understand-

51
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,460
Remember what your friends are.
And your enemies.

52
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,580
Do not you have a son too?
I have a daughter.

53
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,380
I have three daughters.

54
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:39,460
But one of them, little Adela,
she is 13 years old.

55
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,140
How old is your son?
She has potential.

56
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,500
If you are interested she is smart.
She was in the Geography Olympiad.

57
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,100
She can every hill in
this country. Mountains and plains.

58
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,140
Which pair it would be.
You, me and ... Captain.

59
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,740
- Let him go, baby.
- Three relatives!

60
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,380
Let him be. You are so packed.
Sorry, Mr. Relu.

61
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,980
They are a handsome couple. Congratulations!

62
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Thirteen! Yes?

63
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,020
And by the way, we have a daughter
in the same age as son.

64
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,980
Congratulations kid!

65
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,180
Therefore, I have the great honor-

66
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,420
- and the pleasure will come later ...

67
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,380
Are not you happy?

68
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,660
That's me.

69
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,620
Inboard.

70
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,060
Good. Be happy.

71
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,220
Be happy with the outside with.

72
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,900
What should I do?
Dancing on the tables?

73
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,180
Dancing on the table, fighting ...
Do it whatever you want.

74
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,340
Be happy.
After all, this is your point of view.

75
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,940
I've been here for five hours
and you have not said

76
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,020
"We Dance,
It's your daughter's wedding. "

77
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,340
- Shall We Dance?
- No thanks.

78
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,340
You said you wanted it, so why not?

79
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,300
Because you did not ask.

80
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,300
What did I do ten seconds ago?

81
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,980
You just said
you thought I wanted to hear.

82
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,140
- What does it mean?
That you lie

83
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,700
Do not cry over it, he came away.
We can not do anything.

84
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,820
Hello, sir. Are you busy?

85
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,060
Hi, now I'm here.

86
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,660
When I was talking about a triangle
was not this what I meant.

87
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,780
So now you want to get rid of me, your dental?

88
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,900
On the dance floor.

89
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:40,100
If we had done as I wanted
would not you be on the bang

90
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,900
But I could not have walked
in two days.

91
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,340
Do you mean you can do it now?

92
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,020
I can go and shut up.

93
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,340
- Do you want to test?
- It also works.

94
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,940
Listen to me...

95
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,740
No more flattering,
That made me end up here.

96
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,300
You are talking about inviting falafel
and go to the movies, and see what's going on!

97
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,820
- Do you regret it?
- That we missed the movie?

98
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,380
Respond.

99
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,380
Do not be ridiculous.

100
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,940
Too late.

101
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,860
I regret nothing.

102
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,020
I love you.

103
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,860
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

104
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,900
- Certainly sure?
- Yes.

105
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,780
What a cliché!

106
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,580
A tired old cliché.
I swear on my mother's grave.

107
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,940
A grave?

108
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,060
Do you want me to die?

109
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,060
Just say, I'll do that.
I do it!

110
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,420
Serious brain injury.
Death occurred ...

111
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,860
No I do not want to.

112
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,620
You're coolest at this wedding.

113
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Honestly.

114
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,500
We should be the only invited,
because I am also coolast.

115
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,620
If you do not treat her well -

116
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,580
- I steal her and stay away from here.

117
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,860
- Are you hanging out?
- I'm not made that way.

118
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,660
Believe me,
I classify your groom in everything.

119
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,820
Sasha! Come here, do not be
such a hangover. Do not bother you!

120
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,660
When I see such a love
I break from pheromones.

121
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,220
Honestly.

122
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,820
And of love.

123
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,340
Congratulations!

124
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,780
So when he ...
How old was he, seven years?

125
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,700
- Ten, but it's not ...
- Stop it! He was not ten.

126
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,620
Ten? Okay, ten.

127
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,260
We pumped him full with vitamins.
He seemed to need it.

128
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,900
Then he started with everything,
and joined every club.

129
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,340
Even in the stamp collecting club.

130
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,180
He learned several languages,
ikebana and origami.

131
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,780
Something kind of karate.

132
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,020
One day he came to me and said,

133
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,140
"Now I know.
I want to make music, dad. "

134
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,700
Then one day the fruit began to babble.

135
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,380
Not about anything that I wanted to hear,
if you take it.

136
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,500
She said:
"We're going to Teddys school."

137
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,900
"They set up a show,
and he is in. "

138
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,900
They started two hours late
and I had things to do.

139
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,140
But she said, "Wait and see,
they will start soon. "

140
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,340
Suddenly he stood there.

141
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,980
On stage, with the orchestra.

142
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,460
And with the whole belt grip. All of it!

143
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,780
And the guy played trumpet.
Trumpet!

144
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,900
And I promise that
it really made me move.

145
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,700
I thought, "Have you seen,
we have an artist in the family! "

146
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,300
You would have seen him play the trumpet.

147
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,660
He had it going more than
when Pop Geamanu eats pussy.

148
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:41,060
I watched when he drove his number
and saw a puddle formed under him.

149
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:50,220
He pissed himself,
but did not stop playing.

150
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,340
Dude!

151
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Remember when you pissed yourself
that time?

152
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,460
He had been waiting for so long
and could not stand.

153
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,020
Just. Have I said anything else?

154
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,340
Afterwards I went to the director.

155
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,940
He was a joke
and I bumped him out.

156
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,820
He really got what he deserved.

157
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,100
But when I had calmed down me
and stopped seeing red-

158
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:28,340
- I said to myself:
"Wait a minute! My son is brave."

159
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,100
"No matter what happens
he does what he's going to do. "

160
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,300
"He does not give up
until it's done. "

161
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,900
"He is reliable."

162
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,620
We toast for confidence! Ok?

163
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,580
Congratulations, Relu!

164
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,020
- Congratulations.
- Bowl.

165
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,740
I do not see any twist ring.

166
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,380
- wedding ring.
- Yes, wedding ring.

167
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,020
I do not have it on me,
but I have it.

168
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

169
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,700
- What?
- This.

170
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,740
You and I.
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

171
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,860
Why do you want to enter?
Stay here for a while.

172
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,460
Where...?

173
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,540
Damn!

174
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,460
Such drunkards!

175
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,340
Must be a lot of money.

176
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,060
I sat inside
for a woman's sake, for my wife.

177
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,620
I loved her so much.

178
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,460
But I did not say that to anyone.

179
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,540
They had laughed at me
and said I was a coward.

180
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,460
I never told her
how much I loved her.

181
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,380
- That's a shame.
- Yes.

182
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,980
You know what they say:

183
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,020
"Either you fuck or you don't
cock's time is running out "

184
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,380
I have never heard that.

185
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,020
But what's in here
never shrinks.

186
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,500
Love, I mean.

187
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,540
You take the love with you in the grave.

188
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,780
My shoes start to get too tight.

189
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,660
The guys told me
that young people leave tomorrow.

190
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,500
That they go on honeymoon to Greece.

191
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,580
Yes. Sorry, but I'm so tired.

192
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,300
How can you let them go on their own?
A drive, now?

193
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,100
There are so many horrors happening
nowadays.

194
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,860
And the girl has a baby on her way.

195
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,500
If that were me,
if the people i love lived-

196
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,940
- I would not leave them.

197
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,820
How can you let them go away alone?

198
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,220
Pop Geamanu ...

199
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,220
You make me jealous here.
- I have...

200
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,940
Relu, my boy ... forgive me.

201
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,300
It was not meant to ...

202
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,780
What a guy!

203
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,660
He looks like a chihuahua,
but his little snail woke up.

204
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,660
"I felt cold shivers on my spine
- Lucky they did not go down ...

205
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,660
Don't be a redneck!

206
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,660
I bought crystal glass for them.

207
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,140
It was your first salary ...

208
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,340
You are so fun. What have you bought?
You have money.

209
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,380
Come on, enlighten me.

210
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,260
I gave them a card.

211
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,860
Does it play a tune?
when you open it?

212
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,340
No, it will be quiet.

213
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,460
Can not you stay?
I'll take you home later.

214
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,780
I start working in three hours.

215
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,780
Let me at least give you a ride.

216
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,780
- Where's Chuckie?
- He is sleeping.

217
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,180
Can he live with you tonight?
- Yes.

218
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,220
Let me drive you.

219
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,740
You drove us here.
You can not drive us anywhere else.

220
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,700
At least let me go
give you some money Gina!

221
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,500
I do not understand
this paper.

222
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,460
Help me with
Wait, it made it happen.

223
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,620
Mr. Toma?

224
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,860
Mr. Toma.

225
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,780
Regarding our agreement ... As you see
has my situation changed.

226
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:41,340
So I wonder if we can talk
when you have time

227
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,660
And solve this.
I have some money and ...

228
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,380
I know I did not answer
when you called.

229
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,420
As you can see, things have become ...

230
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,540
Who are you now again?

231
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,380
Relu.

232
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,980
Relu from the poker party.
I'm working for the Captain.

233
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,940
Relu? Which Relu?

234
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,700
Yes, Relu! I remember you.

235
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:16,540
You are the father of the bride. Congratulations!

236
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,820
Hope they have a long life together
and a house full of kids.

237
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,740
Congratulations. Now you excuse me.

238
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,180
I'm sleepy and -

239
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,020
- At my age you get frustrated-

240
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,500
- if you do not go to bed
when it is bedtime.

241
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,900
<i> A crash 12 km outside of Uzunu. </ i>

242
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,420
<i> Three cars were involved,
two people suffered minor damage. </ i>

243
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,860
<i> Traffic is slow.
The road is still open. </ I>

244
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,740
This song I like.

245
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,220
Here is 21 Ron.

246
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,220
I don't have any spare change

247
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,140
No problem, it's not the end of the world.

248
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,220
Well then. Have a nice day!

249
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:35,380
Honestly
I would like to have a cup of coffee.

250
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,020
My shift is about to end
and I've been driving all night.

251
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,340
You know how it is.
I can barely stay awake.

252
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,700
Coffee?

253
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,740
- It would not hurt.
But coffee makes you crazy.

254
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,900
After a night's job, you just want to
go home to family and rest?

255
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,020
I can sleep when I'm dead.

256
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,580
You only live once. What do you say?

257
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,740
- I think ... that I want it.
- Yes?

258
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,700
But I have to warn you, I'm a little ...

259
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,180
A little bit shy?

260
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,620
- I'm starving.
- Are you hungry?

261
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,660
"I'm hungry between my legs.
- Oh dear!

262
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,180
Maybe I can not hold.

263
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,540
Such things can go away.
Coffee leads to cake ...

264
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,740
A muffin ...

265
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,100
And I'm not a teen,
so I'm a bit desperate.

266
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,580
Nowadays I'm fucking for the ages.
As if there is no tomorrow.

267
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,300
Until I hit my head in the bedside table
until the wall breaks.

268
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,740
You will not be anywhere
until tomorrow night?

269
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,500
Just closer to your ass.

270
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,420
We live to please or die on duty.

271
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,140
That's what you wanted to hear?
Was that what you wanted to hear?

272
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,660
I can not give you spare change,
so I invite you and pay.

273
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,740
Didn't you say you wanna fuck?

274
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,740
It's called irony. Have a good one!

275
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,580
You know what?

276
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,900
Maybe I'll get there
and rinse out of your mouth with irony?

277
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,940
Is the car an automatic or manual?

278
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,580
- Is the car automatic or manual?
- Manual.

279
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,740
- You have to buy an automatic one.
- sure

280
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,300
When you picked me up
a man helped me into the car.

281
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,540
- His name is Relu Oncescu.
- And? I do not care.

282
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,980
You should be, he's my husband.

283
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:38,620
I have been to a wedding. Our daughter
marry the captain's son

284
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,100
Which captain?

285
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,940
The man who is in plot with the clan
as they talked about on television

286
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,660
I do not know anything about that.
But he can call my husband.

287
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,660
He works for Captain
and can explain it.

288
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,940
So you can come with me inside.

289
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,460
But then you'll have to buy an automatic car

290
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,660
- Because you will not
be able to use your legs.

291
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,660
You there!

292
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,580
Hi, you there!

293
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,820
Have you seen my husband Tinel?

294
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,420
- Excuse me?
- My husband Tinel. Was he out there?

295
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,020
I do not know. Describe him for me.

296
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:37,620
He is about this tall
and a real joke.

297
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,100
Sorry, I have not seen him.

298
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Do you hear...

299
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,940
He got out to buy cigarettes
and never come back.

300
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,580
- How long has he been gone?
- since September 2005

301
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,660
You ... Can you help me-

302
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:11,780
- to change the channel on the television
to that folk music channel?

303
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,900
I have a remote control.

304
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,220
It is over there.

305
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:44,620
- What number is the folk music channel?
- Try 15.

306
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,940
Is this this?

307
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,300
No, it's not it.

308
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,420
Here it is.

309
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,860
- You found it.
- I found it.

310
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,380
Here it is. Number 18.

311
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,340
Thank you, boy.
- Alright.

312
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,460
Take care.

313
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,580
You there!

314
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,620
Have you seen my husband Tinel?

315
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Do not worry, Tinel will be coming soon.

316
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,980
Hi. How are you?

317
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,180
- I'm here to do business.
- Me too.

318
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,940
How is your wife doing?
- Good, she's pregnant again.

319
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,660
- You do not have a button.
- It is she who asks for it.

320
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,420
Do you have anything?

321
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,620
You seem to look good.

322
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,380
I run to protect
my ass, so I'm in good shape.

323
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,740
Was that how you got it?
that brazilian big ass?

324
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,020
Stop it! Nothing beats your ass.

325
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,060
Are you sure
that nothing beats my ass?

326
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,020
I have not said anything. Not to anyone.

327
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,940
Talking about getting a bed,
how was the wedding

328
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,060
Did you stand on Relster's right?

329
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,500
But wait, Relu is with another dame
and they have a couple of kids

330
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,620
What a tragedy.

331
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,740
My heart bleeds.

332
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,900
Well, let's hear. What happens?

333
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,060
Do you have any candy for me?

334
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,220
Or do you just want to check
if I have begun sucking a pole?

335
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,820
- What did you say?
- Do not you know?

336
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,540
A hot day can be
50 degrees hot in the cells.

337
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Twenty buttocks, twenty mouths
which suck air and breathe it out.

338
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,540
It becomes harder to breathe.

339
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,580
So the old ones in the yard
gathering the fresh eggs-

340
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,780
- place their mouths against the edge
of a metal table, and pang!

341
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,980
They hit the back of their head
and break their teeth.

342
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,420
If they only have gums
they can not bite when they suck cock.

343
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:29,420
When it gets really hot in the cell
The fresh eggs suck on their balls.

344
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,700
Instead of air conditioning,
or so-called "sucking balls".

345
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,260
So, let's hear, Nico.

346
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,660
You came because you're interested
how i feel?

347
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,500
You still have your teeth so you're good.

348
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,060
That I was talking about ...
This is 5000.

349
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,700
That should be enough to begin with.
Then we'll see.

350
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,220
You look forward to it
that I enter 14 months-

351
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,100
- and then you come here to ask me
fix jobs for your whores here.

352
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:25,460
If you came here for it
was there a waste of gasoline.

353
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,420
I came because I heard
that you behave.

354
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:34,140
- Is it true?
- Yes, I behave.

355
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:39,260
I brush my teeth and
Wash my cock after a buttock.

356
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,580
We're done here.

357
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,980
Yes, I've heard you behave.

358
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,100
Otherwise, they would not let you out
due to good conduct.

359
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,580
Seriously?

360
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,460
I have to make a few calls to,
but it's almost clear.

361
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,100
That's why we agree, Nico.

362
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,300
You're a woman down here,
but up here, you're a man.

363
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,180
You have nothing to eat in the fridge.

364
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,900
I make tuna pasta.

365
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,260
I do not like that.

366
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,300
How can you know that?
I've never done it before.

367
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,860
I do not like pasta.
And I do not like tuna.

368
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,740
And I do not like your tone.

369
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,940
Do you have any flakes?
- Flakes are for girls.

370
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,300
I can drink beer
to make it more personal.

371
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:47,180
Can I ask something?
I hope you don't mind.

372
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,540
Can you let me fix the liquor
from now on?

373
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,420
I know how to mix.
Which liquor is good and not.

374
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:06,940
If you buy a rom or a cognac
is it usually fake.

375
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,900
- What do you mean?
- It's not genuine.

376
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,940
And therefore you throw up afterwards.

377
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:19,940
If they have spilled out with ethanol
you can even become blind.

378
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,420
There was a guy I know Paulicã.

379
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,220
Now he is begging on the street.

380
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,940
Unfiltered beer gives headache.

381
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,420
The usual makes you feel bad.

382
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:37,420
- Especially if you smoke when you drink.
- I do not smoke.

383
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,020
Not? Not even grass?

384
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:47,340
What the hell, boy?
Have you never smoked a joint?

385
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,580
- I'm ashamed of you.
- Stop it.

386
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,020
Well, so you smoke only cigars.

387
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:02,180
- Have you picked my pockets?
- It fell when I brought you home.

388
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:07,980
- sure
"You are toasted and can't be sure.

389
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,340
"You really bombed last night.
- I was just tired.

390
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,460
Come on, let me take care of it.

391
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,300
I can fix girls too.

392
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,620
What are you saying?

393
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,420
Then you do not get infected with anything
or get rid of someone hunched.

394
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,700
Should I call someone directly?

395
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,900
I'll call somebody.
Come on, you're grown up now.

396
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,540
I do not need your help.

397
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,620
Not? Okay. Take these money then.

398
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,020
Take them Come on, take them!

399
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,500
Buy what you want.
Clothing, computer games ...

400
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,980
don't want the money 
Mom isn't okay with it

401
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,580
What does she have to do about it?
She will only cook food-

402
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:01,820
- wash and clean
She's not cool like you.

403
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,940
Take the money! Live your life!

404
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,300
It's better to get from daddy
than to take them from a stranger.

405
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,700
A stranger can hurt you.

406
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,740
I have not stolen from anyone.

407
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,940
If you also lie, you're fucked, kid

408
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,500
Can you at least defend yourself?

409
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,620
Are you kidding me?

410
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,740
You steal, you're getting bullied
and you lie about it.

411
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,460
And you can not even defend yourself?

412
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,180
I'm going home.

413
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,820
You're not going anywhere
until you have eaten what I have cooked.

414
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,900
It helps against the hangover.

415
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,380
I'm not hungry.
I want to go home.

416
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,820
I'm driving you.

417
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,980
- Go to hell!
- Chuckie!

418
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,500
Chuckie!

419
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,500
Chuckie!

420
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,500
Chuckie!

421
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:09,620
- Do you really do that?
- Just a blow.

422
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,780
- I need it, I'm stressed.
- Why are you?

423
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,420
It's my first honeymoon.
I'm nervous.

424
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,100
You said you had escaped
with some guy before.

425
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:42,180
That cool guy.
Your former boyfriend.

426
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:47,140
With a mother who was a lawyer
and a dad who was a surgeon.

427
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,140
What was he now again?
Rocky. Rocky.

428
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,180
- Rocco?
- You're an idiot.

429
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,940
Rocco.

430
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,140
Ricky.

431
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,180
Richard.

432
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,580
Richard LionHeart.

433
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,780
Tell me now! Come on.

434
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:24,500
We ran away for three days.
I did not escape with him.

435
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,020
Because your dad found you.

436
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,180
If I really wanted
he would not have done that.

437
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,100
Do not be so sure about it.

438
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,700
Ricky was so bad.

439
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:51,780
When I think about it, 
dad was pretty nice to you

440
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,500
He may like you.

441
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,860
That's for sure why he is kind to me.

441
00:56:05,305 --> 00:57:05,849
