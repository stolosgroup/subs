<i>Previously on</i> Raising Kanan...

3
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:30,262
<i>What was he wearing?</i>

4
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:31,584
<i>In case you ain't noticed,</i>

5
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:33,826
I'm high as a motherfucking
Georgia pine right now.

6
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,005
Turns out Kanan ain't the first

7
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,388
young boy you been messing with.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,687
Like I said, I don't know
what you're talking...

9
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,631
I heard what you said,

10
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,771
but do you hear what I'm saying?

11
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:41,954
<i>He ain't dead.</i>

12
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:44,516
And if he ain't dead,
he still talking.

13
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,118
We found the person
who was with Marco.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,479
<i>It's Dominic.</i>

15
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:51,662
You and Howard have
a complicated past.

16
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,605
<i>You were his informant?</i>

17
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,184
<i>Turns out she's been
reviewing my records.</i>

18
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,528
Don't nobody like someone

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,787
digging through
they old shit, Cap.

20
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,331
<i>I'm detective Malcolm Howard.</i>

21
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,030
I need to talk to you about
Detective Shannon Burke.

22
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:02,333
Yeah, come on in.

23
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:04,816
When you playing our track?

24
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,778
My shit plays today.

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,819
<i>Not once, not twice,
not three, four times.</i>

26
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,461
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

27
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:12,904
<i>Don't you see I'm
tryna save you?</i>

28
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:13,985
<i>I was fine without you.</i>

29
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:15,827
I don't need you.
I never needed you.

30
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,388
Nigga, that's a daddy test.

31
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,990
Who the other nigga,
M.H.? Is M.H. Def Con?

32
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:22,753
Need a place to sleep tonight.

33
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:24,252
Traymont, I can offer
you a better product

34
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,235
at a better price.

35
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:26,477
I'm a businessman,

36
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,038
and I only fuck
with people I know.

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,800
Well, you don't know
me, but I know you.

38
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:32,402
And I know you don't wanna fuck
with Cartier Fareed no more.

39
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:34,564
Trayvon's boy got
caught with a gun.

40
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:36,647
Wants me and my
lawyer to get him out.

41
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,186
<i>And reach out to that
nigger queen of Queens</i>

42
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,450
<i>and tell her we need to talk.</i>

43
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:40,410
Maybe you should have killed her

44
00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:41,629
when you had the fucking shot.

45
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,293
Give me another chance.

46
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:45,697
You deserve the good stuff.
You know that, right?

47
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,020
Hey, Marvin!

48
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,478
Must be Thanksgiving,

49
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,679
'cause that's a
fuckin' turkey, boys!

50
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:34,600
<i>Ain't no such thing</i>

51
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:36,563
<i>as a shooter who happy.</i>

52
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,765
<i>Sure, them hitter niggas
might be living and laughing</i>

53
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:40,566
<i>and bowling strikes,</i>

54
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,728
<i>but inside, they broken,</i>

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,468
<i>fucked up in a way they
can't be un-fucked up.</i>

56
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,612
$320 you owe me, Carmine.

57
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:48,293
Double or nothing next week.

58
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:51,176
You've been saying that since
we started this shit at $5.

59
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:53,219
I'm good for the money,
cheating cocksucker.

60
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,743
Goodnight, guys.

61
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,509
<i>And that's 'cause they know.</i>

62
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,390
<i>They knew that all
that shit they done</i>

63
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:07,434
<i>gonna turn back around on 'em.</i>

64
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:12,397
<i>You a hitter, you gonna get hit.</i>

65
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,441
All right.

66
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:16,642
<i>Yo.</i>

67
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,808
You don't wanna...

68
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,612
Yeah, I do.

69
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:31,015
<i>Might be a bullet or a bid</i>

70
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:34,739
<i>or a motherfucking bus,
but one way or the other,</i>

71
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,141
<i>shooters going out
just how they live:</i>

72
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:38,502
<i>hard as hell.</i>

73
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:43,428
<i>And what do we say to God</i>

74
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,751
<i>when he takes from us
someone who is so young,</i>

75
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:51,595
so gifted, so good?

76
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:56,640
We don't say we understand...

77
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:58,762
because we don't.

78
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,683
<i>And we don't say
we believe in you</i>

79
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,405
<i>and your plan for us, God,</i>

80
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:06,890
because losing Renée is not
part of any plan we believe in.

81
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,892
We just ask

82
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,055
that you care for her, God,

83
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,698
love her as we loved her,

84
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,660
<i>hold her as we held her,</i>

85
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:19,702
<i>but above all,</i>

86
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:23,226
<i>protect her...</i>

87
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:25,027
<i>in a way we couldn't.</i>

88
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:42,021
- You done?
- What the fuck, man?

89
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,966
Ain't nothin' sacred no more?

90
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,768
Damn, can't a nigga
just finish in peace?

91
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,009
Put that shit away, Sam.

92
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:50,011
Y'all violating my privacy.

93
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,174
This shit is
harassment right here.

94
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,455
For real.

95
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:54,754
You're pissing in
the public park.

96
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,537
What part is that
private to you, huh?

97
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:58,459
- Any needles?
- Needles, man.

98
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:00,221
Let me see what my
nigga Clarence Thomas

99
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:02,223
got to say about all that.

100
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,265
All that right there for real.

101
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:05,907
I'm sure Clarence
pissed in the park

102
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,108
<i>more than a few times.</i>

103
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,509
<i>I paid for all that.</i>

104
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:10,592
Got a call you
shoplifted from Habib's.

105
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:12,993
Fuck Habib. Habib
is full of shit.

106
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,555
Seriously.

107
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,135
Yo, I paid for all
that shit right there.

108
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,078
- Everything.
- Is that right?

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
You pay for this too?

110
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,218
Nah, nah, nah. Yo,
check this out, man.

111
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:21,780
I'm holding them joints
for a friend, man.

112
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:22,901
Yeah, I wanna meet your friend

113
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:23,804
who trusts you to
hold his crack.

114
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:24,846
Listen here, man.

115
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:25,944
How about I take all that shit

116
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,328
back to Habib, right?

117
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,867
And y'all just let... Let
me hold them boulders.

118
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:30,050
Man, for real, for real.

119
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:31,051
No harm, no foul, man.

120
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:32,573
Yo, come on, man.

121
00:06:32,615 --> 00:06:34,535
I'ma lose my friend if
I lose them cracks, man.

122
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:35,673
I'm sure you'll make
a new friend, Sam.

123
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:36,697
You're a friendly guy.

124
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:38,218
I'll give you a tip, man.

125
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,878
I'll give you a tip that get
you that detec badge, man.

126
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,079
Get you up off this
flat-foot shit.

127
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:42,302
Let me guess.

128
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:44,063
You know where we
can find Jimmy Hoffa.

129
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,906
Nah, nah, nah, nah. I
know who shot that cop.

130
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,469
That detec that got caught
right in the park over here?

131
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:51,631
I know who put him down, man.

132
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,312
Just get in the car, Sam.

133
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:54,994
Five-O, man. I seen him, man.

134
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,774
I know what he look like, man.
I can point him out to you.

135
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,798
I can show you who he...

136
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:05,044
<i>It's Horatio. Open up.</i>

137
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:07,006
<i>I'm done fucking around
with you, Famous.</i>

138
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,049
<i>I can't wait on you no more!</i>

139
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,370
I need this rent.

140
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,092
I told you I'm
figuring something out.

141
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:14,511
Well, you need to
figure it out faster.

142
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,535
Like today!

143
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:17,416
I'm trying. We can't...

144
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,658
We can't put together a
payment plan or-or something?

145
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,100
A payment plan?

146
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,502
Famous, you gotta pay
to have a payment plan,

147
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,783
and you ain't been paying!

148
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:26,202
What if I can get
you that studio time

149
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,323
that Crown was trying
to get you for a minute?

150
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,027
You know, before he got caught?

151
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:29,988
Before that fake-ass Puerto Rock

152
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,350
got fished out the river?

153
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,272
<i>If you could make that happen...</i>

154
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:36,074
And I can't imagine you can...

155
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:38,076
There might be a
deal we could make.

156
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:40,358
But I ain't gonna lie.

157
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,799
I find it real hard to believe

158
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,322
you gonna give me and my
girl free studio time.

159
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,205
I mean, look at you, man.

160
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,806
Yo, you live like shit.

161
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:50,127
You got two days.

162
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,208
And then you out.

163
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:01,779
You think Lou could
do me a solid?

164
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,541
Come on, man. Why
would he do that?

165
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,901
I'm fucked, K.

166
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,463
You are.

167
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,228
There you go.

168
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,435
Congratulations. It's
officially yours!

169
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:28,126
- Thank you.
- It's a beautiful home.

170
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,852
That's my cousin.

171
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:37,014
He wanted to get a
look at the house.

172
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:40,696
I hope you make a lot
of happy memories here.

173
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,458
Yeah, me too.

174
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,182
If you need anything
at all, just call me.

175
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,291
What are we gonna do?

176
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,071
She has to know that her
and her fucking homies

177
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,975
can't go toe-to-toe with us.

178
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,737
She set up shop in our backyard.

179
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,779
She made you come
down on your taste.

180
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:26,919
She told you she wouldn't
give up her brother for Marco.

181
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:29,344
Seems to me she been going
toe-to-toe with us all along.

182
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,745
We can't make a move in Queens

183
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,386
without checking with
our fuckin' friend

184
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,309
in the fish store out in
fucking Howard Beach first.

185
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,872
And that cocksucker, he always
wants something in return.

186
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:40,394
She fucking killed Jimmy.
That can't go unanswered.

187
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,959
I known Jimmy since
we were stealing bikes

188
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,921
outside St. Lucy's, Dario.

189
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,042
I held his daughter in
my arms at her baptism,

190
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:51,525
for Christ sakes.

191
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,327
This nigger's gonna
answer for what she did.

192
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,449
<i>But there's politics involved.</i>

193
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,330
<i>Queens is a fucking
hornet's nest.</i>

194
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,132
And before we do anything else,

195
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:02,496
I want to know exactly what
the fuck we're up against here.

196
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:04,377
We're not going
through any doors

197
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:07,420
without knowing what's
on the other side.

198
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,786
Get me Unique.

199
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:12,585
What do you got?

200
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:13,666
I'm telling you, man.

201
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,348
I know who pulled the trigger.

202
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,670
He was right outside
here the other day.

203
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:19,752
One count of shoplifting,
one count of possession,

204
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:21,153
one count of public indecency,

205
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:22,893
and a dozen counts of
won't shut the fuck up.

206
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,517
Listen here, man.

207
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,377
Why don't you just break me
off one of them vials, man?

208
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,919
Show a nigga some love, man.

209
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,561
I'll make y'all
niggas heroes, man.

210
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:31,243
Hey, Burke.

211
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:33,143
Sam here says he's got an
ID on Howard's shooter.

212
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,065
Yeah, we already been down
that road with you, Sam.

213
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,808
You fingered Lee Harvey Oswald.

214
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,850
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

215
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:38,891
Nah, Detec.

216
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,452
I was fucked up that night,

217
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:42,174
but I remember now.

218
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,393
Hey, look, why don't you just
get me up off this bullshit?

219
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:45,697
<i>Everyone remembers something</i>

220
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,116
<i>when they're about
to get locked up.</i>

221
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,781
I'm telling you, man. It
was young boy who did it.

222
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,502
<i>And I'ma to tell you like this.</i>

223
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:52,922
You don't want that little
nigga in the street,

224
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,106
'cause he bought to
go from being a pup

225
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:57,269
to a wolf real fucking quick.

226
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:58,950
<i>That's my word.</i>

227
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,449
You didn't have shit
for us that night, Sam,

228
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:01,792
so what happened?

229
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,132
Something shake
loose in your head?

230
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:04,854
See, man, I saw that
little nigga out and about

231
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:06,518
and the shit all
came back to me.

232
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,479
Was that before or after
you sucked some smoke

233
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:09,600
out of that glass dick?

234
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:18,168
You wanna know
what I know, Detec.

235
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,850
I got the answers you need.

236
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,812
- Let's go, Sam.
- Where we going, huh?

237
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:23,453
- Right here.
- Where the fuck we going?

238
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,456
<i>Get the fuck off of me, man.</i>

239
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:45,635
Hey look, man, the first song

240
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:46,775
is getting a little
airplay, right?

241
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,277
It's bubblin' a little bit.

242
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,639
I just think that we need

243
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,601
to shift gears for the next one.

244
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:54,524
The first one was...
It was for the clubs,

245
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,485
but this one needs to
be for the bedroom.

246
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,007

What up, kid?

261
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,657
I was hoping maybe we
could talk in private.

262
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:32,699
I ain't got time for that.

263
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:34,282
Cartier is family anyway, right?

264
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:36,404
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

265
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,925
Speak your shit.

266
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,568
Crown was giving my
landlord free studio time

267
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,971
for him and his girl to
help me with my rent.

268
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,052
<i>Now that Crown gone,</i>

269
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:46,151
<i>my landlord asked me if I could</i>

270
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,455
<i>get her back in here again.</i>

271
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:49,257
But if I can't,

272
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,556
me and all my shit gonna end up
back on the street again, Lou.

273
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,620
Yo, yo, yo, I hear you.
I'll figure it out.

274
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:56,023
- We'll get you some shit.
- Just...

275
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,945
the studio won't
stay in business long

276
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,347
if we keep bartering
recording time

277
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:01,748
for your rent, my brother.

278
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,248
Oh, no, no, I'm not
talking about a barter.

279
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:04,992
I'm just talking
about a little trade.

280
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:08,074
A barter is a trade,
young hustler.

281
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,614
Look here, are you familiar
with the expression

282
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:13,320
"You give a man a fish,
you feed him for a day.

283
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,499
"If you teach him how to fish,

284
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:16,322
you'll feed him
for his lifetime"?

285
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:17,982
<i>See, a lot of people like to
think it's from the Bible,</i>

286
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,366
<i>but it's not.</i>

287
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:20,967
It's actually a quote

288
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,329
from a great Chinese
philosopher, Lao Tzu.

289
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:24,931
It's as true today as it was

290
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:26,572
thousands of years
ago when he said it.

291
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:29,496
You see, if you give
somebody something,

292
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:32,017
they just come back for more.

293
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,420
But you teach them how to
get that shit themselves,

294
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:36,022
<i>you've given them a skill set</i>

295
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:38,625
<i>that will last them for
the rest of their days.</i>

296
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,043
I was just talking about
studio time for my landlord...

297
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,186
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

298
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:42,508
What you about to do

299
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,390
is get yourself a rod.

300
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,392
Throw some bait on that hook,

301
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,793
cast that shit out in the water,

302
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,034
my young Latin brother.

303
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:50,115
What?

304
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,397
You're about to be a fisherman.

305
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,478
Lou, what...

306
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,999
And you'll never
go hungry again.

307
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,760
I'm about to be homeless!

308
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,407
I don't do charity, Lou.

309
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:03,648
And now that we in business
together, neither do you.

310
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,814
Hey, yo, what... uh...

311
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:09,935
what happened to that shit

312
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:11,656
about you being
a silent partner?

313
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:13,297
Yeah, well...

314
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,339
money talks, my nigga.

315
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:15,381
Let's get back to work.

316
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,631
Z, you ready?

317
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:28,792
Been ready.

318
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:49,413
Thanks for doing those, baby.

319
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,015
Didn't get a chance to do 'em
before I left this morning.

320
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,059
No problem.

321
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:58,382
Your father told me about

322
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:00,425
what happened with
you and Kenya.

323
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:02,705
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:05,829
I mean, she's the one who
left me in the first place,

325
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,310
so why I ever thought
it would be different?

326
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:10,313
Well, you want to be loved.

327
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:12,357
We all wanna be loved.

328
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:16,398
I mean, and people
can change, Juke.

329
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,240
They can get better.

330
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,285
If they want to.

331
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,288
Seen Kanan at all?

332
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:26,448
Little bit.

333
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,290
He's still over at Fame's.

334
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:30,334
He talk to you about me?

335
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:37,982
Juke don't betray
nobody confidence.

336
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,823
That's why we love you so much.

337
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,067
'Cause we trust you

338
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,869
with the shit that we
can't tell nobody else.

339
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:52,995
Not havin' Kanan
here has been a lot.

340
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,438
Feel like I'm reachin'
out for somethin'

341
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,721
that I can't quite get to.

342
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:01,282
And it hurts.

343
00:16:01,324 --> 00:16:03,644
Everything I've done,
I've done for him.

344
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:06,327
I don't care what nobody
gotta say about it...

345
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:08,449
'cause it's real easy to
judge shit from the outside.

346
00:16:09,773 --> 00:16:11,092
To look in on somebody else life

347
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:14,094
and point out where
they fucking up.

348
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,377
But when you in it?

349
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:17,676
When you gotta make
life-or-death decisions

350
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
for your child?

351
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:22,062
You alone.

352
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:23,704
Ain't nowhere to turn.

353
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,043
Ain't nobody there to
tell you what to do,

354
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,027
so you do what you
think is right.

355
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,247
You gonna do
whatever you gotta do

356
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,831
to protect your child, Juke.

357
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:34,274
Even if it means
risking everything.

358
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:38,037
'Cause, you know, this
shit ain't a short game.

359
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,441
We ain't playin' for tomorrow
or next week or next month.

360
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,362
The calls you make
for your baby today

361
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:47,046
gonna still be hittin'
hard 20 years from now.

362
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,609
Short-term loss turn
into a long-term gain.

363
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,532
That's the hustle.
That's the work.

364
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:57,737
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,141
Any of that make any sense?

366
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:03,183
It does.

367
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:08,907
Sometimes it don't
make no sense to me.

368
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:07,764
Didn't know you was Muslim.

369
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,809
Trying to get back into it.

370
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,255
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.
- Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

371
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,678
Figured since you ain't want
heads from the Southside

372
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,582
seein' you with me,

373
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:27,663
meetin' somewhere out
the hood would be better.

374
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,707
No doubt.

375
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:37,595
So how's everything
with your moms?

376
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,757
Can't really call it.

377
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,278
I'm stayin' at my friend's crib.

378
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,040
Mm.

379
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,244
I don't know what I can and
can't say to you, Kanan.

380
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:51,086
This right here, it's
all still new to me.

381
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,130
Uncharted waters.

382
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,051
I don't wanna overstep

383
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,095
but I don't wanna play
you to the left, either.

384
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:04,341
If you got something to
say to me, just say it.

385
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:07,784
'Cause I...

386
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,028
<i>I don't know what to ask.</i>

387
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,790
I know you my father, man.

388
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:17,992
I been knowing, a'ight?

389
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,995
I ain't need no test to
confirm nothing for me.

390
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,637
Just, the thing
is, with knowing,

391
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,920
now I gotta make sense of
all this other shit and...

392
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:28,322
<i>Damn, I'm sorry.</i>

393
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,764
Should I not curse here?

394
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:32,486
It's best if you don't.

395
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:34,969
Like I said, I'm trying
to get back involved,

396
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:38,252
so I'm sure Allah is keeping
a pretty close eye on me.

397
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:40,174
Make sure I'm on the
righteous tip and all that.

398
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,378
Look, all I'm saying is,

399
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,100
as much as this changes
things between you and me,

400
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,399
it changes things
between me and her

401
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:49,423
a whole lot more.

402
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,308
Did she always know
that you was my father?

403
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,756
I don't know.

404
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,118
I'm not gonna speak
for your moms.

405
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,562
That would be unfair
to you and her.

406
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,884
Unfair to her?

407
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:15,127
Are you... you
serious right now?

408
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,947
How you... how you talking
about being unfair to her

409
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:18,291
when that night at the park...

410
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,613
- I don't...
- She was the one...

411
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,537
I don't want to talk
about that ever.

412
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:27,339
You and me, we ain't about
what's already happened.

413
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:28,540
It's done.

414
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:30,822
There's nothing you
can do about it.

415
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:33,986
We need to be focused
on where we going.

416
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:35,426
Not where we been.

417
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,030
A'ight?

418
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:41,874
Yeah.

419
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,634
Let me drive you to the train.

420
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:46,918
I know who did it

421
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,418
and they still put me
in this fucking box

422
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:49,961
like I'm some fucking dog.

423
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:52,563
I know shit! I know
shit you need to know!

424
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,045
Hey... okay.

425
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,104
<i>Just get me the
motherfuck outta here</i>

426
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,087
- and I'll solve it!
- Take it easy.

427
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,186
- Take it easy.
- I swear I will!

428
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,388
Take it easy,
Sam. Take it easy.

429
00:20:58,412 --> 00:20:59,908
- You gonna get me outta here?
- Maybe.

430
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,590
I need to hear what you
think you remember first.

431
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:03,174
- Then I'll see.
- I seen him, Detec.

432
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,615
Seen who?

433
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:06,177
The little nigga
was on the stairs

434
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:09,339
talking to the same
fucking cop he wet up.

435
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:11,061
You're... you're
talking about Howard?

436
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,544
The kid who shot
Howard was with Howard?

437
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,025
That's what I'm
saying, Co-dumbo.

438
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,626
Who is the kid, Sam?

439
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:18,629
<i>I don't know this
motherfucker's name.</i>

440
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:20,128
He running around with this
other little motherfucker.

441
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:21,512
Some Latin nigga.

442
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:23,593
They call the nigga
Famous or some shit.

443
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:24,674
Famous?

444
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,196
That's what they saying!

445
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:27,357
I don't know him!

446
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,159
He don't look like nobody to me!

447
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,018
Okay, you might actually
have something here, Sam,

448
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,259
but I gotta go run
it up the flagpole.

449
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:33,461
I'll circle back on
you in a few, okay?

450
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,845
You told me you was
gonna get me outta here.

451
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,128
Get me outta here!
Fuck you, bitch!

452
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,747
Sounds like the natives
are getting restless.

453
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:41,971
He's jonesing.

454
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,774
<i>I told her who shot
that fucking cop</i>

455
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:46,514
and she said she was
gonna get me outta here!

456
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:50,459
<i>Get me the fuck up outta
here! Get me outta here!</i>

457
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:59,148
What is it, Burke?

458
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,751
I got a stack of DD-5s
a mile high to go over.

459
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,369
If I had a witness who
came in whose testimony

460
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:04,531
didn't match his
original statement...

461
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,395
Use whatever matches
the evidence.

462
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:07,654
And any other witness statements

463
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:08,757
you might have,

464
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,760
but warn the ADA
he's not reliable.

465
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:13,281
What's this about?

466
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,884
It's a cold case. Long shot.

467
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,406
Just make sure
you're not messin'

468
00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:19,207
in someone else's
rice bowl, Burke.

469
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:21,371
I don't even like rice, Captain.

470
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:35,062
Let me talk to Salinas
in Internal Affairs.

471
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,024
Don't know how you
got this shit done

472
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:40,308
when Cartier couldn't,
but I appreciate it.

473
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,550
It's called the power
of will, Traymont.

474
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:44,872
When I want something
done, shit gets done.

475
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:47,875
That's how I run my
business, how I live my life.

476
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,837
And I take care of my own.

477
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:52,479
My pockets fat,
everybody pockets fat.

478
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,004
Ain't no such thing as
winnin' unless we all winnin'.

479
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,005
Look.

480
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:02,529
Cartier ain't the type to just
let people walk away from him.

481
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:05,412
All that smooth talk
and happy bullshit

482
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:08,815
is just a cover for
one mean, angry nigga.

483
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:11,578
You and me reach an agreement,
I'll handle Cartier.

484
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,979
Uh-uh, we ain't got no agreement

485
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,181
until Cartier is handled.

486
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:17,984
Mr. Drew is free to go.

487
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:20,306
My man here a fucking genius.

488
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,108
Thank you for your kind words,

489
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,949
but it's less about my genius

490
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:26,352
and more about the
state's negligence.

491
00:23:26,394 --> 00:23:28,034
There were four people
in that vehicle,

492
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:30,436
and the weapon was tucked
into the back seat.

493
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,838
<i>They're gonna
struggle to establish</i>

494
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,537
the constructive
possession of the firearm,

495
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:35,563
and they know it.

496
00:23:36,604 --> 00:23:38,484
No more guns, Mr. Drew.

497
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:40,527
At least not here in
the state of New York.

498
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,172
I heard what you said.

499
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:47,214
I'll be in touch.

500
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,580
I think...

501
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:58,143
that bitch's blood may
run colder than Cartier's.

502
00:23:58,185 --> 00:24:00,025
And that's truly
saying some shit.

503
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:11,716
Turns out today's
your lucky day.

504
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:13,758
Got some hard cases
coming through,

505
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,079
and we need cell space.

506
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,001
What the fuck does that mean?

507
00:24:17,043 --> 00:24:18,181
<i>It means those rocks
you were carrying</i>

508
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:19,563
and Hershey bars you boosted

509
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:21,685
ain't worth the time
or space you take up.

510
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,367
More important skels
need a place to land.

511
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,012
Sammy gets to run.

512
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,178
It was a Snickers, motherfucker.

513
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,222
I don't fuck with Hershey's.

514
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:46,269
Fucking harassment,
invasion of a nigga privacy.

515
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:47,649
I shouldn't have been
in this motherfucker

516
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:48,872
in the first place.

517
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:50,713
You're always
fucking with a nigga.

518
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,355
Fuck that. Shit make me sick.

519
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:53,756
I gotta go.

520
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:58,601
Whoa. What the hell you doing?
I need him to stay here.

521
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:00,603
Got bigger fish on the
hook. Sam's been sprung.

522
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:02,143
Well, I'm questioning
him on some other shit.

523
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,607
I need him to sit
tight for a minute.

524
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:05,146
I'm doing what I was
told to do, Burke.

525
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,867
You got a problem with it,
take it up with the captain.

526
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:09,051
Okay. Let me walk
him out, at least.

527
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:11,296
Be my guest. Sam's
smelling pretty ripe.

528
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,976
Yo, you heard him.

529
00:25:14,018 --> 00:25:15,235
You ain't keeping
me in here, Detec.

530
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:16,578
- Fuck that.
- I know, Sam.

531
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,623
I just wanna talk to
you about what you saw.

532
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:21,864
Fuck you need to talk to me for?

533
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:23,162
<i>What the fuck is
Burke doing with Sam?</i>

534
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:25,787
I think they're dating.

535
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,110
But if you ask me, he's
way out of her league.

536
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:31,953
Overheard him telling Burke
he knows who shot you.

537
00:25:31,995 --> 00:25:33,755
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

538
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:34,934
He was already
brought in for that.

539
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,318
He didn't have shit.

540
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,697
Oh, but now he's saying
he remembers someone,

541
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:40,481
because as we all know,

542
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:43,405
crackheads have some
great fucking memories.

543
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:46,047
Burke's an idiot.

544
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,577
Hey, I need to get
you on the record

545
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:57,619
about that shooting.

546
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,300
And why the fuck
would I do that?

547
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,422
I'm out. I don't
need you no more.

548
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:04,625
You saw a cop get shot, Sam.
That's a big fucking deal.

549
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:07,430
That's why I'ma hold on to it
for the next time I need it.

550
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:10,311
Here.

551
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:11,673
There's more where
that came from.

552
00:26:11,713 --> 00:26:13,473
You do right by me,
I'll do right by you.

553
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:15,516
Well, since you put it that way,

554
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:18,518
I might be convinced to speak
my truth out loud for you.

555
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,080
Where can I find you later?

556
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,002
<i>Listen. I'm a
basehead, a'ight?</i>

557
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:23,764
There's three spots
you could find me:

558
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:28,207
the dope spot, the smoke
spot, or the mope spot.

559
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:30,971
I'll catch you on the flip.

560
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,552
How was the funeral?

561
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,395
You know.

562
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:58,717
A lot of crying over
shit that can't change.

563
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,761
You cry?

564
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,562
Shit, I don't know.

565
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:05,606
I had sunglasses on.

566
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,372
I've seen you cry before.

567
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,735
There's nothing
wrong with crying.

568
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,780
I done a lot of bad shit, Juke.

569
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:25,585
And I always been thinking
that I do good shit too.

570
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:31,388
That in the end, the good shit
gonna balance out the bad...

571
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,153
that I'm playin' even
in this motherfucker.

572
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:37,916
Shit not nearly even.

573
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,317
Not at all.

574
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,880
Yo, fucked up shit

575
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:45,683
happen to fucked up people.

576
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:47,965
And I'm fucked up.

577
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,210
So I'm sorry...

578
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:58,175
For the shit I done,

579
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:00,297
for the shit I didn't do.

580
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:03,620
And I'm... I'ma...

581
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:05,862
I'ma try to do good now.

582
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,346
For you.

583
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:13,149
For everyone.

584
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,480
You can't do good for me

585
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:26,562
or nobody else

586
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,444
until you do good for you.

587
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,647
Workin' on that, girl.

588
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:36,091
Workin' on me.

589
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:52,107
Oh...

590
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:56,992
Goddamn, Raq.

591
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,474
What is it, baby?

592
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:02,837
You know what this
is. You know who I am.

593
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:05,200
I am not a man who
waits for what he wants.

594
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,401
Well, it's not
about you waiting.

595
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,604
It's about when I'm ready.

596
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:12,487
I have a proposal for you.

597
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:15,609
I want to buy into
your operation.

598
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:19,453
For a 50% stake in
your organisation.

599
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:22,336
That would guarantee
your package.

600
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:25,419
I will help fund your
expansion into other markets.

601
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:28,462
I will assist you into
moving your profits

602
00:29:28,504 --> 00:29:30,984
into legitimate businesses.

603
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,068
You doing all this just
'cause you wanna fuck me?

604
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:40,353
Nah, I don't pay for that, baby.

605
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:42,636
Never.

606
00:29:42,678 --> 00:29:45,399
Well, I thought you said that
it was too competitive up here,

607
00:29:45,441 --> 00:29:46,799
that the margins were too thin.

608
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:49,923
Now I'm focusing
on market share.

609
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:52,726
See, if you control
enough of the pie...

610
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,167
Mm-hmm.

611
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,450
You start fucking with
the economics of scale.

612
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:59,212
Then we can drive the deal

613
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:01,855
with our friends
in South America.

614
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:05,578
We might not be able
to control revenue,

615
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,581
but we can control our own cost.

616
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:10,582
I'm trying to drive mine down.

617
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,830
You're full of surprises, huh?

618
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,231
I know what I want.

619
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:22,835
And I want what I know.

620
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,166
What I offered her
wasn't just reasonable.

621
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:35,486
It was generous.

622
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:37,769
Her brother for my son?

623
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:40,612
Not a fair trade at all.

624
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:43,254
Losing a child is like
losing a fucking limb.

625
00:30:43,296 --> 00:30:44,776
But I was willing to compromise

626
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:47,579
because I wouldn't even
want her to feel this pain.

627
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:49,741
Hell, I wouldn't wish
this on my worst enemy.

628
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:53,264
Look, I gots no love
for Marvin Thomas.

629
00:30:53,306 --> 00:30:55,428
I mean, then nigga took
shots at me and my son.

630
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:02,673
But with all due respect, Sal,
Marco fucked up the job, man.

631
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:05,636
Kind of tough putting your
kid's fuckup on Marvin.

632
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,758
He went around me, too, Marco.

633
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,240
That's not how business is done.

634
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:11,802
Well, he couldn't
have went around you

635
00:31:11,844 --> 00:31:13,884
if Marco wasn't down
for the crime, man.

636
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:15,927
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

637
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,368
My son vouched for you.

638
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,891
<i>He said you were a friend,
and I've treated you as such,</i>

639
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:23,293
but now you're gonna take
up for this fuckin' moolie.

640
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:28,218
I need you to tell me
about Raq's operation.

641
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,820
How many soldiers,

642
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:32,221
what kind of firepower
they got, huh?

643
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,903
Where they're working out from.

644
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:36,306
I need to know what it looks
like from top to bottom.

645
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:39,749
So you and Raq shit is
just you and Raq shit.

646
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,071
Don't got nothin'
to do with me, man.

647
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:43,753
It wasn't just me and Raq shit

648
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:46,235
when you asked me to
squeeze her in Newark.

649
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:47,636
And it wasn't just
me and Raq shit

650
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:49,478
when you had me hit her trucks.

651
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,041
That was business.

652
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:54,603
You got paid off
all of that, man.

653
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:57,968
The fuck do I get for stepping
in between your beef with her?

654
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:04,172
You get my gratitude, and
that is fuckin' priceless.

655
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,134
Look, man.

656
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:10,578
I dime Raq out to you, that
makes me a fucking snitch.

657
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,380
I ain't going out
like that, man.

658
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:14,783
No one's ever gonna know.

659
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:16,064
I'll know.

660
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,994
You disappoint me, Unique.

661
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:28,115
And I don't handle
disappointment well.

662
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:33,441
They'll show you to your car.

663
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:50,659
Thank you.

664
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:55,102
Appreciate you covering for me.

665
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:57,226
All right, man.
You know I got you.

666
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:02,829
<i>I don't know what
the fuck I'ma do, K.</i>

667
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,592
I get kicked out this spot,
I'm out on the street again.

668
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:07,433
I ain't going back to
no fucking shelter.

669
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,636
Look, I got a couple
hundred bucks I can get you.

670
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:12,599
Thank you. For real.

671
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:15,561
You always got a
nigga back, but...

672
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:17,461
my problem's a little
bigger than that right now.

673
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:19,487
- You know?
- Pick up for Freddy.

674
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:25,573
That's right, motherfucker.

675
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,577
You don't want none of this.

676
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:41,226
Yo, I'm broke as shit,

677
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:43,669
but somehow that
nigga is always paid.

678
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:46,431
You grimy like Freddy,
you can stay paid too.

679
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:48,713
Who the fuck want to live
like that cruddy nigga?

680
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,757
No doubt.

681
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:03,970
- Still good?
- Still great.

682
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,974
So what do you think my
next move is on Howard?

683
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:11,655
The next move is no move.

684
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:13,417
You need to leave this alone.

685
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:14,779
Digging up dirt on your partner

686
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:16,519
ain't gonna win you any
fans in the precinct.

687
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:17,822
I don't need fans.

688
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:19,865
I think you do.

689
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:22,508
I think that's
what this is about.

690
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,710
You're still trying
to prove yourself.

691
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:27,270
Prove to everybody
that you belong

692
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:28,530
and you didn't just get this job

693
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:29,593
because of your family.

694
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:30,874
But I did just get this job

695
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,276
because of my family.

696
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:34,237
And you're still a good cop.

697
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:35,919
Everyone knows it.

698
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:37,801
Everyone but you, that is.

699
00:34:40,406 --> 00:34:42,525
You're real police, baby.

700
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:43,846
Yeah, and real police know

701
00:34:43,888 --> 00:34:45,208
when something
doesn't feel right.

702
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,771
And all of this shit
with Howard feels wrong.

703
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:49,230
I just don't want it
to blow back up on me.

704
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,534
I don't want to get
caught up in his bullshit.

705
00:34:51,576 --> 00:34:55,458
Any chance we could stop
talking about Howard,

706
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,100
focus on us instead?

707
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:01,223
Who's Howard?

708
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,550
You know, just so you know,

709
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:10,611
I appreciate you putting that
Italian motherfucker down

710
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:12,995
for me, Lou, especially
'cause I know

711
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:15,477
you really not tryna fuck with
this kind of work no more.

712
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,922
I'll drop any nigga trying
to take shots at my brother.

713
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:20,845
Word up.

714
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:28,851
So you here with us, Lou?

715
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,012
'Cause shit is about
to get hairy as hell,

716
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:33,495
and we ain't looking
for no part-time help.

717
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:34,634
We need motherfuckers
who puttin' in

718
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:35,577
them full fucking days.

719
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,299
I'm here.

720
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:39,340
Any word on who took out Crown?

721
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:41,663
That nigga owed everybody money.

722
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,905
It could have been anyone.

723
00:35:43,947 --> 00:35:45,347
Look, I got peoples coming in

724
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:46,869
from Newburgh,
Syracuse, and Rochester

725
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:48,189
to back us up here.

726
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,328
Soon as we get our
head count right,

727
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:50,711
we gonna move on Bosellis.

728
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:54,194
Hey, look, I'm down. I'm here.

729
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:57,358
I just gotta say them
Italians is more deep than us.

730
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,201
Money, guns, bodies.

731
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,403
They got more of all
that. We can't beat 'em.

732
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:06,166
But we don't need to beat 'em.
We just need to make 'em bleed.

733
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,167
Okay, these Jersey
motherfuckers,

734
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,809
they ain't no real mafia.

735
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:10,108
They just some damn benchwarmers

736
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:11,932
who answer to the big
dogs here in New York.

737
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:13,373
They ain't got no heart.

738
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:14,713
Now, how you think
it's gonna look

739
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,497
when New York find
out Sal Boselli

740
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,698
getting bodied by some
niggas from Queens?

741
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,780
That's a black eye
for the whole gang.

742
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:23,623
Now, in the meantime,
I'm gonna need an assist

743
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:25,945
on some old accounts
that need settling.

744
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:27,204
I know you still
getting your head right,

745
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,028
but it's time-sensitive.

746
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,630
Collectin'?

747
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:32,752
No, we gotta cash a nigga out.

748
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,713
That crackhead motherfucker Sam.

749
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:51,491
Security.

750
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:49,546
Do you know what time it is?

751
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:50,948
Yeah. I need your mother gat.

752
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:53,910
- Go home, Famous.
- No.

753
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:55,992
I need that gun, Corrine.

754
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,514
For what?

755
00:37:57,556 --> 00:38:00,797
It ain't so I can smash
your moms like Kanan did.

756
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,318
Fuck you.

757
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,560
Come on.

758
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:06,483
I got niggas gunnin'
for me, Corinne.

759
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:08,124
I need that shit
for my protection.

760
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:11,225
Why the fuck you even protecting

761
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:12,568
your mom shit anyway?

762
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,850
Fuck her.

763
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:24,300
Hold on.

764
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:41,774
You get in any
trouble with that,

765
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:44,399
I'm gonna say you stole it.

766
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:46,561
I'll get this back to you
in a couple days, all right?

767
00:38:58,094 --> 00:39:01,616
I know now that you and
Nicole were being manipulated

768
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:03,097
by that police officer,

769
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,517
that she was taking
advantage of the both of you.

770
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,939
And I just want
to make sure that

771
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,102
that doesn't that to
anyone else ever again.

772
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:09,183
Who's he?

773
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:11,065
I'm Detective Edward Salinas

774
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:13,147
from the Internal Affairs
Division at the NYPD,

775
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:14,628
but I wanna be clear

776
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,630
<i>I'm not here in any
official capacity</i>

777
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:18,672
and this conversation is
completely off the record.

778
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:21,035
Mr. Bingham just thought
that you might be able

779
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:23,797
to flesh out what we already
know about Detective Burke.

780
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

781
00:39:26,522 --> 00:39:27,961
<i>When you called me,</i>

782
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:31,044
I thought you just wanted
to talk about Nicole.

783
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:32,525
Uh, we do.

784
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:34,848
I-I just recently
learned, though,

785
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,931
that... that this
Detective Burke

786
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:41,014
has been having an
inappropriate relationship

787
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,696
<i>with you and Nicole</i>

788
00:39:42,738 --> 00:39:44,057
and that it might've involved

789
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:46,859
her giving Nicole the
drugs that killed her.

790
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:50,103
- Who told you that?
<i>- Doesn't matter.</i>

791
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,385
What matters is whether
it's true or not.

792
00:39:52,427 --> 00:39:54,627
I don't talk to the police.

793
00:39:54,669 --> 00:39:56,046
And I sure as hell
don't talk to the police

794
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,591
about the police, so...

795
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,635
Lloyd. No, he... he's
not... Laverne, Laverne!

796
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,956
Damn it.

797
00:40:03,998 --> 00:40:05,277
Okay. She...
she's just scared.

798
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,017
She doesn't... She
doesn't trust the police.

799
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,401
Look, Mr. Bingham,

800
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:09,540
I don't know who gave
you this information

801
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:11,043
about Detective Burke,

802
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:12,943
because you refuse to tell
me, but I have to say...

803
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,527
I promised I wouldn't
divulge my source.

804
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:17,929
Without that girl corroborating
what this source told you,

805
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:19,291
we don't have shit.

806
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,455
Laverne will come around,
okay? I know she will.

807
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,464
These niggas ain't
got no fucking...

808
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:52,643
Yo, what, man? What up?

809
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:54,765
Yo, how you living, Sam?

810
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,607
I'm livin' large, nigga.

811
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,891
Yo, um, I need you to
help me on some shit.

812
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:02,453
Fuck kinda help you
need from me, man?

813
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:12,663
Paying in jumbos,
brother. Get in.

814
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,545
This nigga made a nigga a
offer he can't refuse, yo.

815
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:19,589
You know I'ma smoke
that shit first, right?

816
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:34,365
Give me what you got, nigga!

817
00:41:34,886 --> 00:41:36,846
You tripping.

818
00:41:36,888 --> 00:41:38,727
Open that shit up.
We going inside.

819
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,771
Why the fuck would I do that?

820
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:43,775
'Cause I'ma wet your
ass up! That's why!

821
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,300
Oh, you ain't gonna
do shit, Famous.

822
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:52,101
I know it's you, motherfucker.

823
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,144
<i>Bitch-ass voice.</i>

824
00:41:54,504 --> 00:41:56,904
You done started something you
don't even know how to finish.

825
00:41:57,508 --> 00:41:59,510
Come on. Just
open that shit up!

826
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:05,954
Nah, nigga.

827
00:42:05,996 --> 00:42:07,275
That shit ain't happening.

828
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,677
It don't gotta go like this.

829
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:09,677
Soon as you pulled
that shit out,

830
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:10,759
it was gonna be like this.

831
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:14,402
You done fucked it all up, Fame.

832
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,105
And you sure it was him?

833
00:42:38,147 --> 00:42:39,627
I dropped off the tape

834
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:41,748
and saw him when I was
walking back up the block.

835
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,007
He walked right up to their door

836
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:44,471
and started talking
to Nicole's dad.

837
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:46,673
Look, I could talk to
him about it if you want.

838
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:48,195
Hell, nah.

839
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,996
That police shit
is all you, son.

840
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:51,416
I ain't got nothin'
to do with that.

841
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,400
Shit ain't for me neither, Juke.

842
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,202
Ain't like I wanted it.

843
00:42:55,244 --> 00:42:57,924
Aye, you ever thought about
what went down back in the day?

844
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:59,223
I mean, your moms had
to have been mad young

845
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:00,166
when he stepped to her.

846
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,210
16.

847
00:43:03,412 --> 00:43:04,691
My mother was 16.

848
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:05,749
That means he had to have been

849
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:07,775
in his 20s or some shit.

850
00:43:10,178 --> 00:43:12,939
Kind of like you and
your girl's moms.

851
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:16,302
Aye, yo, it's nothing
like that shit.

852
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,703
Really?

853
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:19,866
'Cause the last time I checked,

854
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:22,347
she was a grown-ass woman,
and you still in high school.

855
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:23,647
Well, it's different
when the woman

856
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:26,111
is the one older
in the shit, Juke.

857
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:29,035
Okay, nigga, you keep
telling yourself that.

858
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:31,316
<i>It's the same fucking thing.</i>

859
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,518
Aye, you ever thought about
goin' back home at all?

860
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:36,802
To her?

861
00:43:36,844 --> 00:43:39,124
After this shit?

862
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:41,406
The fuck I'm gonna
say to her, Juke?

863
00:43:41,448 --> 00:43:44,489
"Hey, Ma, remember you sent me
to do that shit in the park?

864
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:46,811
Forgot to tell me that
nigga was my father?"

865
00:43:46,853 --> 00:43:48,855
At least you have a dad now.

866
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:52,217
How that havin' a dad shit
been workin' out for you?

867
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:54,899
Actually...

868
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:56,943
Marvin been tryin' to get right.

869
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:01,146
She ain't gone be able to
make this shit right...

870
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:03,189
ever.

871
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,647
Hey, you seen Sam around?

872
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:25,690
I ain't seen nothin'.

873
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:27,691
He told me I could
find him here.

874
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,735
Then find him, bitch.

875
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:37,781
Listen to me, man.

876
00:44:37,823 --> 00:44:39,422
You need to get on this bus,

877
00:44:39,464 --> 00:44:41,304
get the fuck outta here,

878
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,825
and never come back.

879
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:44,507
The Southside ain't
safe for you no more.

880
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,149
Southside ain't never
been safe for me.

881
00:44:46,191 --> 00:44:47,430
What's the difference?

882
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:50,232
Difference now is I'm
comin' for you, nigga.

883
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,995
If I see you again,
I gotta put you down.

884
00:44:53,037 --> 00:44:54,757
But why, Marv? What I do?

885
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:56,719
I don't know, Sam.
It... it don't matter.

886
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,882
Point is, I'm tryin'
to be better, nigga,

887
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:01,884
do good,

888
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:04,367
and lettin' you go like this
felt like the right shit to do.

889
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,970
Don't do nothin' to
make me change my mind.

890
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,736
<i>Sam.</i>

891
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:22,383
I know givin' cash to
a dope fiend like you

892
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:23,985
a bad idea.

893
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:26,348
I'm prayin' you understand
what I'm sayin' to you.

894
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,749
<i>Use this money.</i>

895
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,031
<i>Set yourself up somewhere else.</i>

896
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:32,193
Fix yourself, Sam.

897
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:34,237
It ain't never too late.

898
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,761
I'm gonna get on that
straight and narrow, Marv.

899
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:43,404
For real. You'll see.

900
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:46,126
I believe in you, brother.

901
00:45:46,168 --> 00:45:47,608
You just need to
believe in yourself.

902
00:46:12,914 --> 00:46:14,594
<i>Aye, yo.</i>

903
00:46:14,636 --> 00:46:16,959
<i>Aye, yo, let me off this
motherfuckin' bus, nigga.</i>

904
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:56,275
<i>It's a short stop at the top.</i>

905
00:46:56,317 --> 00:46:59,117
<i>Don't matter if you
a CEO, a baller,</i>

906
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:02,681
<i>a rapper, or you sling.</i>

907
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:05,403
<i>You ain't gonna be
the best for long.</i>

908
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,410
<i>But you tell yourself you
always gonna be there,</i>

909
00:47:13,452 --> 00:47:15,575
<i>that ain't nobody
better than you.</i>

910
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:25,583
<i>But it ain't even about better.</i>

911
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:29,109
<i>It's about that nigga who
younger, faster, tougher.</i>

912
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:33,550
Coming up.

913
00:47:33,592 --> 00:47:35,392
<i>That nigga who ain't
got shit to lose</i>

914
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,154
<i>like you do.</i>

915
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:43,000
<i>See, the thing about
the crown, man...</i>

916
00:47:45,004 --> 00:47:48,405
<i>is once you wearin' it, you
ain't as hungry no more.</i>

917
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:53,930
<i>You start feelin'
comfortable, safe, satisfied.</i>

918
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:05,661
You two don't even
trust each other.

919
00:48:05,703 --> 00:48:07,706
We family.

920
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:15,191
Bitch, fuck you,

921
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:17,073
and fuck your family.

922
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:22,638
<i>How's that shit go?</i>

923
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,682
<i>You done fallen, and
you can't get up, nigga.</i>

924
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,448
<i>And when you fall
from that top spot,</i>

925
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,249
<i>you down.</i>

926
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,091
<i>You down for good.</i>

926
00:48:37,305 --> 00:49:37,451
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
