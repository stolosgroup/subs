00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:20,996
Previously
onRaising Kanan...

3
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:26,105
I never wanted to
bring you into this Kanan.

4
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:28,586
You was in this shit
before you was even in it.

5
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:30,632
I need two units, one
on top of the other.

6
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,727
So Famous
gets free studio time,

7
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:40,990
and your niece gets nothing.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,446
You think I wouldn't get
you studio time if I could?

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,360
- Yo, do y'all hear this?

10
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:46,082
Yo, they playing my shit, yo!

11
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,910
What is with
you and that kid?

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,714
The children
are our future, Burke.

13
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,480
That's who you
got? Toni your big CI?

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,848
You're a
fucking pig, Marvin!

15
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:55,526
Fucking pig!

16
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,112
Our shit was
never real, Symphony.

17
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:58,416
This thing between you and me...

18
00:00:58,529 --> 00:01:00,400
We were on some
make-believe shit.

19
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:02,490
White girl
got what she deserves.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,709
World better for her
not being in it no more.

21
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:21,180
All this money and work
I got on these streets,

22
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:22,945
and niggas think I'm
gonna shoot a cop?

23
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,555
Fucking Raq.

24
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:26,054
She's gonna
die or go to prison,

25
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:27,186
and you're gonna be
right there with her.

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,690
You got the label,

27
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:31,388
so just bounce on
this drug shit.

28
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,303
Shut the fuck up
and drive, Jess.

29
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,753
I'm done
waiting, Raquel.

30
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:35,977
So I'm getting a
warrant for Kanan.

31
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,220
I need to talk to my son,

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,590
and you gonna make that happen.

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,005
I need you to squeeze

34
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:41,976
that fucking trigger
tonight and save me, baby.

35
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:44,575
He's coding!

36
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:46,795
I know you don't
want to hear from me,

37
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:49,082
but I wouldn't reach out if
I had anywhere else to turn.

38
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,812
Ha ha. That's right.

39
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:26,634
Nobody from the
hood never took no vacation.

40
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:30,638
No nigga I ever knew had
a damn summer home...

41
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:35,817
'cause there ain't no
time off from this shit.

42
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:39,690
Ain't no breaks,
ain't no sick days.

43
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,171
Not for me or nobody who
come from where I come from.

44
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:47,698
Don't matter whether
you on a corner

45
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,265
or on a fucking beach.

46
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:54,226
No matter where
the fuck you go...

47
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:55,967
there the fuck you are.

48
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,199
Deborah told
me you were out here.

49
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,035
I'm just taking a
last look is all.

50
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:24,430
I remember spending the
summer on this same beach

51
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,955
with your grandmother and
uncles back in the day.

52
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,697
Even had my own little
summertime boyfriend...

53
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:31,873
Rodney Dunn.

54
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:35,180
Ooh, that boy was
fine.

55
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:37,269
Turned out Rodney had,
like, seven other girls

56
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,097
he was talking to.

57
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:42,405
Of course, all of us
thought we was the only one.

58
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,233
Can't trust none of you boys.

59
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,368
It's time to go, baby.

60
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm so damn happy to see you.

61
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:21,923
Detective Howard.

62
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:25,345
Please, Detective Howard, I
really need you to sit here

63
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:28,364
so I can prepare you
to be discharged.

64
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,322
I came to this hospital
three months ago

65
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,561
with a ring on my finger, and
I ain't leaving without it.

66
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:34,544
I'm sure someone
from your family

67
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:35,763
collected it for you.

68
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,680
I ain't got no family.

69
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:46,382
I ain't leaving
until I find my ring.

70
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,953
All
I can tell you

71
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,173
is that Detective Howard's
memory loss is surprising

72
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,349
but not altogether unexpected.

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,718
The human brain
is a fascinating,

74
00:05:58,742 --> 00:05:59,830
mysterious machine.

75
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,571
It will repress trauma,

76
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,183
bury unpleasant memories
to protect itself.

77
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:07,272
So you believe him when he says

78
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,946
he doesn't remember anything
from the night he was shot?

79
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,276
Why wouldn't I?

80
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,298
Look, I-I think you're
missing the real story here.

81
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:16,847
The memory loss is a triviality.

82
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,675
Your partner is
a medical marvel.

83
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,764
Yeah, I know. I know.

84
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:22,437
If he hadn't been shot, we
wouldn't have found that cop

85
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,595
from the Four-Four who
donated that bone marrow.

86
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:27,268
Detective
Howard came in here

87
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,600
with a hole in his chest
and cancer in his blood.

88
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:34,560
He leaves here in remission
with both of his lungs intact.

89
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:36,084
That's about as
close to a miracle

90
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:37,825
as we touch in this building.

91
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,140
All right.

92
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:09,484
Player one wins.

93
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:12,642
Oh, yeah, check that.

94
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:14,122
Let's go. Come
on, you see that.

95
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,256
You think you'll come
back next summer, Kanan?

96
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,267
Now, why would he
want to come back here?

97
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:22,521
This slow-ass town... He
live in New York City.

98
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:26,351
Actually, it's
not that bad here.

99
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:27,570
New York ain't all that.

100
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,398
Man, fuck that.

101
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:31,879
As soon as I raise up
out of here, I'm gone.

102
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,533
- Where you gonna go, Eric?
- Wherever I want.

103
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:36,535
Mama ain't gonna
just let you do that.

104
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,276
Ain't gonna
be Mama decision.

105
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:40,017
Everything her decision.

106
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:41,410
Exactly.

107
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,065
If it was my decision...

108
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,067
I'd probably stay
here with y'all

109
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:48,243
and win at that shit.

110
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:50,723
See? Kanan
has said it's better here,

111
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,595
and he live in New York.

112
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,225
When I was out on
the beach with Kanan,

113
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,425
I was reminiscing
on Rodney Dunn.

114
00:07:56,555 --> 00:07:58,253
Remember him?

115
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:00,298
Ain't a girl our age from
here to North Carolina

116
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,997
- don't remember Rodney.
- Mm.

117
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:07,262
Last I heard, he was a manager
at some health club in Missouri

118
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,046
or Mississippi or something.

119
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:10,981
Yeah, well, he always did
love lifting them weights.

120
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:13,703
Mm, boy's six-pack
had a six-pack.

121
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,098
Look, like I said on the phone,

122
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:20,492
I could enroll Kanan in
high school here, Raquel.

123
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:22,059
He could live with us.

124
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,830
You know, the boys
love having him around.

125
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:26,063
And like I told you before,
Kanan stays with me, okay?

126
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:27,630
He go where I go.

127
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,564
I'm just saying that when
you sent him down here,

128
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,112
you said there was some wildness

129
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,679
you wanted to get him away from.

130
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,117
- Is it safe for him back there?
- Look, things quiet now.

131
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,555
Just some summertime bullshit...

132
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,339
Too many knuckleheads
out in the street.

133
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,254
You know how it is.

134
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:45,822
You know, your mom talked

135
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:49,478
about moving you all down here

136
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,959
before Marvin went
to high school.

137
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,701
But then that thing happened

138
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,573
with your mom and dad and...

139
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,703
There he is.

140
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:04,319
I want you to know that
you can come back down here

141
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,756
anytime you want, okay, baby?

142
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:08,540
Same goes for Jukebox.

143
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,499
And tell her I said so.

144
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:13,371
- And tell her we miss her.
- I will.

145
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:16,157
We loved having you here, Kanan.

146
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:17,854
I loved being here.

147
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:25,427
It's like
I keep sayin'...

148
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:26,997
Famous needs beats
to fuck with, Lou.

149
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:29,039
He can't just come up
with rhymes out the air.

150
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,649
Well, Phife does,

151
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,391
same with Q, and Guru
do the same shit.

152
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,959
Emcees write whether they
got to beat or not, Jess.

153
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,440
It's called being an
artist, being a creative.

154
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,244
I'm so tired
of fighting with you

155
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:41,636
- about this shit.
- Then stop fighting.

156
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,488
It's my job to push for
my brother's career.

157
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:45,142
Then take a day off.

158
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:47,579
I mean, you're Famous'
manager all the time.

159
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,070
When are you just
gonna be my girl?

160
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,194
I can be both.

161
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:58,634
It's a singles-driven
business, right?

162
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,331
You don't get two
bites at the apple,

163
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:02,377
Fame's track was all
right. It didn't move.

164
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:03,987
No, you didn't market it right.

165
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:06,859
The market spoke. It
said, "Fuck Fame."

166
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,644
Now all the little
nigga do is get high,

167
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,534
when he should be trying
to put in that work.

168
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:11,884
It's because he thinks
that you don't care

169
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:13,301
about him or his career anymore.

170
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:14,606
I don't! I don't give a fuck.

171
00:10:14,737 --> 00:10:16,608
You don't care?

172
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,934
If you don't care about his
career, why the fuck should I?

173
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,612
It's what you said, right?

174
00:10:20,743 --> 00:10:22,764
It's your job to give a fuck
about his career, not mine.

175
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,288
So maybe you should
take care of his ass.

176
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:27,010
Sure as hell ain't
taking care of me.

177
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:28,781
- Where you going, Lou?

178
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:32,182
- You know what?

179
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:33,799
You wonder why we always fight.

180
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,671
No, I don't.

181
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:38,804
Motherfucker.

182
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,097
Hey, yo!

183
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,247
Hey!

184
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:32,467
Yo, what the fuck?
Stay away from me.

185
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:34,140
Hey, relax.
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

186
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,600
I got mace.

187
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,187
Look, it ain't even
like that, sweetheart.

188
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:38,560
Who's on the song?

189
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,779
That's why you almost
fucking killed me?

190
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:43,521
Me. I'm singing

191
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,307
For real?

192
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:48,613
I mean, that's my shit.
You singing on my beats.

193
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,485
So sue me.

194
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,051
I'd rather sign you.

195
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,055
Look, My name is Lou Thomas.

196
00:11:56,186 --> 00:11:57,796
Relax.

197
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,755
You ever heard of
Bulletproof Records before?

198
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,590
Don't fucking do that shit!

199
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,026
You got a really dope voice.

200
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:13,682
Can I go?

201
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:15,292
I look forward to
hearing from you.

202
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:16,946
Have a good day.

203
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:01,991
You
ever shoot somebody?

204
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:05,403
You ever shoot
somebody and miss?

205
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,216
'Cause I did.

206
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:13,481
And I can't lie.

207
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:15,110
Looking that nigga in the eye
and squeezing that trigger

208
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:17,702
had me shook.

209
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,966
And when it comes
to that shit...

210
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:23,186
you stay shook until
you do it enough times

211
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,840
that you ain't shook no more.

212
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:29,236
And once that happens,

213
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,206
you done turned into
something else altogether.

214
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,415
He gettin' out the hospital.

215
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,246
The cop.

216
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:42,292
He don't remember nothing
from that night, Kanan.

217
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:46,035
Amnesia or some shit,
brain all twisted up.

218
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:47,819
I got people in the hospital

219
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,345
who say he barely remember
his own name, so you good.

220
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,695
I wouldn't be bringing
you home otherwise.

221
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,523
Look, if he did
remember anything,

222
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:57,022
the police would be looking
for you, but they not.

223
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,046
He ain't got to remember.

224
00:13:58,134 --> 00:13:59,875
What if he see me around the way

225
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,548
and it knocks something
loose in his head

226
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:02,921
and then he remember, Ma?

227
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,967
The ship's already
sailed. It's too late.

228
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:06,403
Ain't nobody gonna believe

229
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:07,554
anything that come
out his mouth now?

230
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:08,578
It's been way too long.

231
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,323
I'll never let
anything happen to you.

232
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,410
I got you.

233
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:19,111
You know I got you.

234
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:34,518
Hey, brother.

235
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,434
That, uh, girlfriend of
yours skipped town and...

236
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:39,958
Yo, Toni wasn't my
girlfriend, man.

237
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:41,569
Call her whatever
you want.

238
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,615
Snitch-ass white bitch,
that's what I'll call her.

239
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,617
Point is that without
her testimony,

240
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:49,098
they have no case.

241
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,708
You got no idea
where she posted up?

242
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:55,278
They're offering 100
hours of community service

243
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:58,586
or court-mandated class on
substance abuse diversion

244
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:00,152
or anger management.

245
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,985
You just said they
ain't got no case.

246
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,422
How it go from no case

247
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,293
to pick up fucking
trash in Times Square?

248
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,730
They still have you on the
simple possessions charge.

249
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,864
Reefer, they got me on
motherfucking reefer.

250
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,300
Shouldn't even be
a fucking crime.

251
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,823
And yet it is.

252
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,564
Look, if you take
one of the classes,

253
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,827
I could probably work it
so that all you have to do

254
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,831
is sign in each session
and then you could leave.

255
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,094
Put me down for the anger
management bullshit, then,

256
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:31,488
'cause them niggas gonna
see what angry look like.

257
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,139
We'll see if they
can manage that shit.

258
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:06,107
Can't wait to go
through three months of bills

259
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,131
and bullshit.

260
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:11,412
You got to get
some light in here.

261
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,919
I was gonna go get
something to eat.

262
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,292
You want to join me?

263
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:39,164
Uh, I appreciate the offer.

264
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:42,385
I got to clean up
all this shit...

265
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:44,126
start trying to figure
out my new life.

266
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,693
"New life"? That
sounds ambitious.

267
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:50,306
I thought I was dead, Burke.

268
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:52,656
No joke.

269
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:57,269
For a minute there
in that hospital,

270
00:16:57,356 --> 00:17:01,056
I-I felt myself leave my body.

271
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,754
Turns out I wasn't
dead at all, though.

272
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,843
I was being reborn,

273
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,716
given a second shot
at all this shit.

274
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:11,588
And I'ma do it right this time.

275
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,851
I'ma be the best version
of me that I can be.

276
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:18,900
Unique's whereabouts
are accounted for

277
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,728
the night of the shooting.

278
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,227
He wasn't there in
the park with you.

279
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,513
I never said he was.

280
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,820
All the evidence pointed at him.

281
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,711
I don't even remember
what happened that night,

282
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,519
so you're talking
to the wrong guy.

283
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:35,830
Howard, whoever shot
you is still out there,

284
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,354
and Homicide doesn't have any
suspects at all right now.

285
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:41,662
I'm concerned about
that. You should be, too.

286
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:44,229
I'm only concerned with
the shit I can control.

287
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,451
Look, when you stare death
in the face like I did,

288
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:51,454
you start getting real
philosophical about shit.

289
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:54,109
Like the song says,
"I think very deeply."

290
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:00,768
I'm gonna go.

291
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:03,118
Hey...

292
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,642
appreciate you picking me up.

293
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:07,272
I'll call you
later, see how you're doing.

294
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,296
All right, I'll be here.

295
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:37,282
Yo, kick the beat.

296
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:43,636
Turn around.

297
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:01,089
What the fuck?

298
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,004
Worrell still don't get it.

299
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,746
Them corners is dead.

300
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:18,193
We the only game
in town now, Kanan.

301
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,544
It's just us, and
we got shit on lock.

302
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:23,546
The beautiful thing
is, five-O can't see us

303
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:25,592
when we up in the
buildings like this,

304
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:28,856
but we can see them
from miles away.

305
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,431
When we going home?

306
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,409
Your uncle's gonna be crazy
happy to see you, baby.

307
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,748
I'm hungry.

308
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,576
I'ma get you something
right after this.

309
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:58,668
-  Hey.
-  What's up?

310
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:18,645
Why did nobody else get on?

311
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:20,603
Got to ask them.

312
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,937
You know, my
moms had the spot humming

313
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:33,877
like a motherfucker.

314
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:36,837
She'd taken over the
whole damn floor,

315
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,597
took care of the niggas
who lived in the building

316
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:41,711
to keep they mouth shut...

317
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:44,018
paid off the housing
cops and the supers

318
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:46,368
to stay out our way,

319
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:48,378
and was connecting the
whole building with drops

320
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,459
that went all the way
down to the basement.

321
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:59,642
And the whole thing was off
the street and out of sight.

322
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:01,688
So, as far as five-O
was concerned,

323
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:03,472
this shit didn't even exist.

324
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:07,650
Moms done changed
the fucking game.

325
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:23,883
Kanan.

326
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,284
Something I use.

327
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:35,199
Yo, look who back
from the beach.

328
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,377
What, you a-a surfing-ass
nigga now or what?

329
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,684
What?

330
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,991
Ain't no Black folk
surfing on the beach.

331
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:45,490
Well, let
me be the first nigga

332
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,297
to ride them waves, then.

333
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:47,559
You know what I mean?

334
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,126
Damn Jackie Robinson
of the Pacific

335
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:50,780
catching all 'em hos in bikinis.

336
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:52,260
It's the Atlantic, Uncle Marvin.

337
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,890
Yo, can you
picture me out there, sis?

338
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,611
Out there on... on my surfboard

339
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:57,142
showing 'em how us
Queens niggas do.

340
00:21:57,221 --> 00:21:59,180
You don't even know how to swim.

341
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,591
Yo, why I got to learn how to
swim when I got a surfboard?

342
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:03,097
Shut up, Marvin.

343
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:33,475
Open up five.

344
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,654
Couldn't believe my fucking ears

345
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:41,352
when I heard you might
be getting released soon.

346
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,180
'Cause I ain't
done nothing, man.

347
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:45,487
Maybe you didn't shoot that cop,

348
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:49,056
but you and I both know you
guilty of all sorts of shit.

349
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:52,189
I mean, everybody guilty
of something, C.O.

350
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:32,333
Yo, things
are going smoothly.

351
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:35,423
On track today to
do that god power.

352
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:38,817
Business is up, barely
keeping up with demand.

353
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,708
I told you
about this shit before.

354
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,473
They talking in code.

355
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:45,041
That's supreme mathematics.

356
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:46,521
God power is 7-5.

357
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,218
My uncle's saying they doing

358
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:51,352
75,000 in sales for
the day up in here.

359
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,310
That's some real
shit right there.

360
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,810
Some of the neighbors
downstairs is starting to beef,

361
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,662
saying too many
people in the halls,

362
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,927
that the stairs stink of
piss, and we too loud up here.

363
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:03,364
It's the fucking projects, man.

364
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:05,814
Stairs been stinking of piss
since they put these shits up.

365
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:07,039
Right, from here on out,

366
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:08,717
we gonna mop these
stairs twice a day

367
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:10,937
and get some air
freshener up in there

368
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:12,915
and spread around some
more money to the tenants.

369
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:15,550
Make sure they got their
groceries taken care of.

370
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,484
If any of these old heads
need their medications

371
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:19,249
or their prescriptions
filled, you know,

372
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:21,860
get one of our guys to make
that shit happen for them.

373
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:24,167
Marvin gonna be calling
the shots over here.

374
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:25,821
Since Kanan home, I'm gonna...

375
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,175
Sorry I'm late.

376
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:35,004
Late once, you're sorry.
Late twice, you're sloppy.

377
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,939
You late all the time like you,
you just don't give a fuck.

378
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,923
What I was
saying is that now

379
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,770
that we got this spot on
autopilot a little bit,

380
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:45,362
I'm looking to build, expand.

381
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,853
And that means that we got to
keep our shit clean and quiet.

382
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,888
Got to pay attention
to the little shit.

383
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:51,890
Ain't no problem that's
too small not to notice.

384
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:54,284
Like, on the way over here,

385
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:56,112
I saw Worrell up
the block slinging,

386
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:58,158
catching that heat
I'm talking about.

387
00:25:58,288 --> 00:25:59,898
And that shit ain't
good for business,

388
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:02,379
especially when it's
that close to us here.

389
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,357
Look, we need a clean
perimeter around our shit.

390
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:07,602
We can't have five-O
sniffing around the vicinity.

391
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,431
I'll take Worrell out.
I owe that motherfucker.

392
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:12,389
- Easy work.
- The best kind of work.

393
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,738
Mm, dropping bodies

394
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:15,523
is exactly what I
don't want to do.

395
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:17,655
And I got other
thoughts for Worrell.

396
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,267
Bring his ass in
for a conversation.

397
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:22,269
And, Scrap...

398
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,706
I need you to ease up
on throwing them dice.

399
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,553
I don't want you fucking with
your mom's card game no more.

400
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:28,275
Leave all that shit alone.

401
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:30,451
Look, we all on the
low-profile tip.

402
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:33,149
See, Scrap
had that gambling bug.

403
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,630
Got passed down
from his parents.

404
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,980
His dad was a bookie, and
his moms had a card game

405
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,982
in her basement every
Wednesday night.

406
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:42,332
Wasn't shit Scrap
wouldn't bet on.

407
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:47,294
46, 47, 47 1/2...

408
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:50,471
Come on, ain't no such thing
as half a fry, motherfucker.

409
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,951
One time,
he took $500 off Marvin

410
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:54,538
over how many fries
are in a large order.

411
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:56,303
48.

412
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,833
The
over/under was 50.

413
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,262
50...

414
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,829
51.

415
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,787
Scrap
took the over.

416
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:04,528
Pay up, nigga.

417
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:06,748
Oh, he got you there.
He got you. That's...

418
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:09,965
Look, the most
successful motherfuckers

419
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,642
are the motherfuckers you
ain't even hear about.

420
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,320
That's what we're doing.

421
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,192
Heads down, guns on safety.

422
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:18,542
- Are we good?
-  Long as you show up

423
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:20,303
where and when you supposed
to and handle your business,

424
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:21,458
yeah, we good.

425
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,856
I'ma go say what's up
to my nephew over there.

426
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:38,736
Your younger brother's
steady slipping.

427
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,411
I heard you was looking
for a backup singer.

428
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:03,239
I don't know, man.

429
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,067
I don't think I'd let
you sing me to sleep

430
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:06,851
with that wack-ass
voice of yours.

431
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:09,158
Wow, I just got back,

432
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:10,594
and you already being mean, man.

433
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:12,398
I should've stayed my
ass in Virginia for this.

434
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:14,542
- That's really crazy.
-  Yo, come here, man.

435
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:18,124
What's up?

436
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:24,042
So...

437
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:26,958
how was it?

438
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:30,005
It was cool. You
know, good to be gone.

439
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:31,876
Clear my head, see
what else is out there.

440
00:28:33,574 --> 00:28:36,664
Realize sometimes
it feel like...

441
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,535
shit, that this is all there is.

442
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:42,539
I'm not sure it's enough.

443
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,284
I don't know. I'm...

444
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm not sure if this
shit is for me, man.

445
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,246
You know what I mean?

446
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,030
Word.

447
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:58,251
- Yo, Aunt Deb...
- Oh.

448
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:01,906
Man, Pat, Eric, everybody,
they all was asking about you,

449
00:29:02,037 --> 00:29:04,170
wondering why you
didn't come down.

450
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,930
I told them it's 'cause
you had some shit up here

451
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,825
you was trying to
figure out, so you good.

452
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,567
It just didn't feel going down
to the beach after all that.

453
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:15,137
Truth is...

454
00:29:15,268 --> 00:29:17,574
it's not like staying here
made nothing better neither.

455
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:22,231
I missed the hell out you, kid.

456
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:23,624
Of course you did.

457
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:24,886
You didn't have nobody

458
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,975
to listen to your
whiny-ass bullshit.

459
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:29,282
Nigga, I just got
ba... I don't miss you.

460
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:31,414
I didn't miss you, then.
Whatever, fine, cool.

461
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:32,905
- I'm just here. Look.
- No, man...

462
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:31,126
Yo, these niggas is
carrying buckets of water,

463
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:34,216
arms all out and shit and
not spilling a damn drop.

464
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:36,307
Yo, that shit'll turn you
into a straight warrior.

465
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,527
You could use some time in
that Shaolin Temple, Lou.

466
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:42,442
Toughen your bitch ass up.

467
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:44,115
Why I need to do all that
when I already got you

468
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:45,532
to carry my water
for me, Marvin?

469
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:48,970
- Yo, fuck you, Lou.

470
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:54,105
- Oh, that shit funny, huh?

471
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:56,083
- He got you there. I was...

472
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:58,066
You know
what else is funny?

473
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,523
- You getting stung by some jellyfish down in Virginia.
- Oh, man.

474
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:03,114
Yeah, crying like a little
bitch for a day and a half.

475
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:04,396
Your aunt Deborah
called up here,

476
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,292
told your moms all about it.

477
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:08,685
Fuckin' fish had
your eyes leaking.

478
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:10,426
That's a bad look
for the family.

479
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:11,969
When you out there,
you reppin' all of us.

480
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:12,863
You remember that.

481
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:14,822
Wasn't nobody crying, man.

482
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:16,867
It hurt, all right?

483
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:20,131
It did, but the doctor said
getting stung by a jellyfish

484
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:22,395
is like getting stung
by, like, 50 hornets.

485
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:24,460
50 hornets ain't shit,
nigga. Toughen the fuck up.

486
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:26,094
You been
stung by a hornet?

487
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:27,313
All right, then.

488
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:34,276
How you doin' Juke?

489
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:37,105
I'm all right.

490
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:40,108
Smells good.

491
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:48,943
Haven't seen you in
damn near three months.

492
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,034
Mm, saw you at Grandma's for
that cookout three weeks back.

493
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:54,949
Right.

494
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,518
Oh, you... you sure
right about that.

495
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:03,218
I was thinking maybe, um,
we could talk sometime.

496
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:07,048
You know, just sit down
and catch up and shit.

497
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:09,224
I ain't got nothing
to say to you.

498
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:14,521
-  But I feel like...
- Dinner's ready, y'all.

499
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:33,901
My baby's home where he
belong, with his mama.

500
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,513
I need you to know

501
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,230
that we wasn't having
none of these dinners

502
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:40,690
while you was gone, Kanan,

503
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:42,518
because if your seat's empty,

504
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:45,173
we not sittin' around
the table like this,

505
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:47,262
'cause this right here
is what it's all about...

506
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:50,613
family...

507
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:54,878
us.

508
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,750
I know we got our differences.

509
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:02,146
And we disagree sometimes.

510
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:05,585
But at the end of
the day, we blood.

511
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:07,084
And that's way more
important than any static

512
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:08,109
that's between us.

513
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:17,684
Family... that's
all that matters.

514
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Word.

515
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,252
Family.

516
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:31,262
I don't get it.

517
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:33,439
I mean, you supposed to
be my manager, right?

518
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:36,790
Supposed to be makin' moves
for me, makin' my shit blow up.

519
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,835
I'm doing
all I can, Fame.

520
00:33:38,922 --> 00:33:40,707
I got your mixtape out.

521
00:33:40,837 --> 00:33:42,970
I got you played on
Stretch and Bobbito.

522
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,885
I can't make people
buy your shit.

523
00:33:45,015 --> 00:33:47,235
What about gettin' me
back in the studio?

524
00:33:47,322 --> 00:33:48,604
What about you
laying off the weed

525
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:50,064
and writing something?

526
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,022
Ever since you started
smoking that shit,

527
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:55,069
you've been sitting on your
ass instead of writing rhymes.

528
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,568
You told me that you
were gonna talk to Lou

529
00:33:56,592 --> 00:33:58,115
about getting me
beats to write to.

530
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,726
He says he wants
you to write first,

531
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,858
and then he'll get
you the beats, okay?

532
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,121
He says he wants
you to be an artist,

533
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,994
a creator, like Phife.

534
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,823
Yo, fuck this.

535
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:11,753
I already knew I should've
got a real manager.

536
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:13,522
I just figured I'd go with you

537
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,698
'cause, you know, Lou was
giving you that dick, so...

538
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:17,589
How the fuck you gonna talk
to your sister that way?

539
00:34:17,613 --> 00:34:19,136
Figured if Lou was hittin' it,

540
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,182
it might help my career
in a way, but, you know,

541
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,160
I guess what you givin'
up ain't gettin' it done.

542
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:25,099
- Fuck you, Famous.
- Fuck you, too.

543
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,057
You ain't gonna get a
real manager anyway.

544
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,028
So, um, what classes

545
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:42,943
you taking in school
this year, Juke?

546
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,903
School hasn't started yet.

547
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,474
I mean
when it does start.

548
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:59,263
Thanks for dinner,
Aunt Raq. It was great.

549
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:00,917
Of course, baby. I'm
glad you liked it.

550
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:18,195
Seem like you and Juke
really connecting.

551
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,458
Kiss my ass, Kanan.

552
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,552
Look, uh...

553
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:28,728
I know I been fucking
up, all right?

554
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:30,599
I'ma do better.

555
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:32,688
Heard that shit before.

556
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:35,256
This label is more
work than I thought.

557
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,060
I mean, anybody can do it,
but to do that shit right

558
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:39,303
is some other shit.

559
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:40,957
You know what I'm sayin', right?

560
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:46,594
How much you made so
far on that label, Lou?

561
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:50,271
It's a new business.

562
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,075
Well, if it ain't making
money, it ain't a business.

563
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:53,927
It's a hobby, nigga.

564
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:56,277
You sleepin' on our
business for your hobby.

565
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,974
Recognize.

566
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:16,471
What the fuck are you doing
smoking cigarettes, Juke?

567
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:19,735
The world didn't stop
spinning when you left, kid.

568
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,134
You ever gonna forgive Marvin?

569
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:29,005
Wasn't
planning on it.

570
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:39,296
Nobody at
dinner said nothin'

571
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,800
about what went
down before I left.

572
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:45,021
What is there to say?

573
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:46,675
It is what it is, nigga.

574
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,461
Man, I don't know.

575
00:36:56,816 --> 00:37:00,602
I was down there with Aunt
Deb, and I started thinking.

576
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:03,257
Oh. Uh-oh.

577
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,217
Kanan thinkin' ain't
never a good idea.

578
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:09,829
Maybe I ain't cut out for this
family-business shit, Juke.

579
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,921
I mean, I only wanted
to do it to protect her,

580
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:16,574
make sure she a'ight.

581
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,450
Doing what I did that night...

582
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:27,455
- and fucking it up.
-  Mm-mm.

583
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,563
They should've never asked
you to do that shit, Kanan.

584
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:32,199
That shit was wrong.

585
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:39,902
You talked to your
moms about it?

586
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:45,952
Feel like I'ma let her down
if I brought that to her,

587
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:47,562
especially after
talking all that shit

588
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:49,346
about how ready I was.

589
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,697
You need to tell her.

590
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:57,615
Look at this country-ass
motherfucker.

591
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:58,573
Yo.

592
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:02,577
Oh, shit.

593
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:07,800
He went to Virginia
Beach, Famous... beach.

594
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,105
What the fuck part of "beach"

595
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:10,672
sound like cowboy boots to you?

596
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:14,415
Virginia sound
country as hell to me.

597
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,001
- Yo, I missed you kid.

598
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:17,723
It ain't been the same
without you around.

599
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,899
This nigga didn't have
nobody to borrow money from.

600
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:21,770
Yo, I been taking money

601
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:24,599
from my mom, like, every...

602
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,862
Yeah, that sound
like a real solid plan.

603
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,429
Wasn't
no plan, really.

604
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,519
I was just doin' the shit,
few times here and there.

605
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:34,348
Like, every day on this...

606
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,527
Baisley killin' it.

607
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:42,312
All we got to do...
Drop off the dope,

608
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,706
pick up the money.

609
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:46,336
So now what we gonna
do is we got to take

610
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,970
what we doin' over at Baisley,

611
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,190
and do that shit somewhere else.

612
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,540
- We about to franchise.
- Like McDonald's.

613
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,455
Always comes back to
food with this nigga.

614
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:55,935
Marvin right.

615
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:57,937
We need to be
inside and up high.

616
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:00,461
Buildings, high-rises.

617
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,115
I'm thinkin' the 40s.

618
00:39:03,986 --> 00:39:06,554
Yeah, that shit might
fit the bill just right.

619
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:08,164
We can get lookouts

620
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:10,123
on one of those tall
buildings over by 109,

621
00:39:10,253 --> 00:39:12,168
and from there, we can
see the whole projects.

622
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:14,518
-  Mm.
- And even if they did find out

623
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:16,453
we was posted up in there, I
mean, there's only a few ways

624
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,784
for five-O to come
in and bum-rush us.

625
00:39:18,914 --> 00:39:20,892
Now, we get the right units
and the right building,

626
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,571
we're protected, even
better than Baisley.

627
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:29,509
And I didn't want to say
nothing around Scrap,

628
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,231
'cause I didn't want
him to feel like,

629
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:33,078
you know, he's getting
passed over or anything,

630
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:35,452
but thinkin' about
puttin' on Worrell

631
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:38,368
and the rest of Unique's crew.

632
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:39,935
Yo, you really thinkin'

633
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:42,329
of puttin' 'Nique's
people on right now?

634
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:44,133
I thought the whole point
was to run them niggas off.

635
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:45,723
Yeah, well, I'm thinkin'

636
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:48,378
we might need to do that
keep-your-enemies-close thing.

637
00:39:48,465 --> 00:39:50,119
And, also, it's gonna
keep 'em, you know,

638
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,688
from bringing the cops to
the corners around Baisley.

639
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:55,448
Look, we gonna let Worrell
get down with the spot

640
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:56,752
we about to open
over at the 40s.

641
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:02,218
Yo, we tried to kill that nigga.

642
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:03,872
He tried to kill me.

643
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:06,788
War is hell, niggas, but
we ain't at war no more.

644
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:09,051
I know who Worrell is.
I know what he did.

645
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:11,532
And I know what we did.

646
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:14,317
And I know Unique, too.

647
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:16,121
And I'm trying to make sure
that when 'Nique come home,

648
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,581
and I hear it's gonna be soon,

649
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:19,975
he ain't got shit
to come home to...

650
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:23,022
No people, no product,
no possibilities.

651
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:25,633
And having 'Nique's
right hand down with us,

652
00:40:25,763 --> 00:40:28,897
I mean, that shit
could be useful.

653
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:30,768
Marvin got Baisley.
You got the 40s.

654
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,292
And assuming Worrell gets down,

655
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:34,207
he gonna have to answer
to you over there.

656
00:40:34,337 --> 00:40:37,819
Marvin's doin' good
work at Baisley.

657
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,342
Give him the 40s, too.

658
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:46,132
- So you turnin' down work now?

659
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:48,438
Why everything with you
got to be a struggle, Lou?

660
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,658
Why do I always
have to be angry?

661
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:52,399
I'm giving you a
spot to fuck with,

662
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:53,767
real money in your pocket,
and you still complainin'.

663
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:54,923
I ain't complainin'.

664
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,838
Is he complainin', Marvin?

665
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:58,666
Bitchin' more like it.

666
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:00,320
You're runnin'
the 40s, Lou,

667
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,471
and that's how it's gonna go.

668
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:15,901
Hey,
hey, hey.

669
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:18,729
Y'all better not be
taking Scrappy's money,

670
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,732
'cause my boy promised
me a Fendi bag

671
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:23,996
for my birthday next week.

672
00:41:26,128 --> 00:41:27,801
Ma, way these
cards are playing...

673
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:29,566
Uh?

674
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,675
...I'll be getting
you the whole luggage set.

675
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:34,484
Come on, man.

676
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:36,008
You kidding me, man?

677
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,053
-  Mm.
-  Come on.

678
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,099
Give me my money.

679
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:42,101
Police! Let me see your
hands! Get them up!

680
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,146
Hands up!

681
00:41:44,277 --> 00:41:46,081
Everyone put their
hands where we can see them.

682
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:48,213
As much as
Scrap was about his business,

683
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:50,500
he just couldn't stay
away from them cards.

684
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,546
And that's weakness.

685
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:55,027
When something got a
hold on you like that,

686
00:41:55,157 --> 00:41:57,855
don't matter what it is...
Cards or bitches or dope...

687
00:41:57,943 --> 00:41:59,379
You gonna slip.

688
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:00,878
Detective
Peng know you here?

689
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:01,902
Where the fuck Peng at?

690
00:42:01,947 --> 00:42:03,209
You know the drill.

691
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:04,534
Get your
hands off my boy.

692
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:05,907
Get your hands off my boy.

693
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:08,388
Get them fucking
hands off of me!

694
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:11,478
Get them fucking
hands off of me!

695
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,357
Look who's
back from the dead.

696
00:42:22,924 --> 00:42:25,100
The prodigal son returns.

697
00:42:25,231 --> 00:42:27,165
Please tell me
you got better shit to do

698
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:31,106
than visit us in the middle
of the fucking night.

699
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:35,023
Hey, I was just
sittin' home, not doing shit,

700
00:42:35,154 --> 00:42:37,678
thinkin', "Where can I find
some like-minded, useless,

701
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,854
godless motherfuckers?"

702
00:42:39,985 --> 00:42:42,857
- Look no further than the NYPD.

703
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:44,922
Crime's down
since you been out, Howard.

704
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:46,339
I-in fact, we're
starting to wonder

705
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:48,123
if you were the
problem all along.

706
00:42:48,254 --> 00:42:51,083
-  Uh...

707
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,520
I got a C.I. bellyachin'
in Interrogation Two

708
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,304
that I got to go
deal with.

709
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,505
It's good to see you back
up on your feet, Howard.

710
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,618
It's good to be back
on my feet, Peng.

711
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,620
Let me go, uh, holler
at Burke right quick.

712
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,838
All right.

713
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,145
Good,
great to see you.

714
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:15,779
What? You're not happy
to see me or somethin'?

715
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:17,868
Oh, I was gonna say hi after
you and the boys finished

716
00:43:17,892 --> 00:43:19,546
measuring each other's dicks.

717
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:22,157
Shit, I know what I got.
No need to measure my shit.

718
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:23,700
Yeah, you'd need one of those
centimeter rulers, anyway.

719
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,736
I see somebody's been
workin' on their material.

720
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:33,212
What you got going?

721
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:37,738
That my shooting?

722
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:39,174
Homicide's overloaded.

723
00:43:39,305 --> 00:43:40,543
I'm just pitching
in a little bit.

724
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:42,047
Do they know that?

725
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:44,875
Not yet, but they will.

726
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:49,924
Look, I'm your partner.

727
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:51,708
If I'm not looking
out for you, who is?

728
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:56,148
I appreciate that.

729
00:43:56,278 --> 00:43:57,671
I really do.

730
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:03,503
Look, Burke, I can't have
you fucking up anything.

731
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,723
All due respect, shit like this
has to be done methodically,

732
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:08,595
damn near scientifically.

733
00:44:08,725 --> 00:44:10,565
So far, all that methodical
and scientific shit

734
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,816
has gotten Homicide nowhere.

735
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,123
Their one suspect had
a rock-solid alibi,

736
00:44:15,254 --> 00:44:17,560
and they're not looking at
anybody else at all right now.

737
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:21,303
Hmm.

738
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:24,524
Well, just make sure you're
on the same page as One PP.

739
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,134
Understood, Detective.

740
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:29,355
I'm tired. I'm gonna go home.

741
00:44:29,442 --> 00:44:32,227
Yeah, you look like shit.
You should get some rest.

742
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:34,099
You're getting good.

743
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:43,717
Get your
fucking hands off me!

744
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:45,849
You know who my
father is? Look at me.

745
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,721
You know who I am? Huh?

746
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,331
You're
the pretty-ass bitch

747
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:52,160
that's gonna suck all our dicks.

748
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:54,815
Watch where you going, G.

749
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:56,643
Keep walkin', coon.

750
00:44:56,773 --> 00:44:58,514
Watch your fuckin' mouth, man.

751
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:00,647
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it, ape?

752
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:02,866
Don't let
him get away with that.

753
00:45:02,997 --> 00:45:06,261
- Handle that boy, 'Nique.
-  Yeah, 'Nique.

754
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:08,481
-  What's up?

755
00:45:12,528 --> 00:45:14,288
You should
mind your own business.

756
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,492
This ain't business,
bitch. This is pleasure.

757
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:23,365
Break it
up, break it up.

758
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:28,631
- Yo, chill.
- They jumped him!

759
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:30,870
I saw the whole fuckin' thing.
These cocksuckers jumped him.

760
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,983
Yeah, that's what the
fuck I'm saying, man.

761
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:34,898
They started it, C.O.

762
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:36,949
- I just finished it.

763
00:45:48,303 --> 00:45:50,479
Kanan and I just
want to thank you again

764
00:45:50,566 --> 00:45:53,178
for driving him down
to Virginia like that.

765
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:55,223
Haven't seen you since, and...

766
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:57,593
we really just wanted to let
you know how grateful we are.

767
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:01,795
How grateful I am.

768
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,713
I'd do anything for
you and Kanan, Raq.

769
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:08,018
You know that.

770
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:12,564
Somebody gonna have to pay
me back for all the Cheetos

771
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:14,087
this boy ate on the
way down to Virginia.

772
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:15,983
You ate way more than I did.

773
00:46:16,113 --> 00:46:17,439
I couldn't even get
my hand in the bag

774
00:46:17,463 --> 00:46:19,334
'cause yours was
always in there.

775
00:46:19,465 --> 00:46:21,380
Nah, nah, nah, by the
time we got down to VA,

776
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,773
your hand was so damn
orange from eating Cheetos

777
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,403
that Aunt Deborah
thought he was in there

778
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:27,124
with some safety gloves on,

779
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:30,345
so people outside
could see him at night.

780
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:32,608
- You ain't right, Kanan.
-  Come on.

781
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:34,741
I'm all the way right,
Symph. We know this.

782
00:46:39,136 --> 00:46:40,592
All right,
switch to channel six.

783
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,290
Listen, we already had
this conversation, Jess.

784
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:43,793
Famous needs to write.

785
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:45,708
Famous been writing, okay?

786
00:46:45,795 --> 00:46:47,382
But he just needs to know
that you're gonna get

787
00:46:47,406 --> 00:46:49,799
behind him and his career.

788
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,933
Get him in the studio,
put some shit on wax.

789
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:55,022
I ain't throwin'
good money behind bad.

790
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:56,347
We already put loot
behind the single.

791
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:57,416
It didn't move.

792
00:46:57,546 --> 00:46:58,895
Knowing when to cut your losses

793
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,636
is a big part of
running a business.

794
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:03,639
Whoa, whoa, losses?
Who's losin'?

795
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,902
It ain't me. It
damn sure ain't me.

796
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,078
The mixtape's
collecting dust, right?

797
00:47:08,165 --> 00:47:10,385
We gonna have to
start all over again.

798
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:13,214
We need to see that
he's doin' the work.

799
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:15,172
Okay.

800
00:47:15,303 --> 00:47:17,784
Y'all didn't put any real
marketing behind Famous, okay?

801
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:20,787
No street teams,
no push on radio.

802
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:22,919
I was the one that
got him on KCR.

803
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,810
I was on that booked
all those gigs downtown.

804
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,401
Okay, I will say

805
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:27,944
that more could have
been done marketing-wise.

806
00:47:27,968 --> 00:47:30,187
-  Thank you.
- Yeah.

807
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:33,147
To Lou's point, we just got
to be smart about our money.

808
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:34,540
We ain't got a whole lot left.

809
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,368
We got all
the money we need.

810
00:47:36,498 --> 00:47:38,718
Just need to make the right bet.

811
00:47:38,848 --> 00:47:42,330
Speaking of the right bet...

812
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:45,377
this my new girl right here.

813
00:47:45,464 --> 00:47:47,683
I'd like to introduce
y'all to Zisa.

814
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:49,729
Found her at a red light.

815
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,513
Now we about to go on green.

816
00:47:53,428 --> 00:47:55,430
She can sing.

817
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:57,040
Let's do this.

818
00:47:59,956 --> 00:48:03,046
Who the fuck is Zisa?

819
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,634
You don't need to wait.

820
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:27,680
There's a long line
outside the bathroom.

821
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:30,683
He gonna be a minute.

822
00:48:30,813 --> 00:48:34,426
Look, I don't know how
Kanan and you were involved

823
00:48:34,556 --> 00:48:38,386
in what happened that
night around your way...

824
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:41,476
the night I took
him down south...

825
00:48:41,607 --> 00:48:44,610
and I don't want to know.

826
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,352
But Kanan is a great kid, Raq,
and he's gonna do great things.

827
00:48:47,482 --> 00:48:50,224
You just got to protect him...

828
00:48:50,355 --> 00:48:54,576
make sure he gets the
opportunities he deserves.

829
00:48:54,707 --> 00:48:57,147
You still think you know my son
better than me, huh, Symphony?

830
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:01,278
Ah, you never learn.

831
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,518
I know who my son is, and I
know what he's capable of.

832
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:05,718
I don't need nobody
to tell me that.

833
00:49:05,848 --> 00:49:07,937
He's protected.

834
00:49:08,024 --> 00:49:09,548
You can be damn sure of that.

835
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:18,383
Well, he said some shit to me
on the way down to Virginia,

836
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:23,213
Like I said, he didn't
tell me anything specific,

837
00:49:23,344 --> 00:49:25,868
but he was scared, Raq...

838
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:28,784
very scared.

839
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:32,092
He'd hate me for
telling you that.

840
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,398
I thought you should know.

841
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,533
I care about him...

842
00:49:38,664 --> 00:49:40,883
about you.

843
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:44,844
Man, the white
dude in front of me

844
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:46,561
blew that spot up before
I even got in there.

845
00:49:46,585 --> 00:49:49,152
My eyes still stinging, God.

846
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:53,461
What's up, we movin'?

847
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,812
It was good to see you guys.

848
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:00,689
I guess I'll see
you around, brother.

849
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:03,602
Maybe so.

850
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,823
Maybe so.

851
00:50:11,392 --> 00:50:13,046
Take care of yourself, Raq.

852
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,577
You too, Symphony.

853
00:50:27,669 --> 00:50:30,672
You still owe me for
those Cheetos, Kanan.

854
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:32,824
And I'm comin' from my money
if I see you around the way.

855
00:50:32,848 --> 00:50:34,763
Yeah, you can see me,

856
00:50:34,894 --> 00:50:36,330
but can you catch me?

857
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:39,638
Ahh...

858
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:41,770
Come on, Ma.

859
00:50:54,479 --> 00:50:55,697
So, before we begin,

860
00:50:55,828 --> 00:50:57,569
I like to focus
on getting present

861
00:50:57,699 --> 00:50:59,571
and focusing on the
breath by breathing in...

862
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:02,748
holding
it, and releasing.

863
00:51:02,878 --> 00:51:04,663
Do I sign
in or some shit?

864
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:06,012
Right there.

865
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:08,841
Um, excuse me.

866
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:11,670
- And you are?
- Marvin Thomas.

867
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,672
Oh. Hi, Marvin.

868
00:51:13,802 --> 00:51:16,805
I'm Renée, the therapist
who runs this class.

869
00:51:16,892 --> 00:51:19,852
Oh, well, nice to
meet you, Miss Renée.

870
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,902
Where you going, Marvin?

871
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:31,777
Yo, I signed in. I'm
s... I'm straight.

872
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:33,866
You signed in,
and now you go sit

873
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:36,695
with the rest of the
group for our first class.

874
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:39,393
Probably just
a little misunderstanding.

875
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:41,110
Uh, my lawyer told me
as long as I sign in,

876
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:42,396
then I'm... I'm good.

877
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:45,181
Good, as in you can leave?

878
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:47,444
- Yes, ma'am.

879
00:51:47,532 --> 00:51:50,143
Well, your lawyer told
you wrong, friend.

880
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,494
Either you sit down in
one of these chairs,

881
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:54,930
or I can let the court know

882
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:56,932
that you violated the
terms of your probation,

883
00:51:57,019 --> 00:51:59,848
and they'll find another
place for you to sit.

884
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:02,068
And I can promise you

885
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:04,897
that the spot the judge is
gonna find for you to sit

886
00:52:05,027 --> 00:52:08,857
won't be as comfortable as
one of these chairs here.

887
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,822
Yo, you for real?

888
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:18,563
Realer than real, brother.

889
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:22,523
I got to call my lawyer, then.

890
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,700
You do that, but, first,
sit your ass down.

891
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:31,314
So, like I said,

892
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:35,057
everyone breathing in together
collectively as a group,

893
00:52:35,188 --> 00:52:37,277
holding it,

894
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:41,150
and exhaling any
negativity.

895
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:44,806
Really coming together and
being focused in this moment.

896
00:53:57,313 --> 00:53:58,880
Yo.

897
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:05,321
She ain't no joke, right, Juke?

898
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:35,177
Shit.

899
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:50,279
What you think Lou would
do if he knew about us?

900
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,239
- Kill you.

901
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,025
He can't run the
studio without me.

902
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:59,158
He knows it.

903
00:54:59,288 --> 00:55:02,552
He's finding artists,
workin' behind the board.

904
00:55:02,683 --> 00:55:04,206
Lou's a quick learner.

905
00:55:04,337 --> 00:55:06,426
It ain't about what
you know, girl.

906
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:10,299
It's about who you know,
and he ain't got my Rolodex.

907
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,519
What'd your friend
from L.A. say?

908
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:14,173
He got a job for you.

909
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:18,307
Junior-level manager...

910
00:55:18,394 --> 00:55:20,135
Be managing the younger talent.

911
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:22,485
- Mm.
- That shit's waiting on you,

912
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:24,749
but not for too much longer.

913
00:55:24,836 --> 00:55:27,926
So, if you want it...

914
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:29,928
better get your fine
ass out to Cali.

915
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:33,975
I should just do it.

916
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:36,238
It's not like I got
shit keeping me here.

917
00:55:46,596 --> 00:55:49,686
You got this.

918
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:12,013
Oh, it's the bedtime
glass of milk.

919
00:56:12,144 --> 00:56:13,599
I've been doing it since
you got out your crib.

920
00:56:13,623 --> 00:56:14,623
Thank you.

921
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:18,803
How you doin'?

922
00:56:20,935 --> 00:56:23,155
I feel like I lost track of you.

923
00:56:23,285 --> 00:56:25,002
Like, I used to always
know what you was thinking,

924
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:27,812
but now that you older,
not so much anymore.

925
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:33,165
Why you got to grow up, hmm?

926
00:56:33,295 --> 00:56:34,819
Why can't you just stay my baby?

927
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,215
You know, sometimes

928
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't even know what
I'm thinking myself.

929
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:47,353
Talk to me, Kanan.

930
00:56:47,483 --> 00:56:50,225
You can say anything
to me, always.

931
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:55,578
I don't want to disappoint you.

932
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:58,668
Well, I mean, if you honest,
you'll never disappoint me.

933
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,932
Tell me what you thinkin'.

934
00:57:01,062 --> 00:57:02,847
Let me in.

935
00:57:06,285 --> 00:57:07,852
I thought I was
cut out for it...

936
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,858
for what you and Uncle
Marvin and Uncle Lou do.

937
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:17,992
I mean, I'm your son.

938
00:57:18,123 --> 00:57:20,952
I'm Def Con's son.

939
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,042
Y'all both did it, so
I thought I would, too.

940
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,050
But maybe not.

941
00:57:34,269 --> 00:57:36,271
Maybe I was supposed
to do something else...

942
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,885
to be someone else.

943
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:47,500
Doing what I did that night...

944
00:57:51,373 --> 00:57:53,288
looking that cop in the face...

945
00:57:56,857 --> 00:57:59,164
messed with my head,

946
00:57:59,294 --> 00:58:02,776
like, nightmares and shit.

947
00:58:02,907 --> 00:58:06,258
And, yeah, I know I was all
over you about putting me on

948
00:58:06,388 --> 00:58:08,303
and getting me started
in the business, but...

949
00:58:10,436 --> 00:58:12,116
shit, I'm starting
to think I was wrong.

950
00:58:13,787 --> 00:58:15,920
I don't think I'm
up for any of this.

951
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:21,316
I can't protect you the way
that I thought I could, Ma.

952
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:27,670
You're not supposed to
protect your mother, Kanan.

953
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:29,803
I'm supposed to protect you.

954
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:33,676
And I didn't.

955
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:43,121
I put you in harm's way.

956
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:46,428
And that's on me.

957
00:58:49,779 --> 00:58:51,651
That's always gonna be on me.

958
00:58:56,786 --> 00:58:58,223
I'm sorry.

959
00:59:01,487 --> 00:59:04,098
Everything I'm doing...

960
00:59:04,229 --> 00:59:06,405
I mean, I'm doing
for you, Kanan...

961
00:59:06,492 --> 00:59:08,102
for us.

962
00:59:09,974 --> 00:59:12,889
And if you're not happy,
if you don't feel safe,

963
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,023
then I'm... I'm doing
all this for nothing.

964
00:59:26,381 --> 00:59:27,556
I love you.

965
00:59:31,038 --> 00:59:32,953
I love you, too.

966
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:38,263
Mom, you should probably
go get that phone.

967
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:00,763
Niggas say you
only do two days in the pen...

968
01:00:00,894 --> 01:00:04,245
The day you go in and
the day you come out.

969
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:06,508
Ask me, that's just some shit

970
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:09,729
somebody who never
been to the joint said.

971
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:11,818
As far as I'm concerned,

972
01:00:11,948 --> 01:00:14,560
you do every fucking
day in there.

973
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,518
You do the days,

974
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:19,347
but you can't let
the days do you.

975
01:00:19,478 --> 01:00:22,046
When you come out, you got
to be the same nigga you was

976
01:00:22,176 --> 01:00:25,005
when you went in...

977
01:00:25,136 --> 01:00:26,746
only harder...

978
01:00:35,015 --> 01:00:36,538
colder...

979
01:00:48,594 --> 01:00:51,379
'cause while your life
got stopped for your bid,

980
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:55,122
everybody outside kept moving...

981
01:00:55,209 --> 01:00:56,776
and they ain't checking for you.

982
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:02,260
They ain't give
a fuck about you.

983
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,479
So you got to show
'em you still here,

984
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,742
you still matter.

985
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,614
You need to remind them.

986
01:01:12,183 --> 01:01:14,707
Make 'em remember you so
they never forget again.

986
01:01:15,305 --> 01:02:15,704
