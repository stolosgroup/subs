1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:20,649
<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color=#fffc50>"Raising Kanan"...</font>

3
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,171
All I want is for Kanan
to know I'm his father.

4
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,539
Truth is, I don't even know
who Kanan daddy is.

5
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:27,121
I don't remember shit
from that night.

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,036
The kid...
He can't shoot for shit.

7
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:30,390
That crazy-ass cop.

8
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:31,970
I thought you said he
didn't remember my face, Mom.

9
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:33,031
What is this?

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,739
- I want you out.
- Where am I gonna go?

11
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:36,344
I don't have any money.

12
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:38,045
I don't know, and I don't care!

13
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:39,658
What you think about hustling
in my mix tapes?

14
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:41,747
Yo, you like music? You got
to check out his mix tape, man,

15
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:43,270
Puerto Rican Famous...

16
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:44,576
He like the next LL, for real,
right here.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,500
- What you boys selling?
- Mixtapes, man.

18
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:47,971
All right, the both of you,
up against the wall.

19
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,929
What the fuck are you doing?

20
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,322
The rats are too many.

21
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:53,150
Call a exterminator,
Juliana.

22
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:54,804
You have
all this money sitting here.

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,370
Why don't you spend it?

24
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,198
- You remember my mom at all?
- Of course.

25
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:01,140
She lives in Harlem...
Divorced twice, no kids.

26
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:03,797
Yeah, Zisa here... she's
the cream of the proverbial crop.

27
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:06,191
- I propose a single deal.
- Done.

28
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:07,375
What the fuck?

29
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,552
- I'm moving, Lou.
- You're leaving tomorrow?

30
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:10,902
I got to look out for myself

31
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,297
because no one else
is gonna do it.

32
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,343
I saw Raq today.
It scared me.

33
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,434
It scared me for all of us...
For me, you, and Jerome.

34
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:18,480
Raq ain't gonna do nothing
to us, all right?

35
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:20,351
Why y'all want to mess with me?

36
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:21,563
We know you a hell
of an earner.

37
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,493
We got to get the team
back together, man.

38
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:24,907
I'm on the other shit, 'Nique.

39
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,531
What, you on Raq's dick, nigga?

40
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:29,839
But y'all giving 40 projects
to Unique's boy instead of me?

41
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,093
I've been down with
y'all niggas since I was 14!

42
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,156
We got you, Scrap.

43
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,470
- You got a snitch.
- Scrap?

44
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:35,453
He working with us.

45
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,802
Scrap could put us
all away forever.

46
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:37,934
Let's do this, then.

47
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,849
Oh.

48
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,154

Hey! Put it back.

89
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:30,181
...from
the crackhead telling you

90
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,140
he'll get you next time
when he coppin'

91
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,120
to the corner boy bullshittin'
about how clean his dope is

92
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:37,339
to the cop
who's skimmin' off his bust.

93
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,768
Everyone's full of shit.

94
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:43,281
Eighty-nine cents.

95
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,153
The truth
is like that fucking J Train.

96
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,643
Shit might be slow,
might be late,

97
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:51,150
might even skip a few stops
along the way...

98
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,947
...but the truth's comin'...

99
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:59,210
so pay
your fuckin' fare, nigga.

100
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:12,006
Yo, how you livin', B?

101
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,838
My mother ain't here, man.

102
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,231
I know. I saw her leave.

103
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:24,705
I just wanted to spit at you
right quick.

104
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:26,676
Get in.

105
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,752
What your mom's
told you about me?

106
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,197
Like I told you before,
we don't really talk about you.

107
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:16,869
What I'm about to tell you...

108
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:20,877
is gonna be the craziest shit
you ever heard...

109
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:23,635
but the realest shit
I'ma ever say.

110
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:39,938
I'm your father, Kanan.

111
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,188
Shit crazy, right?

112
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,799
It made me laugh, too.

113
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,192
Your whole life,
you've been thinking

114
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,643
Def Con your daddy,
but he ain't.

115
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,805
I am.

116
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,374
Everything that happened
with your mother,

117
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,636
that's for another day,

118
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,073
but I only found out
recently myself.

119
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,784
Had I known before
when you was younger, you know,

120
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:07,089
I-I'd like to say

121
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:08,601
I would've been there for you
and all of that, but...

122
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:11,560
...who knows?

123
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:14,041
The truth is, all this time,

124
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,826
I ain't been giving a fuck
about nobody but me.

125
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,657
I know this is a lot
to take in.

126
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:24,112
I don't expect you
to say nothing now, but...

127
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:28,334
...I want to be
in your life, Kanan.

128
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,974
Whatever that means,
whatever that looks like...

129
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:35,515
that's what I want.

130
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:40,328
I'm supposed to go meet up
with my friends,

131
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:42,939
and I'm, uh, already
running late, so...

132
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,202
No doubt.
Go link with your peoples.

133
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,769
I'll be around.

134
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,688
Yo, your mom's gonna say
I'm crazy.

135
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,385
I'm not.

136
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,931
Whoever said
New Jersey America's armpit

137
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,411
is talkin' mad shit
about armpits.

138
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:23,153
Feel just like home to me.

139
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,503
Worrell's cousin live out here.

140
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:27,636
Told him that the crew
that was runnin' these blocks

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,421
just got rolled up by the feds.

142
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,946
Ain't been stepped in yet.

143
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,425
And there's a whole
lot of demand,

144
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:35,644
and we about to be the new
supply.

145
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,864
Worrell callin' shots now?

146
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,256
I'm callin' shots.

147
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,910
Worrell, he just looking out,

148
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,520
which is what
you supposed to do.

149
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:45,480
We already up in Baisley's
and the Forties.

150
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,134
We really need to fuck
with Jersey right now?

151
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,876
We tryin' to grow,
Marvin, build.

152
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,486
And New York
is already spoken for.

153
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,923
The real opportunities
are outside the city.

154
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,796
You makin' big decisions quick.

155
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,972
Maybe we need to take a minute.

156
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:01,975
My decisions are keeping
you paid and off of Rikers.

157
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:04,542
I'm just saying...

158
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,979
we don't know
the players in Jersey.

159
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,198
But we know the game.

160
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:10,200
Spot gonna be yours, Damon.

161
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,680
Yeah, you gonna be
in charge out here.

162
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,160
Now, spread around some cash,
get y'all crewed up,

163
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,336
and then you gonna be up
and running.

164
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,207
But for now, we gonna bust out
some work to you

165
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,774
from my lab on the South side.

166
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,821
Y'all already know
I'm down for whatever... bet.

167
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:23,666

Yo, that's my niece
right there.

188
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,922
What I tell you?
Fucking told you, right?

189
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,315
Right there,
that's my niece, man.

190
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,317
You know, I-I helped to produce
the music and all that,

191
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:11,452
but the vocals and the lyrics,
I mean, that's all her.

192
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:14,934
I mean, God damn,
I felt all that.

193
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,980
For real.
Your words was hittin'.

194
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:19,957
Your vocals are strong as hell.

195
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:23,873
But the look, uh...

196
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,120
You supposed to look
like a bitch that niggas

197
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,382
want to fuck with.

198
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,863
Is you buggin', nigga?

199
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:34,605
When I close my eyes,
it's like I'm loving you.

200
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,303
I open my eyes, and I'm like,

201
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,087
"Who is this girl looking like
she in New Edition?"

202
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,828
Who the fuck is you talkin' to?

203
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,830
That is my niece, nigga.
Watch your fucking mouth.

204
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:44,528
How you look is just
as important as how you sound.

205
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:47,488
Nigga, don't tell me Zisa bein'
a dime and all sexy and shit

206
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:48,881
wasn't the reason you wanted
to sign her in the first place.

207
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,621
Shit matters.

208
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:53,164
Juke ain't Zisa,
and Zisa ain't Juke.

209
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,560
Hey, Juke, um...

210
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,069
Crown ain't all the way wrong.

211
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:05,158
You beautiful.

212
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:07,987
You got to tap
into that beauty, right?

213
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:10,554
And put it out there
so everybody else can see it.

214
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:13,949
This is who I am, Uncle Lou.

215
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,864
This is me.

216
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:18,345
What you see, that's who I am.

217
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,042
That's what I'm saying.

218
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,002
You, you beautiful.

219
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:24,568
I'm telling you that we should
share that with the world.

220
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:26,309
That's all.

221
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,964
Uh-huh, okay, so what
y'all are telling me is

222
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:30,618
y'all want me walking around
looking like a hoochie?

223
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:32,359
- Pretty much.
- Fuck out of here with...

224
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:33,316
It's not about you
being no hoochie.

225
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,144
Right.

226
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,319
All I'm saying
is I want you to maximize

227
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,209
what you already have,
that's all.

228
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,042
It ain't... that wasn't...

229
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,028
I'll get at you later.

230
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:51,378
Juke, Juke, you know
that's not what I meant.

231
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,032
That's... I-I...
It came out wrong.

232
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,251
Y-you're beautiful
is what I'm...

233
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:57,003
I'm just sayin' you...

234
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,433
She's a kid.
You watch how you talk to her.

235
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,913
Don't matter how old she is.

236
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:08,395
She want it,
she got to know what it takes.

237
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,049
And so do you.

238
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,268
You know about a lot of shit,
don't you, Crown?

239
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:14,401
I think I know enough, nigga.

240
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,707
Like where my girl
can find a job in Cali, right?

241
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,972
Jessica asked me, so I was
just lookin' out for her,

242
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,670
like I would do for you
or anybody.

243
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:25,151
Don't be hatin' on a nigga
'cause he a little generous.

244
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:27,762
Now, why would I hate
on you for being generous

245
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:30,330
when you give me so many
other reasons to hate on you?

246
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:32,288
I'm not angry.

247
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,334
I just...

248
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,814
feel dead,

249
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:41,297
like I can't feel anything
or care about anything.

250
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:42,908
Could it be
that the medication you're on

251
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:44,866
is not only
suppressing your anger

252
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,216
but also dulling
your other feelings?

253
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,652
It may be that your doctor

254
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:51,481
just needs to adjust
your medication.

255
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:54,354
What about you, Marvin? Hmm?

256
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,786
You have anything you want
to share with the group today?

257
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:00,186
I'm good.

258
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,579
I tell you
whether you're good or not.

259
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:05,731
And then I tell the judge.
That's how this works.

260
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,153
Fine, whatever.

261
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:13,982
Um...

262
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:17,333
say some... say somebody
talkin' shit to me,

263
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,206
up in my face,
stank-ass breath on me.

264
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,035
My reaction is to put
a foot up they ass.

265
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,819
That's what I do.
That's what I've always done.

266
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:28,170
I won't lie. Shit works for me.
Makes my teeth white.

267
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,390
That's called open aggression.

268
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:32,348
Me or the nigga talking shit?

269
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:33,480
You.

270
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,438
Eh.

271
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,415
Then that's me, then...
Open and aggressive.

272
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,271
When you feel unregulated
like that,

273
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,535
one of the techniques
that we talk about

274
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:49,235
to regain control of yourself
and the situation

275
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,237
is breathing.

276
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:56,068
Remember, everybody, breathe,
get regulated,

277
00:13:56,152 --> 00:14:00,289
and then calmly, quietly,
and peacefully

278
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,771
address this individual

279
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:06,556
and de-escalate the situation.

280
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,646
Breathe with me,
everyone, okay?

281
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:18,177
Breath in.

282
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,545
Let it all go.

283
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:26,968
Inhale.

284
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:28,883
Let it all go.

285
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,326
You late, nigga.

286
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,632
My mother had me doing
some cleaning and shit

287
00:14:38,716 --> 00:14:39,850
around the crib.

288
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,113
I'm here now, so what's up?

289
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:44,159
Raq must be all fucked up
about Scrap.

290
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:46,191
And why would she be
all fucked up about Scrap?

291
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:50,992
'Cause Scrap dead, man.

292
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:52,646
Cops found him in
some broke-down building

293
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,517
up on Rock away Boulevard.

294
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,780
He killed his self.
I thought you knew all this.

295
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:59,044
Get the fuck out of here, man.
What are you talkin' about?

296
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,132
Scrap wouldn't do
no shit like that.

297
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,177
That's not even possible.

298
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:05,485
I saw his whole family
roll up to his mother house, K.

299
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,443
Scrappy gone.

300
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:14,233
Maybe losing a eye really did
get to this nigga, you know?

301
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:16,887
Thought he liked
that shit, man.

302
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:20,456
Said it kept niggas shook.
It... it had 'em scared.

303
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,154
Look, I already went up
in this spot.

304
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:23,633
It's wack as hell.

305
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:25,635
Fucking toilet in the kitchen,

306
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,724
but it ain't no real kitchen
anyway.

307
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,422
Don't even matter

308
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,685
'cause it's still a spot
I can't fucking afford.

309
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,559
Scrappy can get caught up
behind them dice games

310
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,648
and cards and shit.

311
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:39,997
But that nigga made more
in a day

312
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,043
than motherfuckers make
in a whole year.

313
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:44,828
Now, how my mom put
the word out to my whole fam

314
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,395
not to help me
with nothing neither?

315
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,615
Look, I can't sleep
at the Y again, K.

316
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,052
Some old drunk motherfucker
tried to slide in my bed.

317
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,623
Yo, look, I'm not tryin' to be,
like, insensitive or nothin',

318
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,495
but can we focus on a nigga
that's still breathin'

319
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,411
and alive
and don't got a place to stay?

320
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:07,590
I'm gonna go grab the rest
of your tapes.

321
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:08,939
Come on, man.

322
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:10,680
Even I know my tapes
ain't sellin'.

323
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:14,293
That's exactly why we gonna
sell 'em different this time.

324
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:15,772
I don't even know
what that means,

325
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:17,948
but fuck it, I'm down.

326
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,317
How in the fuck my mother
ain't tell me about Scrap?

327
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:23,476
I don't know.

328
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:07,433
Juliana, it's Raq.

329
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:08,999
Where you at?

330
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,219
And why the store closed up?

331
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:13,265
Hit me.

332
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,773
Juliana? You here?

333
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:56,525
Juliana.

334
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:07,772
No.

335
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:10,409
Hell, no.

336
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,122
Fuck!

337
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,621
I'm workin' Raq.

338
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:00,285
Excellent work, everyone.

339
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:03,331
Thank you so much.

340
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:05,725
Thank you so much for your
share today... beautiful.

341
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:11,383
Marvin.

342
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:14,864
I'm gonna keep pressing you,
and I'm not gonna stop.

343
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:17,171
And now you know
I'm... I'm what you call, um,

344
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:20,043
open and attractive.

345
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,567
Openly aggressive.

346
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,482
Right, right.

347
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:28,095
So, um, I guess we'll see how...
You know, how it go.

348
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,271
You press on an openly
aggressive motherfucker

349
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,491
like me.

350
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:36,364
Work?

351
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:38,453
Ah, family.

352
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:39,802
I mean, same shit, though.

353
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,109
Work, family,
ain't no difference.

354
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:45,304
Right, well, remember
your breathing, Marvin.

355
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:49,638
You know I got you, Miss Renée.

356
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,212
This ain't just
your world, little nigga.

357
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,953
Watch where the fuck you going.

358
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:02,060
Hey, hey, hey, hold that shit,
hold that shit!

359
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,436
Put your hand in the door,
motherfucker!

360
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,785
- My bad, man!
- Ah.

361
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,657
Punk-ass bitch.

362
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,312
Elevator finally working.
I still can't fuck with it.

363
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:13,096
That wasn't no jumbo, man.

364
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,534
That shit was straight dust.
Didn't even feel it.

365
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:17,449
Yo, you done?

366
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,015
Keep it movin'.

367
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:20,582
Man, fuck y'all.

368
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,062
'Nique knew what a jumbo was,

369
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:23,890
and it wasn't it
this pieced-up bullshit!

370
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,548
Raq kid.

371
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:42,909
Juliana!

372
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,780
It's Raq.

373
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,145
- What's up, man?
- What up?

374
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:47,147
Yo, where Marvin at?

375
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:50,019
- He at his angry-nigga class.
- Which only makes him angrier.

376
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:52,282
Yeah, I forgot about that.

377
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:13,826
Damn, if she ain't here,
I'll catch y'all later.

378
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:18,221
If you do see Marvin,

379
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:20,049
let him know
I came lookin' for Raq.

380
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:26,316
Door's open.
Move out the fuckin' way.

381
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:33,628
Boss is here.

382
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:38,024
Get out.

383
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,383
I done paged your brother
three times, and still nothin'.

384
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:50,993
Lou fuckin' around
behind them ones and twos.

385
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:53,605
All our shit is gone, Marvin.

386
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,650
Juliana gone with it.

387
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:56,869
And whoever did it
took the security tapes,

388
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:58,044
so there ain't shit
for us to see.

389
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,959
Mami done taxed us.

390
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:02,439
Bitch took all our money

391
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:04,354
and bounce back home
to El Colombo

392
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:06,095
or wherever the fuck she from.

393
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,706
Nah, she know we in business
with her cousin.

394
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,795
Robbin' from us
is like robbin' from Joaquin.

395
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:13,015
Yo, we got
that big re-up in two days

396
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:15,670
for Baisley, Forties,
and Jersey.

397
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:17,367
If we ain't got the money
to cover it,

398
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:20,327
shit gonna get stupid.

399
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:21,328
Maybe we should let
Joaquin know about it now.

400
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:23,243
No.

401
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:26,115
Juliana fucked us, Joaquin,
he probably know already.

402
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:28,074
And if he don't know,
the last thing we want to do

403
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,120
is tell him that his cousin got
grabbed up along with our loot.

404
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:32,731
And it ain't even about that.

405
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:34,471
If it was just about the money,

406
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,703
they wouldn't have grabbed up
Juliana, but they did.

407
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,869
Whoever did this shit...

408
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,305
they want us to come
looking for 'em.

409
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,264
Nah, ain't nobody wild enough
to fuck with us like this

410
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:46,353
just to have us come look
for 'em.

411
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,791
Nah, I know just the wild nigga

412
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,272
who would do some shit
like this.

413
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:54,709
So do you.

414
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:57,756
Yo, how the fuck
we just throwing my shits away?

415
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,061
I thought the point
was to sell them

416
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,759
and hustle up this rent money.

417
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:01,890
Didn't we try that before,
nigga?

418
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,153
Remember? Didn't work.

419
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:07,174
So we gonna flip it this time,
and your ass is gonna get paid.

420
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,161
My shits was live, man.

421
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:14,399
I don't give a fuck
what nobody say.

422
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:23,303
Your mother
would've never let us drink

423
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:24,826
out of anything but glasses.

424
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,872
Yeah, just screaming
down at us right now,

425
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:30,702
"Use the tumblers.
Use the tumblers."

426
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:33,487
- Miss you, Eleanor.
- Love you, Mom.

427
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,887
I heard your partner got
out of the hospital.

428
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:43,453
But he still can't remember
a fucking thing

429
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:45,194
about what happened to him.

430
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,372
Yeah, that's what he's sayin'.
But who knows?

431
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,828
I'm not following you, Shannon.

432
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,422
Howard...

433
00:24:55,506 --> 00:24:57,554
he keeps a hell of a lot
of stuff to himself,

434
00:24:57,638 --> 00:24:59,861
and there's been some moments
where I wonder

435
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:02,777
if he's holding shit back
from me about what happened.

436
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:06,215
You don't ever wonder
about your partner

437
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,044
and he don't ever
wonder about you.

438
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:12,831
Your lives depend
on the trust you two share.

439
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:14,528
That's how it works.

440
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,244
That's how it's always worked.

441
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,577
Yes, sir.

442
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:27,236
Come get that Famous shit,

443
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,023
go-straight-to-your-head shit,
get that hot, hot, hot shit.

444
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,592
Looks like sales
are pickin' up.

445
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:37,333
What can I say, man?

446
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:39,509
Fame is spittin' that realness.
Word gettin' out.

447
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:41,598
"Fame is spittin'
that realness."

448
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:50,869
Let me get Famous. Two times.

449
00:25:55,914 --> 00:26:00,748
Get that Hollywood.
It feel so good.

00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,454
It's good.
I mean, the shit is catchy.

470
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:56,412
It... it might even
be some kind of hit,

471
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:59,111
but not for this girl,
not for this kind of talent.

472
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:02,157
No, Zisa needs
something bigger,

473
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:03,985
somethin'
with some feeling to it.

474
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:06,074
This girl is not just a singer.

475
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,730
She is a virtuoso, an artiste.

476
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:11,688
I like the song.

477
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:14,517
I think it's cool.

478
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,911
Do you not get my pages,
or you just ignore them?

479
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:20,349
Fairest creatures,
we desire increase.

480
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:23,831
That thereby beauty's rose
shall never die.

481
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:25,964
That's Shakespeare's
first sonnet.

482
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:28,245
Cartier Fareed.

483
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,898
I know who you are.

484
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:35,060
Raquel Thomas, Lou's sister,

485
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:36,713
who's about to put
a foot in his ass.

486
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:38,890
Well, you are nothing short
of a revelation,

487
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:41,066
Raquel Thomas.

488
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,808
We need to talk, now.

489
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:46,114
Well, I'm hoping this
is just a short prologue

490
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,655
to a far longer story for us.

491
00:27:53,162 --> 00:27:54,557
Look, my bad.
I'm doing shit right now.

492
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:56,385
Nah, Lou, don't, not now.

493
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:58,561
I don't want to hear
your usual bullshit.

494
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:02,174
All of that shit in there
is bought and paid for by me.

495
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:03,566
So you... you cashin'
the checks I write,

496
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,177
but you not takin' my calls?

497
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:06,961
You a nosy little motherfucker,
huh, Macho Man?

498
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,572
We been hit, Lou.

499
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:10,835
All our shit got grabbed up
at the bodega,

500
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,706
and we can't find Juliana.

501
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,708
And this is about to be the
biggest re-up we've ever had.

502
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:16,536
And all our work for Baisley,
Forties, and Jersey,

503
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,016
and we ain't got
the money to cover it.

504
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,279
Joaquin will front that shit
on consignment.

505
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,455
We done showed and proved
for that nigga, right?

506
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,152
You really think that he gonna
front us with his cousin gone?

507
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,111
Hell, no.

508
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:27,852
And even if he did, the last
place we'd ever want to be

509
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,418
is owin' money
to them Colombians.

510
00:28:29,502 --> 00:28:30,829
I ain't goin' out like that.

511
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:34,510
Nah, this Unique.

512
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,948
This is what this nigga do.

513
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,298
When he wants my attention,
he fucks with my world.

514
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:40,995
Yo, 'Nique would have to be
crazy out his fucking mind

515
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,605
to fuck with the stash...
Come on.

516
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,520
Look, I'm goin'
to talk to Worrell.

517
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:46,914
I need you to get on the block
and see what they sayin'.

518
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:49,264
- All right.
- It's time to work, Lou.

519
00:28:49,348 --> 00:28:50,352
Real work.

520
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,180
I'm on it.

521
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:00,536
Yo, your customers
are pissing in the stairwell

522
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,408
and smoking up in the elevator.

523
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,062
Not that there's never any room
for me in that shit anyway

524
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:05,237
with all your people
going in and out.

525
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:06,455
I'll look into it.

526
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:07,804
You don't need to look into it.

527
00:29:07,888 --> 00:29:10,155
I just told you
what the fuck it is.

528
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,852
Yo, step off or roll off

529
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,201
or whatever the fuck
it is you do, nigga,

530
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,681
'cause you mad close
on me right now.

531
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,440
Fuck you.

532
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:19,033
Look, everybody gettin'
a little somethin'-somethin'

533
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:21,470
for their patience
and accommodations.

534
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:23,429
You took our money,
you know our deal.

535
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,996
Your money ain't nearly enough
to cover me

536
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,302
waitin' on the elevator
for 45 minutes every day

537
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:28,956
'cause that motherfucker always
too crowded.

538
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,132
All right?

539
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,308
Yo, I'm gonna say it again.

540
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:34,875
You need to back the fuck up.

541
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,877
You serious?

542
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,226
You think I'm scared
of you, nigga?

543
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,836
I got shot seven times,

544
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,187
and I'm still puttin' fools
on they back.

545
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,884
Be the next nigga.

546
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:52,937
I hear you.

547
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:56,027
I hear you and understand.

548
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,334
I'm sorry
for your troubles, brother.

549
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:00,901
I'll deal with it.

550
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:02,947
Yeah, you will.

551
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:04,774
Yo, everybody
get the fuck off the elevator.

552
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:06,646
My man here got places to be.

553
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,517
Let's go. Come on.

554
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,610
I got you.

555
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,786
Demo, nigga. Better recognize.

556
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:29,234
Huh.

557
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:36,110
Openly and aggressive...
That's... that's me.

558
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:39,070
The breathing helps with the...

559
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:44,075
Oh, shit!

560
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,905
Somebody's feeling better.

561
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:50,733
Fuck.

562
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:52,909
Back from the dead.

563
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:56,652
My God.

564
00:30:56,736 --> 00:30:58,741
- Hey.
- Hmm?

565
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:02,789
I had cancer, and you lightin'
up coal in my fucking face?

566
00:31:02,873 --> 00:31:04,530
I'm sorry. You're right.

567
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,359
That is fucked up.

568
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:10,797
Oh, shit, I'm late.
Got to pick up my son.

569
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,150
He's a teenager now, right?

570
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,674
A mean-ager.

571
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,068
No, that's what we call 'em,
'cause when they turn 16,

572
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:23,505
they forget
that they ever even liked you.

573
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:24,767
Let me ask you somethin'.

574
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,134
Hmm?

575
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:29,442
How does he feel
about what you do?

576
00:31:30,857 --> 00:31:32,949
What do I do?

577
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:35,082
You know, your line of work.

578
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:38,016
My son thinks that I'm
a barber that does house calls.

579
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:41,480
I got the scissors
and robes and everything.

580
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:48,356
Wow, that's good.

581
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,098
I bet you he got it
figured out, though.

582
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:53,405
You know,
these kids ain't dumb.

583
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:54,319
It ain't like he gonna
bring it up to you

584
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:55,581
or nothing like that,

585
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,104
'cause that's
a fucked-up conversation

586
00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:59,019
to have with your own moms.

587
00:31:59,103 --> 00:32:01,587
Maybe you're right, Malcolm.

588
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:04,024
Maybe he does know.

589
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:07,375
Maybe my son knows that, yeah,
Mommy turns tricks.

590
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,768
Wait, wait, wait,
I didn't mean it like...

591
00:32:08,852 --> 00:32:10,291
But you know what else
he knows?

592
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,424
My son knows
that I would die for him,

593
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:14,339
that I would lay down my life
for his,

594
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:16,993
and at the end of the day,
that's all he needs to know

595
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:18,952
'cause that's all
that really matters.

596
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,065
I...

597
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:15,443
- What'd you hear?
- Nothin'.

598
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,403
I went by the shop...
and his girl's.

599
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:21,232
Nobody around right now.

600
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:24,235
I really don't know
if this is 'Nique.

601
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,324
I mean...

602
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:28,804
just tryin' to stay alive.

603
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:30,719
And fuckin' with you...

604
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:32,330
seem like the worst shit
for his health.

605
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:33,983
One of the reasons
I brought you on

606
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,247
is 'cause I ain't want
no problems with your man.

607
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:37,944
But now that he fuckin'
with my shit,

608
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,976
it makes you seem
a whole lot less useful, son.

609
00:33:41,597 --> 00:33:44,907
Move like your life depend
on findin' this nigga...

610
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,170
'cause it does.

611
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,879
Nah, no way.

612
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:01,402
I don't believe
that shit at all.

613
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:03,274
And that's what I said, Juke.
This nigga's crazy.

614
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:09,340
I don't know. You think I still
need to ask her anyway, though?

615
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:13,284
You gonna ask Raq
about being with that cop

616
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,068
like that?

617
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:18,114
Shit, you right.
What the fuck was I thinkin'?

618
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:19,942
Did he say anything
about what went down

619
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:21,944
between y'all that night?

620
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:23,076
No.

621
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,513
Oh.

622
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:26,949
He doesn't remember,

623
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,603
'cause that would've been
the first shit

624
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:30,649
to come out of his mouth,
so that's good.

625
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:33,347
I don't know, Juke. I...

626
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:34,870
You two been
by the bodega today?

627
00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:35,915
Seen Juliana?

628
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:37,413
- No.
- Nah.

629
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,834
What y'all talkin' about?

630
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,139
I...

631
00:34:43,223 --> 00:34:46,621
We was just, um, you know...

632
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:48,841
I'ma go get ready for bed.

633
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,426
See you tomorrow.

634
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:54,821
- Night, Aunt Raq.
- Mm-hmm. Night, baby.

635
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:05,684
What's goin' on?

636
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:07,860
It's the cop.

637
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,340
Howard.

638
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:10,906
Pulled up on me today.

639
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,388
He said he my father.

640
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,048
This fool.

641
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:24,529
He was talkin'
that same craziness to me.

642
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:26,052
I mean, I thought
it was momentary,

643
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:27,445
that he was gonna
snap out of it.

644
00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:28,576
Well, he's still saying it, Ma.

645
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,361
Yeah.

646
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:32,363
You his son, Juke his daughter,
and your uncle Lou-Lou...

647
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:33,755
- That's his twin brother.
- I'm just saying.

648
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,191
He said he was coming back
around to talk about it...

649
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:37,324
Yeah, you ain't gonna
tell him nothin'.

650
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:38,891
Let him spit all this shit,
and you keep your mouth shut.

651
00:35:38,975 --> 00:35:40,022
He police.
You don't talk to no police.

652
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:41,763
And he didn't say anything...

653
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:44,375
Look, his head is
all messed up, Kanan.

654
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:47,987
He don't know what's real
and what isn't.

655
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:49,684
Look, you just keep letting me
know when he step to you

656
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:51,338
and what he says when he do.

657
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:52,992
And if he get any stupider,

658
00:35:53,076 --> 00:35:55,560
I'm gonna get in the middle
of it.

659
00:35:55,644 --> 00:35:57,431
That's part of the reason why
I asked you to do what you did.

660
00:35:57,515 --> 00:35:59,433
Howard,
he's always been unstable

661
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:00,913
and unpredictable and shit.

662
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:03,350
Never know what wildness
he gonna say or do.

663
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:08,834
Look, you just need
to keep your head down.

664
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,750
He gonna forget about you.

665
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,142
That's how he do.

666
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:24,589
I heard about Scrappy.

667
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:29,028
Yeah.

668
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:31,596
I meant to talk
to you about that,

669
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,249
but I got distracted.

670
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,643
That don't make
no kind of sense, Mom.

671
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,558
Scrappy killin' his self?

672
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,299
It don't ever
make no sense, Kanan.

673
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:43,390
It's hard to understand
how somebody could just get

674
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:46,262
to a point where they
don't want to live anymore.

675
00:36:46,346 --> 00:36:48,090
Look, everybody got
their shit, Kanan,

676
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:50,658
and everybody
deal with it different.

677
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,095
Scrap made his decision.

678
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:56,316
And it hurts for all of us
he left, but it was his call.

679
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,013
It's what he wanted.

680
00:36:58,097 --> 00:37:01,147
So let's just remember him
for who he was...

681
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:02,801
how he wanted us to.

682
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:18,207
Thanks for coming.

683
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:21,689
When I called, I-I wasn't sure...

684
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,865
Yeah, you broke my heart.

685
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,912
But that doesn't mean
I never want to see you again.

686
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,175
I always want to see you,
Shannon.

687
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,176
That's the problem.

688
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:37,357
How's your mom?

689
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:40,665
M.S. isn't a disease
that gets better.

690
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:43,319
I'm having to pay out of pocket
for a home health aide

691
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:45,017
and put ramps in her home,
some of her meds.

692
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:46,192
I'm so sorry, Adina.

693
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:48,107
Is there anything
I can do to help?

694
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:49,500
If you got 50 grand
burning a hole in your pocket,

695
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:50,631
I could put it
to some good use.

696
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:55,157
But you didn't hit me up
to talk about my mom.

697
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:57,943
No, it's my, uh...
It's my partner.

698
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,902
- I heard Howard's on the mend.
- Yeah, he's doing better.

699
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:02,338
You know, he's taking
better care of himself.

700
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:04,166
He stopped smoking.
He's eating right.

701
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,777
He's nicer to me
than he's ever been before.

702
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,518
What's the problem, then?

703
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:09,128
'Cause Howard's always
been a world-class dick.

704
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:14,525
Him being nicer sounds like a
dramatic change for the better.

705
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:18,354
He's got secrets, Adina,

706
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:19,747
a lot of them.

707
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,836
We all have secrets.

708
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,360
In fact, if memory serves,
I was yours.

709
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:25,361
That was the issue.

710
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,976
He says he doesn't remember
anything about the shooting,

711
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,804
but I don't know
if I believe him.

712
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:34,283
It feels like
there's more there,

713
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,807
but whenever I try digging,
he gets pissed at me

714
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:37,112
and tells me to leave it alone.

715
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:38,766
I remember working with him

716
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,855
on this Subway Slasher
task force back in the day.

717
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:43,118
Howard's got a lot of pride.

718
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:44,990
He has a tough time
letting people help him,

719
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,644
especially women.

720
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:52,040
But I get it.
You're his partner.

721
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,782
You're supposed
to look out for him.

722
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:57,132
Thanks.

723
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:59,570
At least someone understands.

724
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:02,094
I always understood you.

725
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,054

730

Sometimes obvious shit
is obvious 'cause it's right.

731
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,737
Juliana hit us herself.

732
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:41,350
It's Juke.

733
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,354

Whatever.

742
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,957
We got to go find our shit.

743
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,568
I'll circle back
with you later.

744
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:26,526

And call me if you see...
You hear anything.

749
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:52,465
All that shit we sold,
I still can't afford a place.

750
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,249
We gonna have
to hit them corners.

751
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,338
Ah, I don't think we'll be able

752
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:58,079
to grab some more work
for a little bit.

753
00:40:58,163 --> 00:40:59,911
Niggas is definitely
gonna start noticing.

754
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:04,303
- What's up, fellas?
- What's up?

755
00:41:04,387 --> 00:41:06,697
Raq home?

756
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:07,977
Yeah, she inside.

757
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:17,533
Lookin' at cribs?

758
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:20,798
Yeah, man.
Fuckin' mom kicked me out.

759
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:22,277
I'm sleepin' at the goddamn Y.

760
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:24,366
Famous all homeless and shit.

761
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,977
Now, that's what you need to be
writing some rhymes about.

762
00:41:26,061 --> 00:41:28,214
For real.

763
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:32,828
Yo, check this out.

764
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,377
I've been hookin' up
this brother

765
00:41:35,461 --> 00:41:36,857
with free studio time
for his girl,

766
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:39,468
and I know they got
some buildings around the way.

767
00:41:39,552 --> 00:41:41,732
Let me talk to him,
see if he want to hook you up,

768
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,516
- show you some love.
- Word?

769
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,605
I ain't promise you nothing,
but I could for sure ask.

770
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:47,563
I mean,
I can pay you somethin',

771
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:49,609
not a lot, but, like,

772
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:52,264
I got this cash that me and K
hustled up, man, like...

773
00:41:52,348 --> 00:41:55,659
Like I said, I'ma ask.

774
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:58,226
These ain't exactly
your Jamaica Estates, though.

775
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,143
Psh. It's better than getting
my dick grabbed at the Y.

776
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:04,537
You saved my life, brother,

777
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:07,279
Like, come... come here.
Come here.

778
00:42:07,363 --> 00:42:10,238
Thank you.

779
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:12,676
That's real man shit
right there.

780
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,590
I told your sister
I was gonna look out for you.

781
00:42:14,674 --> 00:42:17,071
Oh, but you is...
You a man of your word,

782
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,725
my brother,
and I'ma tell her that,

783
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,248
if I ever speak
to her ass again.

784
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,337
Y'all a trip.

785
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:24,339
All right, now.

786
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:26,167
That is my nigga.

787
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:27,908
Let me see that.

788
00:42:36,174 --> 00:42:38,832
- Lou ain't here.
- I ain't here for Lou.

789
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,486
Look, I ain't got time
for you right now, Crown.

790
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,923
I think I got a solution
to a problem we both havin'...

791
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:44,682
with Lou.

792
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,182
You and me better off if Lou
wasn't in the music business.

793
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:10,255
I'm listening.

794
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,822
What if I sold you
part of the label

795
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:14,041
for damn near nothing?

796
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,175
Let you wash all the money
you want through it.

797
00:43:17,259 --> 00:43:19,786
In return, let's get Lou out
the studio, back on the street.

798
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,440
That's where he belong.

799
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:24,443
Hello? All right, well,
I'ma meet you there, then.

800
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:26,184
I ain't got time for you right
now, Crown... you got to go.

801
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,012
Oh, but Lou will kill me

802
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:29,274
if he knew I stepped to you
like this.

803
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:30,710
Lou ain't gonna know shit.

804
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:09,270
How we know this
motherfucker not setting us up?

805
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:10,881
Maybe you and 'Nique
taxed our shit.

806
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:13,318
'Nique called me,
said he want to talk to Raq.

807
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:14,580
I'm with y'all now.

808
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:16,016
I ain't in business
with him no more.

809
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,670
There's better ways
to get to talkin'

810
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:19,324
than grabbin' up all our shit
and our connect's cousin.

811
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:20,934
You here, though.

812
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:22,849
And I bet you ready to talk.

813
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:24,720
We ready.

814
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:26,418
But I ain't promising
all we gonna do is talk.

815
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:27,723
Let's go.

816
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:30,988
You through
the door first, nigga.

817
00:45:08,979 --> 00:45:12,420
Good to see you, too, Raq.

818
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,554
You must really want
to die, 'Nique.

819
00:45:15,638 --> 00:45:18,470
I missed the hell
out of you, girl.

I just want to talk. That's it.

843
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:44,556
You ever heard
of pickin' up a phone, nigga?

844
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,993
You know I got to
make you work for it, baby.

845
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:49,691
Besides,
I knew you knew it was me,

846
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:53,043
being that we be
on the same page like that.

847
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:54,870
I don't know what book
you reading from, nigga,

848
00:46:54,954 --> 00:46:57,047
but it ain't looking like you
gonna live happily ever after.

849
00:46:57,131 --> 00:46:59,092
If you want your money,
you'll hear me out.

850
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:02,313
If not...

851
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:04,880
do what the fuck
you will, then.

852
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:06,621
Talk.

853
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:09,102
But Worrell's just a messenger.

854
00:47:09,186 --> 00:47:12,366
I'm the motherfuckin' message.

855
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,933
You know,
it was cute back there

856
00:47:14,017 --> 00:47:15,935
what you did
framing me for Howard.

857
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:18,155
Don't matter I ain't do it.

858
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,722
I can't even put up a fuckin'
lemonade stand on the block

859
00:47:20,806 --> 00:47:23,421
without them trying
to put me back in.

860
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:27,860
So you all salty
'cause you got beat?

861
00:47:27,944 --> 00:47:30,863
That's what the fuck this is?

862
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,647
Take the loss
like a fuckin' man.

863
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:36,434
I ain't even gonna front, Raq.
My business is done.

864
00:47:36,518 --> 00:47:38,088
My name ain't even got
the same weight

865
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:39,393
on these streets no more.

866
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:42,831
You won.

867
00:47:42,915 --> 00:47:44,616
For real, you did it.

868
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,533
But now I just want to be left
the fuck alone.

869
00:47:48,617 --> 00:47:50,665
All right? That's it.

870
00:47:50,749 --> 00:47:53,146
You see what I did here.

871
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,236
So you know
I can still touch you, baby.

872
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,021
You know I can still
make problems for you

873
00:47:58,105 --> 00:47:59,674
and these fucking Colombians.

874
00:48:02,326 --> 00:48:04,592
I just want my family safe.

875
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:07,421
Peace for me and mines, Raq.

876
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:11,599
Nigga want peace, so he rob us.

877
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:13,297
Fuck kind of peace is that?

878
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:15,908
The real kind, nigga,

879
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:17,910
the kind that got
a price on it.

880
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:21,131
Go post up somewhere else that
ain't the South side, 'Nique.

881
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:24,090
Big world, nigga.
Everywhere got a corner.

882
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:26,397
And everywhere got a Unique,

883
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:28,138
maybe even a Raq.

884
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:30,009
South side home.

885
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:32,925
That's all a nigga know.

886
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:36,972
Besides,
I'm retired now, y'all.

887
00:48:37,056 --> 00:48:40,628
Jersey in the rafters.

888
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,630
I just want to live
my life now.

889
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,807
If we put him down,
everyone gonna know it was us,

890
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:47,461
including five-O.

891
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:53,293
Yo, this motherfucker
tried to kill you.

892
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:55,556
And we tried to kill him.

893
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,864
It ain't personal for me, Marv.

894
00:48:58,948 --> 00:49:00,518
Personal for you, 'Nique?

895
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:02,911
Never was, brother.

896
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:04,957
Never was.

897
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,961
Give me your gat.

898
00:49:18,924 --> 00:49:20,277
You got your peace, 'Nique.

899
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:27,737
Now give me my fuckin' money.

900
00:49:45,124 --> 00:49:46,433
What up, B?

901
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:54,572
Yo, what your mom's
talking about?

902
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:57,052
Oh, let me guess.

903
00:49:57,136 --> 00:50:00,230
I done lost my damn mind.
I got amnesia.

904
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:02,145
I don't know what's real
and what's not.

905
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:08,343
But see, I ain't crazy.

906
00:50:11,063 --> 00:50:14,157
I remember everything.

907
00:50:14,241 --> 00:50:16,724
You little motherfucker,
you shot me.

908
00:50:18,593 --> 00:50:20,206
And I took that bullet
from you,

909
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,991
and now I'ma take one for you.

910
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:26,560
I ain't telling nobody about
what happened in the park.

911
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:28,667
I wouldn't do that to my son.

912
00:50:36,915 --> 00:50:38,181
Remember when I said the truth

913
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:40,313
was like that J train?

914
00:50:40,397 --> 00:50:43,360
I was wrong about that.

915
00:50:43,444 --> 00:50:46,406
The truth is more like
that Metro-North shit...

916
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,365
...fast, heavy...

917
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:50,323
...pulling a lot of weight.

918
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:51,977
And that shit
pick up speed, too.

919
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:55,894
That's the truth coming
for you, nigga.

920
00:50:55,978 --> 00:50:58,375
And it hit hard,
and it hit fast,

921
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:00,203
so look the fuck out.
