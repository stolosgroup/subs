1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:20,798
<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color=#fffc50>"Raising Kanan"...</font>

3
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:22,298
We the only game
in town now, Kanan,

4
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:23,470
just us,

5
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,680
and we got shit on lock.

6
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:27,032
All you have to do
is sign in each session,

7
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:28,118
and then you can leave.

8
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:29,115
Either you sit down,

9
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,236
or I can let the court know

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,539
that you violated probation.

11
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:33,147
My child was murdered!

12
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,711
I know powerful people.

13
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,511
So you believe him when he
says he doesn't remember

14
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:37,686
anything from the night
he was shot?

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,206
You're Famous' manager
all the time.

16
00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:40,297
When are you just
gonna be my girl?

17
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,251
Got a job for you.

18
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:42,209
That shit's waitin' on you

19
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:43,689
but not for too much longer.

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,342
I saw Worrell
up the block slingin'.

21
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:46,213
Yeah, we tried
to kill that nigga.

22
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:47,435
He tried to kill me.

23
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:48,871
Bring his ass in
for a conversation.

24
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:49,914
And, Scrap,
I need you to ease up

25
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,087
on throwin' them dice.

26
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,352
Police! Let me see your hands!
Get 'em up!

27
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:55,352
I got a CI bellyachin'
in interrogation two.

28
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,137
Couldn't believe
my fuckin' ears

29
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,663
when I heard you might
be getting released soon.

30
00:00:58,747 --> 00:00:59,661
When we met,
what'd I tell you, huh?

31
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,141
"Don't ask questions."

32
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,099
I need you right now, okay?
Come on, come on.

33
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,144
Jerome, what's up, man?

34
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:05,928
Come on.

35
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:07,455
That cop, he don't remember
nothin' from that night.

36
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:09,323

Like I been sayin',

the biggest mistake
any nigga ever make

77
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:50,252
is gettin' too comfortable,

78
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,295
kickin' they feet up,

79
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,629
takin' that motherfuckin'
victory lap.

80
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,171
'Cause you ain't never safe.

81
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:01,261
Somebody always out there,
watchin'.

82
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,089
And by the time you see him...

83
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,786
You know that smoking's
bad for you.

84
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,138
...it's already too late.

85
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:08,137
So's the police.

86
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:11,249
I can't seem to get that shit
out my life neither.

87
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,820
And if memory serves, nigga,
you gave me my first cigarette.

88
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,625
One of my many mistakes.

89
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:19,931
What you want, Detective?

90
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,457
Can't lie, Raq.

91
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,901
I thought I was dead.

92
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:28,091
Laying here, bleedin' out.

93
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:31,086
I thought my shit was done.

94
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,255
And your whole damn life really
does flash before your eyes.

95
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:37,609
That shit's real.

96
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:41,942
I didn't like what I saw, Raq.

97
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:44,571
Not at all.

98
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:48,011
I made a deal with God.

99
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,623
Let me live,
I'll right my wrongs.

100
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,536
The kid...

101
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,800
he can't shoot for shit.

102
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,569
Mm, somebody cryin'
about Cochise again.

103
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,576
Shit's the best part
about you, Kanan.

104
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:34,840
The part that cares.

105
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,622
Don't ever lose that.

106
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:41,103
And don't let nobody
take that shit from you either.

107
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,974
Shit just a movie, man.
Whatever.

108
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,767
And you, you just
a cryin'-ass bitch.

109
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,814
Yeah. Yeah.
I'ma fuck you up, Laverne.

110
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:58,816
I ain't afraid
of you, kid, not at all.

111
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,426
You think you got this?

112
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,340
Come on, Juke,
do something!

113
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:02,602
Come on, Juke!

114
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:03,911
Aah!

115
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:10,702
What I want now is what
I've wanted all along...

116
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:14,967
...for Kanan
to know I'm his father.

117
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:19,707
Had a gang of admirers
back in the day.

118
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,188
Truth is, I don't even know
who Kanan daddy is.

119
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,974
Truth?

120
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,807
You gotta know the meaning
of the word to use it, Raq.

121
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:30,369
When I brought Kanan in
for that fight,

122
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,458
son was leakin'

123
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,112
and left some blood behind.

124
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,075
I had the lab
run that shit on the low.

125
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,002
Paternity match...

126
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:42,202
...came back to yours truly.

127
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:47,996
And you can bullshit me
all you want,

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,172
but you can't
bullshit science, Raquel.

129
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:52,261
Well, fuck you
and your science, nigga.

130
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:55,046
He ain't built for that road
you got him on.

131
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,675
I saw that in his eyes
that night.

132
00:05:57,654 --> 00:05:59,794
The game ain't for him.

133
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,378
Now, I ain't gonna knock Kanan
for poppin' me.

134
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:06,461
I deserved what happened
that night.

135
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,457
Divine justice-type shit.

136
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,197
But I'm way past waitin'
on you to tell him.

137
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,329
That was my big mistake,

138
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,157
trustin' that you would
tell him for me.

139
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:20,811
I should have done it
from the start,

140
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:23,440
but I thought it'd be better
if he heard it from you first.

141
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:26,702
But now I'ma tell him
my damn self.

142
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:30,086
Man-to-man, father to son.

143
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:34,829
I'm goin' home.

144
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:37,523
Somebody tellin', Raq.

145
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,308
You got a snitch.

146
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,145
One-eyed Jack. The gambler.

147
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,231
Scrap?

148
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:51,233
He workin' with us.

149
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,669
Saw him sittin'
with a detective

150
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:54,410
at the precinct
the other night.

151
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:57,108
- Bullshit.
- Real shit.

152
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:58,501
And I'm only telling you this

153
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,808
'cause I'm trying
to look out for our son.

154
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:03,680
'Cause that's what parents do,
protect they kids.

155
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:05,377
Yeah.

156
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,340
Kanan 'bout to know, Raq.

157
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:10,126

Where Famous at?

160
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:29,880
He here, and he about to get
his ass beat by my ma

161
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:31,969
if he don't get this skeezer
out the house.

162
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:33,971
But he don't wanna
hear me, though.

163
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,104
You his friend.
You save his sorry ass.

Yo!

191
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,687
You don't even know
what her name is?

192
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,248
Nah, we didn't get to all that.

193
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:36,251
Oh, shit, nigga, look like
you got into a hell of a lot.

00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,649
You're a disaster, Famous,
a fuckin' embarrassment.

195
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,173
Don't matter now, though.
Better start packing your shit!

196
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,696
- Shit! No, fuck!
- Whoa.

197
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,968
She's not a ho, Ma.
She's from NYU.

198
00:08:58,052 --> 00:08:59,491
NYU are all hos.

199
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,797
She got locked out of her dorm,

200
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,190
and I was-I was trying
to help her,

201
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,179
make sure she wouldn't
sleep on the street.

202
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,415
I ain't lying, Ma.

203
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:09,762
...because I know
you stole that money

204
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:11,634
out of my purse
to buy your drugs.

205
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,462
Ma, you trippin' now.
I ain't even do that!

206
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:14,854
You know what?

207
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:17,770
I want you out!

208
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:19,163
- What?
- Out!

209
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,122
Go find another place
to bring your put as!

210
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,515
Where am I gonna go?
I don't have any money.

211
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,995
I don't know, and I don't care!

212
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:26,649
I just want you gone, Shawn!

213
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,999
You're gonna kick your own son
out just like that?

214
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,310
For real, Ma?
No second chances, no nothin'?

215
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:34,182
Ma. Ma!

216
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:36,314
Ms. Fig.

217
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,878
Fuck.

218
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:40,576
One thing that all of us

219
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,883
who struggle with anger
have in common are triggers.

220
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,886
Could be someone
cutting you off in traffic.

221
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,502
Could be someone standing
too close to us on the subway.

222
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,891
Could be someone
interrupting us

223
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,111
or-or talking over us.

224
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:56,770
So tell me,
what are your triggers, hmm?

225
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,640
I don't like being ignored.

226
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:05,427
When people don't listen to me
or hear me, I get angry.

227
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:08,560
Feeling unseen.

228
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:11,650
Is there anyone else here
who gets angry

229
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,266
when they don't feel heard
or acknowledged?

230
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:17,094
See?

231
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,315
You're not alone, Gerald.

232
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:25,316
Anybody else wanna share
what triggers their anger?

233
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,847
When people lie, I get pissed.

234
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,720
Too pissed,
even if it's my kids.

235
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,636
No one likes it
when someone lies to them.

236
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:40,027
But the challenge here
isn't the anger itself

237
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:43,208
but, rather,
the intensity of the anger.

238
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,208
Everybody hear that?

239
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:50,124
Anger is not the problem.

240
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,043
Everyone gets angry.

241
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:56,173
It's how we manage it
that's our challenge.

242
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,179
And what about you, Marvin?

243
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,791
What are your triggers?

244
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:04,664
Yes, Marvin, you.

245
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,491
I'm straight.
Ain't got no triggers.

246
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,232
I'm good.

247
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:12,798
You wouldn't be sitting here
with the rest of us

248
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,496
if you were good.

249
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:19,675
I'm ignoring you, Joe...

250
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,850
...'cause I know
you love that shit.

251
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:22,547
Fuck you.

252
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,029
Still ignoring you,
motherfucker.

253
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:27,338
And I ain't seein' you.

254
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,599
I'll kick your ass right here,

255
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:32,209
right fucking now!

256
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,996
I wish you'd try.

257
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,705
All right, all right,
that's enough.

258
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:41,653
Let's not lose our heads here.

259
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,137
Or our hair.

260
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,266
Sit down, Gerald.

261
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,793
Yeah, sit down, G.

262
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:57,408
I'm gonna let you slide
today...

263
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,497
...Marvin,

264
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:00,933
but you are not off the hook,

265
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:02,592
not by a long shot.

266
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,335
So getting back
to what triggers us...

267
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:14,643
Hey, you seen Kanan?

268
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,646
Mm... he over at Famous'.

269
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,126
Well, if you see him before me,

270
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,563
you let him know
I'm looking for him.

271
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:22,868
Trying to keep better track
of your cousin

272
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,305
now that he's home.

273
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:25,784
If I see him, I'll tell him.

274
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,438
All right. Thank you, baby.

275
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:28,747
Um...

276
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,531
...do you...

277
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:35,102
you remember my mom at all?

278
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:37,840
Of course.

279
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,977
What you remember about her?

280
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:45,064
Well, Kenya was a hell
of a good singer,

281
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:46,631
just like you.

282
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,020
And she gave you that gift.

283
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:51,597
And then she bounced.

284
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:56,511
Look... it's a lot, Juke,

285
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:58,038
being somebody's mother.

286
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:02,430
I mean...

287
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:04,519
you bring a baby
into this world, and...

288
00:13:04,603 --> 00:13:06,477
then it's all on you.

289
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,175
Fathers matter.

290
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,350
I mean, I'm not saying
they don't, but...

291
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,831
mothers, we create life.

292
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:15,051
And that shit
is a lot of responsibility,

293
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,401
and it ain't for everybody.

294
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:18,929
Not everybody up for the job.

295
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:25,104
So... that's why my mom
left me.

296
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:27,415
She wasn't feeling
cut out for the job.

297
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,113
I mean...

298
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,442
...look, I ain't ever
talked to her about it.

299
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,683
But yeah, um...

300
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:39,815
I mean, I think she knew
that she wasn't cut out

301
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,686
to be a mother.

302
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,675
Figured it was best
if she got out the mix.

303
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,345
I almost understand that.

304
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,624
Maybe even respect it
a little bit.

305
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,094
I can't.

306
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:56,574
Shit.

307
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:58,790
I can't neither.

308
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:09,671
She missed out,

309
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:11,890
'cause you're incredible.

310
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,287
And I love you.

311
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:16,768
Come here.

312
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:24,560
See you later.

313
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,649
For months now,
I have tried very hard

314
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,347
to come up
with a rational explanation

315
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:35,697
for why you instructed
those officers

316
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:38,395
to free the person
who murdered my daughter.

317
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:41,224
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Bingham. I really am.

318
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:43,139
But Laverne Thomas
did not murder your daughter.

319
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:44,749
She gave Nicole the drugs.

320
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,273
She showed her how to use them,

321
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:48,275
which is no different
than pointing a loaded gun

322
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,972
at my daughter's head
and pulling the trigger.

323
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,061
Look, I've reviewed the case
file,

324
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:53,845
and there's no evidence
that suggests

325
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,325
that Laverne Thomas
provided the drugs

326
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:56,714
that killed Nicole Bingham.

327
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,331
What does the mayor say?

328
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:03,464
Does he have
an opinion on this?

329
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:06,162
Well, I-I'm not here today
to speak for the mayor.

330
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:07,468
He told me
that you and your husband

331
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:10,079
are acquaintances of his,

332
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:12,999
and he asked me simply
to observe these proceedings.

333
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:18,435
I want her fired.

334
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,438
She should not be
a police officer.

335
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:24,659
Our officers often have
informal arrangements

336
00:15:24,743 --> 00:15:26,225
with the people in
the neighborhoods they police,

337
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,577
but I can assure you that
no officer in this department

338
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,409
would protect a suspect
in a murder.

339
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:36,323
As far as I'm concerned,

340
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:39,848
you all have my daughter's
blood on your hands.

341
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,122
Thanks for having my back,
Captain.

342
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:56,995
I'm looking out for the
department, Burke, not you.

343
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,302
You should never have
stuck your nose in this mess.

344
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:00,738
From where I'm sitting,

345
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:02,607
looks to me like
you fucked this all up.

346
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:04,742
Go!

347
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,709
Yo, whoever's
speaking this shit

348
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:15,971
got it wrong.

349
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,277
Wasn't Scrappy
in that precinct.

350
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,583
Yeah, well, how many
one-eyed motherfuckers

351
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,845
walkin' around
South Jamaica, Lou?

352
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,326
Early Tyler uncle got one eye.

353
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,677
Lost the other shit
in a fight out in Ozone Park.

354
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:29,027
Yeah, well, Early Tyler uncle
100 years old, in a wheelchair,

355
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:30,507
and can't feel
the left side of his face.

356
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,291
Actually, that shit's starting

357
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,293
to come back to life
a little bit.

358
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:37,040
Saw him at the barber
a few weeks back.

359
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,168
Lip was moving a little bit
on the left side.

360
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:41,605
Scrap ain't no snitch.

361
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,694
You know, a lot of niggas
get caught

362
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:45,130
behind them cards and dice,

363
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,480
make bets they can't cover.

364
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:48,309
I told him to stay away
from that shit.

365
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:51,267
Scrap bled for us, Raq.

366
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:54,313
He lost his fuckin' eye for us.

367
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:56,272
Maybe that's why he pissed off
behind that shit.

368
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,317
Look, we not makin'
no decisions yet.

369
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,797
We gonna need to know more.

370
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:00,842
Marvin, you talk to Scrappy.

371
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:01,930
Feel him out.

372
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:03,240
See what he gotta say.

373
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:36,443
Told my mama
I'm meeting with you all, so...

374
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,401
if I don't walk outta here,

375
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:40,838
she gonna know it was you.

376
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:42,536
Well, if we wanted you dead,
you'd be gone already, nigga.

377
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,798
Sit the fuck down.

378
00:18:00,202 --> 00:18:02,338
I mean, fuck it, like,

379
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:05,080
I'll sleep in-
in the-in the-in the bathroom.

380
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,777
Just throw a blanket
in the tub, like...

381
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,649
We already
got Juke at the house.

382
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:12,174
Like I-like I said, man,
if it was up to just me,

383
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,219
hell yeah, you could
come stay at the crib.

384
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,047
But my mother not going
for that shit.

385
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:18,397
She only want family
stayin' at the spot.

386
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:21,879
Man, I need to get
some fuckin' money, man,

387
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:24,621
try and stay in a room
for a minute.

388
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,449
What you think about
hustlin' up my mix tapes,

389
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,059
sellin' them shits?

390
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:29,713
Famous, them shits
didn't move before.

391
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,585
Why the fuck
would they move now?

392
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:33,804
My lyricism was ahead
of its time, okay?

393
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:35,632
Heads need to catch
the fuck up.

394
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,113
And you think
they all caught up now?

395
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:41,729
I'm not tryin' to sleep
on the fuckin' train, a'ight?

396
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:44,728
All I got to my name
is a bag of funky-ass clothes

397
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:47,514
and a gang of mix tapes
that we might be able to sell,

398
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:48,983
unless you got a better idea.

399
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,349
All right, then.

400
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:56,914
So why y'all
wanna fuck with me?

401
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:58,699
And why would I
wanna fuck with y'all?

402
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:00,875
South side ours, Worrell.

403
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,354
I mean, you might be doing
a half day's business

404
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,269
a couple times a week
on one of them tired corners,

405
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,664
but that's about as good
as it's gonna get for you, son.

406
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,101
I mean, you just-you just
picking up our scraps.

407
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,408
But maybe you thinking that now
that 'Nique out the joint,

408
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,192
he gonna pick up
where he left off, right?

409
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,629
That shit gonna get better?

410
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:17,674
Nah, son.

411
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,202
Your man radioactive.

412
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,288
'Nique shit deader than dead.

413
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,029
Deen ain't gonna sell to him.

414
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,770
Nobody gonna fuck with him.

415
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:28,428
You steady starvin', nigga.

416
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,521
But you still ain't even answer
my first question.

417
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,562
Why y'all wanna mess with me?

418
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:38,086
'Cause we got a lot of history
between us,

419
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,001
and ain't none of it good.

420
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:41,002
History's the past, Worrell.

421
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,091
We here talkin'
about the future.

422
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,309
We know
you a hell of an earner,

423
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,659
that you on your business,

424
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:47,965
and we feel like...

425
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,837
you could add some value
to what we trying to do.

426
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,013
And you hungry-ass niggas

427
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:54,145
all runnin' around roughshod
out there,

428
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:56,191
bumpin' into each other,
breakin' shit...

429
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,149
That noise bring police.

430
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:01,152
And police bad
for everybody business.

431
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:03,851
You gonna be under Lou
at our new spot

432
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,291
over at the Forties.

433
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:10,861
And you good with that?

434
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,730
We ain't datin', nigga.

435
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:15,384
We workin'.

436
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,402
I said it before,
but now that I'm here,

437
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:36,231
these shits really feel
like they been warmed over.

438
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:38,977
That's all I got, man.

439
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:46,284
Y'all delinquents
robbin' my fuckin' place?

440
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:47,546
Nah, man. What's up, Uncle Lou?

441
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,855
What's good?

442
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:54,205
Fame's mother actually
kicked him out the crib.

443
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,729
And he came up here
'cause he think

444
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:57,121
he might be able to sell
the rest of these tapes,

445
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,949
get some rent money up.

446
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,898
Obviously, he gonna
give you your cut too.

447
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,345
Yo, fuck it.

448
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,260
It's yours.

449
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:08,306
I already, uh,
wrote the shit off anyway.

450
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,917
Word?

451
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,531
Yo, come here.

452
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:16,663
You need some new flows, man.

453
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:18,969
Just like I told your sister,
stop smoking weed.

454
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,928
Put something on paper.

455
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:23,539
You bring me something good,
then...

456
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:24,975
I'll put you back
in the studio.

457
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,069
- Word?
- Word is bond.

458
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:31,247
No doubt.

459
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:34,942
Peace, Nephew.

460
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:37,035
Thanks again, Unc.

461
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:39,686
I put down the traps
and the poison,

462
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,779
but the rats are too many.

463
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:47,911
Guess I got rat problems
all over right about now.

464
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,614
Throw out the shit
that's been eaten,

465
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:58,661
and put some more traps down.

466
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:01,320
I would have to change them
ten times a day.

467
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:03,975
Call an exterminator, Juliana.

468
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:08,936
You have all this money
sitting here.

469
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:12,414
Why don't you spend it?

470
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,285
Now, I save my money
to buy a home

471
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:16,679
for my family in my country,
and...

472
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:19,947
you save your money
to be eaten by rats?

473
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:26,678
Get an exterminator out here.

00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,530
How you livin', Scrap?

479
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,921
Large as fuck, nigga.

480
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,793
Movin' this weight,
makin' this money.

481
00:23:26,877 --> 00:23:28,707
Couldn't raise you last night.

482
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,409
Had a pickup.

483
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,451
I was, uh, helpin' my peoples
out in Corona

484
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:34,931
put some shit up on the walls.

485
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,108
Yo, who the fuck trustin'

486
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:39,936
your one eye
to hang up something?

487
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,851
Motherfucker got paintings
up all crooked

488
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:43,897
and-and-and-and twisted
and shit.

489
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:45,637
You should've called
the new guy,

490
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:48,993
Worrell, to help you out
last night.

491
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:51,253
I'm sure that nigga's
always available.

492
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,559
Word travel fast, yeah?

493
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,388
Especially when heads
hear your peoples

494
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,216
gettin' in the bed
with the same nigga

495
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,870
who cost you
half your fuckin' eyes.

496
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:03,394
Uh-oh.

497
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,749
Somebody's feelings
gettin' hurt out here.

498
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,270
Ain't about feelings, Marvin.

499
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:11,537
Shit was bad enough
when Kanan came in.

500
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:14,231
But I made peace with that.

501
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:16,277
That's Raq's kid, and, hell,

502
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:18,627
I actually like
the little nigga.

503
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:21,895
But y'all givin' Forty Projects
to Unique's boy instead of me?

504
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,900
I been down with y'all niggas
since I was 14!

505
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:30,291
Lookin' out, baggin',
soldierin', hustlin', cookin'.

506
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,320
Whatever needed to get done,
I done done it!

507
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:36,601
You know what?

508
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:37,910
On the real...

509
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:41,737
...it ain't easy

510
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:43,246
hangin' pictures with one eye.

511
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:48,396
Fact, it ain't easy
tyin' my shoes,

512
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,789
seein' street signs,
or doing damn near anything

513
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:52,095
with one fuckin' eye.

514
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,531
I gave that shit up
for y'all niggas

515
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:55,969
and still came back swingin'.

516
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:58,889
But here I am passed
the fuck over for 'Nique's guy?

517
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:05,591
So who you hangin' pictures for
out in Corona?

518
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:09,999
Yo, didn't even know
you had peoples out there.

519
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:16,641
My cousin Ebony.
Fuck does it matter?

520
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,038
Don't matter.

521
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:23,083
Y'all doing me wrong, Marvin,

522
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,392
and you know this.

523
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:29,002
Yo, we got you, Scrap.

524
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:30,486
Don't even trip.

525
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:40,317
Four bedrooms,
three full baths.

526
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:42,145
Colonial on a quiet street
in Hollis.

527
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:43,890
It's a steal at that price.

528
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,460
What about Forest Hills,
Douglas ton, Little Neck?

529
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:54,809
I think you'll find those
neighborhoods are pricier.

530
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:57,073
What, it look like
I can't afford them?

531
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:59,815
Oh, of course not, no.

532
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:01,251
Sometimes buyers
don't understand

533
00:26:01,335 --> 00:26:03,036
they need to have strong credit

534
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,390
to secure preapproval
for a mortgage from a lender.

535
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,738
- I'm paying cash.
- Oh, wonderful!

536
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:12,393
Fantastic.

537
00:26:12,477 --> 00:26:13,872
Uh, but just to be clear,

538
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:15,787
you'll still need
proof of income,

539
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,485
your last two years'
tax returns, at least,

540
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:18,794
and bank statements.

541
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:21,231
I got all that.

542
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:26,059
You just make sure
that you find me a spot

543
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:27,582
in one of them
pricier neighborhoods

544
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,149
you're talking about.

545
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:40,959
Yeah?

546
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,657
You, uh, Miss Ebony, right?

547
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:43,919
Who asking?

548
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:45,964
New handyman in the area.

549
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,140
Your neighbors up the block
was sayin'

550
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:48,793
you might got some work
that need doin'.

551
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:50,404
Sayin' you got your cousin
or somethin'

552
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:51,753
hangin' pictures and shit.

553
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,189
I don't talk to my neighbors,

554
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:54,495
and I don't talk
to no cousins neither,

555
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:56,149
so who the hell are you?

556
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,628
'Cause you don't look like
no handyman to me.

557
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:59,635
Where your tools
and your work belt?

558
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,329
I don't walk around
with that heavy shit on me.

559
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,463
I'm just saying that, you know,

560
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,117
maybe you-you have some gutters
that need cleanin'

561
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:09,945
or lines that need flushin'

562
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,252
or paintings that need hanging.

563
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:14,558
Last shit I put up on my wall
was a Thriller poster.

564
00:28:14,642 --> 00:28:16,647
That was 1982.

565
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:19,607
Well, if you get a poster
for the new MJ record,

566
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:21,652
let me know.

567
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:24,007
Wait, where you goin'?
What's your name?

568
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,313
You got a card?

569
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,717
What type of handyman
drive a Lexus?

570
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:51,682
♪ You and I together
Till the very end ♪

571
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:53,554
I just don't hear it.

572
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:55,473
Then you ain't listenin'.

573
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:57,514
This girl is the next,
next shit.

574
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:59,473
She gonna change the game.

575
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:02,040
- We signing her.
- No. No, we not.

576
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:05,131
Lou, this a partnership,
a democracy and shit.

577
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,133
That means we-we both
gotta believe in the artist.

578
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:08,786
What are you listening to?

579
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,876
Seeing as I'm financin'
this fuckin' democracy,

580
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,883
my vote counts
more than yours, correct?

581
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:20,450
I guess it...

582
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:23,236
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

583
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,976
Cartier "Duns" Fareed.

584
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,501
My man was
a motherfuckin' shootin' star.

585
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:29,981
Big, bright,
lit up the fuckin'sky.

586
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,548
Had vision beyond the game...

587
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:35,335
Music, art, uptown, downtown.

588
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:38,120
His money was so clean,
you could eat off that shit.

589
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:42,298
Well, if it isn't
Lou-Lou Thomas,

590
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:44,344
the fast-talkin' pretty nigga

591
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:47,521
who thinks he can roll up
on my niece at a red light

592
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,349
with all that light-skinned
smoothness of his.

593
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,307
Cartier Fareed is officially
up in the building.

594
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:53,962
Hey, Zisa, why you ain't
tell me he was your uncle?

595
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:55,355
I for sure
would've kept driving.

596
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,664
I'm not his niece.

597
00:29:57,745 --> 00:29:58,793
Cartier Fareed.

598
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:00,795
Crown Camacho.

599
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:03,976
Cartier Fareed
is in that import-export thing.

600
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,671
He's a top-of-the-food-chain-
type motherfucker, huh?

601
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:10,500
And I'm still hungry.
Now, look here, niggas.

602
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:14,200
I'ma make this short, sweet,
and nonnegotiable.

603
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:17,203
I've got this small
music management group

604
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:21,772
that I've been evolving slowly
but strategically.

605
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:24,427
A collection
of carefully curated artists

606
00:30:24,511 --> 00:30:27,125
that I can hone,
train, and guide.

607
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,563
And Zisa here,

608
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:32,918
she's the cream
of the proverbial crop.

609
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:36,396
Look, I see you got
a fledgling operation in here,

610
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,963
but it's highly unlikely
that you can give Zisa

611
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:42,663
the long-term and lucrative
deal that she deserves.

612
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:45,231
But I know Lou from Lanes

613
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:47,885
and all the other hot spots
that we hit.

614
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:49,713
I propose

615
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:51,802
that we do something that will

616
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,935
be equitable for all sides.

617
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,806
A single deal.

618
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,375
Together,
we will develop, produce,

619
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,073
and release a track for Zisa.

620
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:04,032
See how it feels.

621
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:05,251
Feel each other out.

622
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:07,126
Test the waters, as it may be.

623
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,734
This nigga done?

624
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,301
I'm done, motherfucker.

625
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:14,651
You said a single deal, right?

626
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:16,262
Now, that doesn't guarantee

627
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:18,394
that Zisa stays on our label
if she blows up.

628
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,570
- Crown Camacho.
- Mh-hmm.

629
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:24,095
Macho time.
You any relation to Hector?

630
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,445
Man, me and that motherfucker,
man,

631
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:27,360
we done had some wild nights.

632
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:30,232
This ain't got shit to do
with no Hector.

633
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:33,370
Well, look, man, maybe we could
build somethin' into the deal.

634
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:37,631
Certain thresholds get cleared,

635
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:38,893
we'll sign to the label.

636
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:44,594
Done.

637
00:31:44,678 --> 00:31:46,122
What the fuck?

638
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:49,454
Single deal's for suckers, yo.

639
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:55,431
I said... it's on.

640
00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:57,307
Like Farrakhan.

641
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,921
Yo, I'm tellin' you,
you really need

642
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,270
to check out this fix,

643
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:09,402
Puerto Rican Famous.

644
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:10,794
I'm... no, come on.

645
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:11,665
- It's hot.
- Hey.

646
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:12,666
Yo, you like music?

647
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,189
Look, I got this dope MC.

648
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,146
You gotta check out
his mix tape, man,

649
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,583
Puerto Rican Famous.

650
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,411
He like the next LL
for real right here.

651
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:19,934
- Nah, I'm good.
- Look, I'll do two for one.

652
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:21,762
Two for one.

653
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:23,720
Three for one.
Come on, now. Gimme somethin'.

654
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:25,069
I like how you wearin' that.

655
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,593
How you sellin' my shit
three for one?

656
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:27,768
Three for one,
fucking two for one,

657
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:29,247
nigga, a hundred for one,

658
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:30,118
nobody want these shits
right now.

659
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:31,598
Nigga, I moved a tape.

660
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,604
You traded that
for a hit off a blunt.

661
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,216
What are you boys sellin'?

662
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:40,694
Just mix tapes, man.

663
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:42,086
All right, the both of you,
up against the wall.

664
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,045
What the fuck's a mix tape?

665
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,613
It's music.
I'm a fucking rapper.

666
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:48,528
Hear that? He's a rapper.

667
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:50,138
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

668
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:51,922
And what's your rap name,
rapper?

669
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:54,621
- Famous.
- Famous the rapper

670
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,187
is selling his mix tapes
on the corner.

671
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:58,847
'Cause that's where the best
rappers sell their mix tapes.

672
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:00,409
Supposed to have
a vendor's license

673
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:02,589
to sell anything on the street.

674
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,198
But seeing as you two
ain't doing much sellin',

675
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:08,809
we're gonna let you slide.

676
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,767
Good luck with your rap career,
Famous.

677
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:28,306
You told me
all I was gonna need to do

678
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,831
was to sign into those classes,
then I could bounce.

679
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:32,528
This broad tellin' me

680
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,530
I gotta sit through the shit
every fuckin' week.

681
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:36,489
Uh, some of the instructors

682
00:33:36,573 --> 00:33:38,316
are more willing to play ball
than others.

683
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,144
This one don't give a fuck
about no ball.

684
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,582
I tracked down your friend

685
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:45,541
who was working
as an informant for the police.

686
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,070
There she is. Toni Deep.

687
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:51,808
She's engaged to be married to
a dentist out in Westchester.

688
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:53,767
Ah.

689
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:56,117
Your bitch does have
some nice-ass teeth.

690
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,119
I mean, they hurt, but...

691
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,646
she left the skin on there.

692
00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:04,778
She lives in Harlem.

693
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:07,607
Moved back here about three
years ago from Los Angeles.

694
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:10,048
Divorced twice, no kids.

695
00:34:15,568 --> 00:34:16,793
That's where she live?

696
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,012
A'ight.

697
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:24,062
You owe me.

698
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,978
Well, try as I might,

699
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:32,414
I don't remember shit
from that night.

700
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:33,894
Nothin' at all.

701
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:35,765
Yeah, and we got
nothing on our end.

702
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:37,419
The blood on the jacket
we took off of Kadeem Mathis,

703
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:39,116
street name Unique,

704
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,509
didn't match you or him.

705
00:34:40,593 --> 00:34:42,206
And believe it or not,

706
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,208
his story checks out,
you know?

707
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,645
We got him on camera
at the McDonald's drive-through

708
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:47,168
at the time of the shooting.

709
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,822
We're not done with him yet.

710
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:50,519
We still think he knows more
than he's letting on,

711
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:53,043
but at this point, we can't
even classify him as a lead.

712
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:55,219
Yeah, but we will make his life
miserable nonetheless.

713
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,395
You know why?

714
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,794
Because I don't need a reason.
Fuck him.

715
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,531
Right now, all we got
is some crackhead

716
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:04,402
who was high as a fucking kite

717
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:05,882
who thinks he remembers
seeing a kid

718
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:07,797
but can't give us
any real description.

719
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:10,887
We're not giving up, though.
Not even close.

720
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,194
We just wanted to let you know
where things stand.

721
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,678
I appreciate that.

722
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,074
Wish I could help, fellas.

723
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:21,423
Thank you.

724
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,119
We'll keep you posted.

725
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:26,428
All right.

726
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:30,994
That guy's my fuckin' hero.

727
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:32,692
Yeah.

728
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:36,217
A fucking NYPD Hall of Famer
right there, huh?

729
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,219
♪ Come a little closer
To me... ♪

730
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,177
Hey.

731
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:42,005
What's up, Ma?

732
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:43,833
My fault, I ain't even
see you back there.

733
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,404
Where you been?

734
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:49,626
Me and Famous had a day.

735
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,799
It probably ain't a bad idea

736
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:53,887
for you to let me know
where you are,

737
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,498
'cause I'm your mother.

738
00:35:56,582 --> 00:35:57,807
I get worried.

739
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:00,546
Yeah, I got it.

740
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,535
I just wanna
make sure that you safe.

741
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:05,293
What's wrong, Ma?

742
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,117
It's nothin'.

743
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:09,076
Somethin' is up.

744
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,468
A'ight, I know you not just
trying to know where I'm at

745
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:11,818
on some straight
motherly concern.

746
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:13,127
Talk to me. What's up?

747
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,175
Just that crazy-ass cop.

748
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:19,869
Howard.

749
00:36:19,953 --> 00:36:21,479
Somehow, someway,

750
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:23,264
his brain got all twisted up,
and...

751
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,483
he talkin'
some crazy-ass nonsense,

752
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:28,225
some shit that don't even
make no sense.

753
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,098
And it's possible that he might
step to you talkin' that shit.

754
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:33,143
I just wanna
give you a heads-up.

755
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:35,189
Look, now, he might not
say anything to you at all,

756
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:37,583
so it's not even worth
getting into right now.

757
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,802
But just know that if he does

758
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:42,283
that it's just a crazy police
who got his head all dented.

759
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,414
I thought you said
he didn't even remember

760
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:45,112
what happened that night.

761
00:36:45,196 --> 00:36:47,288
Thought you said he didn't
remember my face, Ma.

762
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,855
- What is this?
- He don't know

763
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,596
what he remembers
or what he forgot, Kanan.

764
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,471
You're good, baby.

765
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,865
I got you.

766
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:00,479
We good.

767
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:07,743
No. What I said was
that he could stay here a night

768
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:09,789
when he got out, that's all.

769
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:13,009
I'm not keeping Jerome
from his daddy, Ma.

770
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:14,750
A father provides.

771
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:17,057
A father works.

772
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:20,408
A father take care
of their own.

773
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:21,801
What's he doing
but sitting around here

774
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:23,541
taking up space,
eating my food?

775
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,934
You know, I don't remember
you complainin'

776
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:26,936
back when I was payin'
your rent,

777
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,851
buyin' your cars, huh?

778
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:31,462
Sendin' you and your broke-ass
church friends to AC

779
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:33,551
every weekend, huh?

780
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:35,336
But I was a provider then,
right?

781
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,645
Right?

782
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,786
I saw Raq today

783
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,792
at the bodega on Sutphin.

784
00:37:54,395 --> 00:37:55,965
What Raq talkin' about?

785
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:57,972
She not talkin'
about anything, 'Nique.

786
00:38:00,097 --> 00:38:02,933
She was just...
I mean, she just stared at me.

787
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:06,584
It scared me...

788
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,195
for all of us...
For me, you, and Jerome.

789
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:16,551
Raq ain't gonna do nothin'
to us, a'ight?

790
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:17,992
How do you know?

791
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:29,346
Look.

792
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,877
I can't say 100-100%
that Scrap bullshittin'...

793
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,224
...but I checked out
his cousin in Corona,

794
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:38,442
and it sure as hell
didn't sound like

795
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:40,140
he was out there hangin' shit.

796
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:41,663
So he lyin'.

797
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:43,447
Maybe.

798
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:44,753
If we ain't for sure,
we don't move on him.

799
00:38:44,837 --> 00:38:46,407
I got somebody on the inside

800
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,452
who say they saw Scrap
up in the precinct talkin'.

801
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,541
That shit alone is enough
to make the call, Lou.

802
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,108
Then why send Marvin
to talk to him

803
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:53,588
and do all that
undercover bullshit?

804
00:38:53,672 --> 00:38:55,029
'Cause I wanna be sure, Lou.

805
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,030
Marvin ain't sure.

806
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,772
Right, Marvin?

807
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:04,294
Like I said,
don't put this shit on me.

808
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:05,948
I told you what I told you.

809
00:39:06,032 --> 00:39:08,081
I won't fuck with it. Hell no.

810
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:09,822
Okay, well, if the shit
is true,

811
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:11,519
Scrap could put
us all away forever.

812
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:15,136
Lose everything, includin'
your fuckin' precious music.

813
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,139
Tell you one thing.

814
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:21,838
I ain't doin' it.

815
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:27,974
I ain't swingin' this time.

816
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:37,023
G57.

817
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:39,160
57G.

818
00:39:42,155 --> 00:39:45,035
B1. B1.

819
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:48,469
Nigga, I'm here to see Deen,
nigga.

820
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,036
Fuck is you?

821
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,906
Deen don't meet with nobody

822
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,734
but friends and family.

823
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:54,257
And you neither, nigga.

824
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:57,260
Well, he gonna wanna see me.

825
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,566
How you gonna do that
with my motherfuckin' pistol

826
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,220
in your mouth, huh?

827
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:01,830
Hey, hey, hey.

828
00:40:01,914 --> 00:40:03,614
That's not necessary, Efrem.

829
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:06,443
Get off me, little-ass nigga.

830
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:08,706
This nigga must've forgot
who the fuck I am, man.

831
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,273
Ain't nobody's forgotten you,
'Nique.

832
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,367
We'd just rather not remember.

833
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:17,715
You gonna need
some bigger soldiers, Deen.

834
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,935
Fit this nigga in my pocket.

835
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:23,983
Look, I'll hit you
with a 30% premium

836
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,767
when I'm back up on top,

837
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:27,377
which won't be long.

838
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,075
I'm already sizin' up corners
out here.

839
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,773
You're not a safe investment,
'Nique.

840
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:34,645
Not now or anytime
in the near distant future.

841
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:38,214
Look, I ain't shoot
that cop, man.

842
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:39,955
That's-that's why
they let me out,

843
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,391
'cause they ain't
got shit on me.

844
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:43,480
And yet,
according to my sources,

845
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:46,483
NYPD continues to consider you
a person of interest.

846
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:47,920
Well, maybe
they interested in me

847
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:49,573
'cause I'm an interesting
motherfucker, Deen.

848
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,532
But I definitely
ain't pop that pig.

849
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,143
G48, G48, 48.

850
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:55,714
It's G48, Grandma.

851
00:40:57,448 --> 00:41:00,236
Raq and her Colombian supplier

852
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,665
have cornered the market
in your old stomping grounds.

853
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:05,938
There's no room
for competition...

854
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:08,118
Not for me or for you.

855
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,296
I'm only competition
if I don't win.

856
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:15,382
But I'm gonna win, Deen.

857
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:17,558
Oh, my gosh, 63.

858
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,474
I just need the assist, a'ight?

859
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:22,737
I'm a little fucked up
right now.

860
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:25,006
But I ain't never asked you
for a favor like this.

861
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:28,917
Desperation doesn't suit you,
'Nique.

862
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:30,049
G1.

863
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:31,615
Let's go.

864
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:33,835
- You makin' a mistake, Deen.
- Let's go.

865
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,663
The fuck off me.

866
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:43,497
You fuckin' up, Deen!

867
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:45,677

To LA.

877
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:32,236
Crown got me a job at
a management company out there.

878
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,526
LA, Crown? What the fuck
is you talkin' 'bout?

879
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,470
I'm goin' tomorrow.

880
00:42:43,554 --> 00:42:45,994
Crown got you a job
in Los Angeles

and you're leaving tomorrow?

882
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:49,780
You know,
I wasn't even planning

883
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,391
on telling you about this

884
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:52,696
because I knew we was
gonna fight about it,

885
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,047
and I'm just so done
fightin' wit' you.

886
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:56,265
But I thought
it'd be mad fucked up

887
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:58,533
if I just left,
so I'm telling you now.

888
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,314
This motherfucker Crown.

889
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:04,621
It's not on Crown, Lou.
I asked him to help me.

890
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:06,232
He didn't just do it
on his own,

891
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:07,755
so don't blame him.

892
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,323
You bouncin' on Fame too?

893
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:13,239
Famous is gonna do
whatever he gonna do.

894
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:14,718
He don't need
my help anymore anyway.

895
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:16,285
Yeah, maybe because
he figured out

896
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,070
that you was gonna
kick his ass to the curb

897
00:43:18,154 --> 00:43:19,288
soon as you got your shot

898
00:43:19,372 --> 00:43:20,997
at being all Beverly Hills
and shit.

899
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:25,903
I gotta look out for myself

900
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:28,127
because no one else
is gonna do it.

901
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:33,002

Look at what they did to us.

907
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:39,515
I was gonna call you
right when I got out, but...

908
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,584
I figured I'd get
some things in order first.

909

Deen ain't fuckin'

Look, I need you back
on my team, Worrell.

912

Strength in numbers, my nigga.

913
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:15,991
Come on, we gotta get
the team back together, man.

914
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:18,602
I'm onto other shit, 'Nique.

915
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,818
Different opportunity.

916
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:23,389
Can't ride with you this time.

917
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:30,179
What, you on Raq's dick, nigga?

918
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:35,227
Ain't nothin' left for you
on the South side, man.

919
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,879
Maybe...

920
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,319
it's time to go.

921
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,536
Nah.

922
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,930
I decide when I wanna go,
Worrell.

923
00:46:47,014 --> 00:46:50,195
Ain't nobody forcin' me
off these blocks...

924
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:54,634
Not the police, not Raq,

925
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:56,640
damn sure not you, nigga.

926
00:47:00,071 --> 00:47:01,993
I'm here.

927
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:04,948
I ain't going nowhere.

928
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:06,472
Well, I ain't going nowhere

929
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:08,609
wit' you...

930
00:47:11,691 --> 00:47:13,043
...brother.

931
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:27,493
I'll be back to visit soon.

932
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:31,758
No. There's nothing here
for you or anybody else.

933
00:47:31,842 --> 00:47:34,373
You go there to Los Angeles,
and you stay there.

934
00:47:42,548 --> 00:47:43,773
Okay.

935
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:47,861
Okay?

936
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:49,170
Okay.

937
00:47:54,604 --> 00:47:56,509
Promise me you won't
give up on your music?

938
00:47:58,303 --> 00:47:59,699
Think I'ma give up
'cause you leavin'?

939
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:02,092
Man, fuck that.

940
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:03,268
Started this shit without you.

941
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:04,621
I'ma blow up without you.

942
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:08,973
Good. I want you to blow up.

943
00:48:10,576 --> 00:48:11,801
I love you.

944
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:28,162
Where to, miss?

945
00:48:28,246 --> 00:48:29,711
Uh, JFK, terminal two.

946
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:41,974
She on the way to the airport,
huh?

947
00:48:44,393 --> 00:48:45,836
Who gives a fuck?

948
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,074
I knew you niggas would come
correct and do what's right.

949
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:12,815
And you know I'ma have
that new lab

950
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:14,991
runnin' like goddamn clockwork,

951
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:16,297
'cause that's how I do.

952
00:49:21,255 --> 00:49:23,391
Yo, that's it?

953
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:25,219
That's-that's the new spot?

954
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:26,873
Whoo!

955
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:31,747
And we gonna be feedin' Baisley
