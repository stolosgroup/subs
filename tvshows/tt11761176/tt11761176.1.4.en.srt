Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,042
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Raising Kanan...

4
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:27,443
<i>Still a lot of chatter</i>

5
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,125
about who put down
this kid Buck Twenty.

6
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:31,329
Buck's folks is angry.
Streets need a body.

7
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:36,492
They're saying D-Wiz got hit
'cause he killed Buck Twenty.

8
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,694
The target's off
of your back now.

9
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:39,095
Don't do nothing
to put it back on.

10
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:41,578
Kanan stays on the stash
until further notice.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,099
I don't want him
anywhere near the street.

12
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:45,221
That's your new office, nigga.

13
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:46,463
Whose house is this?

14
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:48,024
It's just a spot we kick it
from time to time.

15
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:49,786
Look like a damn crack house.

16
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,548
I gotta deal with these guys.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,549
The guys you steal stuff with?

18
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,510
When one of us makes the call,

19
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,591
<i>we all gotta answer.</i>

20
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:56,996
Hey, hey, hey.

21
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,519
He's had enough.

22
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:03,843
You wanna be a singer?
You're gonna sing.

23
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:06,283
Has Lou told you

24
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:07,845
that my little brother Famous
is a rapper?

25
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,286
It ain't come up.

26
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,968
Hey, yo. Who are you?
What are you doing?

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,691
Damn. Uh, my bad.
It's, uh, Kanan, right?

28
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:16,133
Reinforced door,
security cameras.

29
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:17,815
- Take it or leave it.
- I'll take it.

30
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:19,177
I got something for you.

31
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,378
'Nique's re-up.

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,819
Quarter million, uncut.

33
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,341
<i>Do your fucking job,
Detective.</i>

34
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:25,063
Deen's people always circle
the block four times

35
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,345
<i>before they get here.</i>

36
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:28,666
Five-O!

37
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,711
Only one king can rule
the kingdom, 'Nique.

38
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:36,476
<i>One king, one code, one crew.</i>

39
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:33,974
<i>Ha ha. That's right.</i>

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,901
<i>You see
that bitch-ass nigga running?</i>

41
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:20,905
<i>That's Trez-G.</i>

42
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:26,228
<i>He and 'Nique grew up
on the same floor.</i>

43
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,309
<i>Played Little League together.</i>

44
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:32,475
<i>Pop Warner too.</i>

45
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:34,397
<i>Got their dicks sucked
for the first time</i>

46
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,480
<i>on the same night,
at the same party.</i>

47
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:40,203
<i>Day one niggas.</i>

48
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:42,207
<i>To the grave niggas.</i>

49
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:45,768
<i>But none of that adds up
to shit in the game.</i>

50
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,130
We was set up!

51
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:51,815
How do you do?

52
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,937
Please fucking remind me, man.

53
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,941
Open this nigga ear
so he can hear what I'm saying.

54
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,957
You was getting high
on my time, T,

55
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,039
while you was watching my shit!

56
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,842
That ain't me.

57
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:20,284
You know that ain't me.

58
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,652
You right.

59
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:30,655
- That ain't you, B.
- Mm-mm.

60
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:34,018
Just some fucking crackhead
that you turned into, man.

61
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,660
<i>Look at you, man.</i>

62
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:38,063
Don't even fucking
recognize you, man.

63
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,464
One more time.

64
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,705
<i>I don't think
this nigga get it.</i>

65
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:43,270
What?

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,481
You know...

67
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:58,043
I kind of blame myself

68
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:00,806
'cause I brought you
into this shit.

69
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,288
<i>And I saw this coming,</i>

70
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,330
but I closed my eyes to it.

71
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:06,572
You know why?

72
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:10,216
'Cause you
my fucking heart, man.

73
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:12,220
My fucking heart.

74
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,427
<i>I didn't say nothing
to nobody.</i>

75
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,951
I love you, 'Nique!

76
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,532
Love you too, my nigga.

77
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,214
Love you too.

78
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,657
<i>All that history
between them,</i>

79
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,099
<i>Trez never thought
'Nique would turn on him.</i>

80
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,102
- P-We.
<i>- Counted on that.</i>

81
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,625
<i>Bet on that.</i>

82
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:59,787
<i>Slept on that.</i>

83
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,550
<i>And you know what they say.</i>

84
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:04,272
<i>Sleep is the cousin of death.</i>

85
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,414
You always talking
about some cold food

86
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,296
when I'm late.

87
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:29,300
Oh, but you do it, and then...

88
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,024
You already ate.

89
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,947
No, we-we're ready for dinner.

90
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,109
In fact, I was just telling
your mom, I'm starving.

91
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:41,911
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's do this.

92
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:43,793
For real.
I'm hungry as hell, baby.

93
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,755
Uh, spaghetti and meatballs.

94
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:48,039
Classic.
You can't go wrong with that.

95
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:54,003
Well, let me set the table,
and, uh, let's get to eating.

96
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,015
I like you keep it simple.

97
00:07:05,497 --> 00:07:07,499
Thank you, baby.

98
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,382
Presentation is dope.

99
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:16,028
Kanan.

100
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,154
I appreciate you making room
at the table for me, Kanan.

101
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:24,517
I know you weren't
expecting me.

102
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,081
You hear what Symphony
said to you?

103
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,562
Yeah, he right.

104
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:33,004
I wasn't expecting him.

105
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,128
The sauce is bananas.

106
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,132
Even got a little kick to it.

107
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,137
I mean, I'd pay for this.

108
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,701
Where'd you learn
to cook, Kanan?

109
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,822
Moms.

110
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:52,826
Mm.

111
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:55,547
Well, he needs to know
how to fend for himself.

112
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:58,150
Make some meals, do the dishes.

113
00:07:58,152 --> 00:08:00,352
Still working on getting him
to do his own laundry, though.

114
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,757
Well, Kanan got this pasta
on lock.

115
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:11,083
Tonight's usually when Kanan
makes dinner for me.

116
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:13,125
I forgot.

117
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,807
Well, it's my fault.

118
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,689
I didn't know
when I took her out.

119
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,691
My bad.

120
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,376
Now that I know,
it won't happen again.

121
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,861
She knew.

122
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:50,204
Man, I'm never gonna get tired
of watching this.

123
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,807
You're gonna be, like...
like, a big singer,

124
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,408
you know, like,
fucking world-famous.

125
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,412
Stop.

126
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:59,093
I'm serious.

127
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:01,175
You know, I think I need
to kick your ass,

128
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:03,179
knock some sense into you.

129
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,180
Okay.

130
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:08,505
Now you just talking crazy.
You think you stronger than me?

131
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:13,948
You underestimate
this white girl

132
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,949
from the Upper East Side.

133
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,954
Uh, I let you win.

134
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,159
Now, why would you do that?

135
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:27,805
<i>What is going on
up here?</i>

136
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:32,408
It sounds like the ceiling's
about to cave in.

137
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,530
Dancing. We're dancing.

138
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,612
<i>Okay, well,
you might want to tone it down</i>

139
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,214
for the neighbors,
Martha Graham.

Oh, my God.

142
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:44,941
You two are on television.

143
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:47,223
Yeah, it's a tape.
We made it at the mall.

144
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:49,946
Well, this is fantastic.

145
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:52,148
Laverne, you are fantastic.

146
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,549
What a voice.

147
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,431
That's what I keep telling her.

148
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,313
Wow, look at you two.
All right.

149
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:58,515
This is better
than any of the shit

150
00:09:58,517 --> 00:09:59,796
they play on the radio.

151
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,358
Hey, how about you
watch your mouth

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,559
around our guest?

153
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,441
Well, I'm sure
she's heard worse.

154
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:05,482
Am I right, Laverne?

155
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,803
No doubt.

156
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,245
- "No doubt."
- Well, that doesn't mean

157
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:09,526
<i>she needs to hear it
in this home.</i>

158
00:10:09,528 --> 00:10:10,847
Come on, let's just go
set the table for dinner.

159
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,889
Very fly.

160
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,495
Your daddy says I'm fly.

161
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,897
Super fly, apparently.

162
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,901
So weird.

163
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:25,865
Your parents are cool.

164
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:29,349
Yeah, about some things.

165
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:32,071
Not everything.

166
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,455
Shit.

167
00:10:57,618 --> 00:11:00,018
Uh?

168
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,263
- Yes. Yeah.
- Uh-huh? Yeah.

169
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,105
Yeah.

170
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,109
Uh-huh, yeah.

171
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,791
Oh-ho!

172
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,317
Oh, shit.

173
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:21,801
Oh, fuck.

174
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,084
Oh, my God.

175
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:27,887
Oh, shit, yo.

176
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:28,928
Hmm.

177
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,490
Oh, my God.

178
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,892
Yeah, I know. I'm the shit.

179
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:36,616
You want some?

180
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:38,618
No, I don't do that shit.

181
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,622
What, you just sell it?

182
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,791
Oh. Oh.

183
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:52,593
Whew! My God.

184
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,597
Come here.

185
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,958
Yo, fuck are you doing?

186
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,962
Mm, cuddling.

187
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,525
I thought you said
you dated brothers.

188
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,529
Ain't no brothers I know
cuddle.

189
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,570
I've dated
plenty of Black guys

190
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,574
who like to cuddle, Marvin.

191
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:14,337
Well, what happened to all
these cuddling-ass niggas?

192
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,259
'Cause you here with me.

193
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:20,263
Shit.

194
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:24,105
Are-are you for real?

195
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:25,747
You're-you're seriously
gonna leave

196
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:27,789
because I wanted to get close
to you?

197
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,712
Yo, we different,
Toni, okay?

198
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:32,634
Black, white,

199
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,837
bitch, nigga.

200
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,638
I'm from the hood, you from...

201
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,642
wherever the fuck you from
that ain't the hood.

202
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:42,965
So by your logic,
you'd be willing to cuddle

203
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,249
a Black guy from South Jamaica?

204
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,371
Yo, I know you didn't
just call me a faggot.

205
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:54,257
Yo, LT ain't got no food.

206
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,261
<i>I ran out yesterday.</i>

207
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:01,064
Dog hasn't eaten
since yesterday?

208
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,505
But I bet you ate, right?

209
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,307
Look, Marvin, I like you, okay?

210
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:05,628
I don't want us to end
like this.

211
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,592
End? Us?

212
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:10,353
Shit ain't ending, Toni.

213
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,438
Shit ain't even start.
How the fuck it's gonna end?

214
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,600
LT rolling with me.

215
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,522
He don't wanna be hungry
no more.

216
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:20,924
LT was a gift.
You gave him to me.

217
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,566
I also gave you this dick.

218
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,408
You want me
to leave that behind too?

219
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,729
LT!

220
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:30,654
You can't just take him.

221
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,177
Come on. All right.

222
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,700
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

223
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,704
Yeah.

224
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,264
Word.

225
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,311
Deen nervous.

226
00:13:46,313 --> 00:13:48,072
Say he wanna press pause
on any re-up

227
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,195
until the police
show they hand.

228
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,756
Said it's too hot right now.

229
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:53,678
<i>We dying out here, 'Nique.</i>

230
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,480
Not enough work to get us
through the week.

231
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,482
If the connect deads us,
we dead.

232
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:00,125
That cop played the fuck
out of us, killed us.

233
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:02,928
Trez sucking on that glass dick
is what killed us, P-We!

234
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,410
Took his eye
off the fucking ball, man!

235
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,573
<i>This ain't about no Howard.</i>

236
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:09,855
I ain't never trusted that cop.

237
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:12,938
I never told that pig shit.

238
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,140
'Cause I don't trust nobody.

239
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:17,423
Let's be motherfucking clear,
man.

240
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:21,267
Any one of y'all can end up
like Trez.

241
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,949
Everyone here is suspect!

242
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,153
Load them corners up.

243
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:28,995
Step hard on what we got left.

244
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:30,757
<i>Listen, 'Nique,</i>

245
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,399
ain't no crackhead
gonna fuck with us later

246
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:36,202
if we puttin' out
wack-ass rock now.

247
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:38,845
That's why we gonna put 'em out
as orange caps, P.

248
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,687
New batch.

249
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,649
And when we
all the way up again,

250
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:44,931
we're gonna roll out
them tornado testers,

251
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,373
pink caps,

252
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,735
put niggas on they backs
and shit, a'ight?

253
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:52,219
But for now,
stomp on that shit, man.

254
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:53,340
It's already stretched.

255
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,344
Stretch it some more, then,
nigga!

256
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:57,985
Come on!

257
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,198
Raq's stink all over this shit.

258
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,680
Smell her ass from here.

259
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:14,962
We gonna hit back, though.

260
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,724
I just gotta figure out
if it's gonna be

261
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:20,168
to the body...

262
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,689
or to the head.

263
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:45,634
Look, I'm sorry about dinner,

264
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:47,356
but I'm done asking
my 15-year-old son

265
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:49,680
to forgive me for spending time
with a dude that I like.

266
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,726
I ain't heard you ask
for forgiveness.

267
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:58,087
And you ain't gonna hear it.

268
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,408
That's what I'm telling you.

269
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,413
That's what you need
to make peace with.

270
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,734
Dr. West called.

271
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:06,416
<i>Said your grades
still slipping,</i>

272
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:07,857
that you haven't even turned in
some term paper

273
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,379
that you owe in history.

274
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,820
Yeah, had a lot on my mind, Ma.

275
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,063
Well, then let me
clear your mind for you.

276
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:15,025
I told you that if you didn't
get your books right,

277
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,947
things were gonna change.

278
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:18,951
You done with the stash house.
You moving on.

279
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,512
Word.

280
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,675
I'm ready to move up.
Thank you.

281
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,757
What, you think you getting
a promotion up in here?

282
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,198
Hell no.

283
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,481
I signed you up
for an after-school class.

284
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:32,363
I'm doing the paper.
I-I'll have it in this week.

285
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,044
Too little, too late.

286
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:35,726
I found you a class
at City College

287
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,128
that meets two days a week
after school

288
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,209
and every other Saturday.

289
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,490
Saturday?

290
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:40,571
Ain't no school on Saturday.

291
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:41,652
There is for you.

292
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:43,534
I just said I'll do the paper.

293
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,976
And I just said
that it's too late for that.

294
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,257
You need to worry less

295
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:47,658
about who I'm
kicking it with, Kanan,

296
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,021
and a hell of a lot more
about your schoolwork.

297
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,680

Okay.

308
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,858
<i>Not bad. Your flow is nice.</i>

<i>I think, lyrically,</i>

00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:28,741
you just may need
a little help.

311
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:30,903
Um, that last line worked...

312
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:33,386
"The streets need a body."

313
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:36,189
The rest was
a little corny to me.

314
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,510
<i>I don't think nobody buying</i>

315
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:39,432
<i>your high school ass

316
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,834
You know, heads need the truth,

317
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:43,476
that street shit,
that dope boy realness.

318
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:45,038
Now, your audience
is gonna smell your bullshit

319
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,560
from a mile away.

320
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:47,921
<i>You got this.</i>

321
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:49,723
It's right here. Find it.

322
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,808
Find it. Take your time.

323
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:56,332
Famous can do whatever
you want him to do.

324
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,932
- You think?
- Yeah.

325
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,694
Did I tell you that he was
on the radio?

326
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,656
Yeah, when he was nine
because he wrote a poem

327
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,658
about litter and it was
the best in the whole city.

328
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,140
Yeah, you told me.

329
00:18:06,142 --> 00:18:08,102
And they started calling him
Famous right then

330
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,945
because they knew
that he was gonna be somebody.

331
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:12,747
Well, he's a nobody right now,

332
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,789
and I don't think niggas
is bumping

333
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,833
poems about litter
out they Alpine.

334
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:22,517
Look, I got a showcase
coming up.

335
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,160
It's a opportunity
for a select few artists

336
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,601
just to get in the room
and perform

337
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,723
- for some industry heads.
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:31,126
Famous sign with me,

339
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:32,647
and let's just assume
that we can get

340
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:33,688
the track in the right place...

341
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,054
<i>It's the door
on your left.</i>

342
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,337
<i>...I feel like
putting him in that room</i>

343
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:44,660
<i>full of trendsetters
and tastemakers,</i>

344
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:45,861
you know, see what they think.

345
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,543
But you know that's gonna mean

346
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:49,465
we have to work together
real close.

347
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:51,387
Whatever it takes.

348
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,909
Hey.

349
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:55,831
Let's do it!
Well, shit, if you excited,

350
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,233
- I'm excited.
- Let's do this.

351
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:59,237
Let's go!

352
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:01,759
Hey, baby.

353
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:05,481
What's good?

354
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,485
What's good?

355
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:14,693
Let me holler at you outside.

356
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,614
Yeah.

357
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,273
What are you doing here?

358
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:38,876
Business, Lou.
I'm doing business.

359
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,880
That's what you call
business now?

360
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:45,603
Okay, you know
how your big sister put you on?

361
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,285
Well, I'm doing the same
for Famous.

362
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,006
What happened to all that shit
you was feeding me

363
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,608
about me doing
this music thing,

364
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,929
having my own shit?

365
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,291
Yeah, I said you should do it.

366
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,013
I didn't say that I'd wait
for you to do it.

367
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,095
I'm on a different clock
than you, Lou.

368
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,576
So is my little brother.

369
00:19:58,578 --> 00:19:59,697
What are you on, Crown time?

370
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,942
I'm on my time.

371
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:08,747
I meant what I said, okay?

372
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,869
Lou, you...

373
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,873
you could do whatever you want.

374
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,357
But I can't do it for you.
You need to do it for yourself.

375
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:25,566
I gotta get back in there.

376
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:35,294
Go ahead.

377
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:47,587
<i>Fourteen-gauge
double-reinforced steel.</i>

378
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:50,030
<i>Got locks and dead bolts
up and down this shit.</i>

379
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Nobody gets in here
unless I say so.

380
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:01,241
- Got me?
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,244
It's my guys.

382
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,138
All right, calm down.
Calm down, yo.

383
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:18,139
<i>Yo, he good.
He don't bite.</i>

384
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:19,660
Just got a shitty attitude,
that's all.

385
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:22,423
Nigga needs training,
just like his owner.

386
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,585
Yo, man, kiss my ass, Lou.

387
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,147
Marvin's gonna oversee
the movement and storage

388
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:28,149
of our product and cash.

389
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,711
This gonna be the new stash.

390
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:32,834
More secure, more secret,
more private.

391
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,516
I want you to move everything
today.

392
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:36,398
Well, how much more
drugs and money?

393
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,839
Don't worry about it.

394
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,721
Don't worry about it?
I-I have to know.

395
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,765
We tell you what you need
to know, Gabe.

396
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:44,967
I demand to know how much
you bring.

397
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,448
This is my place of business.

398
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,570
This is my place of business
now, <i>papi,</i>

399
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:50,252
and don't ever tell me
what the fuck to do again.

400
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:52,256
I don't answer to you.

401
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:55,019
Marvin'll see you tonight.

402
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:58,140
Stay out his fucking way.

403
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:12,275
<i>Look, I'd rather go
to some after-school shit</i>

404
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:15,558
than have to come home
and babysit every day.

405
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,121
So who watches her
while you at school?

406
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:19,242
Been paying a neighbor,

407
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:21,204
but it's starting
to cost a grip.

408
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,047
Yo, is your mom still talking
to that same guy?

409
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,889
Davina...

410
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,410
...how about this fool
bum-rushed my dinner

411
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,132
the other night?

412
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:31,775
I cook for me and my mom
every Tuesday,

413
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:33,779
and this motherfucker
just pulls up a chair?

414
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,902
It's nice that you all eat
together.

415
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,584
Your moms likes him, Kanan.

416
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:42,588
Don't you want your mom
to be happy?

417
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:46,831
Look, on the real,

418
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,273
I wish my mom gave
enough of a fuck about me

419
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:51,956
to send me
to some after-school class.

420
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,317
Shit, I don't even know
where the fuck

421
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,321
my mom is right now.

422
00:22:56,963 --> 00:22:59,243
Want me to come
babysit with you?

423
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:02,447
Kanan, you don't wanna
change diapers.

424
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,330
Shit, I don't wanna
change diapers.

425
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,332
Go kick it
with your cousin and Famous.

426
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:09,334
A'ight.

427
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:10,896
- I'll get at you later.
- You better.

428
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:13,538
<i>Shit, nigga kissed her.</i>

429
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:20,506
All right, slow down,
slow down, slow, slow, slow.

430
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,393
What's up, baby girl?

431
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:28,193
Hey, 'Nique.

432
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:30,916
I ain't seen you
since Buck went down.

433
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,920
May the brother rest in peace.

434
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:36,842
Just been watching my sister.

435
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:39,125
Yeah, you know, I heard
your moms was on one

436
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,247
out in some spot in BK,

437
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:43,049
out in East New York,

438
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,891
belly
of the motherfucking beast.

439
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:46,573
You know, I'm sorry
to tell you like that.

440
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,854
I know that shit sting.

441
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,738
Look, your moms ain't
all the way gone yet,

442
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,141
though, Davina.
She still in there somewhere.

443
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,424
In fact, I heard her bragging
on you the other day,

444
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:59,586
talking about how you put
some shorty down

445
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,948
for disrespecting Buck.

446
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,471
Said she loved you for that.
I'ma walk with you.

447
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:08,435
You know Rudy
from round the way, right?

448
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:11,198
Well, Rudy's married
to my cousin.

449
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,801
<i>Fool smoked crack
for a year straight,</i>

450
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:17,044
<i>taxed everything in the crib
but the copper pipes.</i>

451
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:20,287
So I sent him away on my dime.

452
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,690
Fool got clean,

453
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,972
got a job or whatever.

454
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:26,374
Coaches his kids'
hoops team now.

455
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:27,735
Shit, he done turned

456
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:29,739
into motherfucking
Heathcliff Huxtable.

457
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,580
Look, I'm just saying,

458
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:34,983
your moms can get clean
like that too,

459
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:36,825
and I can pay for it.

460
00:24:36,827 --> 00:24:39,788
You see, you Buck's girl.

461
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,030
I know he'd want me
to look out for you

462
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:45,514
same way I know he'd want you
to look out for me too.

463
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:48,156
Token of appreciation
type shit.

464
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:50,160
And I ain't asking for much.

465
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:53,842
What's Raq's baby boy
talking about?

466
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:58,047
I see y'all, you know, getting
all close and all that now.

467
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,129
Nothing,
Kanan's not even in on the mix

468
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,330
with his mom's shit.

469
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:02,812
Yeah?

470
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:05,014
'Cause I know you heard
the same noise I did.

471
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:08,097
Now, look, I ain't saying
Kanan put Buck down,

472
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:09,979
but the kid who did,

473
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:12,742
G-Wiz or whatever his name is,

474
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,624
you know, that's Kanan's boy,

475
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:16,065
so that stand to reason

476
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,307
that Kanan might know
a little bit more

477
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,311
than he telling you, <i>mami.</i>

478
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,673
Look, Kanan...
we talked about that.

479
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:25,677
Kanan doesn't know anything.

480
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
Oh, all right.

481
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:33,043
Man, she getting big.

482
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,047
Where did Rudy go to get clean?

483
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:39,169
Spot outside Utica, Davina.

484
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,011
You should see the shit.

485
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:43,253
<i>Out in the woods,
nature and shit.</i>

486
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:45,616
Shit make me wanna become
a basehead

487
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:49,140
just so I could get away
and relax.

488
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:51,302
Listen, I wanna help you
and your moms, a'ight?

489
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:52,863
I really do.
All I'm asking for

490
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:54,585
is a little love in return.

491
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,706
That's it.

492
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,428
You do me that, and I got you.

493
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:03,034
Nothing happens to Kanan.

494
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,557
On my own kid. Come on.

495
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:15,287
I saw Kanan outside this house
one time.

496
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:24,018
Yeah, where?

497
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:33,746
Yo! Hurry up, man!

498
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,508
Fame, ease up, man.

499
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,990
About to take the top spot
in this shit.

500
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:39,632
High score up in here. Ooh!

501
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,113
Swear to God, I been blessed

502
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:42,595
with some sort
of <i>Street Fighter</i> greatness,

503
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:43,956
'cause I am just
a straight killer

504
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,518
<i>on this machine!</i>

505
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,320
Whatever. Yo.

506
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,963
We about to hear my rhymes
on <i>Stretch and Bobbito,</i> son.

507
00:26:49,965 --> 00:26:51,484
Ah, you putting a beat
to "Litter Makes Me Bitter"?

508
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:54,767
What, the poem
that made Famous famous?

509
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:58,251
Fuck both of y'all, a'ight?

510
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:00,173
This dude named Crown
gonna put me on.

511
00:27:00,175 --> 00:27:01,454
He got a record label and shit.

512
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:02,936
I'm even recording a song
that I'm gonna perform

513
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,097
in front of all these
music industry people

514
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:05,419
at a show.

515
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:07,220
Crown Camacho.

516
00:27:07,222 --> 00:27:08,622
Bulletproof Records.
Your Uncle Lou know him.

517
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:10,304
Introduced him to my sister.

518
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:12,386
How you paying for studio time?

519
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:15,349
Like I said,
Crown looking out for me.

520
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:16,910
Get your shit on wax, Juke,

521
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:18,953
and maybe I can put you
in front of Crown,

522
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:21,075
and maybe you can get on
this mic, too, at the showcase.

523
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:22,316
But you gotta move
with the quickness.

524
00:27:22,318 --> 00:27:24,959
- Show's coming up fast.
- Fuck!

525
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:26,963
What?

526
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,366
And what the fuck
was that about?

527
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:33,928
She been boosting for months

528
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,570
trying to get loot for a demo.

529
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,654
Then your dumb ass
just stumbles on it.

530
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,936
Ain't nobody stumbling, nigga.

531
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,818
Y'all got skills
on these fucking machines.

532
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,822
I got skills on the M-I-C.

533
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,433
Yo, Scrap.

534
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:01,637
Yo, nigga, I know
you home, man.

535
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,641
I saw your Cherokee
parked out front.

536
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:06,802
Scrap!

537
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,289
Yo, fuck happened to you?

538
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,371
Bad kung pao chicken.

539
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:16,652
It's killing me.

540
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:17,733
<i>Yo, we gotta move everything</i>

541
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,535
from the stash house
to the new spot.

542
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,619
Put some clean drawers on,
saddle the fuck up.

543
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,781
I said I'm sick, man.

544
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:26,262
There's a bathroom
in the stash house.

545
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,464
You good.

546
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:29,828
My ass is leaking, nigga.

547
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:33,031
I ain't going nowhere.

548
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,483
Yo, Juke.

549
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,487
Hey, Juke, you good?

550
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,050
Famous' sister getting
his wack ass free studio time

551
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:55,132
and a shot
at this industry people thing.

552
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,174
Meanwhile, my ass
is saving up all my pennies

553
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:59,617
just to get my goddamn foot
in the door.

554
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:01,819
Man, you gonna kick that door
open, 'cause when that shit is,

555
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:03,981
you ain't never gonna be
closed on again.

556
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,023
I gotta go.

557
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:07,986
A'ight, I'll catch up
with you later.

558
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:11,990
<i>Yo, Kanan.</i>

559
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:13,912
Yo.

560
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:16,634
I been driving all over,
looking for your wayward ass.

561
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:19,157
Need some help. Get in.

562
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,679
I can't. I got class tonight.

563
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:22,080
<i>Class?</i>

564
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:23,241
<i>What, you got night school,
nigga?</i>

565
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:24,603
<i>Learning a trade?</i>

566
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:25,724
<i>Is my nephew
about to be a plumber</i>

567
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:27,486
up in this motherfucker?

568
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,250
Mom set it up, a'ight?

569
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:32,611
Starts in a couple hours.

570
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:34,453
Yo, this ain't
gon' take that long.

571
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:35,414
Let's ride.

572
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,096
Where?

573
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,737
Gotta move shit out the stash.

574
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,379
Mommy told me
the stash off-limits.

575
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:41,660
I ain't supposed to touch it.

576
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:42,862
Yo, man, we gon' be
in and out so fast,

577
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,223
you won't even know
we was there.

578
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:46,227
Neither will she.

579
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,309
I know I ain't working
for free.

580
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:53,393
This ain't work,
because you still in training.

581
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:55,154
Time to put them reps in.

582
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,326
<i>I need two units,</i>

583
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:07,767
<i>one on top of the other.</i>

584
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:09,329
For real?

585
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:10,931
Building's full.

586
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:13,694
I mean, no vacancies.

587
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:15,175
I'd have to throw people
out on the street.

588
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:16,577
They'd be a'ight.

589
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:18,418
I'ma hit them off
with some relocation money.

590
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,140
I don't know, though.

591
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:21,782
They file a complaint
or some shit,

592
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:23,944
then Housing gonna be
up in my ass, so...

593
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:25,266
Well, maybe I should
go over to the Forties

594
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:26,147
and see what they got
available.

595
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:27,548
Jamaica Houses?

596
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,430
They ain't got
no empty apartments neither.

597
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,472
I might be able to move
the manager over there

598
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:34,037
in a way that you ain't willing
to move.

599
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,803
I might have some apartments
on the seventh floor.

600
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:43,525
No, seventh and eighth floor.

601
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:45,529
Like I said,
one on top of the other.

602
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,736
Got you.

603
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:12,114
So Famous gets free studio time

604
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:14,118
and your niece gets nothing.

605
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,238
It's good to see you too, Juke.

606
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,400
<i>Come on, Uncle Lou.</i>

607
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:19,484
How you gonna do me like this?

608
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:23,005
You think I wouldn't get you
studio time if I could?

609
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,647
<i>It ain't my thing.</i>

610
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,410
Famous' sister made that happen
for Famous, not me.

611
00:31:27,412 --> 00:31:29,692
But you can make it happen
for me.

612
00:31:29,694 --> 00:31:32,896
You know this guy Crown.
Just ask him for a favor.

613
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:34,900
Come here.

614
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:44,307
Let me tell you something.

615
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:46,029
Favors is just another way

616
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,751
of ending up
under somebody's thumb,

617
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:49,433
and I don't know about you,
but I already got

618
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:51,437
way too much of that
in my life, you heard?

619
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:53,357
What about this show

620
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,439
for all these
music industry people?

621
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:57,481
Can you help me with that?

622
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:58,843
I can't.

623
00:31:58,845 --> 00:32:02,566
Damn.

624
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:04,729
You turning into my dad,

625
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:06,691
good for nothing.

626
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,573
Now, you know I'd give you
the money myself,

627
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:10,214
but Marvin would lose
his damn mind,

628
00:32:10,216 --> 00:32:12,096
talking about,
"She's my daughter.

629
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,218
Don't be doing shit for her.
We had to do it for ourselves.

630
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,741
She gotta do it for her."

631
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:18,703
I don't want your money anyway.

632
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:21,266
If you had the hookup,
that's one thing,

633
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:22,787
but just hitting me off...

634
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:25,430
See? You same as me.

635
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:27,272
Don't wanna owe nobody.

636
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:29,276
That's a good rule to have.

637
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:31,877
You eat?

638
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:33,881
I gotta go.

639
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:36,684
Ju-ju...

640
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:40,608
...eat.

641
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:45,453
Thanks.

642
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,653
Love you too.

643
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,895
Later.

644
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:50,937
<i>Well, what happened
to all that,</i>

645
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,138
"When somebody makes a call,

646
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,100
we all gotta answer it,"
bullshit?

647
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:01,107
I need this one, Twin.

648
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,709
Some shit's coming up,
and I gotta get this cash

649
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:04,390
quick-fast, in a hurry.

650
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:09,676
Look, I'm going
to the same spot.

651
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:11,438
They the only ones
getting Suicides in the city.

652
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,240
That's why I need someone
looking out.

653
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:20,767
Fuck you, then.

654
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:22,249
Fuck all y'all.

655
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:46,114
Yo, bitch didn't lie.

656
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:48,118
Hmm?

657
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:51,159
Oh, shit.

658
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,243
Not when she trying to save
her mama, she not.

659
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:14,725
Hey, get...

660
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:16,768
Get the fuck off me, man!

661
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,129
- Calm down. Stop.
- Let me go!

662
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:20,133
Stop, stop.

663
00:35:24,778 --> 00:35:26,780
I know you.

664
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,382
Keep it.

665
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:31,623
We're even now, all right?

666
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,705
You understand?

667
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:35,827
Get the fuck out of here.

668
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:37,469
Next time, I won't let you go.

669
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:39,071
You got that?

670
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:56,849
Damn.

671
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,252
Shit messy.

672
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:00,613
Well, they say
messy motherfuckers

673
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:01,814
is geniuses.

674
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:03,818
Then you Albert Einstein.

675
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,500
Hey, don't tell your moms.

676
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:09,102
Shit supposed to be all
counted and bundled,

677
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:10,824
and tidy and shit.

678
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:13,226
Look, man, we gonna load it
into them boxes,

679
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:14,748
cover with that shit.

680
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,269
We gonna march it
right into the bodega

681
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:17,470
like we doing
the day's deliveries.

682
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:19,713
Where Scrappy at?

683
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,715
Shitting himself
back at the crib.

684
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:23,719
Yo, start packing, nigga.

685
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:57,992
We about to tax
these motherfuckers, man.

686
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,253
Yo, keep boxing up.

687
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:19,815
I'll be back in 20.

688
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:22,618
Make sure your slow ass
is done by then.

689
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,860
I'ma lock it up.

690
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:26,864
Make sure you don't fucking
open the door for no one.

691
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:30,708
Yo. For no one.

692
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:42,358
I saved his ass last time.

693
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,363
And he saved mine.

694
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:49,125
He let me go with the jacket.

695
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:51,928
Yeah, see? That's karma.

696
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,932
You do nice things,
and nice things happen to you.

697
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:57,895
I gotta be honest, though.

698
00:37:57,897 --> 00:38:00,017
This just seems
like a regular jacket.

699
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,418
<i>I don't get it. I don't get</i>

700
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,580
risking everything
for a fucking ski coat.

701
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,223
That's 'cause that shit
was made for you, Nicole.

702
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:08,786
You and all your friends.

703
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,389
See, me

704
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:14,392
and people that look like me,

705
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:17,195
we ain't supposed to have
that jacket.

706
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:19,757
Supposed to be out of reach
for us.

707
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:21,761
Part of a world
that ain't ours.

708
00:38:24,644 --> 00:38:27,765
Ralph Lauren came up
in the Bronx.

709
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:30,288
And his name
wasn't even Ralph Lauren.

710
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,291
It was Ralph Lifshitz,

711
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:36,334
and Ralph Lifshitz
didn't come from no money.

712
00:38:36,336 --> 00:38:38,096
He was poor as hell.

713
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,938
Didn't have nothing.

714
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,343
That's what his whole
Polo shit's based on.

715
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:46,745
Things he wished he had.

716
00:38:46,747 --> 00:38:49,308
Things he was striving for.

717
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,592
Some kind of life
that wasn't meant for him,

718
00:38:53,754 --> 00:38:55,756
A life he dreamed of living.

719
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:59,679
So...

720
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:01,160
Ralph Lauren like me.

721
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:02,722
He a lowlife.

722
00:39:02,724 --> 00:39:05,324
Shit. I don't wanna mess it up.

723
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:07,328
I'm giving it to you.

724
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:10,610
But I thought the whole point
was so you can sell it

725
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:12,772
so you can get money
and get into a studio.

726
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:15,935
It's like that whole karma
thing you were talking about.

727
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,459
That security guard just let me
have it like he did,

728
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:21,501
and...

729
00:39:21,503 --> 00:39:24,504
I'm thinking...

730
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:26,869
maybe you're right
about all this boosting anyway.

731
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:32,194
I want you to have it.

732
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:35,678
I want you to think of me
every time you wear it.

733
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,280
I think about you

734
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:41,762
anytime I'm thinking
about anything.

735
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,367
Shit. I love this song.

736
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:52,814

745

I've never done this before.

746
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,909
I have.

747
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,873
Mm. What should I do?

748
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,315
Uh, whatever feels good.

749
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,873
Don't even breathe,
motherfucker.

750
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:37,722
How much more?

751
00:41:37,724 --> 00:41:39,925
Yo, you need
to stop sweating me, man.

752
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:46,331
We get busy about five o'clock.

753
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,173
I don't want my customers
to be disturbed.

754
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,177
I'm the only customer
that matters, nigga.

755
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:53,781
C-c...

756
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,669
Where'd your mans take
the rest?

757
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:06,112
Yo, I don't know, all right?
They don't tell me shit.

758
00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:08,034
Don't think I don't know
who you are, nigga.

759
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:09,916
And I know you were there
when Buck got hit.

760
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:11,677
I oughta just cap you
on the strength of that alone.

Go!

you hear me?

767
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:33,963
Breathe, brother.

00:43:33,965 --> 00:43:35,967
Yo, just breathe.

769
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:40,810
You know whose kid that is?

770
00:43:40,812 --> 00:43:42,814
Yeah, I know who he...

771
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,509
'Nique's boy.

772
00:44:03,956 --> 00:44:05,958
Goddamn!

773
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:11,562
Yo, you hit?

774

Yo, half our shit
just left in that van.

Hey, you should've just let him
kill me.

776
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:25,736
Once my mom find out I'm here,
I'm dead anyway.

Yo, that's why she ain't
gon' find out.

and she'll never know
you were here.

780
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:38,470
Shit.
I shouldn't have left you here.

781
00:44:38,472 --> 00:44:39,711
Fuck!

782
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:49,321
You're late, Kanan.

783
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:51,043
Got caught up at the pizza spot
with Famous.

784
00:44:51,045 --> 00:44:52,524
I'll be down in a few.

785
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,086
You got one minute.

786
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:49,063
Wait up.

787
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:50,865
We need to talk.

788
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,869
I'm already late.

789
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:01,438
I want you to like Symphony.

I will.

791
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,162
Dude just feels different,
that's all.

792
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:09,804
Well, sometimes different
is good.

793
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:11,566
I should probably get to class.

794
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,650
Never thought
I'd hear you say that.

795
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,533
All I'm asking is,

796
00:46:18,535 --> 00:46:20,615
you just give him
a chance, Kanan.

797
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:22,619
Just don't make no decisions
about him yet.

798
00:46:24,622 --> 00:46:26,501
Nobody will ever be
more important to me than you.

00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,190
<i>As I was saying,</i>

808
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:14,872
New York City has the largest
and most varied collection

809
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,714
of skyscrapers in the world,

810
00:47:16,716 --> 00:47:19,156
but it wasn't always
skyscrapers.

811
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:21,160
You okay?

812
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:23,681
<i>There's no other city
in the world</i>

813
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:25,843
<i>that can rival the size
and scope</i>

814
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:27,405
<i>of New York's skyline.</i>

815
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:28,686
<i>Why is that important?</i>

816
00:47:28,688 --> 00:47:30,167
<i>When I was in the pen,</i>

817
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:32,170
<i>I met this dude who had
a disease or some shit</i>

818
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:34,692
<i>that made it
so he never slept.</i>

819
00:47:34,694 --> 00:47:36,774
<i>He'd close his eyes
every now and then,</i>

820
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:38,416
<i>but most of the time,</i>

821
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:41,259
<i>that nigga was wide awake.</i>

822
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:43,661
<i>And I remember saying to him,</i>

823
00:47:43,663 --> 00:47:45,944
<i>"Man, that ain't a disease.
That's a blessing.</i>

824
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:50,268
<i>You keep your head up 24-7."</i>

825
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,351
<i>And he said,
"Ain't no gift, nigga.</i>

826
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:55,594
<i>"You don't sleep,
you don't dream.</i>

827
00:47:55,596 --> 00:47:57,436
<i>"You don't dream,
you don't ever go nowhere</i>

828
00:47:57,438 --> 00:48:00,199
<i>but where you are."</i>

829
00:48:00,201 --> 00:48:02,321
<i>But he was wrong.</i>

830
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:04,563
<i>You sleep in this game,</i>

831
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:08,207
<i>the only dreams you have
are nightmares.</i>

832
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,731
<i>And them nightmares</i>

833
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:13,412
<i>all end the same way.</i>

834
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:50,075

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
