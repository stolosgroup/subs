1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

<font color=#ffff00>"Raising Kanan"...</font>

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,921
The secret language you talk
with Uncle Marv and Lou-Lou?

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,712
Ma, I'm telling you,
I know stuff.

5
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:25,972
How long you been
trying to get with her?

6
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:27,986
- Since second grade.
- Maybe you should move on.

7
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:31,166
We met at the choir competition
at City Center last week.

8
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:32,049
Sup?

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,690
This bitch doesn't know
who she's fucking with.

10
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:39,804
Who you calling a bitch?

11
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:44,827
I'm in a specific line of work.

12
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,125
If it's not a problem for you,
it's not a problem for me.

13
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:49,258
I'm sorry. I got to go.

14
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:50,647
Kanan's not in this.

15
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,976
Kanan's you
and Def Con's boy, Raq.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,359
That nigga been in this shit

17
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:55,960
before he was even
in this shit.

18
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:57,343
Unique trying
to muscle his way

19
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:58,615
into our corners again.

20
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,182
We need to push back.
He need to feel us.

21
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,097
Saw Buck on your mom's
corner on the way over.

22
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:04,564
Y'all lay back.
Me and D will do this.

23
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:10,409
Who shot him?
You or me?

24
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:12,624
You and your friends
killed that boy

25
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,239
for a corner I already gave up.

26
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:16,163
- I didn't know you gave it up.
- Exactly!

27
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:18,014
You don't know,
but you think you do.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,921
- Kanan!
- I'm good, I'm good.

29
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,560
These boys,
they got prices on their heads.

30
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,702
My son don't got
nothing to say to you.

31
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,249
Watch your back Raquel.

32
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,069
You wanted to be in it,
you in it.

72
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,315
They teach you
about this nigga Isaac Newton.

73
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:16,100
This noise on every action
has an opposite reaction...

74
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,912
That's Newton shit.

75
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,408
He said that.

76
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:23,499
And that's real in the lab
and on these streets.

77
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,284
Everything you done
come back at you.

78
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:28,373
And sometimes
that shit come at you

79
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,673
while you're taking out your
garbage in front of your crib.

80
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,315
Kanan, hurry up!

81
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,912
First day back at school
since...

82
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:47,653
all that went down.

83
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,003
Look, it's only been a few days.

84
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:50,336
It's gonna still be hot
out there.

85
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,180
You need to watch yourself.

86
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,811
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

87
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,311
You're not good, Kanan.

88
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:57,029
Not even close to good.

89
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,205
I'm not good, then.

90
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,209
Wait, you're hearing me,
but you're not listening to me.

91
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,051
That boy's people in a pain
that's never gonna end.

92
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,374
The only thing that
they living for right now

93
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,110
is finding out
who took him from them

94
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:11,561
and figuring out how they
gonna kill them when they do.

95
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,247
Fuck it.

96
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,216
Maybe you should
just stay home,

97
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,295
let shit rest another minute.

98
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:22,202
So you gonna keep me
locked up in here

99
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:23,457
for the rest of high school?

100
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:24,807
It crossed my mind.

101
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:28,333
Ma, I'm good, all right?

102
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:33,927
I'm missed, but I got to go.

103
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,009
Eyes open, Kanan...

104
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,358
at all times.

105
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,398
Kanan!

106
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,003
- What?
- I'm gonna drive you.

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,007
Word.

108
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:47,877
Ma, when are you
bringing me in?

109
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:50,062
Serious?

110
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,178
When we were on that
beach, buckin' off those guns.

111
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,093
You said you was gonna
get me involved,

112
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:04,877
get me started in the business.

113
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,054
You been started, Kanan.

114
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:08,881
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

115
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,753
You pull that trigger,
you in it.

116
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,016
Ain't no going back now.

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,758
People are talking,
pointing fingers,

118
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,586
and you can be damn sure
that some of those fingers

119
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,618
gonna be pointed at you
and your friends.

120
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,809
I'm scared, Kanan.

121
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:27,117
And I need you
to be here with me

122
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,338
because that fear keeps us
alert and awake.

123
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,253
It keeps us alive.

124
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:33,819
So be scared.

125
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:36,170
Scared of them or scared of me,
but be scared.

126
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:39,434
I'm scared.

127
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:59,193
Clear the way.

128
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:00,498
- Hey, let go of her hair!
- Get off!

129
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,197
Let go. Let...

130
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:05,416
Yo, Buck wasn't shit,
and he didn't love you anyhow.

131
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,505
He was with me
the night before.

132
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:11,857
Oh, bitch!

133
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:13,859
Take them to my office
right now!

134
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:17,820
You all have somewhere to be,
so get there, now!

135
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,041
Move!

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,958
Davina got heart.

137
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,396
Fighting over a dead nigga.

138
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,789
It don't get
much stupider than that.

139
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,582
I told you not to slide
them corners to Unique,

140
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,410
but you did it anyway.

141
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:45,543
Now he got our spots,
and Kanan's still a mark.

142
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:47,676
In other words, we gave up
all that shit for nothing.

143
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,678
You seen my house
recently, Marvin?

144
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,984
It's got slugs in it.
'Nique's slugs.

145
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:54,074
That shit with him needed
to be deaded.

146
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:56,119
That's why I gave up those
corners, and I'd do it again.

147
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:57,555
It was the right call.

148
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,296
- Fighting one battle at a time.
- Mm-hm.

149
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,255
Yeah, as far as these
stray niggas out here

150
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:04,084
still talking about Kanan and
his crew dropping Buck Twenty,

151
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:06,564
that's another
problem altogether.

152
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:07,826
You gonna pick up Kanan
from school

153
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,306
and bring him to the stash.

154
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,786
He gonna post up there
for a while.

155
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,093
Speaking of the stash,
it won't be long

156
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:15,095
before ConEd realizes
we stealing they power.

157
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,184
Been in that spot way too long.

158
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:19,316
I seen a few empty houses
closer to Linden.

159
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,145
Houses got us too exposed,
too out in the open.

160
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,582
We need cover, a front.

161
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,802
Early Tyler
talkin' about opening, uh,

162
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,630
an exotic fish store,

163
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:31,023
you know,
with like piranhas and shit.

164
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:32,764
We could keep our business
in the back

165
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:35,898
with the aquariums and food
or whatnot.

166
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,682
What the fuck do Early Tyler
know about fish?

167
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,120
Nigga had a barbershop
for four minutes,

168
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:41,599
and the Board of Health
shut it down because of scabies

169
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:42,861
or some nasty-ass shit.

170
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:43,949
Wait, what is you
talking about?

171
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,386
I know, but wait, okay?

172
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,083
Well, first, it was...
It was lice.

173
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,433
And it wasn't Early's fault.

174
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,218
Somebody brought their weave
in there all infested.

175
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,524
Them shits got all into
the walls and to the floors.

176
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:56,397
That bodega off Sutphin
near Shore...

177
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,964
It's owned by some Colombians,
a husband and a wife.

178
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:00,531
She stepped to me a while back.

179
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:02,968
Said they're looking
for other opportunities.

180
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,840
So she know what we do?

181
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:06,233
Well, I heard she got
a cousin in Washington Heights,

182
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,974
fuck with the Nariños.

183
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:10,802
She know hustle
when she see it.

184
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:12,413
And I think she been
checking us out for a minute.

185
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:14,415
Hmm.

186
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:16,678
And by the way,
I'm putting together

187
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,201
a little somethin'-somethin'
at Lanes tomorrow night.

188
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:20,029
Let heads know we still
out there swingin'.

189
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:21,770
Wine, women,
and song type shit.

190
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,380
A party?

191
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:25,339
He talking
about throwing a party.

192
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:28,951
To let the streets know
we still out here making moves.

193
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,170
I'm building the business,

194
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:32,259
and you throwing parties?

195
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:33,477
If that shit don't say
it all right there,

196
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,087
I don't know what does.

197
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:42,094
Both y'all can come.

198
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:44,662
Spanish Club
will meet today in Room 117.

199
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,403
The East Side Book Club
will meet Fridays

200
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,449
from 2:30 to 5:00 p.m.

201
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,828
Yo.

202
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:54,672
You all right?

203
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:57,371
Just waiting on my mom.

204
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,122
I ain't see you around
in a little bit.

205
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,042
I've been out a few days.

206
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,267
I had to watch
my little sister.

207
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:27,096
My moms...

208
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,403
Couldn't.

209
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,582
I've been out, too.

210
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:38,703
I got strep or something,
you know.

211
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,014
I'm sorry about Buck.

212
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,684
Thanks.

213
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,300
Look, I know you two
weren't really friends...

214
00:10:57,384 --> 00:11:00,042
but Buck was a good guy...

215
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,392
at least to me.

216
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,002
And I don't care
if he was with Tiffany.

217
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:05,352
I just think it's mad fucked up

218
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:06,744
to talk
about somebody who died.

219
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,967
Like I ain't got
shit else to do.

220
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,622
Like I ain't got
a life of my own.

221
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:18,147
I got to get called down here,
disrupt my whole damn day.

222
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:20,105
Patricia...

223
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,107
why don't you and Davina
come inside my office

224
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:24,153
where we can talk?

225
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:27,243
I am a single mother, Dr. West.

226
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:30,028
I'm raising
two girls on my own.

227
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:33,075
Ain't no man around to help me.

228
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,818
Let's you, Davina,
and I talk about it.

229
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,689
Come on, Patricia.

230
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,247
Davina.

231
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:52,646
And you, Kanan,
go to class, now.

232
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,491
<i>♪ Too savage

233

234
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,282
Shit, when you said
no security,

235
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:09,285
I was figuring this shit
for a hit, man.

236
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:12,636
Spent the last 30 minutes
circling this motherfucker,

237
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,205
making sure you wasn't
setting my ass up, Raq.

238
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,176
Yeah well, you won't see me
coming, 'Nique.

239
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,297
Still a lot of chatter

240
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:22,864
about who put down this kid,
Buck Twenty.

241
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:24,735
Yeah.

242
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,172
Well, ain't nobody ever died
from talk, Raq.

243
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:29,349
At least not yet.

244
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,611
Well, that's a short stop from
niggas wagging they tongues

245
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,830
to guns getting' warm.

246
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:36,791
Look, I called
all my people off, Raq.

247
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,359
Not much more I could do.

248
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:43,406
Like I said before,
Buck's folks is angry.

249
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,061
And I can't be held
accountable for civilians

250
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,672
exercising they God-given right
to hit the fuck back.

251
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:52,197
You know how this shit work.

252
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,983
You know what time it is.

253
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,028
Streets need a body.

254
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:09,606
Some shit's starting
to bubble up about Buck.

255
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,347
My sister said she heard them
talkin' about it

256
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:13,088
while she was getting
her nails done.

257
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,046
Until it gets to the
barbershop, no one listening.

258
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,787
When you do what me and D did,

259
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,310
it feels like every nigga
clocking you,

260
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,400
every nigga know.

261
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,358
Some shooters
like that feeling.

262
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:25,143
Not me. Not back then.

263
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:27,711
How you feelin'?

264
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:30,279
Livin'.

265
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:32,063
Kanan's all good because
he knows I was the one

266
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:34,022
that put that nigga down.

267
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,807
Yo, you want him?
You can have him, D.

268
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:38,548
And you ain't doin'
nobody no favor

269
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:39,810
speaking on that shit out loud.

270
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,378
All right nigga, calm down.

271
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,424
Oh, oh, there go the champ!

272
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:46,643
Weighing in at 110 pounds even,

273
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,471

Davina "Don't Get No Meana"
Harrison!

275
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:54,303
Man, the finest girl in school,

276
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:56,697
and she can throw them hands.

277
00:13:56,781 --> 00:14:00,222
Man, I'm about to be in love.

278
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,963
Yo, Buck just died
a few days ago,

279
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:03,747
and you already
pushing up on her?

280
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:04,835

287
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,086
Oh, no. No way.

288
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,175
My Grandpa Walt's
about as old as you,

289
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,177
and I know you guys
get real confused

290
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,440
if you don't find your stuff
just the way you left it.

291
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:46,181
Burke bringing jokes.

292
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,142
So, uh, we should...

293
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:53,188
talk to the-the mother, right?

294
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:56,104
See what she can tell us
about this, uh...

295
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,367
Donyell Worley.

296
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:01,239
Buck Twenty.

297
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:02,719
That's what they call him
around the way.

298
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,286
Don't nobody know
no Donyell Worley,

299
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,681
but they know Buck Twenty
for sure.

300
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:10,248
And his mom,
she don't know shit.

301
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:13,208
There's nothing for us there.

302
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,776
Well, Captain was clear
about putting this murder down.

303
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,952
Our investigation
should start with the family.

304
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:20,650
Captain don't give a fuck
about Buck or his mom.

305
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:24,001
Buck's gone. There's nothing
we could do for him now.

306
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,177
Cap just wants us to make sure
there ain't no more

307
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:29,398
Buck Twenties dying
on the Southside anytime soon.

308
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,792
We're going to the tailor.

309
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,981
Hey, move down
over there.

310
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:49,940
You the one hittin' skins
with my sister.

311
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:51,986
No, I think you got the wrong
guy, brother.

312
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,422
Raq.

313
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:56,556
Raquel Thomas,
that's my little sister.

314
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,298
My baby brother Lou-Lou told
me, uh, you all up in that.

315
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:01,735
I'm not all up
in anything, man.

316
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,085
You goddamn right
about that, nigga,

317
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:05,521
'cause I'll fuck you up.

318
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,178
I bet you won't.

319
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:24,975
Yo, man, that was real dark
skin of you back there, man.

320
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,848
Listen, I'm just
fucking with you, kid.

321
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,719
I'm just making sure
your intentions

322
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,982
with my sister
are honorable and shit.

323
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,115
Well, when it comes to your
sister,

324
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,126
you don't need to worry
about my intentions.

325
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,644
Marvin.

326
00:16:41,728 --> 00:16:42,935
Symphony.

327
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,417
Like that name, baby.

328
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:49,247
Yo, uh, where Toni at?

329
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,641
In the back.

330
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,440
Word.

331
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,753
Uh-huh, yeah, that's...
That's that good shit.

332
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:05,755
Uh, I'm... I'm straight. Thanks.

333
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,046
Suit yourself.

334
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,371
Ahh.

335
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,069
You know, tomorrow night's
short notice.

336
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:17,332
Why don't you just do it
in some club in Queens?

337
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,943
Yeah, I mean, but niggas love
these downtown vibes here.

338
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,032
It's gonna be small,

339
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:23,599
you know, just a little
get-together amongst friends.

340
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:25,166
Maybe you give us
a little corner in the spot.

341
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,689
I mean, you won't even
notice that we're here.

342
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:28,503
Won't take up no space at all.

343
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,508
Yo, you good?

344
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:38,209
I'm not sure if you're aware,
but I'm in mourning.

345
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,182
The dog, right?

346
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,401
Yeah, yo, I heard about that.

347
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:46,230
Microwave and little
nigga got radiated.

348
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,493
Yo, that's a fucked-up way
to go out.

349
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:51,148
Do you have pets, Marvin?

350
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,934
I don't believe in cleaning up
nobody's shit but my own.

351
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:56,053
You're funny.

352
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,591
Your sister's
a straight bitch, though.

353
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:03,160
You know,
for a second I thought...

354
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,772
maybe she was the one
who killed my dog.

355
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:08,209
Yo, Raq loves animals

356
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:09,993
and likes you, too.

357
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:11,778
Says you
a tough-ass white girl,

358
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,649
which is real praise
coming from her,

359
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,085
'cause Raq don't like
white girls on principle.

360
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,440
What time tomorrow night,
Marvin?

361
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,791
Um, jump off around, like,
nine, ten.

362
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,140
You have to pay my DJ.

363
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,272
Done.

364
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:31,014
But you got to save
a dance for me.

365
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,799
I'm not very good at dancing.

366
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:34,452
Ah, don't matter.

367
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,672
Yo, I'm good enough
for the both of us.

368
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,942
Im'a need you to wait in the
car.

369
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,249
Look, I didn't go through
the academy and walk a beat

370
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,078
for three fucking years to
keep this car running for you.

371
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,645
See, I figured with
your old man, his brothers

372
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,517
and their dads being cops,

373
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,518
you didn't even have
to go to the academy at all.

374
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,346
Fuck you.

375
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,306
Now you're learning.

376
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,874
Don't take shit,
not even from me.

377
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,876
But your ass still
gonna wait in the car.

378
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:27,144
Houndstooth 'bout to be hemmed!

379
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,212
You motherfuckers
must be really confused

380
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:40,344
about who I am
or who the fuck you are.

381
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:42,825
Hey, let him through, man.

382
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:45,959
He good.

383
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:49,179
You know, I would offer you
your own jacket, detective,

384
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:52,704
but this must be the only one
in the world right here, man.

385
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:55,620
The world is better for it.

386
00:19:55,704 --> 00:19:58,362
Buck Twenty,
he was one of yours.

387
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:07,241
Well, if by one of mine,

388
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,765
you mean he was a friend,

389
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:14,117
then, yeah, Buck Twenty
was one of mine, man.

390
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,801
Rest in peace to my nigga Buck.

391
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:22,952
Can't have no more bodies
dropping up here, 'Nique,

392
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,606
especially kids.

393
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,608
Need to talk
to your girl Raq, man.

394
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,051
Can we step away from the
fucking boys choir of crack?

395
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:41,666
Hold this.

396
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,612
It's still a little tight
in the chest, man.

397
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,686
Look, 'Nique...

398
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,993
you and I,

399
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:06,387
we both know one of
the worst things ever to happen

400
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:09,289
to Southside was Raquel Thomas
taking over for High Post.

401
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:16,745
There's rules.

402
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:19,276
And she either don't know them,
or she don't give a fuck.

403
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:24,579
Only one king could rule
a kingdom, 'Nique.

404
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,798
One king,

405
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:29,744
one code, one crew.

406
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,184
I'm betting on you.

407
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:42,205
Smart money, Detective.
Smart money.

408
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,861
You make sure
ain't no more bodies.

409
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:48,516
I'm gonna make sure
you sittin' on that throne.

410
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,918
Davina fucked her ass up.

411
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:02,008
Girls be crazy. Shit.

412
00:22:02,092 --> 00:22:04,097
Yo, we making moves
on this pizza or what?

413
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,228
- Let's do it.
- Hell, yeah.

414
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,578
- Got shit to do.
- Damn!

415
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:08,710
Juke and all her
top-secret plans and shit.

416
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,407
Yo, kiss my ass, Famous.

417
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:12,105
Just 'cause I got a life

418
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:13,236
outside of all you
trifling-ass motherfuckers

419
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,716
doesn't mean I got secrets.

420
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,196
It just means
I don't want to kick it

421
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,936
with you tired-ass niggas
all the time.

422
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,763
Damn.

423
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:21,462
Ease up, Juke, all right?
I didn't mean nothing.

424
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:24,944
Yo, Fame, she just going to get
some extra loot for her demo.

425
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:27,207
- Ah.
- She gonna get her Whitney on,

426
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,773
and soon we gonna be saying
we knew her when.

427
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,820
Yo, Kanan!

428
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:33,822
I'm here to take you
to your after-school job.

429
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:35,650
Since when you got a job?

430
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:37,739
Since his mama said so.

431
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,437
Word. Working man now.

432
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,091
Got to bounce.

433
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:49,751
You, um, want to ride?

434
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,145
- I'm good.
- Yo, let's do this.

435
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:53,885
I know you good, girl.

436
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,322
I'm asking, you know,
if you want to ride.

437
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,107
Dad, I'm straight.

438
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:00,196
♪ She was quick
to get with you ♪

439
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,590
♪ Daddy knocked the wind up
out you when he hit you ♪

440
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,419
Hey, man.

441
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:07,551
I hope you're ready, man.

442
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,962
- Where we going?
- Your man named employee of the month.

443
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,821
Im'a come back here and
kick that fucking cat.

444
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:18,910
Some dumb shit.

445
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:21,217
- Oh, hi, Ms. Thomas.
- What's up, Ms. Thomas?

446
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:23,524
Where y'all heading, fellas?

447
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:25,395
We're going to play some video
games, might eat some pizza.

448
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,875
It's on me.

449
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,746
- Word?
- Yeah, kid.

450
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,053
- Thanks, man.
- Thanks, Lou-Lou.

451
00:23:31,137 --> 00:23:32,446
Just make sure you put
in a good word for me

452
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,187
with your sister.

453
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:35,971
I don't even really see
too much of Jess now.

454
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:37,364
S-she be busy
with school and all that.

455
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:39,279
She live with you, right?

456
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:41,150
So when you're reaching
for the same box

457
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:43,631
of cereal in the morning,
just tell her I said what's up.

458
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,198
J-Jess don't even
like cereal like that,

459
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:47,983
'cause, you know,
dairy be messing with her.

460
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,376
I'm just asking you to tell her

461
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,986
that I said what's up.

462
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,540
I ain't ask
about her fucking GI tract.

463
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:56,687
How's your mom, Derek?

464
00:23:56,771 --> 00:24:00,082
Kind of nervous right now.

465
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,390
Uh, my brother just
got back from Upstate.

466
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:06,088
Truth is I think she liked
it better when he locked up.

467
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:07,989
At least she know
where to find him.

468
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,094
Let's do this.

469
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:15,358
Careful out there.

470
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:16,533
- We will.
- For sure.

471
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:20,972
Juliana, how you doin', mami?

472
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:22,263
Hey.

473
00:24:26,018 --> 00:24:27,892
Who are you?

474
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:31,113
How the fuck you know my wife?

475
00:24:31,197 --> 00:24:34,247
I'm Raq Thomas, and this
is my brother Lou-Lou.

476
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:35,204
We wanna talk
to you and your wife

477
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:36,858
about your business here

478
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,425
and the possibility
of working together.

479
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:39,687
My wife doesn't talk business.
I talk business.

480
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:43,212
Follow me.

481
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:16,550
Yo.

482
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,682
Where are we?

483
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,902
That's your new office, nigga.

484
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,211
I'd pay for the upgrades.

485
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,778
Reinforced door,

486
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:31,304
security cameras, all of it.

487
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:33,262
In exchange for you letting us
use your space,

488
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:34,742
we hit you off with some rent.

489
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,527
Hey, I want a percentage
of your sales.

490
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:38,789
I'm taking a great risk
letting you use

491
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:39,877
my store for this, huh?

492
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,401
I should be fairly compensated.

493
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:42,880
I don't know
why you're talking to me.

494
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:45,056
She runs shit.

495
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,146
You may be taking
a slight risk in here,

496
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,322
but we the ones risking
everything out there.

497
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:51,889
Unless you want to get your ass
out on that strip with us,

498
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:53,761
you don't get a piece of that.

499
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,116
Take it or leave it,

500
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,335
'cause we good either way.

501
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,167
I take it. Huh?

502
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:10,169
I'll take it. It's good.

503
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:18,264
From here on out,

504
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:20,135
you come here
after school every day.

505
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:21,180
Your mom said you need
to start doing your homework

506
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:22,746
while you're here.

507
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,052
Said you start
fucking up the books,

508
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,228
your Black ass
back on the bench.

509
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:28,274
Round one, fight!

510
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:32,191
What is this?
What am I doing here?

511
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:34,584
You in the nerve center, baby.

512
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:38,109
HQ, you sitting
on the stash, Black man.

513
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:40,808
You the dragon
guarding the gold.

514
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,158
Ain't that right, Scrap?

515
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:46,901
Yeah, um, dragons
on the gold, that's us.

516
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:49,077
Look, Scrappy gonna hip you
to all the rules of the game,

517
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:52,428
so listen close.

518
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,169
Yeah, I'll be by
to pick you up later.

519
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:57,041
- What...
- You the dragon.

520
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,705
We got that Polo hotness!

521
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:10,751
Tees, sweaters, jackets!

522
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:12,492
Hey, man, how you doing?

523
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:16,235
Polo, brand-new
sweaters, jackets.

524
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,933
- Twenty.
- Thirty.

525
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:21,457
Nuh uh, 20.

526
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:23,546
All right, whatever, man, 20.

527
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,769
Yo, you got to work on your
negotiation skills, Twin.

528
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:30,727
I got, like, six more of them
bum-ass sweaters in my bag.

529
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,555
So...

530
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:34,165
Hey, yo, yo, how much
for this jacket right here?

531
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,646
Two fifty.

532
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,213
That's-that's too much.

533
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:40,955
Keep it steppin', then.

534
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,697
Yo, that's that Suicide.

535
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:45,481
Last one I got.

536
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:47,266
This shit's hotter
than a pistol.

537
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,397
You know, I'm putting
my own life in my hands

538
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:49,659
just by having it out there.

539
00:27:49,743 --> 00:27:51,835
Hundred.

540
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,142
Nigga, I could sell
you this shit for, like, 350.

541
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:56,057
I was just
showing you some love

542
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,612
'cause I can respect
the... the cookie, huh?

543
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:06,589
Shit ain't bootleg, right?

544
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:07,982
Fuck out of here
with that shit, man.

545
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:10,463
We Lo-Life crew.
Come on, recognize.

546
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:13,640
From top to bottom.
We in it to win it.

547
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:16,295
Yo, go talk to them Africans
down the block.

548
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:18,544
They got that knock-off shit
you can afford.

549
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:24,259
- Huh?
- Ahh, man!

550
00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:26,522
I knew you could appreciate
this life we livin', kid.

551
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:28,176
You right.

552
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,699
All right,
break me off some change.

553
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,397
This is for you.
I will get you your change.

554
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,224
Why don't you try it on
for us, huh?

555
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:35,444
I am gonna try it on.
I'm gonna wear this out.

556
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:36,967
You better wear it out.

557
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,795
Twenty, forty...

558
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,710
Fifty for you sir.

559
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,147
Sheesh

560
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:46,281
Oh, man. Good looking out.

561
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:47,804
- Hey, appreciate it.
- Nice doing business with you.

562
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:49,066
- Real talk.
- All right.

563
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,981
- All right, y'all.
- All right.

564
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,549
It'd be easier.
Take care of that.

565
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,117
Whoo.

566
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,858
Made my money, nigga.

567
00:28:57,942 --> 00:28:59,990
Ooh, you about to get up
that studio time loot.

568
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:02,079
Yo, you know how we do.

569
00:29:02,163 --> 00:29:03,370
Holla.

570
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:09,173
How was after school?

571
00:29:09,257 --> 00:29:12,394
Boring.

572
00:29:12,478 --> 00:29:14,701
We played video games, Ma.

573
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,616
When am I gonna get
out on a corner?

574
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,604
Okay, you got to walk
before you run.

575
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:23,274
Bumped into Famous
and Derek today.

576
00:29:23,358 --> 00:29:25,102
D-Wiz?

577
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:27,322
He said his big brother's
home from prison.

578
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,920
Yeah, he got back
a couple weeks ago.

579
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,854
Derek got you the guns you used
on Buck Twenty, didn't he?

580
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:39,465
I know his brother's
a wild boy.

581
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:43,033
Figure he must have gats
stashed up in the crib.

582
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,600
I'm not trying to get
D-Wiz in trouble, Kanan.

583
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:47,821
I'm just asking.

584
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:49,388
I want to make sure
that you guys are all

585
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:50,606
checking for each other
out there, that's all.

586
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,086
You only
as good as your crew.

587
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,349
Yeah, Ma.

588
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:57,439
My crew's holding me down.

589
00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:59,253
Go get washed up
so we can eat.

590
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:14,804
What's today's mathematics?

591
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:19,374
I'm making the most
of what we got.

592
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,768
Kanan stays on the stash
until further notice.

593
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,901
I don't want him
anywhere near the street.

594
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:27,469
Got your party tonight, right?

595
00:30:27,553 --> 00:30:30,907
Oh, we about to turn
this motherfucker out.

596
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:32,692
Might be the time to get
your Reggie Jackson on.

597
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:40,860
Don't like it
any more than you.

598
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:48,534
What my shit got to do
with Reggie Jackson?

599
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:50,753
What you-what you
talking about?

600
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:51,885
Work.

601
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,865
What you looking for?

602
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:00,388
What's behind this door?

603
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:03,043
Nothing you need
to worry about.

604
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,741
Raq put me in here to learn
how all this shit work.

605
00:32:05,825 --> 00:32:08,048
You supposed to teach me
what's what.

606
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:10,616
Raq, also known as your moms,

607
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,531
put you in here to keep
your stupidness off the block.

608
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:14,489
See?

609
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:16,186
You so dumb,
you don't even get it.

610
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,058
I ain't your teacher, nigga.

611
00:32:18,142 --> 00:32:21,365
I'm your fucking babysitter.

612
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:31,811
All right, I know you like
all that Ralph Lauren shit,

613
00:32:31,895 --> 00:32:34,683
but you need to get
some downtown style.

614
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,467
I'm serious.

615
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:39,253
You can't wear sweatshirts
to the Deb Ball.

616
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:41,909
You still think I'm going
to your white-people dance?

617
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,974
Okay, so it's not
a white-people dance.

618
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:46,629
It's a white-people ball.

619
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,458
Ooh, I like that, by the way.

620
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:50,615
♪ Face to face ♪

621
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,522
No.

622
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:57,445
I can buy it for you.

623
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:00,317
Why would I need you
to buy it for me?

624
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:02,058
Oh, I just thought
you just maybe...

625
00:33:02,142 --> 00:33:04,060
You just thought maybe
a poor Black girl from Queens

626
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:07,934
needs you to buy her
a corny-ass T-shirt?

627
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:10,197
I'm not your ghetto
charity case, Nicole.

628
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:14,636

Laverne!

633
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:26,169
I'm sorry.

634
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:27,592
I just thought...

635
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,566
Fuck.

636
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,308
I don't know what I thought,

637
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:39,052
but I totally get why
it would hurt your feelings.

638
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:41,345
I'm just a dumb-ass girl
from the Upper East Side.

639
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:46,320
I mean, where I'm from,
the only way to show people

640
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:49,889
you like them is
by buying them stuff.

641
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:52,008
I...

642
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,330
By the way,
that shirt was ugly.

643
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:59,972
So I wasn't gonna buy it
for you, anyway.

644
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:04,904
You said you liked it.

645
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:08,255
Ah, I like what you like.

646
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,113
I like you.

651
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,215
You threw me in the stash
to keep me off the street.

652
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:57,043
You put me on ice.

653
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:58,988
That's exactly what I did.

654
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:04,485
But before you
all up and down me,

655
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,488
telling me how I lied to you or
how I'm not giving you a chance,

656
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,142
just know that I started
the same way, Kanan,

657
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:11,840
with Def Con, your daddy.

658
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:13,842
Def had me do the same thing.

659
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:16,366
Sitting on the stash,
watching TV all day long,

660
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,194
and it was boring as hell.

661
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:20,022
But he did it for two reasons.

662
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:22,459
First off, he did it
'cause I was pregnant with you,

663
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:25,158
and he ain't want me
out there fighting off junkies.

664
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:27,813
But he also did it to see
if I would follow orders.

665
00:35:27,897 --> 00:35:30,467
To see if I would do
exactly what he told me to do

666
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:33,022
without beefing,
without throwing up my hands.

667
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,605
Def Con was smart as hell.

668
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:39,912
That was your father.

669
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,827
And he knew that
to be a good leader,

670
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,785
you also have to know
how to follow.

671
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:47,180
You have to know
how to listen, to learn,

672
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:49,864
to accept your role,
put in that work.

673
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,015
I'm going out.
You stayin' here.

674
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,365
If you want, you can
have a friend sleep over.

675
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,541
What about D-Wiz?

676
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,804
Sure he wouldn't mind getting
out the projects for a night.

677
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:04,545
I bought a bootleg
of New Jack Citytoday.

678
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,836
You two can watch it.

679
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,463
Word, I'll hit him up.

680
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:11,073
What you all dressed up for?

681
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:13,453
I'm having a night out,
that's all.

682
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:20,691
I love you more than anything
or anyone, Squeeze.

683
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,071
You know this.

684
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,156
Yo, D!

685
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,288
Headin' to this party downtown.
Hop in.

686
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:54,769
I'm watching New Jack City
at the crib with Kanan.

687
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:56,379
Change of plans.

688
00:36:56,463 --> 00:36:58,686
Kanan gonna be there.
He ain't tell you?

689
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,340
Not at all.

690
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:02,646
Swear.

691
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:09,653

What you doing, Kanan?

722
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,643
Me and D-Wiz
gonna watch a movie.

723
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:28,080
Dude supposed
to be here by now.

724
00:38:28,164 --> 00:38:29,411
I called him, like, twice.

725
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:34,347
Is that your sister?

726
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:37,132
Yeah, Tanisha.

727
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:40,048
Only shuts her eyes
when she's out the house.

728
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:42,259
Already figured out
that she can't trust my moms.

729
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:47,621
You see they got a article
in there today about Buck.

730
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:50,193
In the section where they write
about the people who died.

731
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:54,019
Four sentences.

732
00:38:54,103 --> 00:38:56,499
That's all they got.

733
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,184
Buck's whole life
in four sentences.

734
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:02,880
Wonder how many
they'll write about me.

735
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:10,209
Hey, I've been hearing that
maybe you and your friends

736
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:11,775
had a beef with Buck?

737
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:15,170
Uh, don't listen to that,
all right?

738
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:16,461
Shit's not real.

739
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:21,394
Okay. Got to go.

740
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:24,049
I'll, uh,
I'll see you in school.

741
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:25,920
It'll be a minute.

742
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:28,051
They gave me a week
for the fight with Tiffany.

743
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:32,579
All right, well,
I'll be waiting on you, then.

744
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,193
Yo, they out here waiting.

745
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,415
Shit, Marvin.

746
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:44,156
You said it was just
a get-together amongst friends.

747
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,287
Yo, I mean,
what can I say, man?

748
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:47,159
I got a bunch of friends.

749
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:48,638
Well, your friends
are gonna have to wait

750
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,162
'cause I have
regular clientele,

751
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,990
and they are
our number-one priority.

752
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:55,950
Hi, you two. Oh my God,
Mr. and Mrs. Fabulous, come in.

753
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:58,692
- Nice coat, sweetheart.
- I know.

754
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:01,086
Yo, listen, man, all my peoples
is on the express line.

755
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,088
Y'all gonna get in real quick.
I got you.

756
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:05,903
Have I let you down?
I got you, baby, come on.

757
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:09,616
Yo, my man.

758
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,357
I heard you looking
for soldiers.

759
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,532
Where you from?

760
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:14,360
Q.B.

761
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:15,970
Down for whatever.

762
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:18,233
- Oh, good to know.
- What's up, man?

763
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:21,106
Let's get the express
up in this spot.

764
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,411
You're gonna stand here
and wait in line

765
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:24,065
like everybody else, nigga.

766
00:40:24,149 --> 00:40:26,372
Ain't no shortcuts.

767
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:27,664
What the fuck's so funny?

768
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:35,555
He Black, and we Black,
so that means something to me.

769
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,731
Just 'cause Dinkins
look like us

770
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,472
don't mean he actually give
a fuck about us, sweetheart.

771
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:40,864
Word up.

772
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:42,649
Yo, when's Kanan getting here?

773
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:46,044
Oh, uh, he on his way.

774
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:50,352
Actually, have you...
Have you met Amber yet, D?

775
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:51,658
Nice to meet you, Amber.

776
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,660
You too, baby.

777
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:54,965
You know what?

778
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:56,793
I think my boy D here

779
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,795
could learn something
from somebody

780
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:01,798
who, uh, has your specific
kind of expertise.

781
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:03,409
I could?

782
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:04,962
Oh, most definitely.

783
00:41:06,278 --> 00:41:07,525
Show him what's what, doc.

784
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:11,547
What is this, man?

785
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:15,073
Like I said, best night

from the other night?

790
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:50,064
When you rushed out
of the restaurant.

791
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:53,502
Yeah, just-just some drama
at my kid's school.

792
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:55,722
He straight.

793
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:58,377
We straight.

794
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:01,728
So I know them high-rises
got a story.

795
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:05,079
- Let's hear it.
- Huh.

796
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:07,429
First ones to build a high-rise
were the Romans.

797
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:10,084
Called them insulae.

798
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:12,652
The higher up you were,
the cheaper the rent.

799
00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:14,958
And then in 1743,

800
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:17,352
King Louis XV in France
invented the elevator.

801
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:19,267
It changed the whole game.

802
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,748
Rich people started
to buy up all the high-rises.

803
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:24,054
They felt safer up high,

804
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:26,970
away from all the poor folks
in the street.

805
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:29,321
And up here,
you can see what's coming

806
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:30,612
before it gets there.

807
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:35,892
I'm boring you with
all my school shit again.

808
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:41,028
I asked about the buildings
'cause I want to know.

809
00:42:41,112 --> 00:42:44,292
I love hearing you talk,
Symphony.

810
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:47,469
Keep going. Teach me something.

811
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,821
By the time
the public-housing boom hit

812
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:54,302
here in New York in the 1930s,

813
00:42:54,386 --> 00:42:57,610
middle class wanted to be up
in them high-rises, too.

814
00:42:57,694 --> 00:43:00,090

00:43:02,176 --> 00:43:04,182
he got it all twisted.

817
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:07,141
He took high-rises and turned
them into projects, prisons,

818
00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:09,709
where poor people pay rent.

819
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:12,320
Fucked it all up.

820
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:13,800

We start things we can't stop.
We do shit we can't undo.

00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:23,169
And the only way
we know it's over

918
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:26,085
is when it circles back...

919
00:49:26,169 --> 00:49:27,896
when it comes all
the way around on us again.

920
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:29,654
And it's then we know,

921
00:49:29,738 --> 00:49:31,917
you know shit
only really stops

922
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:33,907
when it gets back
