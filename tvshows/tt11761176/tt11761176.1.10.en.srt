<i>Previously on</i> Raising Kanan...

4
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:25,724
Little late to be asking God
for forgiveness

5
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:28,112
for all the shit you done.

6
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:30,406
I'm not asking for forgiveness
for what I've done.

7
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,445
<i>Asking for forgiveness
for what I'm about to do.</i>

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,213
Sorry about your friend.

9
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,713
Laverne, come on.

10
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:39,019
I ain't answering shit.

11
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:40,776
Maybe she could help us
trace it back to Kanan Stark.

12
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,701
I'm telling you to leave
this shit alone.

13
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:44,138
<i>I need you to pick up
that dry cleaning</i>

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,901
<i>up in Harlem
I mentioned a while back.</i>

15
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:49,585
Tell Marvin
that Toni can't be trusted.

16
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:52,306
So, what, you some kind
of girl faggot?

17
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:01,796
<i>When they come for
my baby brother like they did,</i>

18
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:03,718
<i>motherfuckers gon' hear me.</i>

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,641
Anybody down with Raq...
gotta go.

20
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:09,284
This motherfucker 'Nique
got to go right now.

21
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,766
I want all Raq's people
fucking dead.

22
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:13,969
Fucking dead!

23
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,171
Your ma told me to pull out
the best gat for you.

24
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,293
- We at war, Kanan.
- I need to talk to my son, Raq.

25
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,495
I wanna help you.

26
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,136
Just let me know
what I gotta do, Ma.

27
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,057
I'ma put the word out
on the block

28
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:23,619
that he's a cop's kid.

29
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:24,740
I never wanted
to bring you into this, Kanan.

30
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:27,383
Hit a nigga twice
where his heart beat at

31
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,624
and one
where he used to think.

32
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,626
That jacket...

33
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:31,907
that ain't yours.

34
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:37,553
What's next?

35
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,557
Revolution, nigga.

36
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,309
<i>Damn, they shootin'!</i>

37
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:44,486
Fuck!

38
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,054
<i>This shit a cash business.</i>

39
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:54,176
<i>Ain't no discounts.</i>

40
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:56,180
<i>Ain't no shorts.</i>

41
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:02,547
<i>Ain't no returns.</i>

42
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,793
<i>One way or the other...</i>

43
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,755
<i>...your ass paying full price.</i>

44
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:26,953
Yo, get the fuck in, nigga.

45
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,054
<i>Where's my Uncle Marvin?</i>

46
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:50,457
They told me to scoop you,
so that's what I'm doing.

47
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,621
Didn't ask about
nobody else's schedule.

48
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:01,989
Shit get real fast, don't it?

49
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,993
<i>Different when you look
a nigga in the eye.</i>

50
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,033
Do you know who that was?

51
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:07,955
Don't know.

52
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,637
Don't wanna know.

53
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,081
<i>That's your work, not mines.</i>

54
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,964
Got your shit back there.
Change of clothes and whatnot.

55
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,968
You need to take off
that fucking jacket.

56
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:40,149
Well, it's about time we had
a Raquel Thomas sighting.

57
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:43,515
My baby's come home...
to renew her faith.

58
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:48,518
How's that boy of yours?
I forget his name.

59
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,640
Kanan.

60
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:53,083
<i>That's right. Kanan.</i>

61
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,484
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

62
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,086
<i>Genesis ten.</i>

63
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:58,648
<i>The land of Canaan was named
after Noah's grandson.</i>

64
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:02,532
<i>That boy must be
a young man by now.</i>

65
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:03,854
He getting there.

66
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,858
None of them ever get
all the way there.

67
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:07,698
Am I right, Joyce?

68
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,020
You know you are.

69
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,671
Meet you at the front.

70
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,669
You think all that's about me?

71
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,552
What you think?

72
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:12,447
How we do?

73
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,090
Yo, I thought you was
picking me up.

74
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:19,493
Your ma got me on something
that need two eyes.

75
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:20,414
Peripheral vision and shit.

76
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,695
Fuck you, Marvin.

77
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,824
Yo, five-O don't play when
one of they own gets put down.

78
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,625
It's like that?

79
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:36,190
Yo, man, streets getting wild.

80
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,511
Gotta make these moves.

81
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:38,833
You niggas get
to where you going to,

82
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,475
<i>and stay your ass there.</i>

83
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:25,443
Damn.

84
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,244
They flooding
the giddy-up right now.

85
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,327
Fuck, man!
What the hell we gon' do, man?

86
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:32,569
I'm supposed to be with
my grandmother right now. Shit!

87
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,973
That shit ain't happening,
nigga!

88
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:39,538
<i>We need to get off
these fucking streets.</i>

89
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,711
Your moms was talking about
a plan B if it get too hot.

90
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:59,599
Shit's looking mad heated
out here right about now.

91
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,401
Sit tight.

92
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,070
Right here.

93
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:42,962
Come on, he's upstairs.

94
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:44,644
Stay with us, Detective.

95
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,566
Detective Howard,
can you hear me?

96
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:48,570
Detective Howard?

97
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:52,252
Oh, shit. That's that cop.

98
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:53,934
I'm sorry, sir.
You have to wait in here.

99
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,138
You have to go over there. Yes.
Now, go in there.

100
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,821
We gotta get to Lou-Lou.
Come on.

101
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:02,825
Oh, shit.

102
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,586
I'm sorry, sir, you're gonna
have to go this way.

103
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:06,947
- Stay with us, Detective.
- Watch your back.

104
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,469
Coming through.

105
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,473
Hang on. He's holding!

106
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,999
What he look like?

107
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,601
A young boy.

108
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:22,203
About my height, maybe taller.

109
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:25,046
Could have been shorter too.

110
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:26,888
- What was he wearing?
- Jacket.

111
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,089
One of them white joints

112
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:29,651
with the words and shit
in the back.

113
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:31,213
What did the words say?

114
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,055
Fuck I'm 'posed
to know, Officer?

115
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:34,576
Case you ain't notice,

116
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:37,139
I'm high as a motherfucking
Georgia pine right now.

117
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:40,062
Bring him in and hold him
until he starts making sense.

118
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:17,621
You shouldn't be up.

119
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,703
- Fuck happening?
- Cop got popped.

120
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:20,945
Dude who was always
fucking with us.

121
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,626
Um, Howard.

122
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,148
- Detective Howard got shot?
- <i>Yes!</i>

123
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,269
They brought him in
all bloodied

124
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,510
and stretched out
like a motherfucker,

125
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,952
looking like he about
to die and shit.

126
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:29,273
Oh, fuck.

127
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,719
What the fuck
are you doing, Lou?

128
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,960
Raq must be out
her goddamn mind.

129
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:38,763
Lou, you cannot leave.

130
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:41,606
Your lungs are all fucked up
and shit.

131
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,649
They said you'll be here
for at least another five days.

132
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,052
You ain't got shit to do
with none of this.

133
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,056
You been in the hospital.

134
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:52,257
I got to get to my sister,

135
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:54,261
understand what the fuck
going on.

136
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:57,663
- Get my shit.
- I don't...

137
00:12:57,665 --> 00:12:59,505
I don't think you should...
whoa, whoa.

138
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,347
Oh, my God.

139
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:19,205
Why are we here, man?

140
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:21,650
<i>Because your mom said so.</i>

141
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,180
Fuck.

142
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:55,083
Whole hood's on lockdown.
No way out right now.

143
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,564
We need to get you washed up
and out of sight.

144
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,406
Hang tight.

145
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:01,289
Yo, I need to get this car
scrubbed clean of your boy

146
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,331
and get my ass
off these streets.

147
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,654
- Ten minutes.
- Look.

148
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:08,737
You know I'm always down
for whatever.

149
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:12,060
But this, this is some
other, other shit.

150
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:13,302
Kanan could have tracked in

151
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:15,264
all sorts of evidence
and whatnot.

152
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,785
You don't want this
to link back to me.

153
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:19,590
We need my shit
spick-and-fucking-span.

154
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,112
All right, fuck it.

155
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,754
Go do what you gotta do,
and then I want you to go home.

156
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,235
I don't want none
of our peoples out tonight.

157
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,239
Got you.

158
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:32,762
Hey, yo, Scrap. Thanks, man.

159
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:35,124
You one of the realest niggas
out here.

160
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,207
I ain't get that
back at the stash.

161
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,211
But I do now.

162
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:43,575
Yo.

163
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:46,777
<i>Don't matter</i>
<i>who your mama is, my nigga.</i>

164
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,262
You a straight soldier
all on your own.

165
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,272
What we doing at Uncle Lou's?

166
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:03,114
Well, with everything
that happened tonight,

167
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,515
ain't nobody checking
for a crime scene

168
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,317
they already wrote off.

169
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,718
Wait, wait.

170
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,723
Where's the clothes
and the money I gave you?

171
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,164
Left it in the damn car.

172
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,368
Damn.

173
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,089
Well, you gon' wear some
of your uncle's shit, then.

174
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,414
Come on. Inside. Now.

175
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:25,137
- Ah!
- What happened to your hand?

176
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,179
I fell on the way
out of there.

177
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:30,142
It's good. I'm fine.

178
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:32,146
You do everything
I told you to do?

179
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:35,147
Broke it down,
scruffed up the barrel,

180
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:36,308
threw it in the pond.

181
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,910
And?

182
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:39,071
Hoodie on as I walked past

183
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:40,953
the security camera
at the bodega.

184
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:43,318
- So they seen the jacket.
- Yeah.

185
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,359
How many you give him?

186
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,363
Three.

187
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,605
Or two. Uh...

188
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,127
Okay, well, which one was it,
Kanan, two or three?

189
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,129
'Cause there's
a big difference.

190
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:58,732
Um, I can't remember
right now, Ma. I don't know.

191
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:00,133
I said two to the chest,
one to the head.

192
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:01,655
How you gon' forget that?

193
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:04,217
Ma, does it matter?
Two, three, he gone.

194
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,340
I put him on his back,
and he gone for good.

195
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:34,972
Excuse me.

196
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,133
- Detective Burke.
- Where's Howard?

197
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:39,454
- Slow down.
- Who the fuck are you?

198
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,136
Captain Louie Baptiste.

199
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:43,298
I just took over the 117
from Captain Peralta.

200
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,780
What the fuck happened
to Captain Peralta?

201
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:46,502
The thinking downtown
is that a heavier hand

202
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,624
is needed here
in South Jamaica.

203
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:50,628
I'm that heavy hand.

204
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:53,229
So where'd it go down?

205
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,511
Detective Howard was alone
in Baisley Park

206
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,193
when he got shot, and if
the first question you have

207
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:58,714
is, "What the fuck
was he doing there alone?"

208
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,556
then you're asking
the right question.

209
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:01,717
I'm assuming he didn't mention

210
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,359
anything to you
about any meeting.

211
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,320
No, Howard doesn't
tell me shit.

212
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:05,641
That's the fucking problem.

213
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:06,603
That's what I kept saying
to Captain Peralta,

214
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:07,924
but he wasn't listening.

215
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,125
Well, I'm here now,
and I can assure you

216
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,608
I'm all fucking ears,
Detective Burke.

217
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,331
- So who's taking blood?
- <i>No one.</i>

218
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,495
Unless you're AB negative
like Detective Howard.

219
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:21,058
It's rare.

220
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,699
And that's not all.

221
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:28,425
Howard's fucked up in ways
no one even knew.

222
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,511
He's got leukemia.

223
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:34,872
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

224
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:36,233
<i>If the brass finds out,</i>

225
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,155
<i>it puts him off the job.</i>

226
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,558
He goes down from a bullet,
whoever he leaves behind

227
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,360
gets a line of duty pension,
not a cancer pension.

228
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,601
Big difference.

229
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:45,363
Yeah, he doesn't have
anyone anyway.

230
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,006
- But he's not dead yet, right?
- Not yet.

231
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,010
So let's stop talking
about him being dead.

232
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,052
So no one saw anything?

233
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:56,695
Some junkie from the
neighborhood said he saw a kid.

234
00:17:56,697 --> 00:17:58,096
But he was so high,
at first, he thought

235
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:00,098
he was in Central Park,
not Baisley.

236
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,701
Either way, Tactical Narcotics
is circling the wagons.

237
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,223
I know those streets
better than TNT.

238
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:05,904
Let TNT do what they do.

239
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:07,826
And have 'em crack a few heads
and see what they come up with.

240
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:09,830
I can crack heads too, Captain.

241
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:12,711
Give me Detective Garcia
over there.

242
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,433
Let me run these blocks.

243
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:16,035
My partner got shot
tonight, Captain,

244
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:18,277
and you and I both know that
gets me a long fucking leash.

245
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,562
Long leashes can get tangled up
in all sorts of shit.

246
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,572
You get anything,
you call it in.

247
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,696
Garcia. Let's go.

248
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:51,554
Shit.

249
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:57,000
What the fuck, niggas? It's me.

250
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:00,722
'Bout time, nigga.

251
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,243
Shit.

252
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:04,806
It's Howard.
Got hit in the park.

253
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,288
A fucking NYPD detective?

254
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,931
Niggas done lost
they minds out here, man.

255
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,694
Southside gon' burn
like a motherfucker tonight.

256
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:15,056
<i>Any word on who pulled
that trigger?</i>

257
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:16,778
<i>Just talk right now.</i>

258
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,500
Just fucking talk.

259
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:20,182
<i>Shit's crazy.</i>

260
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:21,703
Including some about you.

261
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:24,306
Fuck out of here.
Who the fuck talking 'bout me?

262
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:25,708
All this money and work
I got on these streets,

263
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,190
and niggas think
I'm gon' shoot a cop?

264
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:29,792
Whoever talking
obviously don't know me

265
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,313
or what the fuck it is
I got going on out here, man.

266
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:32,915
<i>Don't make no sense.</i>

267
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,597
I'm trying to protect
these cops

268
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,998
more than they trying
to protect theyself.

269
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,640
I'm the last nigga
on the Southside

270
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,722
who wanna see a cop got.

271
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,726
Dead cops dead my work.

272
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,091
Which might be
the fucking point.

273
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,654
Fucking Raq.

274
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,976
You know, bitch told me
when the time came,

275
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:54,938
I wouldn't see it coming.

276
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,942
She was right.

277
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:00,224
I see her ass now, though.

278
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,306
Yo, I want anybody
who's still out

279
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:04,108
off them streets, man.

280
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,230
And I want y'all to lay low,
keep y'all heads down.

281
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:07,872
And listen,
'til y'all hear from me,

282
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,633
keep y'all doors locked

283
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:12,076
and y'all mouths
motherfucking shut, a'ight?

284
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,760
Yo, I need you
to spin the car around.

285
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:17,764
I need to get
to my peoples ASAP.

286
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:22,647
Fuck! Shit!

287
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,622
You know what to say
if anybody shows up.

288
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:38,824
I saw the man in the jacket.

289
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:40,666
And don't give up the tape
unless they ask.

290
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:42,748
Can't be overeager
or too ready to talk.

291
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,829
Make these cops work
for a minute,

292
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:46,111
feel like they doing they job.

293
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,316
Feel like they finding shit
on their own.

294
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
As soon as your Uncle Marvin
done with this other shit,

295
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:55,441
I'ma have him come get you

296
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:56,723
and take you out of town
until shit cool down.

297
00:20:56,725 --> 00:21:00,006
Huh? Ma, I handled that.
I'm good. He's gone.

298
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,367
Well, until I know
shit playing out

299
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,889
the way I want it to,
we not taking no chances.

300
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:04,893
I need you out of sight
and out of mind.

301
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,780
Grateful to you for what
you did tonight, Kanan.

302
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:15,784
It was a lot to ask,
and you ain't hesitate.

303
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:18,866
I did it for us.

304
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:20,870
You did.

305
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:23,911
Love you.

306
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,473
Love you too.

307
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,970
<i>Got something
in your pockets?</i>

308
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:43,892
You all hear things, man.
I wanna hear what you hear.

309
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:45,173
I don't know nothing!

310
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:46,294
He didn't ask
what you know, homeboy.

311
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,536
He asked what you heard.

312
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:48,657
Where's Unique at tonight?

313
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,661
Who's Unique?

314
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:56,545
Thank you.

315
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,232
Someone smelled gas on 14.

316
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:04,433
No one called me about it,

317
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:06,275
and I'd be the first to know.

318
00:22:06,277 --> 00:22:08,279
All good, then.

319
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,641
Just need you to sign here
saying that you told me

320
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:14,203
there was no problem,
in case some shit explodes

321
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:15,725
or someone dies
from inhaling the fumes.

322
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:16,886
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

323
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,688
No one said nothing
about explosions.

324
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,692
We talking 'bout gas, brother.
Gas explodes.

325
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,856
Make up your mind, man, because
I got better shit to do.

326
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,538
Want me to go up
and check or not?

327
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,900
What are you gonna do, exactly?

328
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:31,982
Go on 14, sniff around,

329
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,626
you know, uh, knock on doors
if I smell a leak.

330
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:36,707
Or not.

331
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:38,309
I mean, you sign this paper,

332
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:40,110
I can keep on stepping.

333
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:42,353
I mean, as long as no one
on 14 lights a cigarette

334
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:45,238
or sparks up they stove,
you good.

335
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Elevator's there. How long?

336
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,322
Ten minutes.

337
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:52,884
Unless I find something.

338
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:55,887
They should call me first.
I should be kept in the loop.

339
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,891
That's not on me, my brother.

340
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,030
So far,
it's just rumors right now.

341
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:57,151
Nothing solid.

342
00:23:57,153 --> 00:23:58,592
In the meantime,
we are taking down

343
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:00,194
everyone and everything.

344
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:01,956
If they're out on the block,
they're coming in.

345
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,357
Don't matter
if they from Jersey

346
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,479
and they stopped to use
the Burger King bathroom.

347
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:07,281
Their ass is being pulled
into the precinct

348
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:09,564
for questioning.

349
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,568
Give me a minute.

350
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,092
We're looking at least five
or six more hours of surgery.

351
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:19,454
It's likely we're gonna have
to remove one of his lungs,

352
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,818
his spleen,
and a decent part of his liver.

353
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,140
And the low platelet count
from the leukemia

354
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:27,623
is a further complication.

355
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,225
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Is he gonna make it?

356
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,267
I have a team of surgeons
in there

357
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:34,430
determined to answer that
question in the affirmative.

358
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:54,691
Come on, sweetheart.

359
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,217
Sweetheart,
when we go upstairs,

360
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:02,139
<i>you take a shower and you
get right in bed, okay?</i>

361
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:04,143
Worrell, ten.

362
00:25:05,144 --> 00:25:06,904
I'ma talk your dad
for just one second, all right?

363
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,265
- 'Nique?
- Hey, what's up, baby? Come on.

364
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:09,626
'Nique, sweetheart,
what is this?

365
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:10,748
Uh, just a little vacation,
baby.

366
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,709
- What is this? What's going on?
- Come on.

367
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:12,990
That's bullshit. 'Nique.

368
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:14,994
<i>'Nique!</i>

369
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:17,835
When we met,
what did I tell you, huh?

370
00:25:17,837 --> 00:25:19,557
What's the one thing
you don't ever, ever do?

371
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,038
- Huh?
- Don't ask questions.

372
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,960
A'ight, don't sweat me
right now, Pernessa, a'ight?

373
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:24,964
I need you right now, okay?
Come on. Come on.

374
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:28,566
Jerome, what's up, man?
Come on.

375
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:53,552
Come on, Marvin, where you at?

376
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,261
Look, we're just gonna throw
some shit in a bag

377
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:00,542
and be out, a'ight?

378
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:03,145
Got no time to...

379
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:05,227
no time to linger.

380
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:06,989
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

381
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:31,296
We need to talk.

382
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:33,817
Who told you
someone was out hunting cops?

383
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,581
Don't fuck with me,
Laverne, not tonight.

384
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,902
Why he going through my shit?

385
00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:40,023
<i>Don't worry about him.</i>

386
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,585
Focus on me
and this conversation.

387
00:27:41,587 --> 00:27:43,707
Look, I didn't want nothing
to happen to y'all,

388
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,469
so I told you
to watch your back.

389
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:48,432
Turns out, I was right.
You're welcome.

390
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,075
We're not friends, Laverne.
I'm a cop.

391
00:27:51,077 --> 00:27:52,676
And my partner
got shot tonight,

392
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:54,558
and somehow, someway,
you knew it was gonna happen,

393
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,562
and I need you to tell me how.

394
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:59,163
You know what happen
to snitches on the Southside.

395
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:01,366
- <i>We'll protect you.</i>
- Right.

396
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:03,530
'Cause y'all so good
at protecting us.

397
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:08,853
Look, like I said,
Unique's been beefing

398
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,815
about a re-up y'all taxed
a while back.

399
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:11,856
Yeah, you said that,
but you didn't say

400
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,378
that he was gonna shoot a cop.

401
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,981
And I'm not saying that now.

402
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:18,303
I'm just saying
what people are talking about.

403
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:20,708
You can make up your own mind
about what that means.

404
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,030
What about your aunt?
Your cousin?

405
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:26,472
<i>Their names keep coming up</i>

406
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,193
<i>in almost every fucking crime
we got on the Southside.</i>

407
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:30,236
Aunt Raq and Kanan ain't got
nothing to do with this.

408
00:28:30,238 --> 00:28:31,277
Your aunt's a drug dealer.

409
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,120
Aunt Raq sells hair.

410
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:35,401
Where are they right now?

411
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:37,483
Shit, they probably hiding out

412
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:40,366
from all you wild-ass cops
with everybody else.

413
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:42,849
It's about to be open season
on niggas for y'all.

414
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:45,652
Well, she's got clothes,
guys' clothes,

415
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:47,656
<i>and a couple hundred bucks
in cash.</i>

416
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,776
Why you got guys' clothes?

417
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:51,938
I wear whatever the fuck
I wanna wear.

418
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,380
<i>We're not worried
about her fucking wardrobe.</i>

419
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:55,582
What else is in there?

420
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:57,985
This.

421
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,067
That ain't got shit
to do with you.

422
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:02,071
Should I open it?

423
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,714
No.

424
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,718
We got what we need.

425
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:12,680
Go home, Laverne.

426
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:14,602
You're right.
It's not safe for you out here.

427
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:01,651
<i>I'm taking you
back to the hospital.</i>

428
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:03,413
Fuck that. Keep driving.

429
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,499
Yo, do y'all hear this?

430
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:11,661
Y'all fucking hear this, right?

431
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:14,024
Hell yeah, I do.

432
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,226
Yo, they playing
my fucking song!

433
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:17,668
They playing our shit, Lou.

434
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,230
Nah, this is crazy!

435
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:22,713
Yo, they playing my shit,
y'all!

436
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:25,115
They must have copped a tape
or something.

437
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:27,078
Lou, they're playing our shit.

438
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,601
- Yo!
- Yeah, it is.

439
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,089
Get me to Baisley.

440
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:41,855
What's up, y'all?

441
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,610
- We good?
- Yeah.

442
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:19,132
This is everything
from the spot?

443
00:31:19,134 --> 00:31:21,136
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

444
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:23,416
Police getting stupid
out there.

445
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:25,659
Which is why
we moving it tonight.

446
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:27,663
<i>'Bout to toss the fuck
out of that bodega.</i>

447
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:30,504
We needed our shit gone.

448
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:33,347
<i>Five-O about to be tossing up
these projects tonight too.</i>

449
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,670
When they show up,
we gotta do this okey-doke.

450
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:38,632
Sure you wanna be here
for that?

451
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:40,274
Well, gotta make sure
our shit move right.

452
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:42,278
It's about to be the first
night of the rest of our lives.

453
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,480
- That dinner?
- Yeah.

454
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,592
Relax, nigga. It's me.

455
00:32:16,594 --> 00:32:19,835
Nigga, I almost... man.

456
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,760
Look. Yo.

457
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:32,650
I'ma stay with him 'til he out.

458
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:37,013
Your mom sent me

459
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:39,017
with some cash
and some clothes.

460
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:50,549
You know what I did?

461
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:54,874
How you feeling?

462
00:32:55,795 --> 00:32:57,595
I had to do it.

463
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:59,599
Dude was coming after me
and my family.

464
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,680
He had to go.

465
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:03,641
You know that's how we do.

466
00:33:03,643 --> 00:33:05,122
Shut the fuck up

467
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:08,646
with all that
tough-guy bullshit, Kanan.

468
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:11,129
<i>I know you
better than anybody.</i>

469
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:18,456
You shook, nigga.
I can see it all over you.

470
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,460
And you should be shook,
by the way.

471
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:24,222
You just a dumbass boy.

472
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,425
<i>I mean, everything you touch,
you fuck up.</i>

473
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:28,146
Dude, what?

474
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:31,390
But that's
how it's supposed to be.

475
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,952
Look, you supposed to fuck up.

476
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:36,996
See, you supposed to fuck up,
dust your shit off,

477
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,240
and-and-and-and keep being
a dumbass kid.

478
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:43,482
Nobody's supposed to get hurt.

479
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:45,645
But that's not
how it works for us.

480
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:47,406
We playing in this
grown folks' world.

481
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:51,050
We can't just wipe our fuckups
off us like that.

482
00:33:51,052 --> 00:33:54,414
We doing shit that's gonna
stay with us forever.

483
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,936
<i>Look, we deciding who we gon'</i>
<i>be for the rest of our lives</i>

484
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,941
without even knowing
who the fuck we are now.

485
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,424
I know who I am, Juke.

486
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,827
You don't, nigga.

487
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:09,069
You have no idea
who the fuck you are.

488
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:11,073
<i>And you think you do.</i>

489
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:14,116
And that's what makes shit
so scary.

490
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:41,503
You two go home.

491
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:43,105
Hey, what about you?

492
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:45,189
I'll be a'ight.

493
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:51,674
Where's Raq?

494
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,678
Eight.

495
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,293
Yo, what the hell, man?

496
00:35:48,295 --> 00:35:50,297
<i>Dude!</i>

License and registration.

498
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,425

License.

500
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:11,359
Check him out.

501
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:17,325
Where you been tonight,
Mr. Thomas?

502
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,806
Uh, visiting a friend uptown.

503
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:22,088
Been there all night?

504
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,890
Why does it matter,
uh, where I been?

505
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,894
Sit tight.

506
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,380
Hands where I can see 'em.

507
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:35,061
Yo, man, I ain't-I ain't-
I ain't done shit.

508
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:36,423
Step out of the car.

509
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:37,744
I don't know
what the fuck this is,

510
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,226
but y'all got the wrong dude.

511
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:40,787
<i>You got
a brand-new fucking warrant</i>

512
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:42,870
<i>for felony drug possession
with intent to distribute.</i>

513
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:44,912
- The fuck I do!
- Get the fuck out!

514
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:46,433
Relax. Relax, man.

515
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,355
Don't need to be pointing
no guns.

516
00:36:48,357 --> 00:36:50,237
You don't tell me what to do,
motherfucker!

517
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,999
I'm sure it's just
a big misunderstanding.

518
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,721
Let's not lose
our fucking heads, all right?

519
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,723
Only one here who's gonna
lose their fucking head is you!

520
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,485
Get the fuck out!

521
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:59,887
I'm-I'm-I'ma-I'ma-I'ma step
out the car

522
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,729
r-r-real-real slow and shit.

523
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:04,252
We'll see about that.
Get the fuck out.

524
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:11,900
Oh, sh...

525
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:29,158
Here we go.

526
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,719
<i>Raise our peoples
down on seven.</i>

527
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:32,201
Soon as the cops
done with them,

528
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:33,883
they gonna give us a heads-up,
and we gon' hit this drop

529
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,685
with everything we got
up in here.

530
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:39,050
Have you lost your damn mind?

531
00:37:41,453 --> 00:37:43,493
Let me talk to my brother alone
for a minute.

532
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,415
It's gon' take them some time
before they get up to seven,

533
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,696
but as soon as you get
that page,

534
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,700
you get in here,
and you start loading.

535
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:00,230
Howard. For real, Raq?

536
00:38:00,232 --> 00:38:01,712
When you get out the hospital?

537
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,834
Are you fucking crazy, Raq?

538
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,636
You know
what you started out here?

539
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:08,118
Hmm?

540
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,680
Was it Marvin?

541
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:11,682
- Does it matter?
- It do.

542
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:12,843
Especially when
they round us up

543
00:38:12,845 --> 00:38:14,805
and start lying to us,

544
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:16,247
trying to get us
to flip on each other.

545
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:18,251
Yeah, I think
this shit fucking matters.

546
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:24,778
Kanan.

547
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,341
No.

548
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,345
Oh, no.

549
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:36,949
I don't even know
what to say to you right now.

550
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:38,510
Well, then don't say nothing,

551
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:39,912
'cause I don't need
to hear it right now.

552
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:41,193
<i>Yeah, you do.</i>

553
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,756
<i>You need to fucking hear it.</i>

554
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:46,999
You had your only son
shoot a fucking cop.

555
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,280
It had to be done.

556
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:49,762
They not gon' stop
'til they find him.

557
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:51,003
Look, he's safe.

558
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:52,605
Marvin's gon' take him
out of town,

559
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,607
soon as he answers
my fucking page.

560
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:56,048
What the fuck
are you doing, Raq?

561
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,053
I'm winning.

562
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:00,815
Win...

563
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,581
Well, I'm through
with this shit.

564
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:10,303
I'm out the mix.

565
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:12,307
I'm out the business.

566
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:15,349
<i>I can't do this shit no more.</i>

567
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:16,830
<i>I should have been done</i>

568
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:19,553
when you had me
put down young boy.

569
00:39:19,555 --> 00:39:21,515
Oh, yeah.

570
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:23,717
Yeah, but I stayed in it

571
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:26,120
<i>'cause I thought
we was in it together.</i>

572
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:28,124
<i>'Cause I love you.</i>

573
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:32,246
But this is bigger than me.
It's bigger than us.

574
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:34,809
I can't do this shit no more.
I'm not doing it. I'm done.

575
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,451
Nah, ain't nobody
ever done, nigga.

576
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:39,015
You in, you always in.

577
00:39:41,137 --> 00:39:44,379
- You threatening me?
- I'd never threaten you.

578
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:47,742
Just like I ain't never gon'
let you walk away.

579
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:49,825
We a team, Lou.

580
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:53,669
In fact,
we way more than a team.

581
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:56,231
We family.

582
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:58,954
We share everything
and everyone.

583
00:39:58,956 --> 00:40:01,397
Nothing that's mine
ain't yours.

584
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,599
And it works the other way too.

585
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,801
Your shit is my shit.

586
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,364
For example,
your recording studio,

587
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,006
yeah, that's my
recording studio.

588
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,288
It's a record label.

589
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,292
It ain't a studio.

590
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,654
And it's clean,
and it's gon' stay that way.

591
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:19,055
<i>Clean, right.</i>

592
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:21,658
Where you get the money
to pay for it, Lou?

593
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,900
<i>Nothing we touch
is clean, nigga.</i>

594
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:26,503
Just the fact your hands on it
make it dirty.

595
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,585
You can't scrub out what we do.

596
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:30,387
It stain everything.

597
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,310
And them stains, they don't
come out in the wash.

598
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:35,752
<i>We can walk away.</i>

599
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:39,078
Make legit bread. Both of us.

600
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:43,681
<i>We got enough we could buy up
whole blocks in the hood</i>

601
00:40:43,683 --> 00:40:45,603
and turn them into whatever
the fuck we want.

602
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:46,964
Me and you.

603
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:49,126
Look, we don't have
enough yet, Lou.

604
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:50,608
But we will.

605
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,654
You gonna offer up
your only son for it?

606
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:59,177
Ain't nobody
offering up nothing.

607
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:01,019
This shit is an investment.

608
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:05,463
In Kanan, in you, in Marvin,
in all of our future.

609
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,305
<i>I'm doing this for y'all.</i>

610
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:10,709
But y'all don't see it,
'cause you don't want to.

611
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:12,471
Everybody,
they want the reward,

612
00:41:12,473 --> 00:41:14,673
but don't nobody
wanna take on the risk.

613
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:16,115
So I take it.

614
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:18,717
I take it, I flip it,
and I turn the shit out.

615
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:29,689
I'm about to be
the last bitch standing

616
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:31,693
up in this motherfucker.

617
00:41:41,703 --> 00:41:44,384
- <i>No?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>

618
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:49,111
It's clean.

619
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:55,916
Keep moving, then.

620
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:57,358
<i>Door-to-fucking-door.
No one leaves.</i>

621
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,400
No one gets past us.

622
00:42:05,888 --> 00:42:07,891
Send the page upstairs.

623
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,258
You done rung a bell
you can't unring, Raq.

624
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,060
I ain't trying
to unring nothing.

625
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:21,264
In fact, I'm trying to get
our shit to ring the fuck out.

626
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:27,069
Just got the page.
They on their way up.

627
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:28,510
All right, move it.
All of it. Right now.

628
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:56,659
Look, yo, I know you got
your shit with Marvin,

629
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:59,422
but my mother don't want
nothing to happen to us.

630
00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:03,268
A'ight, we good.
She got us. You know this.

631
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:08,151
She just had you hit a cop.

632
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:46,712
We need to know
what you saw or heard tonight.

633
00:43:46,714 --> 00:43:48,073
Shh.

634
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:50,395
A cop got shot. Talk to me.

635
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:56,081
People don't like it
when you talk to the police.

636
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,883
Police don't like it
when people don't talk.

637
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,286
<i>So take your pick: us or them?</i>

638
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:03,329
What's this door back here
with all the locks on it?

639
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:09,057
Has that camera
been on all night?

640
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:14,543
You saw something, didn't you?

641
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:19,027
- I don't want any trouble.
- What'd you see?

642
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:23,750
I'll arrest you for obstruction
right fucking now.

643
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,882
It was that man.

644
00:44:34,163 --> 00:44:35,282
The one with the jacket.

645
00:44:35,284 --> 00:44:37,286
What jacket?

646
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:39,727
The one he wears all the time,

647
00:44:39,729 --> 00:44:43,010
with his name on its back.

648
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,412
Unique.

649
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:46,134
Seems like he's a fucking
recurring theme tonight.

650
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:48,138
Was he running from the park?

651
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,981
And you got him on camera.

652
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:52,781
Gimme that tape.

653
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:54,102
Let's put it out
on the Finest system...

654
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:56,106
Kadeem Mathis,
street name Unique.

655
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,387
We're gonna need to take
an official statement from you.

656
00:44:59,389 --> 00:45:01,109
And when we come back,
we're gonna search the spot,

657
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:02,951
so make sure we don't find
anyone running numbers

658
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:04,955
or a card game
in the back there.

659
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,684
<i>We got nothing here, boss.</i>

660
00:45:15,686 --> 00:45:18,768
Ah, yeah, it's gon' be
about another 20 minutes.

661
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,330
Corn bread's worth
the wait, fellas.

662
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:23,292
Ain't that right, Lou?

663
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:28,340
Whatever you say, sis.

664
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:31,301
Little late to be eating.

665
00:45:31,303 --> 00:45:33,103
Well, it's a little late
to be kicking down doors.

666
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,948
Besides, my guys,
they always hungry.

667
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,949
I was told you just moved in?

668
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:40,350
Recently, yeah.

669
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:42,354
What the fuck's up with him?

670
00:45:44,396 --> 00:45:46,957
Car accident.

671
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:48,961
Lucky he's still here with us.

672
00:45:53,526 --> 00:45:55,406
Yeah, all right.

673
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:56,847
You stay indoors.

674
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:59,010
It's not gonna be safe
out there.

675
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:01,014
Thank you for the warning,
Officer.

676
00:46:02,055 --> 00:46:04,057
Yeah, fuck it. Let's go.

677
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:15,507
Hey, take it easy.

678
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,511
Slow down, Juliana.

679
00:46:18,432 --> 00:46:20,434
<i>Well, he was supposed
to be there by now.</i>

680
00:46:22,877 --> 00:46:25,079
I'll... I'ma call you back
in a minute.

681
00:46:28,082 --> 00:46:30,042
Shit ain't going to plan, huh?

682
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:32,565
Got it handled.

683
00:46:32,567 --> 00:46:34,569
Just getting Kanan out of town.

684
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:40,173
If you got it handled,

685
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:42,455
why Kanan need to go
out of town?

686
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,236
Yo, my lawyer's gonna have
all your asses.

687
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:03,917
Our confidential informant
says otherwise.

688
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:07,481
Yo, who telling? Who you got?

689
00:47:07,483 --> 00:47:08,883
They don't call it
confidential informants

690
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:10,084
for nothing.

691
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,328
Hmm.

692
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,332
Someone's trying to really get
in contact with you.

693
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:19,616
Looks important.

694
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:22,659
Yo, fuck you, Five-O.

695
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,548
This nigga could fuck up
a free lunch.

696
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:38,273
Answer my fucking page, Marvin.

697
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,101
I know you don't wanna hear
from me.

698
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:07,746
But I wouldn't reach out
if I had anywhere else to turn.

699
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:14,471
'Nessa, come on.

700
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:16,313
Okay, come on.
Get the ones that you want.

701
00:48:16,315 --> 00:48:17,474
You can't bring all of them,
okay?

702
00:48:17,476 --> 00:48:18,635
Come on. Hurry up.

703
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:27,727
The fuck?

704
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:30,570
Tricky-ass bitch.

705
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:41,101
What?

706
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,189
Don't move! Don't move!

707
00:48:51,191 --> 00:48:53,912
LAPD! Get on the ground!

708
00:48:53,914 --> 00:48:54,953
- Move!
- Stay the fuck down!

709
00:48:54,955 --> 00:48:56,475
I'm down. I'm down.

710
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:57,716
<i>Search the rest
of the apartment.</i>

711
00:48:57,718 --> 00:48:58,797
- <i>Get off of him!</i>
- Stay back!

712
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:00,319
Stop! Leave him alone!

713
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:01,640
<i>Pernessa,
don't move, all right?</i>

714
00:49:01,642 --> 00:49:03,282
- 'Rome, stay where you at.
- That looks like blood.

715
00:49:03,284 --> 00:49:04,403
Sure as hell does.

716
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:05,804
You know, killing a cop,

717
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:07,526
it's a capital offense.

718
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,649
<i>We are gonna set you on fire
for this one, homeboy.</i>

719
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:11,050
Man, I ain't do it.

720
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:12,692
I got ten motherfuckers
who can vouch for me, a'ight?

721
00:49:12,694 --> 00:49:14,133
Shut the fuck up!

722
00:49:20,822 --> 00:49:21,901
<i>Open it.</i>

723
00:49:34,276 --> 00:49:36,278
She sent me.

724
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,401
Come on.

725
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,613
It's clear.

726
00:49:53,696 --> 00:49:55,576
Come on.

727
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,543
Oh, shit.

728
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:09,513
Hey, man.

729
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,597
I love you.

730
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,481
Love you too, Juke.

731
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,485
Hey. Get in.

732
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:23,846
Go on.

733
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:08,573
That's who you got?

734
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:10,615
Toni your big CI?

735
00:51:10,617 --> 00:51:13,017
Yo, Toni let you hit that ass
all night for an eight-ball.

736
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:14,859
Maybe less if you a brother.

737
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,901
<i>You're a fucking pig, Marvin!</i>

738
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:18,583
Fucking pig!

739
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:41,487
She's gonna die
or go to prison,

740
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:43,491
and you're gonna be
right there with her.

741
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:47,295
You got the label.

742
00:51:48,536 --> 00:51:50,538
<i>It's all yours.</i>

743
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:53,620
It's all you need.

744
00:51:53,622 --> 00:51:55,622
So just go.

745
00:51:55,624 --> 00:51:58,385
Bounce on this drug shit.

746
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:00,787
<i>You don't need it.</i>

747
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:02,791
<i>Be done with your sister
and all of that.</i>

748
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:07,314
Just like I told you
when I first met you,

749
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:09,196
you're better than that.

750
00:52:09,198 --> 00:52:10,597
You're smarter than her,

751
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,601
and you're bigger
than her, Lou.

752
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:18,087
Shut the fuck up
and drive, Jess.

753
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,690
<i>I spent
all this time telling y'all</i>

754
00:53:00,692 --> 00:53:03,454
<i>the rules to this shit,
the ways to the game.</i>

755
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:06,898
<i>How it works.
How it don't work.</i>

756
00:53:09,581 --> 00:53:12,782
<i>The truth is, though,
when the shit goes down,</i>

757
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:14,786
<i>ain't no rules.</i>

758
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:55,827
<i>End of the day,</i>

759
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:57,789
<i>it's every nigga for himself.</i>

760
00:53:57,791 --> 00:54:00,592
Um, I just saw his jacket.

761
00:54:00,594 --> 00:54:03,155
That is all.
I-I-I didn't see his face.

762
00:55:04,941 --> 00:55:06,701
Holy shit, you're alive!

763
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,383
Captain! Captain!

764
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:10,707
D-don't move.
Don't-don't do anything at all.

765
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:14,829
What happened? Do you remember?

766
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:17,552
Can you talk? Talk to me.

767
00:55:17,554 --> 00:55:19,715
Malcolm? Can you talk to me?

768
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,516
Talk to me, okay?
Who did this to you?

769
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,520
Who shot you?

770
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,402
Malcolm, who shot you?

771
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:52,789
<i>When it all goes wrong,</i>

772
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,793
<i>ain't nobody checkin'
for you but you.</i>

773
00:55:55,914 --> 00:55:57,754
<i>You on your own.</i>

774
00:55:57,756 --> 00:55:59,916
<i>See, in this shit,</i>

775
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:01,678
<i>the only thing
that you can trust</i>

776
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,682
<i>is that you can't trust.</i>

777
00:56:05,604 --> 00:56:08,087
<i>Not nobody. Not ever.</i>

778
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:11,168
