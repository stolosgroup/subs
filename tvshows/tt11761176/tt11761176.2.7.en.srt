I got a CI bellyaching
in interrogation two

5
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:32,432
that I gotta go deal with.

6
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:34,132
- You got a snitch.
- Scrap?

00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:36,066
- He working with us.
- Bullshit.

What happened that night,

10
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:44,027
the night you had me
take Kanan out of state?

11
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:45,990
What happened that night
is, I was protecting my son.

12
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:47,274
He came to my store.

13
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:48,972
He comes and he goes
as he pleases.

Just business.

You may wanna keep it down.

17
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:57,239
You and, uh, your sister

00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,072
Get the fuck outta here,
Freddy.

23
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:05,812
- Grab that bag.
- Hey! Hey!

24
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:07,642

Marvin, what are your triggers?

35
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,362

Joe, she's a murderer!

46

47

them waves all over?

and the shit spreads.

90
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:45,045
You start all them waves,

91
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,615

more than you know at first.

96
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:08,325
But you gonna find out.

97
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,029
That's for damn sure.

98
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,000
Nicole would've hated it here.

99
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,665
She had bad hay fever.

100
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,315
The pollen from the trees
and the grass

101
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,405
would've made her miserable.

102
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:37,025
She was a city girl.

103
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:38,689
Don't worry. Linda's not here.
Uh...

104
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:43,115
...we're divorcing, actually.

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,245
If I'm honest with myself,

106
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,595
it was probably going to happen

107
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,379
when Nicole went off
to college.

108
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,819
Linda and I see the world
very differently.

109
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,479
Nicole's death...

110
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,779
...just hastened
the inevitable, I guess.

111
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,059
I miss her so much.

112
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:13,839
Me too.

113
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,509
You know, Laverne, uh...

114
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,555
...I'm glad that...

115
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,559
she knew what it felt like
to be in love.

116
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:36,555
I'm glad that you
were in her life.

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,995
Mr. Bingham, I think
there's something that...

118
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,475
No, there's nothing else
that I need to know.

119
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,215
There's nothing else
I wanna know.

120
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,739
You made...

121
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,229
...my daughter happy.

122
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,689
That's all any parent
wants for their child.

123
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,809
Oh, thank you.

124
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,115
Nicole cared about you,

125
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,429
so I care about you.

126
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,205
If there is ever anything
that you need, Laverne,

127
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:20,689
anything at all...

128
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,345
...y-you know where to find me.

129
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,095
I'll let you two
spend some time alone.

130
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,275
You don't have to go.

131
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,365
Oh, I'm-I'm here
almost every day.

132
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,889
I'm sure she, uh,
wants a break from me.

133
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,855
Hey, by the way, whatever
happened, uh, to that tape

134
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,425
of-of you and Nicole
singing together?

135
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:58,115
I have turned her room
upside down,

136
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,499
and I can't seem to find it.

137
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,775
I don't know
what happened to it.

138
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,825
Oh.

139
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,569
Linda probably threw it away.

140
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,305
Be well, Laverne.

141
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,675
While the rest of the crew

142
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,115
continue to tear it up
on their own,

143
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,775
Ralph got a few things
to say himself.

144
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:46,475
And tee on that sensitive tip
with this one.

145

Do I look like
that nigga's keeper?

158
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,895
Who the fuck are you?

159
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,119
Bumboclaat, boy.
We have some business with him.

160
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,469
Crown business ain't my...

161
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,255
Ain't my business.

162
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,435
You now just say
you share this place with him,

163
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,395
so his business
are your business.

164
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,265
And if we don't see him soon,

165
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,135
your business
become our business.

166
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,485
Oh, it don't work like that.

167
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:45,095
Boy...

168
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,665
we represent Linton Manley.

169
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:53,055
Yeah, your bredren Crown
borrow 50,000 from him,

170
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,369
and he put this place up
as collateral.

171
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,065
So if we don't get
our paper soon,

172
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,715
it's Linton Manley's studio.

173
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:20,919
You need to finish.

174
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,485
Fine. Fuck you then, Lou.

175
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,445
Fucking Crown.

176
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,499
Shit.

177
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,115
Sh... oh, sh...

178
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,379
Sh...

179
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,119
There you go.

180
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:46,605
Pizza good as hell, right?

181
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,695
Fuck the pizza.

182
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,565
You said you had business.

183
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:53,575
Food brings different cultures
together, Capone.

184
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:54,785
I- I'm tryin' to build
these bridges

185
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:56,055
over some cheese and sauce.

186
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,315
This fuckin' guy.

187
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,359
You got work or not?

188
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,805
Got a rat problem
by where you rest at.

189
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,285
Now, I'd handle it myself,

190
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,025
but my Black ass
show up out there,

191
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,805
alarms start ringin'.

192
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,639
People start runnin'.

193
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,855
Whereas a pasty-faced
motherfucker like yourself

194
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,339
fit right the fuck in.

195
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,129
How much?

196
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,169
Five.

197
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:32,049
All right, listen.

198
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,825
If I do this,
it's outside my family.

199
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:37,849
All right? My father
doesn't know about this.

200
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,529
That's on you, brother.

201
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,539
All right.

202
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,979
I'll think about it.

203
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:51,455
But don't call me again.

204
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,109
I'll find you.

205
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:55,765
Noticed you killed that slice,
by the way.

206
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,509
I told you, we bondin'
over this mozzarella.

207
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,515
Caviar is like money.

208
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,035
- Hmm.
- You grow into it.

209
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,555
At first, you don't get it.

210
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,295
You don't know
the right way to enjoy it.

211
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,255
But as soon as you figure
that thing out,

212
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,259
can't get enough of it.

213
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,005
Well, when it comes to money,
I'm all the way grown.

214
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:20,485
But I don't know if I'm grown
enough for this shit.

215
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:21,965
Mm-mm.

216
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,005
You can do way better
than this old man, girl.

217
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,745
Oh, Boris,
when you start letting the help

218
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,315
mingle with the diners?

219
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,495
Traymont Stinson,
Fort Washington St in sons.

220
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,055
You two know each other?

221
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:33,535
Associates.

222
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,105
Traymont, you trackin' me?

223
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,585
'Cause according
to my calendar,

224
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:37,895
we ain't supposed to meet
till later on.

225
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:39,715
- Well, you know this my spot.
- Psh!

226
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,855
Traymont was used to bustin' up
crabs with a damn hammer

227
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,025
down in Baltimore when we first
started workin' together.

228
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:47,595
I civilized
this cretin motherfucker.

229
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,075
Nigga, I been on this shit
since way before you, Cartier.

230
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,685
Shit!

231
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,735
Hell, I turned you on to it.

232
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,645
We at the Hilton later?

233
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,435
Pierre. Got a suite.

234
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,345
- Abraham with you?
- You know damn well

235
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,435
Abraham only fuck
with the Holiday Inn.

236
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,825
That fool cheap.

237
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:03,225
Caviar at the Russian Tea Room?

238
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:05,355
Suite at The Pierre?

239
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,259
Seems to me I'm makin' you
too much money.

240
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,969
I make my own money, Cartier.

241
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,449
You keep tellin' yourself that.

242
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,325
Now, get the fuck
out of my face

243
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:20,589
so I can enjoy my motherfuckin'
beluga and Stoli, nigga.

244
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:25,459
Pleasure.

245
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:33,555
Traymont sits over my distro
in Maryland and D.C.

246
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,779
I own that motherfucker.

247
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,259
Yeah, I don't think
he agree with that.

248
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,259
Without me...

249
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:46,305
...he ain't got shit to sell
but his mama.

250
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,875
Ain't you
the one who said

251
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,265
insubordination
leads to insurrection?

252
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:52,835
Or is that
just some shit you talk?

Leviticus 18 gives us
a whole list of rules

297
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,855
for our bedroom activities.

298
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:20,469
And these are not suggestions,
my brothers and sisters.

299
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:25,335
These are orders, mandates,

300
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,815
commandments.

301
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,905
When Leviticus 18 says,

302
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,605
"Do not have sexual relations
with a man

303
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,775
as one does with a woman;

304
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:36,345
That is detestable,"

305
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,135
that is God telling us

306
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:40,355
that these so-called
alternative lifestyles

307
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:43,005
we keep hearing about

308
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,225
are nothing more
than wickedness,

309
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,495
nothing more than plain,
old-fashioned

310
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,105
hellacious sin.

311
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,845
And there's nothing
alternative about that.

312
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,649
Yo, get the fuck out the way.

313
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,305
Yo, y'all got these niggas
out here loiterin'?

314
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:19,829
Yo, we not selling right now.

315
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,089
Where they at?

316
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,365
Yo, you got a line of customers

317
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:37,019

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,845
We just sent
a bag out two hours ago.

320
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,375
- The fuck you doin' Lou?
- I'm runnin' shit.

321
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:47,895
Hey man, gimme that.

322
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,245
How much you takin'?

323
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,555
Yo, man, this shit
need to be added the fuck up.

324
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,295
You can't take the money
till it's been counted.

325
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:56,159
Look, I got it all
in my head, all right?

326
00:17:58,299 --> 00:17:59,995
Yo, Marv,

327
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,865
with this nigga Worrell
out of Newark now,

328
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,565
we tryin' to get
these books right.

329
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,175
And just pullin' out cash
uncounted like that,

330
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,915
it's gonna fuck us up.

331
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,495
So, uh, whatever you do,

332
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:23,935
don't marry
your husband's brother.

333
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,935
And don't mess with
your wife's sister neither.

334
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:27,895
Why? You got a sister?

335
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:30,675
You a clown.

336
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,285
So when you gonna give me
those digits?

337
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:33,465
Hadn't thought about it.

338
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,075
I have.

339
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,335
Let me take you to a movie,
just kick it.

340
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:40,035
I'll share some popcorn
with you, a soda,

341
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,295
some Milk Duds, maybe.

342
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:43,999
We not sharin' a soda.

343
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:46,735
We not like that.

344
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,695
Well, not yet, we not.

345
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:49,959
We gonna get there, girl.

346
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,749
Just let me get
that number, Laverne.

347
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,935
We can come back
and just let the committee

348
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,899
take care of everything else
that we need.

349
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,379
Okay.

350
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:20,119
Go on.

351
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:36,705
Hey yo, Garcia,
what's up with that?

352
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,185
Her kid killed himself.

353
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,275
But she's not buyin' it.

354
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,275
She's been coming
to the precinct every week

355
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,975
and leanin' hard on Peng
to open an investigation.

356
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,405
Peng?

357
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,625
Peng wasn't
on the kid's suicide.

358
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:50,495
She's Peng's CI.

359
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:52,719
She's been workin' with him
for almost a year now.

360
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,545
- I thought the kid was the CI.
- Nah.

361
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,245
She's got some, uh, card game

362
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,985
that has her hearin'
all the neighborhood 411.

363
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,635
Peng has us look the other way
on the game,

364
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,295
and she gives him
what she hears.

365
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,285
Raq here?

366
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,159
No.

367
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:42,159
How you been?

368
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,855
Fine.

369
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,119
Word.

370
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,049
That's good, you know.
That's-that's real good.

371
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:56,319
I guess just let your aunt know
I was looking for her, then.

372
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:13,365
Um...

373
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,469
yo, when was you gonna
tell me about your moms?

374
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,069
I wasn't.

375
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,205
- Who told you?
- Don't matter.

376
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:28,689
What matter is, she left.

377
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,389
Left the both of us
and kept goin'.

378
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,125
Kenya ain't your mother.

379
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:39,385
She just some broad
that dropped a baby and ran.

380
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:41,475
And you think you did
any better than that?

381
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,919
I think I fucked up plenty.

382
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,305
But I was here.

383
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,709
I was here
and never stopped tryin'.

384
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:52,015
Look, I'm tryin'
to get into this soup, man.

385
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:54,885
She wasn't there
for you before.

386
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:56,585
She ain't gonna be here
for you now.

387
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,029
Kenya is on her own shit.

388
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,675
Always has been.

389
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,229
Traymont.

390
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,925
Mm, you're lookin'
a little worse for wear

391
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,715
since I saw you earlier.

392
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,819
Yeah, fucked myself up
getting' out the shower.

393
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,715
With all Cartier
pullin' from your share,

394
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,505
you takin' a bath.

395
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:52,545
So I ain't gonna mince no words
or waste your time.

396
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:54,375
I can offer you more work
for less cash and headache

397
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,595
than you got with Cartier.

398
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,739
And I know that headache
is real right now, bro.

399
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,425
Who the fuck are you exactly?

400
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:03,605
I mean, we just met
three hours ago

401
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,475
on some caviar and vodka,

402
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,565
and now you tryin' to be
my business partner?

403
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:10,215
I can offer you better product
at a better price.

404
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:12,395
That's all you need to know
about me right now.

405
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:14,315
Look, I'm a businessman, girl.

406
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:15,939
And I only fuck
with people I know.

407
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,139
I don't know you.

408
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,839
You got some big balls, though.

409
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,145
Hell of a risk,
steppin' to me like this.

410
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:26,325
How you know I won't just
dime you out to Cartier?

411
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:29,069
Well, you don't know me,
but I know you.

412
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:32,519
And I know you don't wanna fuck
with Cartier Fareed no more.

413
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,945
See, I'm here
because I add value.

414
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:38,205
And in this game,
that's all that matters.

415
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,465
So if you a businessman
like you say you are,

416
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,089
I'ma be hearing
from you real soon.

417
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,345
- Gerardi's don't miss.
- This is some good pizza.

418
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,265
Now, tell me about them grades.

419
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,535
Had to shut me up there.

420
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:01,799
All right, look.

421
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,229
Grades are what they are,
all right?

422
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:07,885
Keepin' shit movin'.

423
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:09,365
Mm, grades
are what you make them.

424
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,975
It's about moving
toward something, Kanan,

425
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,715
you know,
settin' goals for yourself,

426
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,415
achieving them,
surpassing them.

427
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,555
Uh, I got goals for myself.

428
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,555
Yeah, just 'cause you tryin'
to score don't mean they goals.

429
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:24,905
I'm moving
toward something, okay?

430
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,735
So, uh, speaking of movin',

431
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:34,995
that's actually
why I reached out.

432
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,655
Hmm?

433
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:39,139
I got a job offer
in North Carolina.

434
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,915
Charlotte.

435
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,019
They want me to be
the transport planner there.

436
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,885
Damn.
Sound important.

437
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:53,715
Probably just gonna be
figuring out bus routes,

438
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,239
but, this is a good opportunity
for me.

439
00:24:58,019 --> 00:24:59,199
Wow, that's...

440
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,725
Just doin' it, huh?

441
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,509
Gettin' up outta South side?

442
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,599
Yeah.

443
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:09,685
I know you're not really
kickin' it with my moms

444
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,299
like that no more, so...

445
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,739
We're better as friends.

446
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:19,949
You gonna be the one that tell
your friend you leaving?

447
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:24,525
No, I'm thinkin' it might be
better for our friendship

448
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:26,925
if I just left.

449
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,445
You and me both know you
wouldn't have even told me this

450
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,149
if you ain't want her
to know, Symph.

451
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:37,275
You're too smart
for your own good.

452
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,235
And you know this.

453
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:19,235
One-seventeen Squad to Central.

454
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,975
Central. Go ahead.

455
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,715
Fifteen a rolling New York.

456
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,895
Sam, Zebra, Victor 378.

457
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:48,045
The seller is thrilled
with your offer,

458
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:51,265
but the homeowners' association
are real sticklers

459
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,055
when it comes
to proof of income.

460
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:54,535
I'm payin' cash.
What else they need to know?

461
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:56,225
It's about you
maintaining the property,

462
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:59,315
being able to afford
any mandated improvements.

463
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:02,585
Neighborhoods like this one
have covenants and bylaws

464
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:05,415
that require the homeowner
follow strict guidelines

465
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,195
when maintaining the property,

466
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,845
everything from the height
of your bushes

467
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,285
to the frequency
of when your grass is cut.

468
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,545
Tell 'em I own a record label
and a lawn mower.

469
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,129
I'll get 'em
everything they need.

470
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,685
Oh, fuck.

471
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:47,365
License and registration.

472
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:48,715
My license is in my pocket,

473
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,935
and my registration's
in the glove box.

474
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,369
Go ahead.

475
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:04,995
What'd I do?

476
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,255
I don't know yet.

477
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,605
That sounds unconstitutional,

478
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,695
but not unusual.

479
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,605
You were stopped here
at a checkpoint last summer

480
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:14,749
in South Jamaica
on a night when a cop was shot.

481
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,615
What were you doing here?

482
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:19,915
For real?
That's why you pulled me over?

483
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,095
They were stoppin' everyone
that night.

484
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,485
Why were you here?

485
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,625
Shit, I don't even remember.

486
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:28,315
I... think I was looking
for gas or somethin'

487
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,665
after droppin' a friend off
at the airport.

488
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,015
How do you know Kanan Stark?

489
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:34,195
Better question is,
how do you know Kanan Stark?

490
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,779
I don't answer you.
You answer me.

491
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,985
Kanan is a student of mine.

492
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:43,985
He was in a class I taught
up at City College.

493
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,245
Kanan Stark's in high school.

494
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:46,685
It was an after-school thing.

495
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:48,735
You seem to know
a whole lot about Kanan.

496
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:50,255
You also have a relationship
with his mother?

497
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:51,775
You gonna arrest me
or something?

498
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:52,955
'Cause it feels like
these questions

499
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,655
are going to a place
they shouldn't be going,

500
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:56,655
and I don't really feel
comfortable answering them.

501
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:58,305
Have you ever met
Kanan's father?

502
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,045
Okay, I'm not
answering you anymore.

503
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,835
You wanna give me a ticket
or something, go ahead,

504
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,049
but I'm done answering
these questions.

505
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,539
Wait here.

506
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,495
What, am I gonna leave
when you got my ID?

507
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,245
Can I help you?

508
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:27,595
Need to get this fixed.

509
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,599
All right. What...

510
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:34,165
All right,
I need to respool it,

511
00:29:34,249 --> 00:29:36,215
untangle it,
rerecord it to another tape.

512
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,869
- How much?
- Twenty.

513
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,395
All right.

514
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,615
Very good. Come back tomorrow.

515
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,925
Pretty sure I told you,
bigger than Miami and Jers.

516
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:59,195
But just wanted to let you know
you's on my mind and e'ything.

517
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,845
But you know I'm on the clock.

518
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,155
'Bout to get back
to this business, a'ight?

519
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,809
I'ma see you later, baby,
a'ight?

520
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:09,635
Proud love from up above.

521
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,079
What it do, baby?

522
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,205
You know,
I don't know why niggas

523
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:15,815
be shittin' on New Jersey.

524
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,035
I like it out here.

525
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,519
Feels like vacation.

526
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:22,259
Paid vacation at that.

527
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,305
You talk to Raq
about movin' on the crew

528
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:26,569
in that other building?

529
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,615
You see, Raq just an investor.

530
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:34,925
Out here,
we think for ourselves.

531
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,499
She see it different.

532
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:40,195
I don't give a fuck
how she see it, my nigga.

533
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,455
Neither should you.

534
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,495
I mean, just think about it,
right?

535
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:45,975
Why you think she moved you
from the Forties

536
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,289
out here to New Jersey?

537
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:50,595
Raq ain't stupid, my nigga.

538
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,075
She want all her problems
in one place.

539
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,855
You and me, we those problems.

540
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,815
She just bidin' her time
right now

541
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,605
till she figure out
what she gonna do with us, man.

542
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,865
See, that's why we gonna
make our own plans

543
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:04,215
and our own moves, a'ight?

544
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,825
'Cause I ain't goin' out
like that again.

545
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,475
And neither is you, my nigga.

546
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,185
Marco.

547
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:19,275
Come on, man, you can't be
pullin' up on us like that.

548
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,665
What it do, man?
You know we gangsters, baby.

549
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:24,539
Merry Christmas.
That's for you.

550
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:28,415
My man.

551
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:30,155
I see you killin' it
out here, huh?

552
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:32,459
Shit, we ain't
killed nothin' just yet.

553
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:35,205
We still markin' motherfuckers
out here.

554
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:36,895
Time tickin' on these
New Jersey niggas, though,

555
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,425
I'll tell you that.

556
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,489
Hey, what do you know
about the older brother?

557
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:43,255
Martin or Marvin

558
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,605
or whatever the fuck
his name is?

559
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,695
Fuck Marvin.

560
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,915
He wants to do
some business together.

561
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,179
Is he good for the money?

562
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:55,875
Far as I know,
Marvin pay what he owe.

563
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:58,445
Why, what you two
gettin' into together?

564
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,315
Ah, you know, just takin' care
of a little problem

565
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,615
he's got near me.

566
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,625
Nothin' to write home about.

567
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,715
- Word up.
- All right.

568
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,275
I'll catch you homeboys later.

569
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,199
No doubt.

570
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,685
Them two niggas
workin' together?

571
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:20,595
Hide the women
and the children, man.

572
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,695
Anyone finds out I shared this
with you, Shannon,

573
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:33,175
I'm out of a job.

574
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,345
So these are his informants?

575
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:37,305
To maintain confidentiality,

576
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,745
an identification number
is assigned to each informant

577
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:42,095
and specifies age and gender.

578
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,225
So Howard had a 17-year-old
female informant

579
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:45,705
back in the '70s?

580
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,835
Yeah, that's what it says.

581
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,105
You gonna talk
to your friend in the sixth

582
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:51,145
about my nephew and this whole
shoplifting mess?

583
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:52,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
I got you.

584
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,985
My cousin Juliana
remains unhappy

585
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:03,555
that you've chosen to work
with the very same man

586
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:05,035
who took her hostage.

587
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,165
Yeah, I know she is.

588
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:08,595
And I don't blame her.

589
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,425
Don't feel right.

590
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:12,129
Not to me neither.

591
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,475
Look, I don't trust 'Nique.

592
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,215
I never have. I never will.

593
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:17,605
He been sharpenin' the knife
he gonna stick in my back

594
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:18,785
since I brought him in.

595
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:21,045
But he a means to an end.

596
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,549
He the price that I gotta pay
for the work out in Jersey.

597
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:25,399
New Jersey.

598
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,275
New Jersey's, uh, how you say?

599
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,055
Uh, small potatoes.

600
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,975
It's more headache
than it's worth.

601
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,585
No, we showin'
and we provin',

602
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:36,585
layin' the groundwork

603
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:38,025
to take what we doin'
on the South side

604
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:40,109
and set our shit up anywhere.

605
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,415
And more than that, walkin'
away from my work out there

606
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:43,935
looks like weakness,

607
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:45,985
and I can't afford
to look weak right now,

608
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,329
especially since I'm buildin'
our shit out even more.

609
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,035
Look...

610
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:53,475
I ain't tryin'
to count no chickens yet,

611
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,385
but I'm makin' moves
to plug into a network

612
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:57,649
that's gonna take us
down to Maryland and D.C.

613
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:00,305
We about to be fuckin'
with the eastern seaboard.

614
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:03,345
You don't need Unique
to build your business.

615
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:06,575
Look, we gon' handle Unique,
Juliana.

616
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,359
But we gotta be smart about it.

617
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,879
Can't be pullin' the trigger
on emotion.

618
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,365
Mm.

619
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,155
Keep us posted
on the expansion.

620
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:47,045
She in there at some table

621
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,355
with a Menudo-lookin'
motherfucker

622
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,785
and some other bitch,

623
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:51,315
kinda bad-lookin',
to be honest.

624
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,925
Never seen the guy before,

625
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,485
but don't take
too much imaginin'

626
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:56,225
to figure
what's payin' the bills.

627
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,839
Well, I got a pretty fuckin'
wild imagination, Abraham.

628
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,885
So let's find out
all the real shit

629
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,269
we need to know about everybody
who was at that table.

630
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,045
What the fuck?

631
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:36,355
Linton want we for make sure

632
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:39,705
you and Crown
understand the urgency.

633
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,575
And since Crown
gone for the moment...

634
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:09,385
Shit.

635
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:27,145
I know it wasn't always easy,

636
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:28,585
and I know
it wasn't always fun...

637
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,105
...but it was worthwhile

638
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,635
and not just for you.

639
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,939
I learned a lot too,
so thank you.

640
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,505
And I'm always here
if you need me, so...

641
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:42,639
don't hesitate to reach out.

642
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,775
To all of you, congratulations.

643
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:47,995
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

644
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,555
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

645
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:52,129
Cheers, Marvin.

646
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,915
You-you too, Gerald.

647
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:57,005
We made it.

648
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,095
We did.

649
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,965
You know, I really was gonna
try and kick your ass that day

650
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:02,395
when you said
that you were ignoring me.

651
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:04,135
Oh, I know.

652
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,615
Mr. Clean was unregulated
like a motherfucker that day.

653
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:08,599
I think we both
learned a lot here.

654
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:10,795
You a'ight, G.

655
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,585
Between you and me,
I always felt like

656
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:14,275
a bald-headed nigga like you

657
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,975
got every right in the world
to be a little angry,

658
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,245
'cause that's unfair.

659
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:19,505
- Yeah.
- I mean, your shit is like

660
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:21,155
yesterday's news.

661
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,805
It's like it's never
comin' back, B.

662
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,595
Hey, Marvin, uh...

663
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:34,255
So... you made it.

664
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,739
Yeah, I-I did.

665
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,345
I'm proud of you.

666
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:41,005
I'm proud of me too.

667
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:42,395
I mean, it's the first
graduation I had

668
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:44,309
since I got my gold belt
in kung fu.

669
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:47,225
Wah!

670
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:48,669
Um...

671
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:54,145
...that's-that's my number.

672
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:57,669
I-I hope you stay in touch.

673
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,549
I'd love to hear from you.

674
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:05,465
I'd, uh... I'd love to be heard.

675
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,295
It's-it's a good job,

676
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:14,519
and there aren't many of them
out there right now.

677
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:17,129
So you leavin'?

678
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:20,179
I couldn't say no.

679
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,475
I mean, you can always say no.

680
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,695
You've said no to me
plenty of times.

681
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:27,969
Oh, when did I ever
say no to you?

682
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:30,005
Don't matter.

683
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:31,265
Uh-huh.

684
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,189
You leavin'.

685
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:36,449
Good luck.

686
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:40,849
You know I want
the best for you.

687
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:43,329
And I appreciate that.

688
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,899
You know I want
the same for you too.

689
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:57,385
This white lady cop
pulled me over yesterday.

690
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,425
Had all sorts of questions
about Kanan

691
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:01,695
and the night you had me
drive him down South.

692
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:03,955
Even asked me
about Kanan's father.

693
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,565
So what you tell her?

694
00:39:05,649 --> 00:39:07,135
- Nothin'.
- What does nothin' mean?

695
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,435
I mean, your version of nothin'

696
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,395
might be a little different
from mine.

697
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,315
All your secrets
are safe with me.

698
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,749
I ain't got no secrets.

699
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:22,885
Take care of yourself, Raq.

00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:11,675
I thought
you was Corinne's sister

when I met you, remember?

708
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,815

- Hey.

716
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,275
Look, uh, I-I can explain.

717
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,445
I... t-this shit
kinda just happened.

718
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,015
You fuckin' whore.

719
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:46,835
First thing every girl
needs to learn

720
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,259
is how to hold on to her man.

721
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:51,455
Fuck you, you fuckin' bitch!

722
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:54,765
Corinne! Hey! Shit!
Yo, Corinne!

723
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:57,675
Let her go, baby.
She gonna be fine.

724
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,245
She just walked in her room

725
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:01,115
and saw her boyfriend
in bed with her mother.

726
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,115
How the fuck is she gonna
be all right, Palomar?

727
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,725
Every girl goes through this.

728
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:06,385
Every... you acting like

729
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,295
this is some regular shit
right now, a'ight?

730
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:09,555
What the fuck about this
is regular?

731
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,949
You wanna be regular?

732
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,345
Who wants to be regular, hmm?

733
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:17,175

And you're certain this nigga

738
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,925
Crown Camacho's gone, right?

739
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,275
'Cause Linton Manley
ain't the type of nigga

740
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,539
to be trifled with.

741
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:37,679
Crown Camacho's
check-writin' days is done.

742
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,099
And your sister
won't give you the assist?

743
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:44,855
I can't have Raq
touchin' this label.

744
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:46,945
That's why I came to you.

745
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:48,685
You get what I'm tryin' to do
with this business.

746
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:51,255
You're talented.

747
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:54,295
Exactly how talented
still remains a question to me,

748
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,699
but there's a gift there.

749
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:59,825
This is business, though.

750
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:01,399
And business ain't about gifts.

751
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,489
Put some interest on it.

752
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:05,969
Gimme a due date.

753
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:09,059
I'll get you that money back.

754
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:14,015
Assuming Crown Camacho's

755
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,105
dancing days are over,

756
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:18,969
what happens
to his piece of the company?

757
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,155
Throw his mom
some pocket change,

758
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,939
comes to me.

759
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,509
I want half of his half.

760
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:34,559
You'll still have
controlling interest.

761
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:37,719
I'll just be a silent partner.

762
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:42,439
You need my help with Linton.

763
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:45,269
My help ain't free.

764
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:50,315
One nigga's crisis
is another nigga's opportunity.

765
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:52,795
Nobody knows that
better than you, Lou.

766
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:07,065
My man.

767
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,079
That's the one.

768
00:43:22,729 --> 00:43:24,089
In and out.

769
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:27,825
Clean, quiet.

770
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,399
I want none of your bullshit.

771
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:32,745
Hey, I turned over a new leaf.

772
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:34,795
After that shit
in the Catskills... you'll see.

773
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,405
- You and your dad.
- Listen to me.

774
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,055
This got nothin' to do
with my father.

775
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,665
It's my job, not his.

776
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,015
And he don't ever need
to know about it.

777
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:44,279
You hear me?

778
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:47,589
Yeah, loud and fuckin' clear.

779
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:52,939
Let's go.

780
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,555
See, girl,
that movie's why you don't

781
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,165
hire a babysitter
that look better than you.

782
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,045
I mean, thank God
she had that slow Black guy

783
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,735
who wanted nothin' more
than to protect white bitches

784
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:11,655
and they kids.

785
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:13,485
Yo, if I was him,

786
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,785
I would've let ole girl
bring the whole place down.

787
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:17,835
I mean, they sold his ass out
fast up in there, right?

788
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,669
Shit!

789
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:22,495
I mean, they did find
those underwear

790
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,665
in his toolbox, though.

791
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:27,495
I mean, she planted it,
but still.

792
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:28,935
All them stupid white folks
deserve each other.

793
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:34,589
This was fun, Laverne.

794
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:37,119
Yeah, you fun.

795
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:39,859
- You fun too.
- Hey.

796
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:02,269
Let's do this again sometime.

797
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:05,319
Word.

798
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,935
Oh, and when we have kids,

799
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:13,885
we ain't hirin' no crazy
white babysitter, a'ight?

800
00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:15,765
No doubt.

801
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:54,325
Oh, my God, baby!

802
00:46:01,979 --> 00:46:04,595
Ah. I mean...

803
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,855
...if I had known

804
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:09,375
that dentists were that good
at fucking,

805
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:11,905
I would've gotten my teeth
cleaned more often.

806
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:13,995
Well, our job is to notice
the little things.

807
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,035
- Mm. Uh-huh.
- It comes in handy sometimes.

808
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,749
I love you, baby.

809
00:46:27,129 --> 00:46:28,309
I love you too.

810
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,885
I'll be right back.

811
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:38,365
Mm-hmm!

812
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:43,805
Uh-huh.

813
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:46,379
- Don't you move.
- I'm not going anywhere.

814
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:49,859
Ah!

815
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:00,739
All right.

816
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:12,525
Shoot him, Dom!

817
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:13,795
- Marco!
- Shoot him!

818
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:22,805
Oh, fuck.

819
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:35,685
Toni.

820
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,815
Toni. Toni, baby.

821
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:41,125
Toni.

822
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:42,825
Baby.

823
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:44,645
Toni!

824
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:48,215
Baby.

825
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,479
Help!

826
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:51,565
Help!

827
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,145
That white bitch cop
you fuckin' with,

828
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:01,885
she a problem.

829
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:03,665
She rolled up
on a friend of mine,

830
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:06,015
asked him questions about Kanan
and Kanan's daddy

831
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:07,885
and what happened to you
in the park that night.

832
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,365
Burke a dog with a bone.

833
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:10,715
It ain't gonna be good for us

834
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:12,765
if she put two and two
together.

835
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,375
Two and two might be
more math than she can handle.

836
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,595
She'll be a'ight.
What about your boyfriend?

837
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:20,775
He know enough to be a problem?

838
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,279
Nah, he don't know
what he know.

839
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:28,085
So he a problem.

840
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:33,789
Kanan tell you
I sprung his boy?

841
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,439
Figueroa. Puerto Rican kid.

842
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,835
I mean, I heard he got out.
Didn't know it was you.

843
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,615
Son came to me.

844
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:44,015
Puerto Rican kid got knocked

845
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:45,879
with a bag
full of filthy-ass drug money.

846
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:48,319
I assumed it was yours.

847
00:48:50,669 --> 00:48:52,895
Raquel, if you keep puttin'
Kanan in the cross hairs,

848
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:54,279
eventually he gonna get hit.

849
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,245
Yeah, well,
you handle your business.

850
00:48:57,329 --> 00:48:58,945
I'll handle mine.

851
00:48:59,029 --> 00:49:00,595
Speaking of your business,

852
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,685
turns out, One-Eyed Jack
wasn't no snitch after all.

853
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,685
My bad, yo.

854
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,735
And his moms, she ain't buyin'
that he died by his own hand.

855
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:12,085
You told me Scrap was a snitch.

856
00:49:12,169 --> 00:49:13,955
I know what I told you.

857
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:15,915
I made a mistake.

858
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:17,305
That's easy to do out here,

859
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,005
with everybody lyin'
and perpetratin'.

860
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,355
What you gonna do when Kanan

861
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:22,059
sees all your lies
and mistakes, huh?

862
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:41,635
You ever even come to bed
last night?

863
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:42,985
I know where this shit starts,

864
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:45,205
but I have no fuckin' idea
where it ends.

865
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:48,945
The numbers tell the story.
Raquel Thomas?

866
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,295
Raquel Thomas was Howard's CI
back when she was 16,

867
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:52,645
which was right around
the time

868
00:49:52,729 --> 00:49:54,385
that she got pregnant
with his son.

869
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:55,995
Meanwhile
Howard has a teenage son,

870
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,175
and he seems real interested
in Kanan Stark.

871
00:49:58,259 --> 00:49:59,395
I think that Howard
and Raquel Thomas

872
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:00,695
slept together
when she was underage

873
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:02,565
and Kanan Stark is his kid.

874
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:04,615
You're making
some big leaps here, Shannon.

875
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:06,265
The thing
that I can't figure out

876
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:08,249
is how this all tracks back
to the shooting.

877
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,489
You need to leave this alone.

878
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,105
I'm investigating
the shooting of a cop.

879
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:17,145
You're not investigating
the shooting of a cop.

880
00:50:17,229 --> 00:50:19,419
You are investigating a cop.

881
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:22,025
A-all of a sudden,
you're Internal Affairs.

882
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:24,935
And nobody
likes Internal Affairs.

883
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:35,775
Look, my mom fell this morning,

884
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:37,565
so I gotta go.

885
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:07,989
Ms. Thomas?

886
00:51:09,629 --> 00:51:12,635
Uh, I'm Corinne Ashford.
I'm a friend of Kanan's.

887
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:13,905
And I think there's something
you should know.

888
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:13,095
James Bingham?

889
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:15,225
I'm Detective Malcolm Howard.

890
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:17,529
I need to talk to you
about Detective Shannon Burke.

891
00:52:20,009 --> 00:52:21,839
You see, uh,
who left this here?

892
00:52:22,919 --> 00:52:23,975
No.

893
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:29,195

Ain't no
such thing as a clean getaway,

00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:56,105
not in real life

and definitely
not in this fuckin' life.

925

you won't even see that shit
