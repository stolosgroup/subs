Ha ha. That's right.

3
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:15,160
Yo. What's up, money?
you can't understand

4
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,484
Y'all seen
how my last fight ended

5
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,037
this right here is how
my first fight started.

6
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,083
"Fight!"

7
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:29,458
Get offa him! Leave him alone!

8
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,051
I told you, stop
playin' with us.

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,047
He's hurt, let him go.

10
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,290
Leave him alone!

11
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,798
Shut up, Jukebox!

12
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,731
I wouldn't do that, yo.
Why don't you say somethin', bitch?

13
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:44,401
Y'all better recognize.

14
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:46,466
You already doin' man.
Can't mess with us.

15
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:47,872
Kanan, you don't
have to do this!

16
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:49,223
That fool didn't
know what he was doin'.

17
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:50,934
Exactly. Let
it go. Let it go.

18
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:51,973
Yo!

19
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,182
-  He's cuttin' out.

20
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:02,535
Next time, you're gonna give
up that money when I tell you.

21
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,276
Stop playin' with us, man.

22
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,106
Man, let's go, let's do it.

23
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,450
-  Get off, let me go.
-  Let her go.

24
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,722
Punk-ass!

25
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,301
Hey, nice job.

26
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:14,626
You okay, Kanan?

27
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,020
Kanan?

28
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,481
-  See this?
- Kanan?

29
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:21,309
Now everybody's
laughing at you.

30
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,517
Kanan?

31
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:23,972
The
hood got no love

32
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,441
for a motherfucker who run.

33
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,839
Bye, Kanan!

34
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:29,403
Kanan! Get back here!

35
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,761
There I go.

36
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:37,719
Damn. That shit's a bad look.

37
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:39,155
You all right, Kanan?

38
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:48,850

39
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,880
My mom and her
boyfriend, High Post.

40
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:03,271
Where you goin', Kanan?

41
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:08,584
Look like little Kanan got
in a tussle at the park.

42
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:11,975
Post is the one
who really got her in the game.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,975
Hey.

44
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:15,604
You want me to go talk to him?

45
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,576
Not every kid up for
the Southside, Raq.

46
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:21,896
Mine is.

47
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,195
Post'll
be dead in a year.

48
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,745
Someone lit his ass
on fire for tellin'.

49
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:29,201
I always liked that brother.

50
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:31,450
Treated my mom right.

51
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,149
Why you cryin', Kanan?

52
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,005
What happened?

53
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,177
Tyus and Antoine
jumped me for my money.

54
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,568
How they know you had it?

55
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,599
I told you not to show
nobody your money.

56
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:51,084
Didn't show nothin'.

57
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,641
You talkin'
about it, then.

58
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,343
And you gave it up.

59
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,796
They beat me down.

60
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:01,603
Where was Jukebox?

61
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,500
They were holdin' her back.

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,799
Tyus' stronger than me.

63
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,057
We goin' back to that park.

64
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:40,596
Hey. Let's go.

65
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:53,643
Let's go.

66
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:57,926
That them?

67
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,317
Deal with them or deal with me,

68
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:03,497
but there ain't nowhere to
run when it comes to me.

69
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:05,879
Get yours, boy.

70
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:16,403
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

71
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:37,334
You know I can get
tickets to first base.

72
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:38,359
He can't get tickets.

73
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:39,428
- Stop...
- Yo.

74
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,099
Yo, so you back for more?

75
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:47,561
Oh, my God!

76
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,372
- Yo, Kanan, no...

77
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:59,181
Come on, let's go.

78
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,863
Damn, payback's
a mother fucker.

79
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:08,924
Southside,
Jamaica, Queens, 1985.

80
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,127
Kanan messin' these niggas up!

81
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,705
That was the
first time my name rang out.

82
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:17,726
And it ain't stopped
ringing since.

83
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,825
That's the bell.
Everyone, get to class.

84
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,164
That's the bell.
Didn't you hear me?

85
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:47,735
My office.

86
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,589
This could be a
life-changing opportunity for you, Kanan.

87
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:02,902
Stuyvesant is one of the best
high schools in the country.

88
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:04,785
Now, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

89
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,428
Ma, but I don't
wanna change schools.

90
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,425
There isn't enough time
to fully prepare Kanan

91
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,620
for the entrance
exam, but I am betting

92
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:12,817
that just based on what
he already has stored up

93
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:16,324
in the that ample brain of
his, he'll do quite well.

94
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,259
It's a brand-new school building

95
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:21,003
with a pool, five gymnasiums,

96
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:24,324
12 science labs, and escalators.

97
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:27,124
Word? Escalators?

98
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,234
The building
cost $150 million.

99
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,273
That's some real money.

100
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:33,726
The most
expensive high school

101
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,171
ever built in the city

102
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:37,938
with a top-notch
faculty to match.

103
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:39,382
Stuyvesant ain't playing.

104
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:41,106
I hope you don't mind
that I took the liberty

105
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:44,003
of signing Kanan up for
the entrance exam myself.

106
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,966
But there's still paperwork
that requires your signature.

107
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:50,684
Thank you.

108
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,708
There's no limit
to your potential, Kanan,

109
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:56,137
and there's nothing worse
than squandered talent.

110
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,005
- What?

111
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,097
-  Hey...

112
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,252
You're takin' that test,
and you're goin' to that school.

113
00:09:12,277 --> 00:09:13,645
I like it here.

114
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,966
I'd have to take the
bus all the way down

115
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,411
to Sutphin and take the E.

116
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:19,286
Ain't nobody tryin'
to do all that.

117
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:21,411
Besides, I'm doin' good here.
Why we gotta go switchin' up?

118
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:24,839
Because there is a better
plan for you, a bigger world.

119
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,151
Ah.

120
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:31,604
That's me right there.

121
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,760
It's the only shit I
ever liked in school.

122
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,151
My girl Cassiopeia,

123
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,134
she got put up
here as punishment.

124
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,549
Rolled up on Poseidon and said

125
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,065
she was finer than his mermaids,

126
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,658
so he threw her up in the sky,

127
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,760
spins around the North
Pole for eternity.

128
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,143
Old girl's just holdin' on,

129
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:53,203
always about to
fall off the throne.

130
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:57,375
That's real right there.

131
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:02,807
Look, I got a plan
for you, Kanan.

132
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:05,138
And this new school, it
figures in just right.

133
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:06,971
So you gonna take that test,

134
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,498
you're gonna get into
that school downtown,

135
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:09,915
you're gonna go to college,

136
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,986
and you're gonna become
a CEO or some shit.

137
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,932
Okay, you about to live a life

138
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,791
that people 'round
here only dream about.

139
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,605
But I'd be away from you, Ma.

140
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,628
Your life is my life.

141
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:25,049
You fly, I fly.

142
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,629
I gotta go. I love you.

143
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,125
You hear that?

144
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,673
You feel that?

145
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,359
My cousin Jukebox can sing.

146
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:00,195
But that voice gon' fool yo ass

147
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,918
'cause you never knew a
nigga harder than Jukebox,

148
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:05,952
and I ain't never loved
nobody harder neither.

149
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:07,961
Juke, everything.

150
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:22,729
Thanks.

151
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:25,607
Kanan.

152
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:28,124
What's up, Davina?

153
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,772
I saw your mom in the
hallway earlier today.

154
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,069
She's so pretty.

155
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,976
Davina Harrison.

156
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,090
To me, Davina was
the dopest girl

157
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,186
on the Southside, no question.

158
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,420
See, Davina didn't even
know she was a dime,

159
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:50,490
which only made her
that much finer.

160
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:53,069
Any time she looked
in my direction,

161
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,391
I damn near forgot my own name.

162
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:57,110
Look at me.

163
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:59,030
Nigga can't even speak.

164
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,843
And you got them same genes.

165
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:06,648
Look, I ain't never really
seen a good picture of my pops.

166
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:08,697
He might be crazy
ugly, I don't know.

167
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,205
Look, everybody says
he used to, like,

168
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,449
run the hood back in the day,

169
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,389
and they don't let
ugly dudes do that.

170
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,046
And you cute already anyway.

171
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,202
Next!

172
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:20,030
You up.

173
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,186
- Huh?
- Y-you, uh...

174
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,965
You... yeah.

175
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,378
Yo, what up, Jukebox?

176
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,449
The
crew. My people.

177
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,280
Fuck that food shit. Give
me a... give me a beat.

178
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,863
Oh, word?

179
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,162
You can't teach
that shit, nigga!

180
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,933
Come on. That's God-given.

181
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,350
That's touched by a angel.

182
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,522
That's off the dome, nigga.

183
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,244
I'm not
gonna lie, Famous.

184
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,022
That's not the worst
rhyme you've ever spit.

185
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:08,796
Thanks?

186
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,569
Sean "Puerto
Rican Famous". Figueroa.

187
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,593
But we just called him "Famous"

188
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,707
because when he was
in the third grade,

189
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:19,319
he won some contest to read
a poem he wrote on the radio.

190
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:21,593
That shit was garbage,
but that's my nigga.

191
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:31,491
Every school got
a Davina Harrison,

192
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,181
and every Davina
Harrison in every school

193
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,251
got a boyfriend
like Buck Twenty,

194
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,123
the smoothest, best-dressed dude

195
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,845
around the way.

196
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,858
Fuck Buck Twenty.

197
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,494
How long you been
tryin' to get with her?

198
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,030
Since second grade?

199
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:58,663
How long she been
playing you to the left?

200
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
First grade.

201
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,025
Maybe you should move on.

202
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,662
Juke, I ain't never movin' on.

203
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,071
How the fuck did
Born Ready get hit?

204
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:28,230
They savior he cipher
squared wisdom gods.

205
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,218
There
go my Uncle Lou-Lou,

206
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:32,224
my mom's youngest
brother and right hand

207
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,898
up in this muhfucker.

208
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,023
If there shit that need doin',

209
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:39,226
Uncle Lou-Lou'll get it
done, and get it done right.

210
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:41,297
Up on knowledge, culture power.

211
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:43,716
Oh, and
they talkin' in code,

212
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,992
or some type of secret shit.

213
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,845
That's why you don't
know what they sayin'.

214
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,226
So mind your own damn bidness.

215
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,272
No one gone to the essence,
but Born Ready, he caught one.

216
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:54,169
- But where he at?
- He in here.

217
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:56,109
-  What's good?
-  Yo.

218
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:57,836
They just ran up
on us and blazed.

219
00:14:58,061 --> 00:14:58,953
Four dudes.

220
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:00,792
E-Z, Trace, and L-Mack got away,but

221
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,931
Ready got hit in the leg.

222
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,963
Shit burns.

223
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,239
Marvin, what
the fuck happened?

224
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,447
Got him in the meat.

225
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,416
Ready'll be a'ight.

226
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:15,796
Where you been?

227
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:18,556
Nigga hungry.

228
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:19,661
Uncle Marvin.

229
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,613
My mom's older brother.

230
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,368
That nigga never
miss a opportunity

231
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:25,134
to miss a opportunity.

232
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:26,814
But he loyal.

233
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:28,166
And tough.

234
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,295
And he always eatin'.

235
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,291
'Nique tryin'
to muscle his way

236
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,642
onto our corners again.

237
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:37,515
We need to push back.
He need to feel us.

238
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,885
You want us take it to the
street, it'll be taken.

239
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,345
Nah, we barely comin'
out this drought.

240
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,570
We don't need a war right now.

241
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:44,150
It ain't about
what we need, sis.

242
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,719
It's about what we got.

243
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,129
We can't let 'em body us,

244
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,924
especially when
business so tight.

245
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:52,127
And we gettin'
elbowed down at Lanes.

246
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:54,236
- Since when?
-  Couple weeks.

247
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,338
Harlem niggas is movin' in.

248
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:58,080
And I'm just hearin'
about it now?

249
00:15:58,722 --> 00:15:59,947
I just heard about it.

250
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,931
It's accurate.

251
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:05,478
You runnin' distro
downtown, right?

252
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:08,916
Then run it.

253
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:11,361
Now I gotta go deal
with this bullshit.

254
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,236
We got your hospital bill.

255
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:16,658
Thanks.

256
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,658
Can't sleep on this
hospital apple sauce, yo.

257
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:35,138
Oh... come on.

258
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,923
-  Shoot, shoot, shoot.
-  Yes!

259
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:38,575
Come on,
come on, come on...

260
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,210
Ryu 'bout
to fuck you up!

261
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,497
Chun-Li's making you her bitch.

262
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,002
Blocks and weaves,
blocks and weaves...

263
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:47,508
Ooh... oh!

264
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,966
Ah! Ooh!

265
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:52,725
Oh! Boy.

266
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,966
My bitch.

267
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:56,169
That's some bullshit.
You know this shit fake.

268
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:58,278
Let's do it again.

269
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,466
Wanna
go for round two?

270
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:01,684
Yeah.

271
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,217
That's Unique.

272
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:18,397
Biggest drug dealer
on the Southside.

273
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:21,627
Niggas wanna be him
or be down with him.

274
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,030
That shit's bulletproof.

275
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:30,396
Unique's got a dude
in Utah who armors up

276
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,075
all his rides for him.

277
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,129
I didn't know
Unique put Buck on.

278
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:25,449
Yo, we
lookin' for Hugo.

279
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:27,301
Uh, not here.

280
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:28,945
Any idea when he'll be back?

281
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,928
Hugo's taking a
mental health day.

282
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:32,711
I told you, I'm done
with green apples.

283
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,785
My nutritionist says only citrus for the
rest of the year. Where are my tangerines?

284
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:39,981
And who are you?

285
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:42,897
My sister and I, we got
bidness with, uh, Hugo.

286
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,508
Oh, Hugo's business
is my business.

287
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,934
I'm the club's new publicist.

288
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,185
Well, this
ain't about publicity.

289
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,690
Everything's about publicity.

290
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:51,654
Wait, I know who you are.

291
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,309
You're the drug dealer.

292
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:54,810
You're the one who
made a deal with Hugo

293
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,215
to sell your blow here.

294
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,331
Your coke's all stepped on
and dirty... ghetto shit.

295
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:00,895
It's a bad look for the club.

296
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,942
Going forward, we're
gonna be using my source.

297
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,254
I bet you won't.

298
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,933
Let me get at her
for a sec, Raq.

299
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,822
Yeah, this bitch doesn't
know who she's fuckin' with.

300
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,176
Who you calling a bitch?

301
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:11,246
- You, bitch.
-  Raq.

302
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:13,107
- Let me handle it.

303
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:15,959
I'm not the one.

304
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,201
Know this.

305
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:20,209
Your sister
needs to chill the fuck out.

306
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:21,580
She needs to know I'm not

307
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:23,303
some scared-ass
white girl, honey.

308
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,928
Let me holler
at you for a sec.

309
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,287
She's the worst.

310
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:34,750
Well, she 'bout to
get her ass beat.

311
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,502
Tears will not be shed.

312
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,038
Symphony Bosket.

313
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,716
That's a hell of a name.

314
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:43,308
Well, I'm a hell of a guy.

315
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:46,364
Raquel Thomas.
People call me Raq.

316
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,451
You new?

317
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,599
I'm just working here
Tuesdays and Thursday nights.

318
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,927
Got class all the others.

319
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:54,443
Oh, what you learnin', Symphony?

320
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,326
I'm getting my masters
up at City College.

321
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:58,309
- Urban planning.
- Well, I'm urban.

322
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,459
I like plans.

323
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:02,693
Might just have some
shit to talk about, then.

324
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,310
Yo, Raq.

325
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,068
We're gonna get at Hugo later.

326
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,881
I'll see you 'round, Symphony.

327
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:10,605
I'm gonna look forward to that.

328
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,468
Lamont's Diner.

329
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:22,224
That's our spot.

330
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:26,240
Dinner every Wednesday night
for as long as I can remember.

331
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:28,685
Best memories I got.

332
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,657
-  Okay, Lou-Lou.
-  He's not?

333
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:31,833
-  No.
-  Who funnier?

334
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:32,740
I mean, the bald one.

335
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,440
Oh, we not even
talkin' about that.

336
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,226
-  Like I said...
-  Just saying...

337
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:43,092
Look, look, I'm-I'm
just telling you all,

338
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,583
though, for real, Juke,

339
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,559
you was killin' at choir
practice today, for real.

340
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:48,223
- For real.
- My girl's a star.

341
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,990
Yo, Juke ain't no joke,
baby. That's right, B.

342
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:54,176
- Oh, that was a good one.

343
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:57,248
Well, your ma's been tellin'
me about this Stuyvesant test.

344
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,521
That's dope. It's good.
New building, what?

345
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:03,098
It's a new building where...
Got a bunch of labs,

346
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:04,428
pools, escalators.

347
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:05,340
Who got labs?

348
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,012
Look, the principal
over at the high school

349
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:08,272
wants him to take that test

350
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,491
to get into the school downtown.

351
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:11,146
Now, it's supposed to
be the best high school

352
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,715
- in the city.
- What city?

353
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:14,379
How come, uh, the principal
never stepped to you

354
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:15,598
- about this, Juke?
-  She did.

355
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:17,684
But you said it was
gonna be a waste of time,

356
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:19,579
that all them white
folks down there

357
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:22,129
was never gon' give
me a real chance.

358
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:23,895
I mean, that sounds
some shit I'd say.

359
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,158
- Yeah, exactly.

360
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:27,631
Look, okay, well, take
the test now, then.

361
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm too old.

362
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:32,051
Fuck it, then. I
mean, arts and science

363
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,098
is good enough for us, good
enough for my daughter.

364
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,633
That shit wasn't good
enough for us, Marvin.

365
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,223
- That's the point.
-  Whatever.

366
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:38,701
That's us.

367
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:39,965
Whole fam.

368
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,350
- Hey, yo!
- Doin' our thing.

369
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,664
- Yo, Fame!
- Thomases. What up?

370
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:45,881
-  What's goin' on, man?

371
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,764
Hey, hey, what's
the word, Thomas family?

372
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:50,019
Yo, so how much you payin'
this fine-lookin' woman

373
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:51,068
to walk around with you, Famous?

374
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,936
'Cause I know she ain't
kickin' it with you for free.

375
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:55,404
That's my sister, Jessica.

376
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:57,068
Oh, didn't even
know you had a sister.

377
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:58,943
I've been livin' with
my father in Baltimore.

378
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,187
Up here now to work
and go to school.

379
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,346
Oh, nothing I love more
than a working girl.

380
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:06,914
Somehow, it doesn't surprise
me that you love working girls.

381
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:08,287
Oh, sh...

382
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:10,445
Thirty seconds in, and she
already out your league.

383
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,350
Pull up a couple
seats. I got dinner.

384
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,375
No, we cool, we was just
passing through, Mrs. Raq.

385
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,545
- I just wanted to say "hi."
-  Famous.

386
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,857
You really gonna sit here and
act like it's a coincidence

387
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:19,579
- that you showed up?
- For real.

388
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:21,779
You know this our spot and time.

389
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:23,147
- Sit down.
-  Right.

390
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:24,647
I mean, if y'all insisting.

391
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:26,412
Hey, no one
insisting on shit, nigga.

392
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:27,743
Are you eatin' or not?

393
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,303
I'm eatin'.

394
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:30,631
Whoa, whoa.

395
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,656
Ha.

396
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:35,113
-  Dude, we know you.

397
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:37,248
Ain't no time to be poor, right?
It's cool to be poor.

398
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,143
Cool?

399
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,643
- Hey.
- Hey.

400
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,467
-  I'm Lou.
-  Jessica.

401
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,260
What's the
day's mathematics?

402
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,728
Power understanding
off the corners.

403
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:52,917
Wisdom and knowledge
from the other spots.

404
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:54,056
We down.

405
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:56,143
The price of jumbos dropped.

406
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,140
Had to keep up with the Joneses.

407
00:23:04,823 --> 00:23:05,984
You not cold?

408
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,401
Yo.

409
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:12,961
Yo. What up?

410
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:15,554
Yo, I don't want your uncle
messin' with my sister, man.

411
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:17,668
- Fame.
- She not built for this shit.

412
00:23:17,693 --> 00:23:19,303
Yo, you been wantin' to
be a part of our family

413
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,570
since you was, like,
four years old, Famous.

414
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:24,047
Hey, maybe this is
finally your way in.

415
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,883
- You know what I mean?
-  Word.

416
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:27,823
- Love, marriage.
- Yeah, maybe.

417
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:29,391
-  In-laws.
-  Exactly, Juke.

418
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:34,288
- Down!

419
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:51,870
You okay?

420
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,496
- Yeah.
- You okay?

421
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:55,773
-  I'm good.
- You two?

422
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:56,594
-  Yeah.
- Lou-Lou, good?

423
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,012
We good. I'm good.

424
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,008
Yo, you all right?

425
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,471
That's probably the bravest
thing any dude's ever done for me.

426
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:03,888
You hangin' with
the wrong dudes.

427
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:04,992
- Clearly.

428
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:07,933
Yo. That's Five-O. Let's be out.

429
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:09,548
Yo, Famous,
get in the car.

430
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,444
You okay?

431
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:29,074
Yeah.

432
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,148
I know who shot at us tonight.

433
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,992
You don't know
what you know, Kanan.

434
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:39,640
Hmph. Yeah, I know more
than you think I do.

435
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:41,464
I'm handling it.

436
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:42,877
We good.

437
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,532
That secret language you talk
with Uncle Marv and Lou-Lou,

438
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,552
all that wisdom, cipher,
understanding stuff,

439
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,021
it's Supreme mathematics
and alphabet.

440
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,411
I heard some Five
Percenters using it.

441
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:58,255
You always talkin' numbers
outside of Lamont's.

442
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,622
"Power understanding" is 53.

443
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,950
"Wisdom knowledge," 21.

444
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,176
Ma, I'm telling
you, I know stuff.

445
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,681
Look, you need to stay
out grown folks' business.

446
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,755
Okay, I told you, I'ma deal
with what happened tonight.

447
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:12,404
Okay, you just focus on
this test and school.

448
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:15,474
You handle your job,
I'll handle mine.

449
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:16,990
No, but what if
something happens to you?

450
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,714
That was just a message. They
weren't tryin' to hit me.

451
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:22,133
But what if they did
and you were gone?

452
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,676
- What happens to me?

453
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:41,202
You'd go live with
your grandmother.

454
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,923
That's one of the reasons
I rented her that house.

455
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,470
So you always have
a place to go.

456
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,970
I don't want you to die.

457
00:25:58,187 --> 00:25:59,362
Go to bed.

458
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,627
I seen my life flash in
front of my eyes last night.

459
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,463
Well, that's not much to see.

460
00:26:20,488 --> 00:26:21,673
Fuck you, Juke.

461
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:25,626
Hey,

462
00:26:25,962 --> 00:26:27,414
what was Raq
talkin' about last night

463
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:28,884
when you got home?

464
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,149
She say she wanna fix it.

465
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:33,308
Then she gonna fix it.

466
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,001
Guess you won't have to worry
about this shit no more.

467
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:43,345
You gonna be at
your fancy school

468
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,767
next year downtown.

469
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,585
Test tomorrow.

470
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,665
Yo, if it was me,

471
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,233
I'd fuck up that special
test shit on purpose.

472
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:50,511
I ain't goin' to school
with them fuckin' crackers.

473
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:51,911
Nigga, the
only special test

474
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:53,274
you ever gonna take is
the one to make sure

475
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:55,475
you ain't got that HIV
from Toya Hutchinson.

476
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,345
I used a
jimmy hat, a'ight?

477
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:58,899
Word?

478
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:00,915
I pulled out early, nigga! Damn!

479
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,665
You just
stupid, Famous. That's all.

480
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:05,147
I guess.

481
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,978
You came at me and my
family last night, 'Nique.

482
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,142
Wasn't tryin' to
hurt nobody, Raq.

483
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,821
Niggas are just
buckin' off in the air,

484
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,587
tryin' to get your attention

485
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,322
to motivate this
parley right here.

486
00:27:32,428 --> 00:27:34,438
Your brother would've
never done shit like that.

487
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:36,017
Yeah, maybe not.

488
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:38,419
You see, Ronnie's
upstate for the rest

489
00:27:38,444 --> 00:27:39,853
of his natural life,

490
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:41,219
and I'm runnin'
the show right now,

491
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,290
so I do what I wanna do.

492
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:45,839
You also bum rushed
my dudes on 145th.

493
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:48,227
Listen, my niggas
got a little wild,

494
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,851
but they've been checked.

495
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,524
But look, Raq,

496
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:54,844
High Post and my
brother had an agreement

497
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,986
that those blocks above 139th
is a demilitarized zone.

498
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,408
No man's land.

499
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,609
Then when your little
peoples ran in there,

500
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:04,713
snatched that up
without checkin' in.

501
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:06,447
'Sup with that?

502
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:08,099
Post's deals ain't my deals.

503
00:28:10,362 --> 00:28:14,010
You know, you must
really miss Post.

504
00:28:14,035 --> 00:28:17,604
Bein' that you two were just
so madly in love and shit.

505
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,182
Post used to say,

506
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:23,252
"Once you're on your knees,
it's damn near impossible

507
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:25,064
to get back on your feet."

508
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:27,830
I ain't gettin' on
my knees, 'Nique.

509
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:30,205
Not for you or no man.

510
00:28:30,893 --> 00:28:32,655
You take 140 to 143,

511
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,377
I get 144 to Sutphin.

512
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:38,000
- Why you get the extra block?
- Look.

513
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,929
We can go head up in this
motherfucker, 'Nique.

514
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:41,166
No matter where you were aimin',

515
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,864
you took a shot at me
and mines last night.

516
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,268
My peoples are ready
to throw the fuck down.

517
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,525
You can't afford the
war right now, Raq.

518
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,361
You hurtin' just like me.

519
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:51,736
Well, outta my pain
comes strength, nigga.

520
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,502
140 to 143.

521
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:03,039
Word is bond.

522
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,247
You know, that's a fly-ass
jacket right there, B.

523
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:13,296
You bring that to
shop, and we can

524
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:14,690
- tighten that up for you.
-  Mm-hmm.

525
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,433
- What the fuck is that?
- Come here, baby.

526
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:43,527
Ah...

527
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:50,358
What the fuck is that smell?

528
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,457
How you just gonna stop?

529
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:59,150
Bella?

530
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:02,171
Did you go poopy?

531
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,152
Hey, get me some water, yo.

532
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:07,910
Where are you, Bella, baby?

533
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,486
They said you got
a break halfway through.

534
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:47,576
Thanks.

535
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,287
You're gonna crush this, baby.

536
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,171
You have three hours
to complete the exam.

537
00:31:16,196 --> 00:31:19,883
You may open your test
booklets and begin the exam...

538
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:22,235
Now.

539
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:23,875
Good luck.

540
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:00,401
Niggas defined
by the choices they make.

541
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:03,426
And my choice has always
been clear as hell.

542
00:32:05,744 --> 00:32:07,691
My moms over everything.

543
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,329
Especially some downtown school

544
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:12,049
with a bunch of white niggas.

545
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:47,923
Medium well.

546
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:52,584
No doubt.

547
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:09,577
Test went quick.

548
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:11,391
Knew the answers
before I even sat down.

549
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:14,545
Hey, uh

550
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:17,131
saw Buck on your mom's
corner on the way over.

551
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:20,444
140th.

552
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,328
Damn, this nigga takin'
shots at us at the diner,

553
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:23,545
now he takin' corners too?

554
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,610
I thought you told Juke
your mom was gonna fix that.

555
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:28,664
We gonna handle it.

556
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:33,544
My brother got some gats
hidden around the crib.

557
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,686
D-Wiz.

558
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:37,952
D the one givin' Famous
the beat on the table

559
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,631
back in my old school.

560
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:42,038
Lot of fake tough
guys around the way.

561
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:44,196
Niggas who act like
they got heart,

562
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:46,507
but bitch up when shit get hot.

563
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,991
That wasn't D-Wiz.

564
00:33:49,016 --> 00:33:51,577
D always with
whatever, whenever.

565
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:53,998
That's my man.

566
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:58,984
Let's do this.

567
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:40,779
He got caught
by his parents.

568
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:43,275
- With a girl in his room.
- No way. Are you kidding?

569
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:46,939
What's up?

570
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:49,314
Can we help you?

571
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,472
Oh, shit, uh, this is Laverne.

572
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:54,936
We met at the choir competition
at City Center last week.

573
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:56,681
You go to Spence, right?

574
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:58,423
You're, uh, you're in
my friend Alex's class.

575
00:34:58,819 --> 00:34:59,743
Nah.

576
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:01,941
Where do you go to school?

577
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,314
Jamaica.

578
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,720
The island, Jamaica?

579
00:35:04,745 --> 00:35:07,634
Oh, my God. Um, Queens.

580
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:10,947
Jamaica, Queens.

581
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:13,572
Laverne and I are working
on a duet together

582
00:35:13,823 --> 00:35:14,998
for the Deb Ball.

583
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:16,205
It's like a

584
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:18,251
exchange program thingy.

585
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,560
I'll call you guys later.

586
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:27,329
- What the heck was that?
- I don't know.

587
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:29,954
God, the Deb Ball's this thing

588
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:31,291
that happens every year

589
00:35:31,316 --> 00:35:33,548
for rich white
girls to be, like,

590
00:35:33,753 --> 00:35:36,095
presented to rich white guys.

591
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:38,791
Rich Black
people have that too.

592
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:41,072
Jack and Jill or some shit.

593
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,267
Not that I've ever been invited.

594
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:47,542
Come with me to mine, then.

595
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,077
Nobody want me there.

596
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,087
I want you there.

597
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,314
Come on, come on, come on.

598
00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:14,500
Yo, um, what's
up with the mutt?

599
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:16,185
Tumor in his spine.

600
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:18,580
Can't use his rear legs no more.

601
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:20,947
Yo, well, never
give up on family.

602
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:22,705
No doubt.

603
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:35,642
Yo, uh, Hugo say we good.

604
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:37,800
Back up at Lanes
again. Own a spot.

605
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,281
He also was talkin'
some crazy shit

606
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:43,221
about the new white
girl up in there.

607
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:45,541
And, uh, and a dog in
a fuckin' microwave.

608
00:36:47,514 --> 00:36:48,646
What white girl?

609
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,103
You're so pretty.

610
00:37:12,122 --> 00:37:13,167
- Yeah.

611
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:30,383
You're shaking.

612
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:36,186
I get it. I get it.

613
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,828
Let me get
five red caps, yo.

614
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,445
Let me see cash.

615
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,296
Look at this.

616
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,062
Postin' up on my mom's corner?
That's straight-up disrespect.

617
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:47,397
Let me get the strap.

618
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:48,702
I'm using the other one.

619
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:57,272
I don't know what the fuck

620
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,461
Mm-mm.

621
00:38:58,486 --> 00:38:59,846
I ain't goin' out

622
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,235
Fuck that... what am I gonna do

623
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,395
when they start shootin'

624
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,344
Yell at them?

625
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:05,094
Man, look, y'all lay back.

627
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,022
Wait here.

628
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:44,969
Hmph.

629
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:46,300
The fuck you want, Kanan?

630
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:53,602
Oh, shit!

631
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,094
Oh

632
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:03,116
-  Who shot him?

633
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:04,546
Me or you?

634
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:12,318
Nigga tryin' to speak.

635
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:36,421
Buck Twenty the
first nigga I ever pointed a gun at.

636
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:40,047
You never forget that shit.

637
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,532

Kanan, let's go, man!

641
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:15,347
It's been a minute since
anybody asked me out on a date.

642
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:18,349
I know I'm not the
kind of brother

643
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:19,615
you probably mess with.

644
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:23,440
I'm in a

645
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,440
specific line of work, Symphony.

646
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,908
Not everybody can get down.

647
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:33,249
If it's not a problem for you,
it's not a problem for me.

648
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:42,505
So urban planning?

649
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,753
What do I need to know?

650
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:47,911
Oh, man. How much time you got?

651
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,908
How 'bout when Robert Moses

652
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,935
built the Cross
Bronx in the '40s,

653
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,918
he moved out 5,000
low-income families?

654
00:41:56,943 --> 00:41:59,511
Just threw them in the street.

655
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:01,869
But if he'd run the
expressway along Crotona Park

656
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,592
like a lot of
people told him to,

657
00:42:03,617 --> 00:42:05,663
only, like, 50 families
would have had to go.

658
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,636
I've never even heard
of Robert Moses.

659
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,968
Pretty much the architect
of the whole damn city

660
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:16,692
and Westchester and Long
Island and Rockland County.

661
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,891
Lotta people, including me,

662
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:21,482
think he destroyed those spots.

663
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,446
But I tell you all that

664
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:26,641
because that right
there is urban planning.

665
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:29,228
It's where policy
and design intersect.

666
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:33,953
- Look what you done started.

667
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:38,875
I like brothers with
bigger ideas than me.

668
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:47,526
Kanan.

669
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,708
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

670
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,005
- For dinner.
- No, but I asked you out.

671
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:05,672
I had squashed it, Kanan.

672
00:43:05,697 --> 00:43:08,401
It was done. Over.
We made that peace.

673
00:43:08,426 --> 00:43:10,031
Ma, he tried to kill you!

674
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:11,294
Then they was just
on your corner,

675
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:12,820
disrespectin' you? Hell no!

676
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:14,281
I gave him those corners.

677
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:17,710
Why-why would you do that?

678
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:19,578
- Great question.
- Here we go.

679
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:20,798
You wanna
start your own shit?

680
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:22,838
Make your own calls?
Have at it, nigga.

681
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,259
But if the past
taught us anything,

682
00:43:24,284 --> 00:43:26,101
it's that you not made
to sit in this seat,

683
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:28,135
to walk in these fuckin' shoes.

684
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:29,536
So how 'bout you
shut the fuck up

685
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:30,913
and let me speak to my son?

686
00:43:34,473 --> 00:43:35,710
That your blood?

687
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:40,257
No, it's the other kid.

688
00:43:40,282 --> 00:43:42,234
Yeah. The dead kid.

689
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:44,749
So just so we clear,

690
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:46,652
you and your friends
killed that boy

691
00:43:46,677 --> 00:43:48,218
for a corner I already gave up.

692
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:50,296
- I Didn't know you gave it up.
-  Exactly.

693
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:52,499
You don't know, but
you think you do.

694
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:53,703
You all do.

695
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,671
And where the fuck was you at

696
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:58,568
when all this stupidness
was goin' down?

697
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:04,195
Choir practice.

698
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:06,958
Singing.

699
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:08,568
She was singin'.

700
00:44:08,593 --> 00:44:10,153
Ma, I wanna help you.

701
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:11,801
-  You wanna help me?
- Yes!

702
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:14,045
Go to that school and get
the fuck up outta here!

703
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,654
You coulda sent me to
live with grandmoms

704
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:16,989
a long time ago!

705
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:19,911
Schools out there is safe, is
good, but you ain't do that.

706
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:22,066
You kept me right
here next to you

707
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,825
'cause this is all we got.

708
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:26,981
I'm here because
you wanted me here!

709
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:29,458
And now you tryin' to send me
to some spot downtown, right?

710
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:31,894
So I can go to college,
get some corny-ass job,

711
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,317
and raise up off
the block forever?

712
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,115
Leave you here alone?

713
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:36,985
Which one is it, Ma?

714
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,794
Am I stayin' here,
or am I goin'?

715
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:43,985
For real, you need
to make up your mind.

716
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:46,321
Go to your room.

717
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:51,680
I'm grown.

718
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,860
I don't think you can tell
me to do that no more.

719
00:44:53,885 --> 00:44:55,899
You must be
out your damn mind.

720
00:44:55,924 --> 00:44:58,448
Somebody gotta fly that
flag and have your back.

721
00:44:58,963 --> 00:45:00,524
That's what I did.

722
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:03,644
Ma, that's who I am! No, no,
no, I tell you who you are, Kanan,

723
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:04,781
not the other way around!

724
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:06,028
I am your mother!

725
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:13,578
That sweatshirt gotta go, Raq.

726
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:15,695
Go take it off.

727
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,069
Yo, you gotta burn that shit.

728
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:23,644
Come on.

729
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:34,251
'Nique gonna hit us back.

730
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,073
Sh...

731
00:46:37,691 --> 00:46:40,313
Look, Ma...  Not
nearly that time yet, Kanan.

732
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:43,124
Not even close.

733
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:53,231
Go take out the garbage and
get back up to your room.

734
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:06,798
Gonna take you to
your grandmother's.

735
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:18,319
Maybe you were right.

736
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:27,350
Maybe I should've sent you
out there from the rip.

737
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,272
Yo, Kanan!

738
00:48:12,534 --> 00:48:13,622
Kanan!

739
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:19,013
I'm good, I'm good.

740
00:48:19,038 --> 00:48:20,170
I'm not hit.

741
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:45,101
Every hood got
a cop like Malcolm Howard.

742
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:47,470
Act like he own the streets.

743
00:48:47,876 --> 00:48:49,984
Like we all answer to his ass.

744
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:52,625
Like he the biggest
gangster around the way.

745
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,805
But it ain't that simple.

746
00:48:55,322 --> 00:48:56,846
It ain't never that simple.

747
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,109
Looks like baby
boy's balls dropped.

748
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:05,931
The block's the same,
him and his boys,

749
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:07,262
they got prices on their heads.

750
00:49:07,336 --> 00:49:08,990
Yeah, well

751
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:10,906
block's got it wrong.

752
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,953
Maybe you should, uh, get
out while you still can.

753
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:25,537
They hit the wrong house.

754
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,289
Just a fucked up mistake.

755
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:29,836
Hmm. That's your story.
You're stickin' to it?

756
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:30,861
That's the one.

757
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:34,416
You spinnin' that same shit?

758
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,399
My son don't got
nothing to say to you.

759
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,364
Watch your back, Raquel.

760
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:46,162
And keep them eyes open, B.

761
00:49:54,169 --> 00:49:55,843
Yo, let us
through, man, we family.

762
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:57,208
Yo, Raq.

763
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:59,497
You a'ight?

764
00:49:59,522 --> 00:50:01,279
Guns wasn't pointed
in the air this time.

765
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:05,746
It's your first
crime scene, Burke.

766
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,318
What do you got?

767
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,881
Nine-millimeter
shell casings.

768
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:11,091
Some sort of SMG.

769
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:12,997
Gonna run ballistics,
see if we can match it.

770
00:50:13,022 --> 00:50:15,661
Ah, you all sleuthing up
in this motherfucker, huh?

771
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,896
Just doin' my job.

772
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:19,763
Yeah, well, I
hope you're a good swimmer.

773
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:21,458
The gat that squeezed
that shit out

774
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:23,163
it's already at the
bottom of Baisley Pond.

775
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:30,443
Shit's scary, right?

776
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:34,482
Psh. Shit's so scary, I didn't
even have time to be scared.

777
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:41,749
I'm glad they missed.

778
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:44,932
Yeah, me too.

779
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:50,181
Yo.

780
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:54,089
Where was you at earlier?

781
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,736
White girl?

782
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:07,572
You know I'd never tell you
how to raise your son, Raq.

783
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:11,651
But them fools is
comin' for Kanan.

784
00:51:11,826 --> 00:51:15,134
And no escalator in no school
is gonna save him from that.

785
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:17,602
Neither is his mama.

786
00:51:28,347 --> 00:51:29,347
For Buck's family.

787
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:35,378
Sss.

788
00:51:35,836 --> 00:51:37,511
We had a truce, Raq.

789
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:40,305
That your boy and
his crew violated.

790
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:43,297
Now, you think a clip of
cash for Buck's family

791
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:44,987
gonna nearly fix that, Raq?

792
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:47,811
If our word don't count,
this whole shit falls apart.

793
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:50,233
You know that.
Speakin' on violations.

794
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:52,139
You came after my
son last night...

795
00:51:52,605 --> 00:51:53,606
Where we stay at.

796
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,676
And we gonna keep comin', Raq.

797
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:57,730
You see, I got money on
all them niggas' heads

798
00:51:57,755 --> 00:51:59,975
until you and I come
to an agreement.

799
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,293
Or until we don't
need to no more.

800
00:52:02,689 --> 00:52:03,785
Now, look.

801
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,030
I want all them corners.

802
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:09,028
No compromise, no split,

803
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:10,481
no nothing.

804
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:12,551
They all comin' to me now.

805
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:14,824
See, look.

806
00:52:15,313 --> 00:52:17,457
My crew's lookin' at me like

807
00:52:17,747 --> 00:52:21,278
if I don't brin' something
back real for Buck,

808
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,341
they gonna start wantin'
answers to questions

809
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:27,326
people in our position don't
ever wanna be asked, Raq.

810
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:29,517
Kanan's not to be touched.

811
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,370
I'll dead the bounty.

812
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:32,980
But you gotta understand this:

813
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:35,400
I can only control
what I can control.

814
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:38,681
See, Buck's got a lot of
people on the Southside, Raq.

815
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:42,998
And I can't be held responsible

816
00:52:43,023 --> 00:52:45,316
for random niggas
wantin' to take matters

817
00:52:45,341 --> 00:52:46,064
into they own hands.

818
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:47,017
Kanan's not in this.

819
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,665
Kanan's you and
Def Con's boy, Raq.

820
00:52:50,703 --> 00:52:51,978
That nigga been in the shit

821
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:53,970
before he was even in this shit.

822
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:57,080
That's why I always say
this hustle right here

823
00:52:57,105 --> 00:52:59,237
ain't for the broads,
Raq.

824
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:01,321
'Cause you see, in this shit,

825
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:04,275
you can't give a fuck
about nobody or nothing

826
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,180
more than your business.

827
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:10,659
Distractions make you
weak. Make you blink.

828
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:13,739
You don't care about your son
any less than I care about Kanan.

829
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:16,588
Listen.

830
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:20,930
Jerome's my heart,

831
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:23,498
but he ain't live inside of me.

832
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,961
He didn't come out of me, Raq.

833
00:53:26,382 --> 00:53:28,294
You see, you and Kanan
connected in a way

834
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,341
me and Jerome just
never will be, Raq.

835
00:53:31,718 --> 00:53:33,623
You can't fuck with
that chemistry.

836
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:34,951
It's biology.

837
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:38,138
Even worse, Raq.

838
00:53:39,462 --> 00:53:40,326
Listen.

839
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:45,248
All them corners is mine now.

840
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,802
I'm not blinkin', 'Nique.

841
00:53:57,077 --> 00:53:58,990
My eyes are wide fuckin' open.

842
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:25,353
Kanan.

843
00:54:28,154 --> 00:54:29,986
Get
dressed. We're goin'.

844
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:31,279
Goin' where?

845
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:32,479
Just get dressed.

846
00:55:30,438 --> 00:55:32,005
Thought you were
takin' me to Grandma's.

847
00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:37,044
How'd that test go?

848
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:39,779
For real.

849
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:42,192
Don't lie to me.

850
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,589
If there was a lot of
answers in that B column,

851
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:49,383
I might be a'ight.

852
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:53,621
You threw it.

853
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,914
Kanan went hard on them Bs.

854
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:13,636
You see those four
stars? Right there.

855
00:56:14,244 --> 00:56:15,592
That rectangle.

856
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:18,905
With those diagonal stars
right in the middle of them.

857
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:22,446
That's Orion the Hunter.

858
00:56:25,822 --> 00:56:27,302
That's us, Kanan.

859
00:56:28,654 --> 00:56:29,615
Orion.

860
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,162
Always the hunter,
never the hunted.

861
00:56:51,606 --> 00:56:52,998
Go ahead. Take it.

862
00:56:55,047 --> 00:56:56,256
Point it straight out there.

863
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,115
Hold that shit with two hands.

864
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,647
Strong hand on top.

865
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,381
Extend your arms.

866
00:57:05,496 --> 00:57:06,865
Aim straight out there.

867
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:10,385
Squeeze one off.

868
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:20,441
That bullet's out there now.

869
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,931
Circlin' the world
with your name on it.

870
00:57:24,999 --> 00:57:26,915
Now you gonna be runnin'
from it for forever.

871
00:57:29,148 --> 00:57:30,829
You wanted to be in it?

872
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:32,564
You in it.

873
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,849
You already
know how my shit ended.

874
00:58:22,385 --> 00:58:24,032
And now you know how it started.

875
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:29,212
But the real story is
what happened in between.

876
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,131
This is that story.

877
00:58:35,132 --> 00:58:36,350
This is my story.

878
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:40,287
This is a Southside,
Jamaica, Queens story.

878
00:58:41,305 --> 00:59:41,685
