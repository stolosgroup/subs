00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?

2
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,489
Mr. White?

3
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,490
Hello?

4
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,128
Mr. White,
the car's been dealt with, sir.

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,806
No one tailed you?

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,885
No, I stayed off the main streets
and kept checking, so...

7
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,448
Joe ask any questions?

8
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,367
I told him RV job, just like
you said and he totally knew.

9
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,485
It's pretty cool the way they do that.
They just turn a car into a cube.

10
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,600
So should we deal
with this other thing now?

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,245
Yeah.

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,891
Sure.

13
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,284
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Okay.

14
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,769
It had to be done.

15
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,164
Okay.

16
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,090
All right.

17
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,084
I need to talk to you.

18
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,685
In private.

19
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,961
So, what's the story?

20
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,884
You get to Mike?

21
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,644
He get out safe?

22
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,250
He's gone.

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,040
All right.

24
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,727
Well, what about
those nine guys in jail?

25
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,645
I mean, they got no reason
not to talk now.

26
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,450
So, what do we do?

27
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,649
We"? Who's "we"?

28
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,327
There is no "we," Jesse.

29
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,687
I'm the only vote left...

30
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,809
...and I'll handle it.

31
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,169
My client will supply information
relating to the organisation...

32
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,160
...distribution and production of
Fring's methamphetamine enterprise.

33
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,881
We expect all charges to be dropped,
and Dennis not only walks out of here...

34
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,401
...a free man,
but also receives blanket immunity.

35
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,166
For what he'll be furnishing,
this deal is plenty fair.

36
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,922
Best I'd be willing to do is queen
for a day and reduced charges.

37
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,127
All charges dropped.

38
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,602
Queen for a day and a five-k.
That's the best you're gonna get.

39
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,728
No way. Guys, come on.

40
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,928
You can be a fairy princess,
for all I care.

41
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,491
Where you going?

42
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,962
Shopping for someone who can tell me
something I don't already know.

43
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,009
Hey, he)'

44
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,648
I got plenty you don't know.

45
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,648
You seem a little confused.

46
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,370
This here is a buyer's market.

47
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,650
I got eight other assholes just like you,
four of them within 100 feet from here.

48
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,202
I also got Dan the lawyer, who'll
give me the money and Ehrmantraut.

49
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,364
So settle in, Dennis.
Enjoy your new home.

50
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,968
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.

51
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,928
- So?
- Maybe you should order something.

52
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,163
- Do you want a coffee or something?
- Not just now.

53
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,571
I think this would play better
if you ordered something.

54
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,963
I think this will play just fine,
and I'm not thirsty.

55
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,441
So let's take a look at the list.

56
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,846
Lydia, you've come all this way.
You do have the list?

57
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,128
- Yes, I have it.
- Good.

58
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,209
It's just not written down.

59
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,081
- And why is that?
- It's in my head. Safer there.

60
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,526
I see.

61
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,251
Then I suggest you pick up a pen.

62
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,561
Not just yet.

63
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,561
It was my understanding that
attending to these nine names...

64
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,569
...was precisely what you wanted.

65
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,161
Ten names now.
Ten, counting the lawyer.

66
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,607
Yes. Ten, counting the lawyer.

67
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,730
So, what, am I not tying up loose
ends for our mutual benefit?

68
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,724
You're tying up loose ends,
and I don't wanna be one of them.

69
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,087
I give you that list,
I've served my purpose.

70
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,766
Then maybe I'm just one more person
who knows too much.

71
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,280
So you put that list in my hands,
and in your mind...

72
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,082
...I immediately just murder you,
just right here in this restaurant?

73
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,801
- No. Not right here. Of course.
- Here in this public place, immediately?

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,445
- That is not...
- Listen, Lydia.

75
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,288
You made me promise on my children's
lives that I guaranteed your safety.

76
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,010
From Mike.

77
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,686
You guaranteed
I'd be safe from Mike.

78
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,169
There's no way he'd ever go for
this, you getting rid of his guys.

79
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,928
You wouldn't be doing this, the
names, if Mike were still a factor.

80
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,404
Yeah. That's what I thought.

81
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,050
What do you want, exactly?

82
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,244
Because if you don't want
to give me that list...

83
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,244
...then I've truly
got no use for you.

84
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,767
I can grow your business
exponentially.

85
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,121
Just give me the list.

86
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,250
I can do that by helping you
expand into a larger...

87
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,007
...highly active, highly profitable
marketplace.

88
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,164
What do you know
about the Czech Republic?

89
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,651
The Czech Republic?

90
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,407
Did you know there's a higher demand
for meth there than anywhere in Europe?

91
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,642
Five percent of its
10 million people...

92
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,326
...which is roughly the population
of the Southwest...

93
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,087
...from western Texas to Phoenix,
are using meth.

94
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,443
You keep your market here,
but by adding overseas sales...

95
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,841
...you can more than double
your current profits.

96
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,886
And I checked. The average purity
is only about 60 percent.

97
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,368
They've never seen
anything like your product.

98
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,164
You'll blow their hair back.

99
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,161
Shipping internationally
seems like courting disaster.

100
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,367
Not if you're Madrigal.

101
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,444
Madrigal is under investigation
by the DEA.

102
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,449
The restaurant division, mostly.

103
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,964
We've got 46,000 employees
spread across 14 divisions.

104
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,762
And once Mike's people are no longer a
factor, things should tidy up nicely.

105
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,729
This is what I do, you understand?

106
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,281
Move things from point A to point B
all over the globe.

107
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,807
One-point-two million
metric tons a month...

108
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,000
...and all of it right at my
fingertips, a laptop click away.

109
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,328
The Czech Republic...

110
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,606
- Who's on the other end?
- People I ship to regularly.

111
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,889
People I've worked with for years.
Professional and very amenable.

112
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,691
I'm very careful who I work with.

113
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,003
And if this is such a slam dunk,
then why didn't you pitch it to Fring?

114
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,006
I did. He said yes. We were in the
final stages of working it out...

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,650
...when somebody killed him.

116
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,128
You don't think Gus Fring built his
distribution network all by himself.

117
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,923
There are considerable advantages
to diversification of distribution...

118
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,325
...like putting 6000 miles
between you and your product.

119
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,211
At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating
you'll gross about 2 million.

120
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,289
Give me 10 pounds to start,
and we'll see how it goes.

121
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,609
- All right.
- Now, with Fring...

122
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,481
...my end was gonna be 30 percent,
which I believe is more than fair.

123
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,802
- Okay.
- Trust me, if you do this...

124
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,328
Lydia, learn to take
yes for an answer.

125
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,086
Now, first things first.

126
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,965
Shake on it?

127
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,442
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

128
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,924
Todd, I think it's time
I meet your uncle.

129
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,250
No iron pile.

130
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,121
There's too many muscle-heads
flexing their shit. Too many eyes.

131
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,568
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.

132
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,245
Well, gonna keep it simple.

133
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,001
Pass-byes.

134
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,762
Yeah. Hallways,
shower room, cells.

135
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,531
The easy stuff.

136
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,885
I say we go with a riot.
Our boys get it done in a riot.

137
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,646
No, no, no. No chaos.

138
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,330
I don't want the goon squad rolling
in and stealing our shot, you know?

139
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,165
This has gotta be fast and quiet.

140
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,561
Just boom, boom, boom.

141
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,688
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

142
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,042
Surgical.

143
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,568
Surgical. That's what it's gotta be.

144
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,645
So how many guys we got at MDC?

145
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,283
Three, counting Shattuck.
And he makes the schedule now...

146
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,489
...so we can put who we need
where we need them.

147
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,564
All right. So MDC's covered.
What about the rest?

148
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,563
We need G block in Valencia, right?

149
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,365
Our guy's on the night shift.

150
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,851
- Have him pull a double.
- No.

151
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,367
His supervisor's got
some hard-on about OT.

152
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,682
Have him switch with somebody.
Just get it done.

153
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,049
Regardless, you know, we got
enough guys in Valencia right now?

154
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,009
Might have to hire out.

155
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,481
You high?
Mix blood with chuntaros?

156
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,529
- No way.
- No.

157
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,369
There's no need. We got enough.

158
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,923
Hitters ain't the problem. It's that
short walking window after lunch.

159
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,091
Yeah. It's gonna be tight.

160
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,683
Real tight.

161
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,444
I gotta be straight with you, man.
Taking out all these guys is doable.

162
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,244
But hitting them in three separate
jails all within two minutes?

163
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,927
I mean, whacking bin Laden
wasn't this complicated.

164
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,731
Where do you suppose
these come from?

165
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,282
I've seen this one before.

166
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,283
I wonder...

167
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,490
...are they all In some giant
warehouse someplace?

168
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,884
Hey.

169
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,522
It can be done,
just not the way you want it.

170
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,401
It can be done exactly
how I want it.

171
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,326
The only question is,
are you the man to do it?

172
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,048
Figure it out.

173
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,600
That's what I'm paying you for.

174
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,571
Yo, what's going on, man?
What's that alarm?

175
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,285
What's happening?

176
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,770
What are you doing, man?
No, man, please!

177
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,684
No, man! Help me!

178
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,525
Help me! Help!

179
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,284
Help me!

180
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,087
Ball came in my direction,
batter wouldn't even bother running.

181
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,768
Excuse me a second.
Couple more photos.

182
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,086
Yes?

183
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,850
<i>It's done.</i>

184
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,131
<i>New details have emerged
in the spate of jail deaths...</i>

185
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,726
<i>...that rocked central New Mexico
three days ago.</i>

186
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,003
<i>As of yet, no names of victims
have been released...</i>

187
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,642
<i>...but authorities continue to
investigate what appears to be...</i>

188
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,371
<i>...a carefully coordinated
sequence of attacks...</i>

189
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,009
<i>...that occurred within minutes in
three different correctional facilities...</i>

190
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,083
- Is it okay if I turn this off?
- Oh, sure.

191
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,163
I don't want the news on right now.

192
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,603
Hank just pulled up,
and he's not in the best mood.

193
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,889
- Oh, all right. I'll get out of your hair.
- Okay.

194
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,330
Hi, honey.

195
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,481
Dinner will be in about an hour.

196
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,002
And I thought we could have
that chicken you like.

197
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,881
- Or we could order Chinese.
- Sure.

198
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,804
Here we go.

199
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,729
That fun? Play with your toys?

200
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,043
I'll see you in a little bit, okay?
See you in a little bit.

201
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,521
Hey, Hank.
I was just getting ready to leave.

202
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,125
Something to drink?

203
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,122
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

204
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,966
Perfect.

205
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,090
Hi.

206
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,566
- Rocks, right?
- Rocks, yes.

207
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,564
Been thinking about this summer job
I used to have.

208
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,524
Oh, yeah?

209
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,211
Back in college,
I'd spend my days...

210
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,851
...marking trees in the woods
with this...

211
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,561
This orange spray can.

212
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,321
Marking trees?

213
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,245
Yeah. Crews would come in later...

214
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,370
...and find the trees I tagged
and cut them down.

215
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,210
First, you go in and you mark locations
for skid trails and landings.

216
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,090
Then you choose specific trees
all within a selected grid.

217
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,642
Every day...

218
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,803
...I'd go back...

219
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,965
...hike in...

220
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,128
...pick up where I left off.

221
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,971
Oh, it sounds nice...

222
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,367
...being out in the woods all day.

223
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,724
No, it wasn't so great.

224
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,611
I got sunburned.
There were mosquitoes.

225
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,570
I just wanted to make a few bucks.
Buy beer.

226
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,766
Been thinking about that job
more and more lately.

227
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,805
Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.

228
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,922
Tagging trees is a lot better
than chasing monsters.

229
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,127
I used to love to go camping.

230
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,206
- This way.
- Here, baby girl. Come see your brother.

231
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,283
There you go, sweetie. That's it.

232
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,528
Oh, my God! Look at her go!

233
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,321
- Good job! Good job!
- Over here. Peekaboo. This way.

234
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,562
Let's go see your brother.
Let's get him.

235
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,724
Where'd you go?
I can't see you. Where'd you go?

236
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,928
There you are!

237
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,130
You're really good with her.

238
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,566
Come here, my baby girl.

239
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,610
You're gonna be a handful,
aren't you? Yeah.

240
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,684
Mama's gonna get her exercise.

241
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,930
Hey, do you wanna watch a movie?

242
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,044
Hey, Louis.

243
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,084
One moment.

244
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,969
Nothing. What's up?

245
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,408
Oh, Well.

246
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,724
It's so nice to see you smile again.

247
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,330
I mean, you seem good.

248
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,562
Yeah. I'm hanging in there.

249
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,521
To see you laugh like
that just now...

250
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,849
It's such an improvement,
don't you think?

251
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,290
I don't... I don't really...

252
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,208
We've been thinking...

253
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,682
...Hank and I,
that it may be time...

254
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,650
...to take the kids home.

255
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,884
It's been almost
three months, right?

256
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,804
Almost three?

257
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,441
Does Hank not want...?

258
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,206
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God. No. No.

259
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,170
Hank's crazy for these kids.
You know that.

260
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,721
It goes without saying,
we love having them.

261
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,450
And we're always here for you...

262
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,002
...and wanna help you
any way that we can.

263
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,285
But...

264
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,601
We're starting to worry...

265
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,485
...that maybe...

266
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,521
Maybe we're enabling you.

267
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,324
Sweetie, you've had
a lot on your plate...

268
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,530
...and you and Walt have had a lot...

269
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,605
So much to contend with.

270
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,843
I'm so proud of you for going to therapy.
You know that, right?

271
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,521
It can be so helpful,
such a good tool.

272
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,725
And I'm very, very proud of you...

273
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,484
...but I...

274
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,603
We...

275
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,288
Maybe at this point...

276
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,886
...the best way to help
repair the family...

277
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,365
...would be to repair the family,
you know?

278
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,721
Take a drive with me.

279
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,688
Here. I'll get it.

280
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,445
Walt.

281
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,690
This is it.

282
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,880
This is what you've
been working for.

283
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,002
I rented this place and I started
bringing it here because...

284
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,247
...I didn't know what else to do.

285
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,526
I gave up counting it.
I mean, I had to.

286
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,241
It was just so much, so fast.

287
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,528
I tried weighing it.

288
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,489
I figured one bill of any
denomination weighs a gram.

289
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,765
There are 454 grams
to a pound, but...

290
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,401
There's a variety
of denominations, so...

291
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,082
How much is this?

292
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,607
I have no earthly idea.

293
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,008
I truly don't.

294
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,724
I just stack it up...

295
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,402
...keep it dry,
spray it for silverfish.

296
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,328
There is more money here...

297
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,484
...than we could spend
in 10 lifetimes.

298
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,811
I certainly can't launder it,
not with a hundred car washes.

299
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,290
Walt...

300
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,130
...I want my kids back.

301
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,888
I want my life back.

302
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,410
Please tell me.

303
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,844
How much is enough?

304
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,201
How big does this pile have to be?

305
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,449
Shit!

306
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,051
Hi.

307
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,851
Hey.

308
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,364
I hope I'm not disturbing you
or anything.

309
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,965
I tried calling, but...

310
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,363
Yeah. No, I tossed all my burners.

311
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,483
And you didn't answer
your home line.

312
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,563
It's disconnected.

313
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,728
Well, unplugged.

314
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,168
I mean, did you leave
a message, or...?

315
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,805
No.

316
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,321
So, what's up?

317
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,007
No, I was just in the neighbourhood,
so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

318
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,610
You wanna come in, or...?

319
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,891
Sure. Thanks.

320
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,364
You know, I'd offer you
a beer or something...

321
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,248
- ...but, you know, I'm out.
- No, no. No, I'm fine, thanks.

322
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,842
You didn't wind up moving, I see.

323
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,923
Didn't have to.

324
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,651
Saul told me what you did.

325
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,930
Anyways, I'm not in jail.

326
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,567
You aren't either, so there you go.

327
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,805
There was no other option, Jesse.
It had to be done.

328
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,529
I'm not coming back.

329
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,410
I know.

330
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,686
So why are you here, exactly?

331
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,925
It's funny, I...

332
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,765
I saw a Bounder the other day.

333
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,684
- Bounder?
- Yeah.

334
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,650
Our RV? A Bounder?

335
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,090
Oh, you saw the same one as ours?

336
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,323
Yeah. Well, I mean,
within a couple of years, I guess.

337
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,845
Early '80s.

338
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,368
It was certainly in a lot better
shape than our old hunk of junk.

339
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,849
Much nicer paint job.

340
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,601
No bullet holes in the door.

341
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,969
Yeah. That thing
was a nightmare, huh?

342
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,522
Yeah. It was primitive.

343
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,322
You know, whenever
I hit a red light, I used to pray...

344
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,687
...it wouldn't crap out on me.

345
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,365
Yeah.

346
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,967
And then, suddenly,
it would sometimes have that...

347
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,606
That screeching sound
just out of the blue...

348
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,250
...like we hit a pack of cats.

349
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,768
Power-steering belt.
That's what that was.

350
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,929
You know, I always had this...

351
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,003
This whole system.

352
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,481
Strategy to not let it idle too low.

353
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,962
Remember that time we ran out of gas
coming back from a cook?

354
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,009
The gauge. It always said half-full.

355
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,370
You walked three miles with a jerrican
while I waited on the side of the road...

356
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,882
...praying the whole time
that no cop would show up...

357
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,644
...no Good Samaritan.

358
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,564
God.

359
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,690
We had money.

360
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,569
Why'd we keep it?

361
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,803
Why did we have to have
the world's shittiest RV?

362
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,883
Inertia?

363
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,408
Yeah.

364
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,244
Inertia.

365
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,722
So, hey, you know,
I gotta get going.

366
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,245
- Me too.
- I'm meeting friends.

367
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,721
I gotta get going as well.

368
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,969
I left something for you.

369
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,564
Hey.

370
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,124
I'm out.

371
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,804
I'm out.

372
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,761
With some big earrings,
it could be really nice.

373
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,366
- Perhaps some big hoops.
- I do indeed.

374
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,205
I feel like I want to mix it up
with my hair this summer.

375
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,681
- I don't know, like colours...
- I don't know. Coins.

376
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,842
Did you have a coin collection?
Did you?

377
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,611
I've heard it's very therapeutic.

378
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,003
Coins and baseball cards.
Those were the ones.

379
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,447
You can play around with it,
take them in and out.

380
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,409
Not enough hours in the day, right?

381
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,245
- There's not enough hours.
- My hairstylist told me...

382
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,607
...to take prenatal vitamins.

383
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,205
For your hair?

384
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,601
He said they work,
so I figured why not?

385
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,560
Oh, Flynn, could you put some more
sunscreen on Holly?

386
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,290
Yeah. Is it over there?

387
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,084
- Yeah, it's right here.
- Okay.

388
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,881
- Especially for a home brew, though.
- Paba-free. That's good.

389
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,771
- I don't know why it would be bad.
- Yeah. Me neither.

390
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,003
Oh, do you...? I used to squeeze
lemon juice in my hair.

391
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,406
You remember that?

392
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,325
You wanted to be
a beach bum so badly.

393
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,005
I did.

394
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,162
You and your stiff hair.

395
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,120
- Stiff? Whose stiff y? What?
- Hey, hey.

396
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,930
I was interested
to see you get into that.

397
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,004
- It's like chemistry.
- Borage oil is supposed to be good.

398
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,162
- Better than flaxseed?
- I don't know.

399
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,484
- That's cool. I like your style.
- There is no Christmas.

400
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,723
- Maybe I should brew up a batch.
- Schraderbrau?

401
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,041
- Yeah.
- I vote yes.

402
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,931
- I second that.
- Well, there you go. It's unanimous.

403
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,971
Well, who am I to fly in the face
of public demand, right?

404
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,208
All right.

405
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,441
Anybody want anything?
You want anything?

406
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,047
- No, I'm good. I'm good, thank you.
- Yeah? All right.

407
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,168
Does it look glossier?

408
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,210
Do I have a halo?

409
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,408
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

410
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,803
Yeah? Try not to put any
of the sunscreen on her fingers.

411
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,687
<i>"To W.W. My star,
my perfect silence. "</i>

412
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,081
W.W.

413
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,962
I mean, who do you figure that is?

414
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,849
Woodrow Wilson?

415
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,562
Willy Wonka?

416
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,929
Walter White?

417
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,567
You got me.

418
00:46:33,305 --> 00:47:33,686
