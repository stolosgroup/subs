00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:52,487
Hey, Captain America.

3
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,826
-What's up, brother?
-Hey, bro.

4
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,094
This is stupid.

5
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:21,182
-You got a better idea?
-Okay, fun. Whatever.

6
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,519
-So when do we, you know?
-We don't, for now.

7
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,938
No cooking until things settle down.

8
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:31,026
Settle down? l thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

9
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,361
Look, l just put my family
through an ordeal...

10
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:38,033
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? l can't--

11
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,827
That's too expensive.

12
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,881
Look, l can't leave my house...

13
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,467
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

14
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,510
I need time to mend fences.

15
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,556
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

16
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:05,393
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

17
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,323
That's $600.

18
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,908
Okay, what about the rest?

19
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,579
-Rest of what?
-Half your money's mine.

20
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,998
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

21
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,377
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

22
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,545
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

23
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,632
Okay. lf it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

24
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:45,266
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

25
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,187
As for now, no contact. Understood?

26
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,774
Where are you going?

27
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,777
I leave first.

28
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,048
-Walt!
-ln the kitchen.

29
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,731
Hey.

30
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:38,069
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

31
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,573
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

32
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,324
Juice is on the table.

33
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
What?

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,877
-Good morning, honey.
-Hey, Mom.

35
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,629
Dad's cooking breakfast.

36
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,674
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

37
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,137
Nice? Follow me.

38
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,348
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

39
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,518
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

40
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:14,856
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

41
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:18,860
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

42
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,405
I wanted to.

43
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:27,577
-Grapefruit juice?
-Yes, please. Thanks.

44
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,331
There you go. Honey?

45
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,875
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

46
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,589
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

47
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,341
-Yeah.
-There you go.

48
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,052
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

49
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,222
-No.
-Yes, absolutely.

50
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,016
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

51
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,061
...l would put them up against
any current band you can name.

52
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,813
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

53
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,150
-That's besides the point.
-Have a good day, honey.

54
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,902
You too.

55
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:05,406
-Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
-Boz Scaggs.

56
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,118
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

57
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,328
-Bye.
-You're welcome.

58
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,121
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

59
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,748
All right.

60
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,046
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

61
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,507
We have failed as parents.

62
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,217
Come to think of it...

63
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,053
-...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
-Stop it.

64
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,431
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. l'll get it. Yeah.

65
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,058
Thank you.

66
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,687
Hey, listen...

67
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,106
...in the calendar section...

68
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,775
...all week long...

69
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:45,321
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

70
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,908
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

71
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,619
-...and that sort of thing.
-Yeah?

72
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:57,667
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might....

73
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,712
I mean, l'll go with you if you like.

74
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,267
Oh, and...

75
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,396
...you know, l was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

76
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,940
You were wondering
if l had a second cell phone.

77
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,651
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

78
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,990
...and l think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

79
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:35,663
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

80
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,000
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

81
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,171
And, well, the weird thing is that...

82
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,175
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

83
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,511
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

84
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,349
...if you ask me.
But l think that was probably it.

85
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,685
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

86
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,188
...other than the phone ring, but....

87
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,566
They so overcomplicate
these things.

88
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:09,197
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that l lost it.

89
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,575
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

90
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:16,621
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

91
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,874
...we can stop by,
and l can get a new cell phone.

92
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:38,226
Skyler?

93
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,237
-Ready?
-Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,957
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,260
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

96
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,305
...pursuant to Section 47-8-1 3...

97
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,474
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

98
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,601
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

99
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,355
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 871 04.

100
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,692
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,445
-lt's your Aunt Ginny's house.
-And she gave it to me.

102
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,155
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,116
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

104
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,578
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:24,499
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,126
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,004
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,507
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:36,302
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,805
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,853
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

112
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,857
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

113
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,026
...so you're welcome.

114
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,403
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,531
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,618
I was worried, so l went
over there and I let myself in...

117
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:05,206
...and l found your laboratory.

118
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,211
You guys have your own key?

119
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,179
Manufacture of a Schedule lI
controlled substance...

120
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,140
...is a second degree felony.

121
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,602
Under federal asset seizure...

122
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,981
...the government can take
the entire house.

123
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,860
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

124
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,571
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

125
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,199
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

126
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,369
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,580
Otherwise,
your parents have authorized me...

128
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,208
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,004
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,092
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,470
Come on.

132
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,721
-Hi.
-Hey.

133
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,316
-l fixed the garage door.
-Great.

134
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,943
Yeah.

135
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,820
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

136
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,572
Okay.

137
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,494
-Where were you today?
-Out.

138
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,217
Is everything okay?

139
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,221
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:44,365
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

141
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,450
...the cancer support group.

142
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,494
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,372
Yeah.

144
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,500
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,670
You were right
on the money about that.

146
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,172
It's good to, you know...

147
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,134
...talk about things.

148
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,761
I think that's great.

149
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,475
Yeah.

150
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,837
Jesse.

151
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,925
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,636
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,223
Yeah, no, l've just been...

154
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,060
...pretty busy. How'd you--?

155
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,022
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,566
Hey, listen.

157
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,986
So l've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

158
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:08,616
...we had the other day,
and l completely get why...

159
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:12,161
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and....

160
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:16,082
-lt's not just your father, Jesse.
-No, I know. l know. I know.

161
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:21,504
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

162
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,673
...which is why l wanted to talk
to you. You know, l've been...

163
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,302
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,971
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now....

165
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,683
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

166
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,646
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:42,191
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,611
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,196
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,574
-l thought it was just a wake-up call.
-We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,993
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,496
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,833
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,336
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,796
I earned this.

176
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,340
You did not make
her lunch every day.

177
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,300
What did you do, huh?

178
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,178
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,681
-Don't start with me.
-Now what?

180
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:17,184
You've decided to, l don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,646
Great family, Mom.

182
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,775
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:39,290
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,334
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,919
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,214
Hey, where am l supposed to go?

187
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,718
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:57,224
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:02,563
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,692
Jeez.

191
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,247
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,209
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,752
Come in and say hello.

194
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,838
Hey, we've got omelets.
You want an omelet?

195
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,089
No, I'm good.

196
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,259
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chilies.

197
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,345
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,263
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,267
-Who's Flynn?
-Flynn.

200
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,436
He's your....

201
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,484
-Flynn?
-Yeah.

202
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,277
So?

203
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,364
So? Nothing.

204
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,200
-You ready?
-Like it.

205
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,118
-Bye, Mr. White.
-Okay.

206
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,497
Bye.

207
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,840
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

208
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,890
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

209
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,352
I don't know. lt's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,437
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,648
Don't take it personally.

212
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,818
He wants his own identity.

213
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,909
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,579
-About the blackout?
-Louis is his friend, Walt...

215
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,374
...and your disappearance
upset him.

216
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,881
Hey, I made omelets.

217
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,634
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,386
Where you going?

219
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,973
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,853
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:14,028
-White residence.
-Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?

222
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,407
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

223
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,744
-l know, but there's a problem.
-I don't care. We agreed.

224
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,039
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,541
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,628
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,716
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,056
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,682
Out.

230
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,771
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,981
Skyler.

232
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,490
-What?
-Yo, l get l shouldn't call...

233
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,159
...but l'm in a situation here,
and l need my money.

234
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,078
I just gave you $600.

235
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,579
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

236
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,873
...but that was
before my housing situation...

237
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,209
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

238
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,419
You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you?

239
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:13,921
-What? No.
-Yes.

240
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,214
-No.
-Look, Jesse...

241
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,965
...your problems are just that:

242
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,842
Your problems.

243
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,762
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,849
-When the moment is right, I will call.
-Mr. White, you're not listening.

245
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,268
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,448
You son of a bitch.

247
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,163
Son of a bitch.

248
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,126
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,295
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:59,133
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,719
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,595
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:48,015
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. l'm serious.

254
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,350
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,394
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,607
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

257
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,941
Two nights tops.

258
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,569
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

259
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,280
Yeah. l'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

260
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,825
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,161
Yeah.

262
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,539
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,707
Too hot.

264
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,960
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,587
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,298
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

267
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,634
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,639
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

269
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,059
Damn. l'm hating, man.

270
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:35,187
That's why we need to get the
Hammer up and running, you know?

271
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,982
-Get you out of the house.
-How awesome would that be?

272
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,859
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,571
I cut all the green parts off like you--
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:48,367
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,701
Get back in the scene.

276
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,746
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

277
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:56,041
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

278
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,918
...and then you take--

279
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,712
Mommy's home.

280
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,757
-Hi.
-Hello.

281
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,426
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

282
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,430
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,558
-Hey, Jesse.
-Hey.

284
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,269
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,856
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,463
Yeah, l used to not like carrots too.

287
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:51,513
Hey, Hen, l think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

288
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:04,276
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:09,114
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,741
You got other people to call?

291
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,327
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,662
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,333
Yo, in-laws?

294
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,337
-Sucks to be you, P.
-Yeah. Yeah, l know, huh?

295
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,048
Here.

296
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,674
See you, man.

297
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,885
It's good to see you.

298
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:35,182
Look, l'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and--

299
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,352
Look, l already called Badger,
all right? l called everyone.

300
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,021
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,862
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,782
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,552
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,847
-You cannot be serious.
-Hey.

306
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,226
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,436
Not cool.

308
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:38,425
-Morning.
-Oh, hey.

309
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,010
Morning.

310
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,346
Where did--? Where did Mom go?

311
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,850
Out.

312
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:55,317
Where's breakfast?

313
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,614
Hey.

314
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,658
Let's go do something.

315
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,536
Like what?

316
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,581
Something fun.

317
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,377
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:18,632
-ls your foot on the-- Okay. Good.
-Yeah. I got it.

319
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,011
Good.

320
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,848
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,644
Good. I like the hands at 1 0 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,146
Okay, let's slow down here...

323
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,483
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:39,611
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,530
-Sorry about that.
-That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,660
-Much better than last time, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,162
Has he?

328
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,706
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,959
Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.

330
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,586
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,631
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,551
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,388
Right hand.

334
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:09,432
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,897
-Are you using both feet?
-Yeah.

336
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,274
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,610
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

338
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:23,530
-Why not?
-Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:28,493
-Just stop, please. Right. All right.
-Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,913
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,208
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,127
-All right.
-Okay?

343
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:45,135
Okay, just-- You don't have to--
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,221
Just-- That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:52,225
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,686
Okay.

347
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,273
Don't-- Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,984
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,902
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

350
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,571
I can't do this.

351
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,948
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,993
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,121
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:16,750
All right. We'll get this. l promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,127
-All right.
-Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,215
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,177
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:32,057
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,601
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,603
-Braking.
-You're using both feet again.

361
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,105
-lt's not stopping.
-That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,107
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:47,614
Okay.

364
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,033
That's one way to stop.

365
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,786
I told you.

366
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,454
Flynn.

367
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,526
-Hands up, asshole!
-Yo, yo, it's cool.

368
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,361
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,656
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? lt's Jesse.

370
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,701
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,537
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,664
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:23,877
-You smell like shit.
-lt's a long story.

374
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,588
So l fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

375
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,006
...750 for the repair.

376
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,426
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

377
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:36,389
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,016
Okay.

379
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,310
Here's the thing.

380
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,895
I can't pay you today.

381
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,480
But l can pay you this week,
all right?

382
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:50,695
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1 750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:53,823
-l thought your word was your bond.
-lt totally is.

384
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:57,660
Definitely. l just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,206
But l will, soon.

386
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,625
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,961
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,797
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,509
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:17,263
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,935
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all l got left.

392
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,479
Please, all right? l really....

393
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:30,485
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,448
Clovis, come on.

395
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:57,595
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,515
There's something called
methylamine. Me-- Meth....

397
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:03,142
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,604
I don't know. l banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,655
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,997
Hey! Hey!

401
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,366
Skyler.

402
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,208
Louis took Walt to school.

403
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,296
I was thinking maybe...

404
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,965
...this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:42,909
I dreamt that l owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,496
In lreland.

407
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,209
Weird.

408
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,421
Sounds weird.

409
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,354
I wanted to apologize...

410
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,564
...for everything.

411
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,901
My...

412
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,446
...desire for privacy.

413
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:24,283
My emotional...

414
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,869
...unavailability.

415
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,582
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,087
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

417
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,966
...and for that...

418
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,718
...l'm very sorry.

419
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,639
I love you.

420
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,393
And l love this family.

421
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,813
And l just...

422
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,190
...want to make sure that...

423
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,318
...we don't lose contact.

424
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,786
Thank you.

425
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,663
Okay.

426
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,420
I agree.

427
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,520
Is that it?

428
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:37,148
God.

429
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,525
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

430
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,278
-Do what?
-This.

431
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,280
Not talking to me.

432
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,992
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

433
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,453
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

434
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,788
...so let's talk about it.

435
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,757
Oh, God.

436
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:08,012
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

437
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,516
...that l'm up to something.

438
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,646
-Like what?
-l have no idea, Skyler.

439
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:20,066
What, that l'm having an affair?
Is that it? ls that what you think?

440
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,318
Is that why you asked me
about the....

441
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:25,905
Some other phone? Because
you think that I'm being unfaithful?

442
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,951
-l don't know.
-Okay.

443
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,036
So ask me.

444
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:34,997
Why?

445
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:38,543
-Would you even tell me?
-Yes. I would.

446
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,586
Of course, I would.

447
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:46,050
And no. l'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

448
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,928
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

449
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,598
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. l'm not having an affair.

450
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,600
I heard you, Walt.

451
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,936
You're not having an affair.

452
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,771
Congratulations.

453
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,399
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

454
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:02,692
Great job.

455
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,610
What is this? What do I have to do?

456
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:08,739
-l'm trying to talk to you, and you--
-Okay, so talk, Walt.

457
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,578
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

458
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:17,748
You want to know
what you have to do?

459
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:22,003
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

460
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,047
Today. No more excuses.

461
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:29,260
No more apologies.
No more of these-- These obvious...

462
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:32,054
...desperate breakfasts.

463
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,559
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

464
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,311
Good.

465
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,396
Then tell me.

466
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,482
Now.

467
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,662
Tell you what?

468
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,211
Skyler.

469
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:10,343
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,855
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,525
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,741
What the--?

473
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:52,843
-Yo, l'm really sorry, okay?
-What is wrong with you?

474
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,554
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,183
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

476
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:03,187
-...kleptomaniac douchebags.
-Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,189
No, look. l know this isn't a optimal--

478
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:09,527
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:13,948
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? l'm really asking.

480
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,118
-Nothing. l'm sorry. l just--
-What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,204
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,748
-l don't know.
-You know why you don't know?

483
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,126
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,045
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:31,924
I said l was sorry. l just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,552
Your half?

487
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,263
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:40,015
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,519
Why should I be penalized
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,688
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

491
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,690
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:50,943
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:54,363
I've been meaning to ask,
because l'm the producer, right?

494
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:58,784
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:04,206
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

496
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:07,960
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re--

497
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:30,065
Do it.

498
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:01,764
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,426
Want some breakfast?

500
00:45:21,305 --> 00:46:21,326
