00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:04,999
Hello, Carol.

3
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:06,559
Oh, my God, Skyler.

4
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:08,760
Okay, I'll take the pink one.

5
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,378
- It's a princess cupcake.
- Ooh.

6
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,813
- Skyler?
- I know, right?

7
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,399
Well, actually,
they were my idea,

8
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,900
so you are all welcome.

9
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:17,402
You are the devil.

10
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:22,407
Hey, buddy.
Ready for a cold one?

11
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:25,693
Nah. I'm not feeling
hundred percent.

12
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,495
- Oh, no.
- I hope it's not something you ate.

13
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,364
No, no, I just...

14
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:31,499
We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.

15
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:33,067
Yeah.

16
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,085
Uh, no, I'm good.

17
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,204
I-I-I...
We need to shove off.

18
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,006
Okay, yeah.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

19
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,375
I'm sorry, Skyler.
I hate to leave you with...

20
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,594
No, no, don't worry about it.
I have plenty of help.

21
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:45,430
- And by that, she means me.
- That is correct.

22
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:48,016
- Holly can help.
- Let's go say good-bye.

23
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,917
Let's go send them
on their way.

24
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,919
- Let's say good-bye.
- Yes.

25
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:53,921
- Too long.
- Mwah. Say, "Bye, Auntie."

26
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,723
Bye, sweetie. Bye-bye.

27
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:58,977
Hey, and you know it's been about a
hundred years since we've been bowling.

28
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:01,429
- Well, then, how about Thursday night?
- Oh, that sounds great.

29
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:03,764
Oh, thank you for having us.

30
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:06,767
Hey. You okay to drive?

31
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah.

32
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:12,373
All right.
Well, feel better.

33
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:16,995
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank."
Bye-bye.

34
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:20,916
Bye-bye.

35
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,385
Bye, Aunt Marie.
Can you wave bye?

36
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:24,730
All right, let's get started
on those dishes. Come on.

37
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:28,491
- You.
- No, you. - You. Washing, okay?

38
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:32,060
- I'll dry. You wash.
- Hello, Carol.

39
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:35,313
Oh, hi, Walt.

40
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,849
Europe.
I can't believe it.

41
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,319
- Were you there when she said that?
- Yeah.

42
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:43,488
You okay?
Your stomach okay?

43
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:44,805
Yeah, oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

44
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:49,744
Okay.
God. Jesus, Europe.

45
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:52,447
I just... And, you know,
where they were

46
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,315
three or four months ago.

47
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,983
Oh, she was talking about it.

48
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,002
It sounds like it's...

49
00:07:58,037 --> 00:07:59,537
We need to go to Europe.

50
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,039
- We could go.
- Yeah.

51
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,758
It'd have to be, like,
a business trip, you know.

52
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,793
It could, um...
We could go to Italy.

53
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,179
To, um, Lake Como.

54
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:09,597
It's "Como," right?

55
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,332
...Like Mario Cuomo?

56
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,644
Hank. Hank?

57
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:23,678
Hank?

58
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,980
Baby, you okay?

59
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:27,649
Hank!

60
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:34,188
Oh, my God.
Hank!

61
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:38,243
Hank! Hank! Oh, my God!

62
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:41,696
Hank, are you...

63
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:43,915
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- I'm good.

64
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:47,585
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

65
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,588
Okay. You okay?
Just take a breath.

66
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,423
Oh, God, sweetheart.

67
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:53,891
It was an accident.
It happens.

68
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,427
I'll make the appointment.
All you have to do is show up.

69
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:59,714
For what? Three hours
in the Emergency Room?

70
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:00,898
All for nothing?

71
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,067
All they did was rule out
a heart attack.

72
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:05,486
- What if it happens again?
- It's not gonna happen again.

73
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,773
How can you know that? You can't even
say what it was in the first place.

74
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:10,241
Marie, baby, I'm okay.

75
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:13,861
I'm fine. Trust me.
Discussion over.

76
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,531
- And do not tell Skyler.
- What? Why?

77
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:18,700
Just don't.

78
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:21,119
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about. Hank?

79
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:26,067
<i>Hola,</i> Mariano.

80
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,101
Morning.

81
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:29,136
Luis. Enrique.

82
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,072
Oh, <i>feliz cumpleaסos,</i> Enrique.

83
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:35,660
Hi.

84
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:39,864
Here you go.

85
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,982
There's complimentary
coffee inside.

86
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,669
Have an A-1 day.

87
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,871
Air fresheners
are high margin, right?

88
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:48,956
At 30 cents wholesale, yeah.

89
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,009
Right. So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display,

90
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:54,345
separate the food scents
from the nature scents.

91
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,933
I mean, does bubble gum belong
anywhere near ocean spray? No.

92
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,636
And pine is still
our biggest seller, right?

93
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,522
So maybe we move that
over to the cash register

94
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:07,007
by the five-hour
energy drink.

95
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,526
Sure. Fine.

96
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,647
Yeah, yeah.
Come here.

97
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:15,516
Speaking of the business,

98
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,819
the story comes first.

99
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:20,238
The story is is that
we are car wash owners,

100
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,572
pure and simple.

101
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:25,243
But if our story is that
the car wash is successful,

102
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:28,529
what do successful
car wash owners do?

103
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:31,699
They buy more car washes.

104
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:36,170
Listen. Skyler.

105
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,890
We'll be laundering
that money for years.

106
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:40,892
Decades.

107
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:43,895
Wouldn't two
be better than one?

108
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:47,932
Well, there's gentle hands
over by Kirtland.

109
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:50,017
I do love that location.

110
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:54,439
I'll think about it.

111
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,157
Yeah. Right. Right.

112
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:58,443
To be continued.

113
00:11:58,494 --> 00:11:59,660
Okay.

114
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:04,832
Good morning.
Welcome to A-1.

115
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,951
Just the regular, please.

116
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:09,737
Well, we're having a special
on hand wax... 21.99...

117
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:12,840
if you're interested in getting
rid of those water spots.

118
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,542
Just the regular is fine.

119
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:18,412
Okay. Well, there's complimentary
coffee inside while you're waiting.

120
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,765
Have an A-1 day.

121
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:27,472
Please give this to
your car wash professional,

122
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:29,774
and have an A-1 day.

123
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,264
68%. And falling.

124
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:39,317
Good morning. May I have
your ticket, please?

125
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:43,204
I knew there would be
a drop in quality, but 68%?

126
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:47,107
This is not what I agreed to.

127
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,794
I left a viable operation.

128
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,796
The rest was up to you.

129
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,798
May I have your ticket, please?

130
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,883
I'm only asking for a few days.

131
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:58,469
A week at most.
Call it a tutorial.

132
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:00,621
That's the standard wash.

133
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,975
Fix this.
Get the ship back on course.

134
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,978
We'll make it worth your while.

135
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:10,481
That'll be 14.95, please.

136
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,769
Listen, this is
a complicated situation.

137
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:17,021
There are a lot
of moving parts.

138
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:20,575
None of which are my concern.

139
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,529
You're putting me
in a box here.

140
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,747
You know what could happen.

141
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,536
Again, none of my concern.

142
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:33,170
There's your change.

143
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:35,456
And if you'll hand this
to your car wash professional.

144
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,491
And have an A-1 day.

145
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:45,600
- Listen...
- It'll only be a few more minutes.

146
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:48,168
There's some complimentary
coffee, if you like.

147
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,534
What's up?

148
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,370
Just wondering
who washes a rental car.

149
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,376
Walt, who was that?

150
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:18,749
She's a former
business associate

151
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,918
who wants me to go back.

152
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,904
And I won't.

153
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,622
Enrique, this one's finished.

154
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,208
<i>Terminado. Gracias.</i>

155
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,544
Get out of here.
Now.

156
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:51,682
- Excuse me?
- Never come back here.

157
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:54,301
Do you understand me?

158
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,887
- I...
- Go.

159
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,579
Hey.
Hey.

160
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,116
Oh, thanks.

161
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,068
Are you going in today?

162
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:28,871
- Uh, no. Uh-uh.
- Good.

163
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,257
Just, you ow, stay out of there
till you're sure you're better.

164
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,758
- Yeah.
- Stay home and rest.

165
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,760
- Don't even think about work.
- Okay.

166
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:37,379
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

167
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:53,979
- Morning, Mrs. Schrader.
- Hey, guys.

168
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,315
- What's going on?
- Just dropping these off, ma'am.

169
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:58,867
- Where would you like them?
- Bring them around to the garage, guys.

170
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:02,204
I got it.
Have a good day.

171
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:05,607
You too.

172
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:08,777
Boss, Janice said to tell you

173
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:11,046
a few of them
might not have indexes.

174
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,880
We could give you a hand
sorting through them.

175
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,500
No, I got it. Thanks.

176
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,804
All right.

177
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:21,851
- See you, boss.
- Okay.

178
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:25,079
Okay, um...

179
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,854

Dude, you are tripping.

203
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:28,168
I'm not dead. I'm on
the starship <i>Enterprise,</i>

204
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:31,922
macking on Yeoman Rand, while the
Andorian with the Disrupter's

205
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,224
back on Talos Four or whatever.

206
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,727
What do you think
all those sparkles and shit are?

207
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:38,728
The transporters are breaking
you apart, man.

208
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,981
Down to your molecules
and bones.

209
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:42,599
They're making a copy.

210
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:45,102
That dude who comes out on the
other side, he's not you.

211
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:46,987
He's a Color Xerox.

212
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,573
So you're telling me every time
Kirk went into the transport,

213
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,442
he was killing himself?

214
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:55,395
So over the whole series,
there was, like, 147 Kirks?

215
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:57,164
At least.

216
00:18:57,198 --> 00:19:01,234
Dude, yo, why do you think McCoy
never likes to beam nowhere?

217
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:03,236
'Cause he's a doctor, bitch.

218
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:05,906
Look it up.
It's science.

219
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,010
I ever tell you about
my <i>Star Trek</i> script?

220
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:11,912
<i>Star Trek</i> script?

221
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,348
Yeah. I gotta
write it down is all.

222
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:19,753
The <i>Enterprise</i>
is five parsecs out of Rigel 12.

223
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,940
Nothing's going on,
Neutral Zone is quiet,

224
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:24,558
the crew is bored,

225
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:27,027
so they put on
a pie-eating contest.

226
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:29,841
The whole crew's in the galley.
They're eating tulaberry pies...

227
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:30,614
Tulaberry?

228
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,866
Tulaberries.
From Gamma Quadrant, yo.

229
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,601
That's <i>Voyager,</i> dude.

230
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:37,788
Okay, blueberries then.
They're eating blueberry pies

231
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:41,291
as fast as the replicator
can churn them out.

232
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:45,879
Finally,
it's down to just three...

233
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,382
Kirk, Spock, and Chekov.

234
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,634
Okay, Spock always wins
these things.

235
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:53,220
How is Spock
gonna beat Kirk, yo?

236
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:55,889
Spock's like a toothbrush.
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

237
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:59,626
Spock has total vulcan control
over his digestion.

238
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:01,795
- You wanna hear this or not?
- Yeah, yeah, go.

239
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:05,232
Okay, finally, Kirk...
he can't take it anymore.

240
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:09,302
He yorks. Now it's just
down to Chekov and Spock.

241
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,988
But Chekov, you see,

242
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:15,242
he's got a whole fat stack
of Quatloos riding on this,

243
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:18,245
and he has figured out
a way to win.

244
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,531
He's got Scotty back
in the transporter room,

245
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:22,533
locked in on Chekov's stomach.

246
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:25,652
Every time Chekov eats a pie,
Scotty beams it right out of him.

247
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,254
Where is he sending them?
The toilet?

248
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:28,872
Space.

249
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,175
There's blueberries
just floating out there,

250
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,377
frozen, because it's in space,

251
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:36,764
and Chekov is just
shoveling them into his mouth,

252
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,933
and Spock's like, "I can't believe
this Russian is defeating me."

253
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:43,837
Meanwhile, Scotty's in the transporter
room fiddling with levers,

254
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:46,006
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in,

255
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:48,525
and she's got, you know,
her big pointies.

256
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,528
- And Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.
- No.

257
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:55,682
Chekov screams. He sprays
blood out of his mouth.

258
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,735
Scotty beamed his guts
into space!

259
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:02,022
No way!

260
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,225
Hey, man, where you going?
You're missing the best part.

261
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,211
Just fill this out.
Bring it back to me.

262
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:27,764
Yo.

263
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:32,402
Yo!

264
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:39,392
Ohhh.

265
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:10,524
You know you can't
smoke that up in here.

266
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:20,868
Yeah. Jesse Pinkman's
out here smoking pot.

267
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:23,103
Give me a break, man.

268
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:30,610
Pinkman, he'll see you now.

269
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:33,947
Woody Harrelson,
live and in person.

270
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:35,949
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

271
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:38,468
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
Don't be doing that.

272
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:40,787
Uh, sorry to keep you
on ice out there, kid.

273
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:43,290
If I'd known it was you,
well...

274
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,509
Francesca.
I've warned her before.

275
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,845
One more time,
and it's back to the DMV.

276
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:53,466
So, uh,
are we on our own today?

277
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:55,135
Barn door open.

278
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:57,637
"Barn door"?

279
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:58,989
Oh.

280
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:01,491
So, uh, how is the maestro?

281
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,493
Things have been quiet
on this end.

282
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,195
I haven't seen him.

283
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:08,148
Just as well, probably.

284
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,650
That whole thing
in the jails...

285
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,452
I mean, when they start
to whack the lawyers,

286
00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:13,921
that's when I draw the line.

287
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:18,342
This goes to
Kaylee Ehrmantraut,

288
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:24,298
and that goes
to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.

289
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:28,468
315 East Pueblo.
It's up in White Horse.

290
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:30,687
It's two and a half million each.

291
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:33,190
A total of five.

292
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:36,727
Mr. and Mrs., uh, who?

293
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:39,279
Drew Sharp's parents.

294
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:42,783
Drew Sharp... that's the kid on TV.
The missing, uh...

295
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:46,153
So but why would you, uh...
Scratch that.

296
00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:48,038
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

297
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:51,742
Uh, thing is,
what those folks want

298
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:53,410
is to know what happened
to their boy.

299
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:55,245
Sack full of cash
on their doorstep...

300
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:57,748
that's just gonna
raise more questions.

301
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,718
Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
That's Mike's granddaughter?

302
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:05,205
- So this is Mike's money?
- It's mine.

303
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:07,207
It's your money.
Okay.

304
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:10,002
And you're giving it
to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...

305
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:11,960
It's what Mike wanted.

306
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:16,650
So you and Mike, uh...

307
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:18,718
You've been in touch?

308
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:26,743
So we're just
talking about charity?

309
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:28,912
Yeah.

310
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:31,281
Okay, look.
You know, um,

311
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:34,951
shelling out money to the ex
and her little boy... I kinda get it.

312
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:37,170
I mean, kinda. But this...

313
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:38,672
This is a bridge too far.

314
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:40,374
I'm sorry to say, kid,

315
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:44,244
but you're still gonna be
two miracles short of sainthood.

316
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:50,350
Brass tacks, okay?
My job is to advise.

317
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:54,221
And my advice is...
Come on, already.

318
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:56,473
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue,

319
00:24:56,524 --> 00:24:58,725
and you better believe
his family's on the radar.

320
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,310
A couple million bucks
shows up,

321
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:02,312
they're gonna snatch it
<i>tout de suite.</i>

322
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:04,398
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

323
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:06,599
What are you
you going for a hat trick?

324
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:08,902
- I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
- No, no, no!

325
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:10,487
I was just...
I was thinking out loud.

326
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:12,989
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

327
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,410
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I... I live to serve.

328
00:25:19,547 --> 00:25:21,882
And, kid, you might
wanna think about

329
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,834
cleaning up a little,
getting some rest.

330
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,286
- You've looked better.
- Just get it done.

331
00:25:33,627 --> 00:25:37,230
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

332
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,633
Yeah, there's a problem.

333
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:43,470
There's five million of them
here in my office.

334
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:47,524
No. No. Don't.
Just hold onto it.

335
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:52,312
Yes. Ye...

336
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,114
Yes.

337
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:56,149
Calm down.

338
00:25:58,002 --> 00:25:59,786
I'll handle it.

339
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,220
Dיjב vu, huh?

340
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,924
Jesus.

341
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,976
All right, look.

342
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:10,513
You wanna talk me through this?

343
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:12,898
What you were thinking?

344
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:18,487
What you asked Saul to do?
I mean, come on.

345
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:20,856
It's just nonsensical.

346
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,451
I mean, do you...

347
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,588
You have any explanation
at all?

348
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,160
What?

349
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:44,880
It's like you said.
It's...

350
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:47,049
It's blood money.

351
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,768
I s...

352
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:53,723
Jeez. Okay. Yes. All right.

353
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:57,226
I said that. I did.

354
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:01,447
But it was in...
in the heat of the moment.

355
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:04,450
I was trying to win
an argument, all right?

356
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:08,371
And I was wrong.

357
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:10,573
This is your money.

358
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,958
Come on.
You've earned it.

359
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,881
Drew Sharp.

360
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:40,569
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

361
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,691
But, son...

362
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:49,395
you need to stop focusing

363
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:52,164
on the darkness behind you.

364
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,533
The past is the past.

365
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:02,208
Nothing can change
what we've done.

366
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,178
But now that's over.

367
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:10,099
You're out,

368
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,301
and so am I.

369
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:17,773
That's right.
I'm done.

370
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,611
I've been out
for about a month.

371
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:28,150
And there is nothing left
for us to do

372
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:32,988
except to try to live...

373
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:37,076
ordinary, decent lives.

374
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:55,060
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

375
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,983
She needs someone
looking after her.

376
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:07,137
Mike is perfectly capable

377
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:09,857
of looking after
his own granddaughter.

378
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:14,978
I don't think so.

379
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:17,948
I don't think he is capable.

380
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,201
I don't think he's coming back.

381
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,587
What...
what are you saying?

382
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,509
You doing what you did...

383
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:31,211
offing Mike's guys?

384
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:34,214
If he was out there,

385
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,267
you would have to look over your
shoulder for the rest of your life,

386
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,269
and that's not
how you do things.

387
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,271
So I think he's dead,

388
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,892
and I think you know that.

389
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:49,730
I don't know that.

390
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,368
I don't.

391
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,572
Listen to me.

392
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,825
I did not kill Mike.

393
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,362
The last time that I saw him,

394
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,131
he had his bag...
the one that I brought him...

395
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,467
and he got into his car,
and he drove away.

396
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,170
And for all I know,
he is alive and well.

397
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,093
And if... and if
he does come back,

398
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,764
and he doesn't understand
why I had to do what I did...

399
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,818
well, then, that's on me.

400
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,941
Jesse...

401
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,946
I need you to believe this.

402
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:45,836
It's not true.
It's just not.

403
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:52,709
So he's out there.
He's okay.

404
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,578
Yes.

405
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,680
Mike is fine.

406
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,182
Wherever he is.

407
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,936
We both know that
he can take care of himself.

408
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:06,106
And he's certainly capable

409
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,142
to provide for
his own family, okay?

410
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,448
Jesse?

411
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,702
I need you to believe me.

412
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,743
Yeah. Like you said.

413
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,746
He's alive.

414
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,950
Yeah.

415
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,888
Mike's alive.

416
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:46,463
Absolutely.

417
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,939
Well, you've gotta
have a college counselor.

418
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,407
Are they bringing in
someone new?

419
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,975
I don't know.

420
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:00,694
Um, maybe she'll be back.

421
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,913
And what if she's not?
What are you supposed to do?

422
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,115
I mean, what's Louis gonna do?

423
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,784
- He's... he's not worried.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

424
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:10,671
What's there to worry about?
It's only college, right?

425
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:12,339
Right.

426
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:14,758
College.
Nothing more important.

427
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,327
Oh. You know, Uncle Hank's
still not feeling well,

428
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:19,963
so bowling's off
tomorrow night.

429
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:21,298
Really?

430
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,801
Really. So you're spared
a night out with the family.

431
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:27,054
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

432
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,056
I'll be right back.

433
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,941
Um...

434
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,561
so if bowling's off,

435
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:38,565
can I...
can I get a late curfew?

436
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,460
Ah. Ugh.

437
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,978
Are you gonna
turn off the light?

438
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,363
Have you seen <i>Leaves Of Grass?</i>

439
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,282
Hmm?

440
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:04,701
My book.
Walt Whitman.

441
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,620
Dark green hardcover?

442
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:09,072
I didn't even know we had that.

443
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:12,094
Hmm.

444
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,969
You don't think Junior...

445
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,021
You're kidding, right?

446
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:26,308
Well, it'll show up.

447
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,711
What's wrong with Hank?

448
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:49,882
Mm, it's a stomach bug,
sounds like.

449
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:53,085
He hasn't been to work
all week.

450
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:58,974
Well, good night.

451
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:02,724
Good night.

452
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,053
Mister, can you help me out?

453
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:15,389
Spare so change?

454
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:29,353
Hey. Come back.

455
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:31,872
Yeah. You. Come here.

456
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,908
I got something for you.

457
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:40,748
Here.

458
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,583
Take it.

459
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,301
Go ahead.

460
00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:48,422
Just take it.

461
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:52,476
Take it.

462
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:58,315
Yeah.

463
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:38,922
Anything you
want us to tell Steve Gomez?

464
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,608
He says he's worried about you.

465
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:43,310
Yeah. Tell him
I already got two grandmas.

466
00:39:45,197 --> 00:39:48,983
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

467
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:54,104
- We better hit it.
- Yeah.

468
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:56,407
See ya.

469
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:17,678
- Hey, guys.
- Walt.

470
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:19,847
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing?

471
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:22,633
Very good. Yeah. Well, you know.
I can't complain.

472
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:25,236
Hey, how's your son's arm, by the way?
I was thinking about that.

473
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,154
It's back to 100%.
We're going to District.

474
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:29,189
It's gonna be exciting.
When? This Saturday?

475
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:32,359
This Saturday morning. I think
first pitch is at 10:00 AM, so, uh...

476
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,694
- 10:00.
- Yeah.

477
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,362
Be there.
Should be a big crowd.

478
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:37,781
Guys, you're still on the clock here!
Let's go!

479
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:38,949
See you, Walt.

480
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:40,284
- See you, Artie.
- See you, Walt.

481
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:41,818
All right, Scott.
Be well.

482
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,325
They're good guys, huh?

483
00:40:48,343 --> 00:40:49,927
Yeah.

484
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:52,713
Well, it's good to see you up and about.
- Yeah.

485
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,965
- How you feeling?
- Well, you know,

486
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:58,535
I've been better, but...
I don't know.

487
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,271
You...
Did you get to see a doctor?

488
00:41:01,322 --> 00:41:02,940
I mean,
when one of these things

489
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:04,408
lasts more than three days

490
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:06,159
you really should
get that checked.

491
00:41:06,194 --> 00:41:08,161
Yeah, no, I...
I did and I'm fine.

492
00:41:08,196 --> 00:41:11,064
I'm, uh... I'm what they say
on the upswing, you know?

493
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:13,784
Mm. Good.
Good to hear.

494
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,786
Yeah.

495
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:18,789
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I...

496
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,460
Well, looks like you have
the work coming to you.

497
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:26,079
Perks of being the boss, huh?

498
00:41:26,097 --> 00:41:28,131
Yeah, you know...

499
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:34,087
How's, uh...
how's things at the car wash?

500
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:36,139
- Good.
- Yeah?

501
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,108
Yeah, really good.

502
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,980
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

503
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:46,817
- I don't know. Ma... maybe.
- Yeah, I mean,

504
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:50,571
no one else got sick, so you
probably shouldn't worry about it.

505
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:57,995
Well, Skyler will be very happy to
hear that you're feeling better.

506
00:41:58,046 --> 00:41:59,463
Which reminds me.

507
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:01,548
I better get back to it.

508
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,121
If there's anything I can do...

509
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:16,129
Feel better.

510
00:42:27,942 --> 00:42:29,910
You know...

511
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:32,913
You're gonna laugh,

512
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:36,199
but I have to ask you
about this.

513
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:40,671
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

514
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:42,873
I mean, it looks just like
the GPS tracker

515
00:42:42,924 --> 00:42:45,125
that we used on Gus Fring,
doesn't it?

516
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:49,046
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us?

517
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,101
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

518
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,036
You okay?

519
00:43:13,071 --> 00:43:16,740
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

520
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,248
Ugh!

521
00:43:30,638 --> 00:43:32,539
- Hank...
- It was you.

522
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:35,392
All along, it was you!

523
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:37,678
You son of a bitch.

524
00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:40,347
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

525
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:42,482
Calm down.

526
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:45,602
That call I got telling me
Marie was in the hospital...

527
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:48,221
that wasn't Pinkman.

528
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:50,223
You had my cell number.

529
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,944
You killed ten witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

530
00:43:53,995 --> 00:43:57,564
- Listen to me...
- You bombed a nursing home.

531
00:43:57,582 --> 00:44:01,034
Heisenberg. Heisenberg!

532
00:44:01,068 --> 00:44:03,870
You lying,
two-faced sack of shit.

533
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:05,872
Hank, look,

534
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:08,408
I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just...

535
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:12,429
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the jail.

536
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:14,681
Just take a breath, okay?
Just listen to yourself.

537
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:17,517
These wild accusations...
they could destroy our family.

538
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:20,353
- And for what?
- Damn, like you give a shit about family!

539
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:29,446
Hank, my cancer is back.

540
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:32,783
Good.

541
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:35,118
Rot, you son of a bitch.

542
00:44:36,154 --> 00:44:38,155
I'm sorry you feel that way.

543
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,908
I wanna beat this thing.
I do.

544
00:44:41,942 --> 00:44:45,545
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

545
00:44:47,548 --> 00:44:49,800
But the truth is in six months,

546
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:53,503
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

547
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:57,257
But even...

548
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,060
even if somehow

549
00:45:00,094 --> 00:45:03,764
you were able
to convince anyone

550
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:06,516
I was capable
of doing these things,

551
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:09,402
you and I both know

552
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:12,439
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

553
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:21,748
I'm a dying man
who runs a car wash.

554
00:45:21,783 --> 00:45:26,036
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

555
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:33,627
What's the point?

556
00:45:37,832 --> 00:45:41,218
Have Skyler
bring the kids here,

557
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:43,770
and then we'll talk.

558
00:45:47,441 --> 00:45:50,844
That is not going to happen.

559
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:58,485
I don't know who you are.

560
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:03,490
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

561
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:10,413
If that's true,

562
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:14,033
if you don't know who I am...

563
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,390
then maybe your best course...

564
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:25,428
would be to tread lightly.

565
00:46:26,305 --> 00:47:26,341
