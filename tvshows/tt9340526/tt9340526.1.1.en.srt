12
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,985
right off exit 29
in the Dirty Delta,

13
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,697
as fertile as the Nile.

14
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,034
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

15
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,372
Shake that, pop that,

00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,374
Let's go up in this bitch!

17
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:03,678
Ooh, and this nigga gonna say,
"Can I get some change?"

18
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,432
- No.
- And I was like, "No, nigga, no."

19
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,975
Ain't like my G-string
a motherfucking collection plate.

20
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,269
Amen.

21
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,062
And here I thought stripping
was a recession-proof industry.

22
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,146
Whoo!

23
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,985
Bitch, how that pole burn,

24
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,295
Better put some Neosporin
on that bitch.

25
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,071
Another scar
on my pretty-ass legs.

26
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,033

he end up busting me
in my fucking head.

33
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,894
You gonna need more than
some Neosporin for that.

34
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,086
You gonna need some stitches.

35
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,005
Mercedes, finish dancing
my turn for me?

36
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,257
Uh-uh.
My arms is tired.

37
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,944
I'm liable to fly right off
the pole into the crowd.

38
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,636
Mercedes, finish that girl turn.

39
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,697
- Hell, why don't you do it?
- Because I just went out.

40
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,473
I-I'll give you a blunt.

41
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:52,685
Miss Mississippi, bring your
black ass back out on this stage right now.

42
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,396

00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,566
Ooh.

00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,901
Bitch, you gonna owe me
more than a blunt.

45
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,257
Can I borrow your hairpiece?

46
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,574
Ooh, y'all,

47
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,790
Ooh, child, smell like
somebody that died up in here.

48
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,591
First day back

49
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,884
and I get another fucking scar.

50
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,012
Hair can cover this one.

51
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,055
Floss can't cover that one.

52
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,572
- That's that bud.
- $20, nigga.

53
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,766
All right,

54
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,070
But that gentleman just paid 20.

55
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,709
Yeah, well, that how much it cost
for a pretty bitch like you.

56
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,855
That how you give compliments
round these here parts?

57
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,839
That's just the politicking
of The Pynk.

58
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,675
Uncle Clifford rules.

59
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,384
No funny money, no bullets,

00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,095
and no motherfucking chips.

61
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,680
No chips?

62
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,230
Look...

63
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,149

00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,403
Ah, it's gonna be like that.

66
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,783
Take your Rihanna-looking ass

68
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,293
Okay, you good.

00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,050
Go ahead.

71
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,808
Back of the line.

72
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,699
Uh-uh.

73
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,120

163

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,375
Heifer, ain't nobody crying
over your baby-neck-smelling ass.

165
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,168
What you gonna do
when you leave?

166
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,921
What all G do.

167
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,633
Count our money.

168
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,221
Aww, it time for The Pynk booty battle.

169
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,807
First up, we got Blue Cinnamon.

170
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,561
Skrawberry.

171
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,437
Get it, Alizé.

172
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,941
Y'all need to give it up
for these bitches, man,

173
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,460
and bitches who are here
with they niggas,

174
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,903

175
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,197
And last but not least,

176
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,576
sounding all poetic and shit,

177
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,455
Autumn Night!

178
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:48,138
We got a winner!

179
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,807
Oh, we got a winner!

180
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,643
Mm-hmm.

181
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,980
All right, Autumn Night!

182
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,239
Mm, mm.

183
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,660
Don't spend it all
at the nail shop, now.

184
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,629
What's a girl have to do
to work here?

185
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,173
I mean, do I need to fill out
a job application or something?

186
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,676
Bitch, this ain't
no damn Walmart.

187
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,595
But there sure is a opening.

188
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,096
Hmm.
Nice ass.

189
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,807
Got a nice jiggle to it.
Hmm.

190
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,652
Them titties look like
two little bee stings,

191
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,772
but you work hard,
buy you some bigger ones.

192
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,607
Nice teeth.

193
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,150
You got good-grade hair.

194
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,818
I got Indian in my family.

195
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,739
Bitch, that's a Peruvian bundle.

196
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,118
You can start tomorrow,
if you wanna.

197
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,513
I don't know why you suddenly
start taking on more bitches.

198
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,623
Mercedes, why is you
over there yapping

199
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,917
when you the one leaving us
at the end of the month?

200
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hmm?

201
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,048
Mercedes' Last Dance?

202
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,176
Keyshawn, I was finna tell you.

203
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,419
I know you been saying it
for I don't how long.

204
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,764
But why now?

205
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,807
Mm-hmm. Oh.

206
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,229
Mm.

207
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,312
Oops.

208
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,563
My bad.

209
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,988
Is this one empty?

210
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,075
Slow your roll, high yellow.
I ain't gone yet.

211
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,201
Apologies.

212
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,162
Y'all bitches stinking hop
off this booty battle crown,

213
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,746
but best believe,

214
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,543
your ass ain't gonna last
one week neath these lights.

215
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,174
Fuck!

216
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,218
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

217
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,054
No, no!
No, no, no, no!

218
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,015
Oh!

219
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,688
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

220
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,246
Now, y'all done sent me
all these notices saying I'm behind.

221
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,832
A nigga roll up in here
with a check, y'all won't take it?

222
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,960
You made the bad check list
this month, Clifford.

223
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,502
Hmm?

224
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,606
Oh, y'all could have used
a cuter picture than that.

225
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,632
I'll be sure to tell management
about your request.

226
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,925
Look, just hold on
to this till next week.

227
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,719
I postdated.

228
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:05,056
Ain't that fine establishment
of yours in need of some toilet paper?

229
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,101
Who told you that,

230
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,353
your husband?

231
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,188
Cash or money order
on this equity loan

232
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,022
against the club
from here on out, Clifford.

233
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:14,898
And if I don't?

234
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,608
Then you and your
hoochie-coochie girls

235
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,819
gonna have to post up
somewhere else.

236
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,866
Passport, please.

237
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,037
See, these folks say
this ain't discriminating.

238
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,580
Y'all all best come on down
to The Pynk.

239
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,209
I won't take $35 out your check

240
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,711
to give you
your motherfucking money.

241
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,798
Mas dineros, negritos.

242
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:43,219
And some tequila
for you too, baby.

243
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,595
Mm-hmm.

244
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,681
Mm.

245
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,141
Sucker.

246
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,648
Five, six, seven, eight.

247
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:14,584
This ish y'all doing right here
ain't gonna get y'all no crown.

248
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,796
I mean, how y'all just gonna let the
Southaven Sizzles come and steal your trophy?

249
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,464
I mean, how?

250
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,008
I asked y'all a question.

251
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,054
- I did my part!
- Shut up!

252
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,931
If y'all don't learn nothing else from me,
y'all learn this.

253
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,268
In this life, you always
gotta go full out.

254
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,103
Ain't no mark in this ish.

255
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,148
Do it again, but before that,
give me 50 toe touches.

256
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,153
One.

257
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,989
Two.

258
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,073
Three.

259
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,871
Can't believe you got these girls
practicing on a Sunday afternoon too.

260
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,372
God don't mind,

261
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,958
'cause thou shalt not lose
to the Southaven Sizzles.

262
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,794
That girl done got too big

263
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,753
to be wearing shorts that short.

264
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,297
Her mom all right with it.

265
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,133
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

266
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:16,645
Can't believe I even let you hide your
booty money in the church building fund.

267
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,499
You sure weren't complaining when I
put that booty money in y'all account

268
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,108
so y'all could apply
for that loan.

269
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,280
Well, you got your pulpit
and I got mine.

270
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,583
You in a hole that deep
for a refinancing loan?

271
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,851
How you let it get
that bad, man?

272
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,252
Oh, nigga, hush.

273
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,604
We ain't never gonna be able
to keep the fridge on ice

274
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,172
with Mercedes
on her way out the door.

275
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,674
Tell me something I don't know.

276
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,512
Shit.

277
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,016
All right, all right, all right.

278
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,101
Everybody here?

279
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,477
Mm-hmm.

280
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,811
Where Keyshawn at?

281
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,521
- She coming.
- She just text us.

282
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,107
Oh, bitch constantly
be on CP time.

283
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,192
Y'all let her know
I'm instituting some new rules

284
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,153
for y'all hos starting tonight.

285
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,404
The new stripper math:

286
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,073
$4 off a lap dance,

287
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,950
15% off the private rooms
for the house.

288
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:11,826
The fuck?

289
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,344
Stage work was always
paid beforehand.

290
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,912
Now that include tip-out too.

291
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,413
Oh, come on.

292
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,414
You really gonna have bitches
hitting the floor

293
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,790
negative a Benjy?

294
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,186
Hell, if bitches ain't skip out
on tip-out at the end of the night,

295
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,671
maybe Uncle Clifford wouldn't
have to make y'all pay before.

296
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,089
Me and my girl pocketbook
getting fucked up over here.

297
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,467
Well, we'd all leave with
more scrilla in our pockets

298
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,510
if y'all didn't make
them weak-ass drinks.

299
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,263
Mercedes, you be the main one.

300
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,142
Always flodging like you
gonna come up off them duckets,

301
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,144
and at the end of the night,
your ass ain't nowhere to be seen.

302
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,189
DJ Neva Scared know.

303
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,316
Cool all that nastiness
down now.

304
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,775
Cool down.

305
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,445
Now, y'all know if it wasn't
for Mercedes Sundays,

306
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,865
y'all hos wouldn't be ringing
in nothing but $20 each on a holy night.

307
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,011
I don't know what y'all gonna do
without this Mississippi bread,

308
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,746
chitlins,
and corn bread-fed booty!

309
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,830
But I'ma pay what I owe y'all.

310
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:03,336
'Cause tonight this ass
gonna make it rain hella fast.

311
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,296
Maybe even some tetanus too.

312
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,228
I, um...

313
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,561
I fell.

314
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,480
Don't tell me it's corn bread

315
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,357
when I smell
them biscuits burning.

316
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,609
Are you all right?

317
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,818
Bitch, what you think?

318
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,366
Like I was saying, some things
gon' have to change around here,

319
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,201
and y'all bitches
better like it.

320
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,328
Go make them asses pretty, now.

321
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,163
- Gidget?
- Mm-mm.

322
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,582

324
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,627
Yeah?

325
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,756
Yeah.

326
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,258
Mm-hmm.

327
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,717
Uh-huh.

328
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,718
Yeah.

329
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,801
See?

330
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,011
You's a liar.

331
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,721
Now, burp her good, now.

332
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,726
Give me your shit
and sit over there.

333
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,271
Come on.

334
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,407
Mm.

335
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,747
Ooh, sorry.

336
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,416
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

337
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,042
I hit him first.

338
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,588
What, you don't believe me?

339
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,717
I ain't said nothing.

340
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,175
I ain't said a word.

341
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,054
How many you got by him?

342
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,848
Two.

343
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,934
The other one over

344
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,605
He say he love me.

345
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,778
Hey, I know that kind of love.

346
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,405
It feel good 'cause
it make you feel something.

347
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,199
Let you know you're living,

348
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,826
even though living ain't
'posed to feel that bad.

349
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,413
Come on.

350
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,290
You don't understand.

351
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,666
How come I don't?

352
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,876
Hmm?

353
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,963
Hell, I used to have a nigga
used to beat my ass.

354
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,965
- You?
- Sure did.

355
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,679
That's till I poured a pot
of hot grits all over his ding-a-ling.

356
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,893
Yes, ma'am, I had to Al Green
his ass something terrible.

357
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,311
And he ain't never bother me
no nevermore.

358
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,522
Sorry. I'm sorry.

359
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,776

361
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,882

362
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,115

363
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,802
Think he can tell me
what to do with my money.

364
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,536
Girl, hey!

365
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,121
This is your money.

00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,082
Right here!

367
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,166
Right here.
This is your strength.

368
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,296
You let a nigga take this away from you,
I don't know what you gonna do.

369
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:54,839
Hell, mm-mmm.

373
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,638
Yep.

374
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,148
It's opening time at The Pynk.

375
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,363
Ooh, whoo!

376
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:03,241
Now, you remember, we got that $3
dozen special on them Parmesan wings.

377
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,954
Why your nose so turnt?

378
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,789
I thought you liked

380
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,018
I'm just wondering why all

00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,086
You wet it down, it keep your flowers
from drying out in the rain.

389
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,798
Faggot-ass nigga, you got a hobby
arranging flowers or some shit?

390
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,884
Fuck you.

391
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,471
They use these in the sprayers
down at the funeral home.

392
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,806
Kept the carnations

393
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,523
Boy.

394

400
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,211
Yo.

00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,093
Hey, this is Little Murder,
nigga. You ain't know?

00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,844
I don't know nobody

405
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,637
It's all right.

406
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:00,776
Back of the line.

407
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,787
Ooh! All right, bitches.

408

Nice, nice.

411
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,671
Oh, niggas ain't gonna know
what to do when they see

412
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,631
what Uncle Clifford got

413
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,342
Come on, now.

414
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,428
We got some very important
penises out there.

415
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,429
Mm-hmm.

00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,511
Yes, come on.

417
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,892
Whoo!

418
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,144

00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,271
to break her in,
teach her how to work the flo'.

420
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,731
Nothing else.

421
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:43,693
Now, how the fuck you gonna
make moi of all people babysit?

422
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,903
Do you wanna trade?

423
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,824
I ain't think so.

424
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:51,410
Now, you go on and be
a good booty buddy, now.

425
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,453

Fall back, kinfolk.

429
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,285
My booty needs
some negative space

430
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,685

434
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,616
- What?
- Ain't popped his tags yet.

435
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,493

436
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,079
and gonna take it right back

437
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,205
I ain't worth the dance.

438
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,433
How in the world did you know...

439

443
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,273

That guy with
the vintage "Space Jams"?

445
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,820
Yeah, that's 850 on they feet

Ordered some fucking

447
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,490
Hey, little mama.

448
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,222
Hey, I know you hear me

You gonna eat your
Vienna sausages or no?

455
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,217
They ain't mine.

456
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,920
You know,
I can take care of that.

457
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,009
Many folks you killed
over there,

458
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,637
you don't need another body
on that conscience of yours.

459
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,014
Well, it's better his

460
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,519

465
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,436
Throw some ones up in the air

467
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,592

About to switch it up

471
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,650
Y'all wasn't ready for all that.

472
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,360
Oh, yeah, yeah!

473
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:29,623
Hey, girl, hey!
Wanna come partake in my little party?

474
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,708
Seem like you got your lap full
right about now.

475
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,293
No, my lap big enough
to accompany all that there.

476
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,628
Well, if I'm gonna twerk it,

477
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,689
you gon' have to make
this G-string greener than I never seen.

478
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,132
Ooh, I like your consonance.

479
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:43,887
I like your assonance too.

480
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,931
Hey, fuck with your boy

00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,214
I got a Louis duffel full
of coochie coupons, you heard?

482
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,565
Where you going?

483
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,818
That duffel could
hold eight stacks,

484
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,737
but you ain't got
nothing but five.

485
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,673
With them floral arrangement
bricks up in there,

486
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,074
it's hard to tell.

487
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,951
- Hell, I don't...
- Whoa, okay, okay.

488
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,260
So it's, like,
five stacks, then.

489
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,786
Four.

490
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,331
You just wasted a G
on these hos perpetrating.

491
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,875
Damn, bitch.
You's a OG for real.

492
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,335
What your name is, partner?

493
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,420
Little Murder.

494
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,338
Hottest rapper out in these
streets right about now.

495
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,173
- Little Murder, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

496
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,927
Is we spending four stacks
on a lap dance tonight,

497
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,596
or you got something else
in mind?

498
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,849
- Something else.
- Keep talking.

499
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,143
This champagne room busy,
you know what I'm saying?

500
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,311
Whoa, who that guy getting it
right there, though?

501
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,148
- Ooh.
- Nobody.

502
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,233
No, player, that's like Beyoncé
cousin with that blue dress on.

503
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,902
Hey, now, that's
a good metaphor.

504
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,612
Write that shit down.

505
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,739
Mm.

506
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,242
Guess I'm gonna have to swing
my stacks thataway, then.

507
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,409
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

508
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,952
You say you got
four stacks, huh?

509
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,496
- Mm-hmm.
- Let me see.

510
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,206
Okay.

511
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,333
Tell you what.

512
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,835
I pull in for your boy
over there

513
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,797
but you give us
all your coochie coupons.

514
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,215
- Double the trouble!
- Bet.

515
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,282
If you ain't laying down
no ones that'll keep that electric on,

516
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,059
you best move along,
brown Fubu T-shirt.

517
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,981
So I got a customer
want you and me in VIP.

518
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,108
You down?

519
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,233
VIP?

520
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,360
That's not what
Uncle Clifford said.

521
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,546
The way you getting down
up in twerk town,

522
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,690
you gon' have to come up
off of these training wheels.

523
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,701
Besides, I got a nigga
willing to pay two stacks,

524
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,702
a G for me and a G for you.

525
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,204
A G, huh?

526
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:37,291
Girl, that's double what niggas throwing
down nowadays in the champagne room.

527
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,586
Besides, you need to learn
how to handle VIP.

528
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,715
And who better to learn from
than a OG like me?

529
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,744
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

530
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,289
Getting creamy up
in this bitch right here!

531
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,750
It's getting creamy!

532
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,876
Goddamn, man!

533
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,295
Redbone. Redbone, look my way.

534
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,382
Look my way!

535
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,675
I said look my way!

536
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,302
Hey! Don't make me have to wrap
a nigga balls round his neck.

537
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,681
Don't touch them
unless they touch you.

538
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,557
It's all copacetic
in the cut, Diamond.

539
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:41,565
Look, you gonna have to calm down
drunk as fuck over there.

540
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,775
Nigga, you doing
the most right now.

541
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,028
- She's straight?
- Yeah, she straight.

542
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,201
Mm, I see why they call you
Little Murder.

543
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,956
You ain't seen nothing yet till I take you
to the next level, you know what I'm saying?

544
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,748
Oh, that's the Paradise Room.

545
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,297
That's only for private,
private parties.

546
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,463
Well, if you want more,

547
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,050
there's something I'ma need
to put on you in private.

548
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:15,891
Autumn... be right back.

549
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,603
Finna take my man
over to the Mercedes room.

550
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,646
Y'all take good care
of my sis, now.

551
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,652
I'll be back.

552
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,802
No, dog.
My booty can't bump to this.

553
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:53,887
What you mean?

554
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,679
Ain't got enough tremolo,
ask me.

555
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,389
And these lyrics, though?

556
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,726
I mean, is you rappin'
in cursive or what?

557
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,603
Bitch, this trap reggae soul.

558
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,271
This slaw, what it is.

559
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,155
You ain't pinning this shit
on my badonkadonk.

560
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,523
Then fuck all my stacks, then.

561
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:07,888
That's fine.
Who needs your money

562
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,777
when a bitch got
some artistic integrity?

563
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,623
You're the bad one
of the bunch, I see.

564
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:25,168
Halfway right
but mostly sweet, though.

565
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,835
Like this neck of yours.

566
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,338
Come on, shorty.
Stop acting all uptight.

567
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,215
Drink some of this
champagne with me.

568
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,092
You mean sparkling wine?

569
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,137
What?

570
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,530
Redbone, you think you
better than us, huh?

571
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:38,847
Hey, hey, I didn't...

572
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:39,992
Then don't be getting
all saditty on a nigga.

573
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,176
Please, let go of me!

574
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,811
Yo, Pico, what the fuck?

575
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,353
Ah, shit!

576
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,440
Damn!

577
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,777
Hey, hey, hey,
get up off my nigga, man!

578
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,737
You wanna do things
the hard way, huh?

579
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,824
That's one way to VIP.

580
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,411
Damn, nigga.

581
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,871
Watch where you
putting them boats.

582
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,748
My bad, nigga.
I'm looking for that bitch.

583
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,416
Which bitch? Which one?

584
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,001
The redbone
with the white tank on.

585
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,186
- We ain't mean to offend her.
- What?

586
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,128
Nigga, what?

587
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,481
I said we ain't mean
to offend her.

588
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,672
Nigga, what?

589
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,115
I said we ain't mean
to offend her!

590
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,056
Come on over here.

591
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:23,559
Now, say what you said.

592
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,603
Damn!

593
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:30,025
This room on some Super Mario
save the princess type shit.

594
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,961
Nigga, what you know about
some save the princess?

595
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,193
That's before your time.

596
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,403
I'm a old soul.

597
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,530
Mm-hmm. And what was you saying?

598
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,490
Shit got kinda hectic up in VIP.

599
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,093
I wanted to apologize
to little shorty.

600
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,762
Oh. Well, she gonna have
to get used to it,

601
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,430
learn how to handle herself
if she wanna work for me.

602
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,291
Oh, so you the manager
round here.

603
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,501
I found me the man
I need to complain to.

604
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,045
Oh! Wo-man.

605
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,422
Besides, what you got
to be complaining about?

606
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,217
The Pynk got everything
that a man need.

607
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,762
We got white bitches,
redbone bitches,

608
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,431
high yellow bitches,
midnight blue bitches,

609
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:04,184
molly, hot wings,
Tums after the hot wings.

610
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,561
Seem like The Pynk got everything
but the one thing I really need.

611
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,818
Oh, this little nigga trying
to make me blush.

612
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,865
Don't make me fall the fuck out.

613
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,871
Well, I lays motherfuckers out.

614
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,706
That's why they call me
Little Murder.

615
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,250
That your government name?

616
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,668
It's my rap name.

617
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,711
So you just be...

618
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,047
doing little murders
as opposed to big murders?

619
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,384
I buys them all, baby.

620
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:38,635
Oh, is that right?

621
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,554
In fact, I got something
that'll murder you.

622
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,516
Hmm.

623
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,168
- You all right?
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?

624
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,211
Wait a minute,
are you taking pictures of me?

625
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,713
No, no.

626
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,465
I do, um, real estate.

627
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,300
Stupid me, I didn't take
all the pictures I needed to earlier

628
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,719
for a meeting with a client.

629
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,887
Hey, you all right?

630
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,643
Yeah.

631
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,396
Yeah, yeah.
Um, just needed some air.

632
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,646
Gets stuffy in there.

633
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,065
I couldn't breathe.

634
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,068
The smoke?

635
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:39,278
Actually, you got one?

636
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,362
No.

637
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,284
What's your vice, then?

638
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,367
Don't got one.

639
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,166
Can't trust a man
without a vice.

640
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,876
We all need to give in
to something.

641
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,586
Hmm.

642
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,172
True that.

643
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,050
Andre.

644
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:03,302
Andre Watkins.

645
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,393
They call me Autumn Night.

646
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,190
- Sounds all poetic and...
- All poetic and shit.

647
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,239
I'm...

648
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:27,202
sorry I was so abrasive
just then.

649
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,911
I just got a little shook.

650
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,414
Can only imagine what you gotta shake off
working up in there.

651
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,128
Your client's a vampire.

652
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,465
They got you out here
taking pictures after midnight.

653
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:44,385
No.

654
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,556
It's just that during the day,
this place goes ghost.

655
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,726
But at night, the spots round here,
they, uh, start poppin'.

656
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,603
Client just couldn't believe.

657
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,396
Let me see.

658
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,998
You got a good eye.

659
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,168
That I do.

660
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:32,559
Well, you ain't seen poppin'

661
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,184
until you come inside.

662
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,103
You coming in?

663
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,981
You trying to give me a vice?

664
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,942
Why? You want one?

665
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:47,574
No. No, no, I'ma head on back.

666
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:50,284
But it was a pleasure
meeting you, Autumn.

667
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,121
Actually...

668
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,916
It's Hailey.

669
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,836
- That's my name.
- Nice.

670
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,298
Well, good night, Hailey.

671
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,400
Everybody ready?

672
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:27,237
I said are you ready?

673
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:30,949
I know brown Fubu T-shirt over
there readier than a motherfucker, man.

674
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,077
Saucy-ass big forces there,
big-head nigga!

675
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,789
With your bald head.

676
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:41,001
But y'all better get ready, 'cause Mercedes
about to pop that ass for that cash,

677
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,086
you know what I'm saying?

678
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,050
- I need you to play this.
- This Mercedes-approved?

679
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,594
I thought you was
DJ Neva Scared.

680
00:48:56,224 --> 00:49:00,146
Now, here every nigga
favorite night of the week at The Pynk!

681
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,856
Throw them Benjies up in the air

682
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,110
for the most luxurious booty
round these parts.

683
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,239
She a hood celebrity, y'all.

684
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:16,329
Welcome to Mercedes Sunday!

685
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,552
Rewind!

686
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,532
Oh, I need y'all
to say this with me now.

687
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,016
Uh, Mercedes! Uh!

688
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,728
- Mercedes.
- What?

689
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,353
Mercedes.

690
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,606
Fuck it up, fuck it up,
Mercedes.

691
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,525
Fuck it up, fuck it up,
Mercedes.

692
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,503
Fuck it up, fuck it up,
Mercedes.

693
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,195
Fuck it up, fuck it up,
Mercedes.

694
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,155
Fuck it up, fuck it up,
Mercedes.

695
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,806
Come on, now! Come on!

696
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,811
Lit up in this motherfucker.

697
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,523
Oh, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

698
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,971
Mercedes! Wait.

699
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,182
Why you didn't tell me you
was coming tonight, Ma?

700
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,285
You know I don't like surprises.

701
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,434
They love you.

702
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,061
Folks was willing
to give up their rent

703
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,855
and car note for you.

704
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,067
I didn't know you made
that kind of money.

705
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,402
Well, tonight was a good night.

706
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,737
What you think?

707
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:59,032
I mean, I see how you
manage your abundance.

708
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,619
You always said I was blessed
and highly favored.

709
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,036
Thank you, Jesus.

710
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,264
Where did I go wrong, Mercedes?

711
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,873
Mama, don't start
this shit again.

712
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,126
Why has my God forsaken me?

713
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,838
He must be so mad at me to have
given me a ho for a daughter.

714
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,507
Heifer,
I ain't never been no ho.

715
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,925
Your body is a temple, Mercedes.

716
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,010
Didn't I teach you that?

717
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,094
You sure did.

718
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,447
That's why when
I was a young un,

719
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:23,181
you sent me over to bend my temple
over in front of them niggas

720
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,327
to get them to buy our
breakfast at the Waffle House.

721
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,431
I ain't know the Lord then.

722
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,853
Bitch, you barely know him now.

723
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,398
- Stripping is blasphemous.
- No, Ma.

724
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,483
It art.
I transport motherfuckers.

725
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:35,570
Dazzle them, something you wish
you could do.

726
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,947
Oh, Mercedes, this ain't gonna
get you through the gates of heaven.

727
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,617
Well, I heard hell
hella lit, though.

728
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,954
With all this,

729
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,748
church should have been getting
double the tithes and offering,

730
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:53,378
with all the money I seen
these heathens waste on you tonight.

731
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:58,467
So you think I'm a waste?

732
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,760
You're not a waste, Mercedes.

733
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,722
But this is a waste
of time and your talent.

734
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,307
You think I'm doing this
for nothing?

735
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:09,186
You ain't been doing shit
but breaking my heart!

736
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,688
Oh, Lord!

737
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:13,648
This all my fault.

738
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:19,614
With everything I done done,
I... I deserve this.

739
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,659
Put her sins on me, Lord,
'cause I can carry 'em.

740
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,621
For her and for me,

741
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,498
and I don't care if I have
to die as a sacrifice

742
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,876
for this daughter of mine.

743
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,920
I will do everything
in my power to save her.

744
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:39,592
Save her, oh, dear Lord!
Save her! Save this ho!

745
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,927
Save her, Lord! Save her.
Save her, Lord!

746
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,847
Save her! Save this-save...

747
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,936
God is always grateful
for an offering.

748
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:56,192
But he'd be even more grateful
for your repentance.

749
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,695
The cash all I got
to give tonight.

750
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,653
Mm, mm, mm.

751
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,155
See there, see?
What I say I was gonna do?

752
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,117
That's $100 for you, Yoli,

753
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,034
and 60 for them snaggletooth-ass

754
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,286
bottle girls of yourn.

755
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,164
100 for... mm.

756
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,666
First time one of my sets
been roofied.

757
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,811
Little Schmurder must have broke you off
something real nice

758
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,213
to have you slip
that shit in on a bitch.

759
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,816
You better talk
to your boss about that.

760
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,217
That was Uncle Clifford request.

761
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,681
Hey, man.

762
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,565
Well...

763
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:21,443
somebody left two stacks
for your little champagne room experience.

764
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,405
That's a G for you.

765
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,617
And a G for you.

766
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,161
He said it was more than that.

767
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,456
Oh, well, you know.
It's always a lying nigga.

768
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,539
Or a lying bitch.

769
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,166
Mm-hmm.

770
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,213
Like you said,

771
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:43,673
15% off my cut of the VIP.

772
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,675
Mm-hmm.

773
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:49,304
And...$147 for lap dances.

774
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,556
Oh, look at that, 'Cedes.

775
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,518
She might have beat you
on the lap dance tip.

776
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,481
Why God made me talented
and lazy, I don't know.

777
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,485
She ain't do nothing
but lay up there looking light.

778
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,487
Well, that's what
yellow bitches do.

779
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,655
And where the rest
of your tip-out at?

780
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,532
- I ain't got it.
- What?

781
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:12,161
How the hell you in the hole
on Mercedes Sundays?

782
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,668
She done pulled that
Holy Roller bullshit again.

783
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,556
No. I already owe you.

784
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,601
Bitch, this ain't mine.

785
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:40,396
Little Schmurder,
he gave you that.

786
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,981
Hmm.

787
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,583
Nigga, just count.

788
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,559
Hey, you need a ride,
little mama?

789
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,061
No, I got one right there.

790
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,362
- Bye, y'all.
- Bye, girl.

791
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,530
Bye, girl.

792
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:34,242
Mm-mm. Wouldn't be me.

793
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,744
I don't care if man look like
Idris Elba in his prime,

794
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,414
circa "The Wire" 2005.

795
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,289
Wouldn't be me.

796
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,083
Mercedes, she gonna do
what she gonna do.

797
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,420
Mm-mm-mm.

798
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,425
How you getting home,
Miss Autumn Night?

799
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,986
You wanna ride with me

800
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,469
Uh-uh, bitch.

801
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,346
I ain't got nothing
but a two-seater,

802
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,948
and we done giving lap dances

803
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,474
I'm all right.

804
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,601
I wanted to stay a minute
before I head on home.

805
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,896
Home? Where's home?

806
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,688
Out east.

807
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,733
Oh, you wanna be heading east?

808
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,235
You should be heading thataway.

00:58:09,305 --> 00:59:09,152
