3
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,674
<i>Are you really ready</i>

4
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,979
<i>for the academic rigors
of Stansfield?</i>

5
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,424
<i>Yes, ma'am. I believe so.</i>

6
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:32,596
Ezekiel Cross.
Have you heard of him?

7
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,685
Zeke doesn't play,
you don't stay.

8
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,128
This my boy Tariq.
Show him some love.

9
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:38,785
<i>Your mom is Monet,
and your father is...</i>

10
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:39,990
Lorenzo Tejada.

11
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>How many of you are there?</i>

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,435
<i>Just the three of us.
It's me, Cane, and Dru.</i>

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,230
<i>I don't know what's
gonna happen to your mom.</i>

14
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:46,565
<i>She just fired me.</i>

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,725
<i>Without me, Tariq, your mom
is in a lot of trouble.</i>

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,128
<i>You're gonna need to get her
a good attorney fast...</i>

17
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:52,597
Someone who doesn't need
the truth to win.

18
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,606
Davis MacLean,
my mother's on trial

19
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:56,101
for killing my father,
and I want to hire you.

20
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:57,950
Five hundred K, liquid,
up front.

21
00:00:58,035 --> 00:00:59,122
<i>We could make a killing here.</i>

22
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:00,246
<i>All I need is a supplier.</i>

23
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:02,396
How do we know who wants drugs
and who actually wants tutoring?

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,843
See, the people that want drugs,
they'll order the premium package.

25
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:06,478
<i>Each order will come
with a real study guide</i>

26
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:07,708
<i>so we can cover our base.</i>

27
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:10,497
You will be released
out of this shitshow

28
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:12,231
and into
Federal Witness Protection.

29
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:14,592
I need Witness Protection
for my whole family.

30
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:16,989
So what are you gonna do now
that your illustrious career

31
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,253
as U.S. attorney is over?

32
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:19,200
Why do you care?

33
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,559
Why don't you come work for me?

34
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:23,128
Now that I'm out, I'm putting
my family back together.

35
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,174
<i>Tommy just tried to kill me.</i>

36
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,632
We got to get Yas
and get the hell out of here.

37
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:30,569
I can get us some money, all right?
I just need a little bit of time.

38
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:31,837
My number's in here.

39
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,505
All right, if anything happens, use it.

40
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:35,407
<i>Somebody tried
to kill me today.</i>

41
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,575
<i>Tariq, are you okay?</i>

42
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,143
<i>I'm good. I got away.</i>

43
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:39,478
<i>Criminals
don't attend our school.</i>

44
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,854
The fact is that a gangbanger
was murdered

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,316
by a killer skilled enough
to make it look like an accident.

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,184
Zeke Cross.
Can I get a picture?

47
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:48,653
- Ooh!
- Aah!

48
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:50,255
What you need me to do?

49
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,289
Body them Guaps.

50
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,225
<i>Cane is out taking care
of G.T.G. right now.</i>

51
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:54,493
<i>That'll be the last thing</i>

52
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:55,945
<i>Cane does for this family.</i>

53
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:58,463
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

54
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:00,398
Look, man,
I-I'll do whatever you need.

55
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:01,500
I want half of everything.

56
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:03,134
<i>Ma, I think that's Rico
with the drop.</i>

57
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:04,870
Get down!

58
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:05,904
No, Dru!

59
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:07,906
Dru!

60
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,426
Monet's right about you.
You are stupid.

61
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:13,445
Cane, I told you
if you did something

62
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:15,514
against the family,
I will put you down myself.

63
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:16,970
Ramirez wasn't even fuckin' blood.

64
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,056
Past tense?

65
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,043
<i>I know you're involved, Tariq.
I know you've been selling drugs.</i>

66
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,753
I'd like to use you
as basis for my next novel.

67
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:28,349
- You want to write a book about me?
- I can get you money, Tariq.

68
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,230
<i>Thanks for meeting me,
Professor Reynolds.</i>

69
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:32,402
I'm sorry. I couldn't be seen
handing a bunch of money

70
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,021
to a student on campus.

71
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:35,256
I knew you was a snitch.

72
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,915
We got to do something
about this nigga.

73
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:37,983
He knows too much about us.

74
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,785
Tariq, what the hell
you doing, man?

75
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,087
<i>We use Ramirez's gun,
we tie up all the loose ends.</i>

76
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:43,783
Can't let you write that book.

77
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,097
<i>Y'all still planning to run?</i>

78
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,527
<i>Ma's going.
You don't got to worry about her no more.</i>

79
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:50,095
<i>'Riq. What took you so long?</i>

80
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,112
We just got a tip
about another threat on your life.

81
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:54,966
- We're moving you out now.
- No! Let me go.

82
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,569
I should've popped Tasha
when I had the chance.

83
00:02:57,653 --> 00:03:00,505
Who the fuck's riding with you
that got the balls

84
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:02,007
to pull a strap on me?

85
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,642
So you really did
kill your father.

86
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,610
He might not be here no more,

How'd you know to do that?

00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:24,376
When I was your age,
Ma taught me and Raina.

138
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,412
I'm so sorry, 'Riq.
I was trying to make breakfast.

139
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:28,880
It's all right.

140
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,882
You shouldn't be doing this
by yourself anyway.

141
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,818
What the hell?

142
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:35,237
Wha... uh...

143
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,361
Really, little girl?

144
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,064
You... you had to wake up
the whole neighborhood?

145
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:48,133
I'm sorry, Big Mama.

146
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,834
I mean, Grandma,

147
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:51,336
I don't think
Yasmine is old enough

148
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,271
to be making breakfast
for herself anyway.

149
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:56,074
It's not just for her.
It's for both of us.

150
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:59,528
I was cookin' when I was
her age, and so was your mama.

151
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,541
Oh, Lord. You see?

152
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,084
This one here don't listen.

153
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,313
I done told her
a thousand damn times

154
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:12,469
that I like my bacon crispy,
not burnt.

00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,826
What's so hard about that?

156
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,963
When'd you get here, Tariq?

157
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,999
I mean, you don't call first?

158
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,801
<i>- You just show up?</i>
- Grandma, what do you mean?

159
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:24,436
I been here since
eight o'clock last night.

160
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,922
I spent the night.
You don't remember?

161
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:28,691
Right. Yeah.

162
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:30,327
Last night around eight.

163
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,794
I spent the night.

164
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,915
Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,902
Look at all that snow.

166
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:43,505
I'm going back to sleep.

167
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,292
You take her to school.

168
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:48,793
I got her.

169
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,234
She been drinking again, Yas?

170
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:59,971
She's getting worse, 'Riq.
Can't you stay here with us?

171
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:37,141
- Ma?
- Get back in your room.

172
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,469
If I'm not back
in five minutes,

173
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:40,013
grab Dru and a piece
and climb out the window

174
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:41,048
- and lock the door.
- Ma...

175
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,549
Just do it!

176
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:04,469
Shit, boy!

177
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:07,236
You damn near gave me
a heart attack.

178
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,726
Sorry.

179
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,104
You okay?

180
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:13,907
I needed water
for my antibiotics.

181
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,960
Can you put your gun away?
I don't want to get shot again.

182
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,481
Dru, you okay?

183
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,416
I wish people would stop
asking me that.

184
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,351
The doctor said you got
to change those bandages

185
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:27,220
every few hours.

186
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:29,055
You need my help?

187
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,641
Diana'll help me.

188
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,860
Fine.

189
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:36,496
Ma, you good? 'Cause I don't
know, you seem kind of...

190
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,050
I'm fine. Just help your
brother clean up that mess.

191
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:47,240
Look, it's not entirely
her fault you got shot.

192
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:49,075
She feels bad, Dru.

193
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,910
Not as bad as I do.

194
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:02,555
That shit was lit.

195
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,190
Hey, I bet you you and my pops

196
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:05,587
ain't roll like that
back in the day, Mecca.

197
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,927
Man, it was just another
Tuesday night for me, bruh.

198
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:10,180
Good to meet you, Cane.

199
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:12,966
Hey, you said
you knew Big Guap?

200
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,922
Shit, yeah.

201
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,603
Yeah, we hit some licks
together back in the day.

202
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:19,149
So you know my pops, Lorenzo...
They used to run together.

203
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:21,052
Lorenzo? Tejada?

204
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:24,258
Yeah. Yeah, I heard the name.
Never had the privilege.

205
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:26,253
Where's he now?

206
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:28,699
He's inside.
You ain't know that?

207
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,719
Why do I get the feeling
you're testing me, bro? Huh?

208
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:34,236
I mean, we just had
a good time in the spot...

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,023
Fuck a good time.
You smell like a fuckin' narc.

210
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:39,276
What's up, motherfuckers?

211
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:42,985
Yo, Javi, yo, you don't...
you don't want to do this, man.

212
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,498
You a fuckin' traitor, LG!
And you ain't got no strap.

213
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,860
So I definitely want
to do this.

214
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,183
K.O. was my brother.

215
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,918
Yeah, well, he shouldn't have
come for my family.

216
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,886
K.O. was down for the G.T.G.,

217
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,355
not like this piece of shit.

218
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,190
What, you
a fuckin' Tejada now, LG?

219
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:57,092
This is payback, bitches.

220
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:59,361
Sorry you got the wrong
friends, motherfucker.

221
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:11,239
Hey, yo, yo, yo, Mecca,
let him go, bro.

222
00:11:11,323 --> 00:11:12,707
He ain't coming back.

223
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,243
Bro, chill! Chill, man, please.

224
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,378
"Please"?

225
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:18,246
Now you got manners,
motherfucker?

226
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,317
Friends of yours?

227
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:24,219
Nah. Not no more.

228
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:27,155
- Cane, you know them?
- We had beef.

229
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,424
Not anymore.

230
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:32,927
Guess he ain't no narc.

231
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:35,063
Guess not.

232
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,068
<i>Coming up on</i> Matter of Fact,

233
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:41,736
<i>my exclusive interview</i>

234
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,773
<i>with superstar defense
attorney Davis MacLean.</i>

235
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:46,074
<i>Don't go away.</i>

236
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,843
<i>Stephanie,
let me get your opinion.</i>

237
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:52,447
- How's this?
- Um...

238
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:54,215
I think a jewel tone

239
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,084
will really complement
your complexion.

240
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:59,287
Yeah? Then by all means,
jewel tone me, quickly.

241
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:05,727
Davis, good to see you.
Thanks for coming on the show.

242
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:06,995
I know how busy you are.

243
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,396
<i>Well, I'm never
too busy for you.</i>

244
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,964
Oh. Sorry I'm late.

245
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:12,367
Oh, Soledad, this is our newest
associate, Cooper Saxe.

246
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:14,769
- From the U.S. Attorney's office.
- That's right.

247
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,237
You were on opposite sides

248
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,840
of the Tasha St. Patrick
case, yes?

249
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,909
Yes. You know
what they say, Soledad?

250
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:23,244
- Opposites attract.
- Hell freezes over.

251
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:26,281
I am very interested to see
how this team works out.

252
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:28,167
- I will see you out there.
- All right.

253
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:33,388
Whoa, associate?
You sold me on a partnership.

254
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:35,957
Okay, look, we're partners,
all right?

255
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,759
Both our names go on the door.

256
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:39,861
MacLean and Associates.

257
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,896
See, "Associates," that's you.

258
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,799
Wait. Why-why am I here?

259
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:46,134
What, you need me
to hold your dick?

260
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:47,969
No. Don't...

261
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,138
if I play my cards right,

262
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:51,873
<i>I might have someone
lined up for that.</i>

263
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:53,208
Oh, my God.

264
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:57,979
Uh, Stephanie,

265
00:12:58,063 --> 00:13:00,915
could you give us
the room a moment, please?

266
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,038
Thank you.

267
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:12,961
Tariq, my young brother,
what's up?

268
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,096
Don't tell me
you're in trouble.

269
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,798
Davis, just cut the bullshit,
a'ight?

270
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:17,966
I need to find my mother.

271
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,100
That's not

272
00:13:19,184 --> 00:13:20,835
how Witness Protection
works, Tariq.

273
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,237
<i>Listen,
I need to speak to her.</i>

274
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:25,624
It's about my little sister.
I'll make it worth your while.

275
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,408
I'll see what I can dig up.

276
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:29,261
Get back to me ASAP.

277
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:33,848
Could you believe this shit?

278
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:36,017
He talks his mom
into going into WITSEC,

279
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:38,086
and now he wants me to find her
so they can have a chat?

280
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,421
Fuckin' nerves.

281
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:41,856
Could you find her?

282
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,159
Even if I could find her,

283
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:46,645
I wouldn't tell you,
let alone him.

284
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:50,231
Look, he... he already
killed one parent.

285
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,100
Maybe now... I don't know...
He's gonna take out the other.

286
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:54,969
Please, that boy
loves his mother.

287
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,906
He wouldn't harm a strand
of hair on her weave.

288
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,207
All right?

289
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,910
Plus, I told him

290
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:05,280
I'd see what I can dig up,
not find her.

291
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:07,182
And we're gonna charge him

292
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,151
for every second
we even think about it.

293
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,671
Well, that's disgusting.

294
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:14,155
Hmm.

295
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,357
Welcome to the world
of private practice, my friend.

296
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:18,359
One more time from the top.

297
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:19,894
Last go.
Stay strong. Stay strong.

298
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:22,163
All right, E. Let's go.

299
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:23,364
Come on. Let's go.

300
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:25,433
Counterattack, here we go.

301
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:27,569
Finish strong. Nice!

302
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,237
Nice.

303
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:31,239
Looking good, man.

304
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:32,874
You think I'm ready?

305
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,294
You know you got it.
Just got to keep grinding.

306
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,247
How's your head?

307
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:43,084
I missed a lot of games
'cause of academic suspension.

308
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,320
Maybe another year
of college ball'd do me good,

309
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:49,424
but I just ain't trying
to miss out on my opportunity.

310
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,460
Look, you know your body,
you know your game.

311
00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:54,021
Even with the risk of injury,

312
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:55,163
you don't want to come out
too early

313
00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:56,631
and fuck up a good career.

314
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,167
You even want to come out now?

315
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:01,153
Think about
what you want, Zeke.

316
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:10,996
Bro! Where were you last night?

317
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:13,481
Spent the night
at my grandmother's.

318
00:15:13,565 --> 00:15:15,250
You know, I was
with my little sister.

319
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:16,551
Big family reunion, huh?

320
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:18,620
Must be nice to have
your mom back.

321
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:20,955
My mom's in Witness Protection
right now, bro.

322
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,590
What? Why?

323
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,959
<i>Are you okay with that?</i>

324
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,294
I mean,
it's for her safety, bro,

325
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,029
so I don't think
I have much of a choice.

326
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:29,597
<i>Well, my family
hunting trip's this weekend.</i>

327
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:31,199
<i>You know, come with.</i>

328
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:33,167
Believe me, nothing will take
your mind off your troubles

329
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,969
more than killing
a few helpless deer

330
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:37,205
with a bunch
of uptight white people.

331
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:38,439
I don't know
about that one, man.

332
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:39,507
Okay, well, at least come

333
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,242
to the kick-off dinner
in the city.

334
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:42,510
It's a whole fuckin' thing.

335
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:44,479
If you don't come,
it's gonna be all about me,

336
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:46,481
my future, blah, blah, blah.

337
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:50,251
Hold on. So this shit ain't
about me catching a break.

338
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:53,354
This is about me deflecting
for your dumb ass.

339
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:55,290
Yeah. Okay, yeah.
I'm not gonna lie.

340
00:15:55,374 --> 00:15:57,492
Can... can you just do
a brother a solid?

341
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:58,559
I'll think about it.

342
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:00,161
Yeah.

343
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:01,462
All right. I'll hit ya later.

344
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:03,498
- All right.
- Ha ha!

345
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:16,010
Riq, I heard your mom
got released!

346
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:18,346
Um, why didn't you say
anything?

347
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,547
Well, I just been
with the family

348
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,082
ever since it all happened,
you know?

349
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,685
No. Yeah, I-I totally
understand that.

350
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:27,488
Um, I mean, I'd really
like to meet her.

351
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:30,291
After all she's been through
and... it's pretty crazy.

352
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,160
Where is Professor Reynolds?

353
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:34,195
I have no idea.

354
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,097
I haven't seen him.

355
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,599
He was supposed to open up
the classroom this morning.

356
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:40,068
Uh...

357
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:41,602
<i>You've reached
Jabari Reynolds.</i>

358
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:43,304
<i>Leave a message.</i>

359
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:46,040
Jabari, all the students
are here.

360
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,076
It's the first day
of the ethics term.

361
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,745
You need to be here.

362
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:08,196
I'm not sure where
Professor Reynolds is,

363
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,231
but let's get started.

364
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:13,101
This seminar is centered
around your answers

365
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:15,636
to the perennial
ethical dilemmas

366
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,705
that scholars
have long debated.

367
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,407
I'm so tired

368
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:21,409
of the same old
patriarchal voices.

369
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,277
Right, like, why are we worried

370
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:25,279
about what old,
dead white men think?

371
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,315
'Cause they still
run the world.

372
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:28,515
Your world, maybe.

373
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,318
There's only one world, sis,

374
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:32,220
and we need to be
in this together.

375
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:34,288
Call me "sis" again. Do it.

376
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,508
Jackie, BruShaundria, come on.

377
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:40,261
We've broken the larger group
into smaller sections

378
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:42,697
so we can sharpen
your critical thinking,

379
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,632
<i>hone your rhetorical skills.</i>

380
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:47,201
<i>I want you to be
intellectually fearless</i>

381
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:49,070
<i>as we attack these questions.</i>

382
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:51,205
The only wrong answer
is the one you cannot defend.

383
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,473
Understood?

384
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:55,710
The first question
was Professor Reynolds' idea,

385
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:58,379
but I'll press on
without him, I guess.

386
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:01,382
It's a question that's been
around since biblical times.

387
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:04,552
<i>Is free will an illusion?</i>

388
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:09,123
<i>Do we make our own decisions,
or are they pre-ordained?</i>

389
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:10,458
Ma.

390
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:12,760
Oh, hell, no. Put that back.

391
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:14,162
But I like it.

392
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:16,597
I said what I said.
Put that shit back now.

393
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,299
<i>What does it mean
if we're not making</i>

394
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:19,634
<i>our own choices?</i>

395
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:22,470
<i>- Who's making them for us?</i>
- Easy.

396
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:25,306
<i>And who gives them
that power over us?</i>

397
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:30,262
Is all this necessary?

398
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,348
If you walk in a strip club
and all the girls

399
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:39,153
are broke down,
wearin' last year's G-string...

400
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:40,939
you sticking around
to pay their rent?

401
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,458
I'm not convinced about this
whole stripper metaphor.

402
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,827
Okay, fine. Look...

403
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:48,663
in your old job,
you had to look...

404
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:50,949
...trustworthy.

405
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:55,837
In this job, you got
to look successful, smart.

406
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:00,608
See, we take cases,
we win cases,

407
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,777
and we look good
doing that shit.

408
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:04,178
I make my own choices.

409
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:05,313
You sure?

410
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:08,149
Come on, your hair, nails,
your affect,

411
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,750
that all comes
from where you come from.

412
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,385
You didn't make those choices.

419
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,566
You got to have something
you care about, Davis,

420
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,767
something of substance.

421
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:29,437
Ain't no substance
like a bank balance, Saxe.

422
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,739
Now, look...

423
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:34,459
...public becomes clients
or the jury.

424
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:38,246
You got to impress 'em both.

425
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,182
Next, we got to work
on that hair.

426
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:44,002
Sam Harris says
that thought and intention

427
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:47,421
emerge from background causes
of which we are unaware

428
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:49,891
and over which we have
no conscious control.

429
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:51,151
My best friend got pregnant,

430
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,727
and she's out here with just
her baby and a EBT card.

431
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,263
I ain't take that route.

432
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:57,431
I willfully chose
to be here instead.

433
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,233
Yes, we have choices.

434
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:01,269
<i>And your boy Aristotle,</i>

435
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:04,372
<i>he said that we have the power

449
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:32,400
The hand you're dealt
is determinism.

450
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:35,269
How you play it is free will.

451
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:37,471
We haven't heard
from you, Tariq.

452
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:40,808
You agree with Lauren?
Do we have free will?

453
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:45,446
Tariq, you don't have
to do this.

454
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,781
You're wrong.

455
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:48,916
I don't have a choice,
Professor.

456
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:52,286
I mean...

457
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,322
it doesn't feel
like that sometimes,

458
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:56,991
but I like to believe
that we have free will, yes.

459
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:59,260
Who cares what you believe?

460
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:00,394
What's your argument?

461
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,330
So you think everything
is predetermined

462
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,365
and you can't do anything
to change actions?

463
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,467
- Yes.
<i>- But I bet you look</i>

464
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,302
left and right
before you cross the street.

465
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,537
<i>Look, bro,</i>

466
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:11,339
you can't base your conduct
off the belief

467
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:12,807
that everything
is predetermined

468
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:14,942
because you don't know
what's been predetermined.

469
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,844
Stephen Hawking said that.

470
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,879
Look, we all got to play
the hand that we're dealt.

471
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:20,815
You got to deal
with the consequences.

472
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:22,383
That's how life works.

473
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:25,987
Pull over, D.

474
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,922
I want to grab something
for Dru.

475
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:30,791
Really?
We're carryng weight.

476
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,427
Stay in the car.
I'll be back in a minute.

477
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:54,882
What the fuck, Kamaal?

478
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:56,717
What the fuck
is you on my couch,

479
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,136
and I want to watch my TV.

480
00:21:58,369 --> 00:21:59,553
Come on.

481
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:00,821
Look, I understand you upset

482
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:01,989
that you lost
the governor's race,

483
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:03,591
- but this ain't...
- I didn't lose.

484
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,960
I was fuckin' robbed, bro.

485
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:07,695
And nobody stopped the steal.

486
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:09,030
That's no excuse for you

487
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:12,033
to be lying around here
all day and night sulking.

488
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:13,868
Come on, man, we Tates.

489
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:17,004
You got to get back
on your feet.

490
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,774
What's that thing
Pops used to say?

491
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:21,909
Get me a drink and shut up?

492
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:23,878
What? No!

493
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:26,547
Listen, you still got
your councilman seat,

494
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:28,482
and you still
represent the people.

495
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:30,985
Oh. Fuck the people.

496
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:33,621
What have the people ever done
for my Black ass? Hmm?

497
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:34,989
I know you, 'Shad.

498
00:22:35,073 --> 00:22:37,992
The governor's office
was just a means to an end.

499
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:40,761
What you really want
is the power.

500
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:43,964
Okay. So you know me.

501
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:47,652
So then find another means
or find another fuckin' couch.

502
00:22:48,953 --> 00:22:51,605
And clean this
fucking mess up, man.

503
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:53,674
<i>Fucking pigsty.</i>

504
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:25,906
You too. You too.

505
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:48,963
What the hell
was all that about?

506
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:50,464
They wanted me to move the car,

507
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,566
but I handled it
just like you taught me.

508
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,135
Smile a little, flirt a lot,

509
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:56,187
make 'em feel like
they can get it.

510
00:23:58,056 --> 00:23:59,591
Proud of you, D.

511
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,811
Stop all that damn cheesin' and
get us the hell out of here.

512
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:31,131
My brother just texted me.

513
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:34,252
"We're here, dickhead."

514
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,971
Ah, fuck.

515
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:38,356
It's the fam, huh?

516
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:39,707
Yep, that's them,

517
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,909
waving a pair
of golden fuckin' handcuffs.

518
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:43,911
Wait, yo, is that
a brand-new whip for you?

519
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:45,212
<i>- Yep.
- You ain't tell me</i>

520
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:47,114
the handcuffs came
with brand-new whip, nigga.

521
00:25:47,198 --> 00:25:49,049
- Sign me up.
- You don't get it, 'Riq.

522
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:51,585
Yeah, I don't get it.
This shit is crazy.

523
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,088
Isn't this nice?
That is for you, son.

524
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,924
- Thanks, Dad.
- Congratulations.

525
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:58,759
- Thanks.
- Why don't you go check it out?

526
00:25:58,843 --> 00:26:01,262
- Look at those rims, huh?
- Yeah, it looks great.

527
00:26:05,383 --> 00:26:06,867
<i>Every year this weekend</i>

528
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:08,269
<i>becomes more important to me</i>

529
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:11,205
because of the opportunity
to reflect on where we've been

530
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:14,608
and where we're going
as a family

531
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:15,943
<i>and a community.</i>

532
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:19,213
And it gives us the opportunity
to kill Bambi's mom.

533
00:26:19,297 --> 00:26:20,848
Shut up, Skids.

534
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:23,117
And this year
is even more special

535
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:25,653
because my old
college roommate,

536
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:27,955
Congressman Rick Sweeney,
is here with us.

537
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,660
I remember joining
your Weston weekends

538
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:34,061
back when we were
at Stansfield, Bobby.

539
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:35,996
- That's right. That's right.
<i>- Well, I dug out</i>

540
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,831
some of Bobby's old Stansfield
photo albums

541
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:39,733
in your honor, Rick.

542
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:41,635
Oh, I burned all my photos
from back then.

543
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,737
Well, he still won't tell me

544
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:46,674
what happened on those secret
society trips out at the lodge.

545
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:48,208
Hmm. Well, let's just say
I know

546
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,643
where all the skeletons
are buried.

547
00:26:49,727 --> 00:26:51,045
Those secrets
die with us, Bobby.

548
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:52,980
- They die with us.
- Cheers to that.

549
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:54,982
Everyone, eat, drink,
and be merry.

550
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,984
Thank you so much
for being here. Enjoy.

551
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:58,819
- Cheers.
- Great.

552
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:01,221
Let's toast to all the misogyny
and rape committed

553
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:03,223
by our marauding ancestors.

554
00:27:03,307 --> 00:27:06,160
Look at these photos
of Dad's frat house.

555
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:08,862
You can practically
taste the roofies.

556
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:11,365
Cheers to the good old days,
right?

557
00:27:21,092 --> 00:27:23,277
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Uh-uh.

558
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:24,845
You, uh...

559
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:26,347
you got to pledge Kappa
if you want to look at these.

560
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:29,950
You shouldn't have brought
him here.

561
00:27:30,034 --> 00:27:32,036
Shut the fuck up, Trace.

562
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:36,090
- Brayden.
- Uncle Rick.

563
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:38,058
How's, uh,
your freshman year going?

564
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:39,259
Uh, it's been good.

565
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:40,828
You got to any, uh,
plans for the summer?

566
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:43,263
Um, I was thinking about doing
something entrepreneurial,

567
00:27:43,347 --> 00:27:44,732
maybe sales.

568
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:46,333
<i>Brayden
will be spending the summer</i>

569
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,669
at the family hedge fund,
just like Trace.

570
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,271
And your friend, Terrell...

571
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:54,274
- Tariq, Dad.
- Yes, Tariq. Tariq, uh...

572
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:55,909
we have summer internships.

573
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:58,278
I actually haven't thought
about any of that yet.

574
00:27:58,362 --> 00:27:59,747
Well, you should.

575
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:02,216
Stansfield opens its doors
to students like you

576
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,052
who might not have
traditionally matriculated,

577
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:08,122
but they aren't given the...
the proper guidance to succeed.

578
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,423
<i>Actually, Uncle Rick,</i>

579
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:11,058
Tariq has been succeeding
pretty well

580
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:12,793
in the Canonical Studies
program at Stansfield.

581
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:14,061
You're familiar with it, right?

582
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:16,997
Really?
That's a rigorous program.

583
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:18,399
- Very. Very rigorous.
<i>- It is.</i>

584
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:20,901
I am happy to see
that Stansfield's

585
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:23,303
need-blind admissions program
is succeeding

586
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:26,524
in attracting top-notch
diverse students like you.

587
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:28,108
Yeah, they are.

588
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:31,529
But, actually, my education
is funded by my father's trust.

589
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:34,848
Oh. And who's your dad?

590
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:36,917
He's actually not here
with us anymore,

591
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,819
but his name
was James St. Patrick.

592
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:40,788
He ran for Lieutenant Governor.

593
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:44,124
I met him once,
at a DNC fundraiser.

594
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,061
It's... He was very impressive.

595
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:48,796
Thank you.

596
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,464
To lose your father
at that age,

597
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:52,433
that's... that's tough.

598
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,201
It is.

599
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:56,236
And then the ugly rumors
that spread about him

600
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,306
since his passing...
That doesn't help.

601
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,442
I hope they're not true.

602
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:03,744
I've witnessed firsthand
the deleterious effect of drugs

603
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:04,845
on minority communities.

604
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,380
I agree with you.

605
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:08,882
I mean, look what opioids
are doing across the country,

606
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,384
especially Appalachia.

607
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:12,920
Of course, Big Pharma's
not getting put in prison

608
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:14,021
for dealing Oxy.

609
00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:15,389
Son, there's a difference

610
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:17,291
between legal
and illegal drugs.

611
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,577
Legal drugs are killing people
at a higher rate

612
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,428
than illegal drugs are.

613
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,464
I mean, the only difference
that I see between the two

614
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:24,898
is that rich white donors

615
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:26,934
have the power to influence
these lawmakers

616
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:29,870
so that their product
is considered "legal."

617
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:32,139
- Hmm.
- Does have a point, Uncle Rick.

618
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:34,208
You need to
bring him every year.

619
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:38,245
Yeah, so how much money
are you taking

620
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:40,481
from Big Pharma,
Congressman Sweeney?

621
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:53,911
Thank you.

622
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,131
Hey.

623
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:00,834
Hey, Whitman, it's cold as fuck
out here, right?

624
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:02,302
- No shit. Body's up the hill?
- Yeah.

625
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:03,904
Hey, you got something for me?

626
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:08,475
Snow didn't help, but I think
we found the murder weapon.

627
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,811
That's a 15 Mag.
Is that police issue?

628
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:12,179
Ran the serial number.

629
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:13,847
Belonged to Detective Danilo Ramirez.

630
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,449
- You reach out?
- Yep. He's not home.

631
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:17,151
And he's missed a week of work.

632
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:20,320
Huh. All right.
Did you put out a BOLO?

633
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,823
Yeah. You think Ramirez
popped the victim

634
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:24,258
and then skipped town?

635
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:25,526
Maybe.

636
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,829
But would he leave his gun here
for us to find?

637
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:30,464
Look, that's good work,
but keep it quiet.

638
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,432
Don't let the press find out.

639
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,871
<i>How long has
the body been here?</i>

640
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:40,258
Overnight, at least.

641
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:44,929
Any ID?

642
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:58,125
Shit.

643
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:01,395
It's Professor Jabari Reynolds
from Stansfield.

644
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,197
You know him?

645
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,233
He was helping Santana
investigate a...

646
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:08,869
dead body
found in the campus pool.

647
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:11,038
Hope that didn't
get him killed.

648
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,458
<i>Give it back to her.</i>

649
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,295
Really, Tate? At my home?

650
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,897
Okay. You have three minutes.

651
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:38,265
That's all I need.

652
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:40,400
I've been doing some serious
thinking about my next move.

653
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:41,468
Okay, just...

654
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:43,103
Uh, Rachel, Lizzie,
Sarah, please!

655
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:44,722
Daddy can't hear himself think.

656
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:47,241
The truth is,
I wanted to have them.

657
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:49,209
I mean, you can't have a career
in politics

658
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:50,310
without kids, right?

659
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:51,878
Would it have killed you
to give me a son?

660
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:53,547
I mean, just one.

661
00:31:53,631 --> 00:31:55,582
Okay. You have two minutes
and 40 seconds left.

662
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,584
The 12th District.
You see, the way I...

663
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,019
Whoa, Sweeney's seat?

664
00:31:59,103 --> 00:32:01,088
You're interrupting
my precious family time

665
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:02,489
to discuss Sweeney's seat?

666
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:03,924
The guy's a Democratic legend.

667
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,959
- No.
- He's a damn dinosaur.

668
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:08,562
The district has grown,
diversified, and changed.

669
00:32:08,646 --> 00:32:10,297
- He hasn't, and you know it.
- Okay.

670
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:12,399
Look, if you're asking for
my help or the party's help,

671
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:15,235
I can tell you right now
the answer's a flat no.

672
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,938
There's no way that guy's going
anywhere without some hard,

673
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:21,642
and I'm talking, like,
hard dirt to force him out.

674
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:24,544
So you just go back to
your little city council office

675
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:27,014
and be happy you have a job.

676
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:28,649
Seriously?

677
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:31,151
Promise me, when I bring
something back on Sweeney,

678
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:33,020
you'll bless
my taking his seat.

679
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:35,555
Okay, yeah, sure. You got it.

680
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:39,326
But that's never gonna happen.
Goodbye, Councilman.

681
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:51,672
Hannah, listen, I'm sorry
I missed the meeting.

682
00:32:51,756 --> 00:32:54,441
But I promise,
I won't be slipping back

683
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:57,344
into anything
with Zeke or Jabari.

684
00:32:57,428 --> 00:32:59,346
In fact, I just got a call
from the detective

685
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,548
I used to work with and date.

686
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:04,484
And, um, he wants
to meet for coffee.

687
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:07,605
He's a good guy,
you know, an adult.

688
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:11,391
And, um...

689
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:14,194
we had chemistry, so...

690
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:16,430
I know I wasn't making
good choices back then,

691
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:19,533
but this could be like
a second chance, you know?

692
00:33:19,617 --> 00:33:23,603
Take it slow, of course,
but, um, I don't know,

693
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:27,040
I feel like this could be the
beginning of something good.

694
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:32,112
I got to go. Talk later.

695
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:35,716
<i>- Kevin. Hey.</i>
- Hey.

696
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,218
I, um, hope
you weren't waiting long.

697
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:40,304
No, you...
you're right on time.

698
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:42,756
You look great.

699
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,725
Thanks. You too.

700
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:49,196
Should we go inside?

701
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,564
Uh, actually...

702
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:52,632
I was hoping to maybe take you
someplace else.

703
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:54,718
It's a couple blocks away.

704
00:33:56,187 --> 00:33:57,655
Okay. Sure.

705
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:14,738
No.

706
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,557
No.

707
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,092
Oh, no.

708
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:21,245
Can you confirm his identity?

709
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:25,098
It's Jabari.

710
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,200
Jabari Reynolds.

711
00:34:27,284 --> 00:34:29,436
What happened to him?

712
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:37,511
You two were close?

713
00:34:37,595 --> 00:34:39,679
We worked together.

714
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:44,251
From your reaction,

715
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:46,153
it feels like there might be
something more between you.

716
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:47,721
In the past, there was.

717
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,556
Not currently?

718
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,360
- No.
- When did you see him last?

719
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:56,129
I...

720
00:34:56,213 --> 00:34:58,131
I don't know.

721
00:34:58,215 --> 00:34:59,633
Yesterday in the office.

722
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:02,302
What'd you talk about?

723
00:35:02,386 --> 00:35:05,739
I... I... I don't remember.

724
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:08,275
Oh, Jabari.

725
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,311
I'm so, so sorry.

726
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:13,547
I'm so sorry.

727
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:16,200
You're sorry?
You blame yourself for this?

728
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,487
You think I had something
to do with this?

729
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:22,489
I didn't say that.

730
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:25,625
But it has been my experience
that you tend to blur

731
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,495
the personal
and professional lines.

732
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,831
That's why you ambushed me
this way.

733
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:33,834
This is amateur-hour bullshit.

734
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:36,503
I have no idea
what happened to Jabari.

735
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:39,539
I would never, ever...

736
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:41,959
I would never hurt him.

737
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:43,844
You have any more questions
for me,

738
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:45,445
you... you call my lawyer.

739
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:48,515
Carrie, you can leave,
or you can help.

740
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:53,320
I need a list of his students
and advisees

741
00:35:53,404 --> 00:35:54,855
and a separate list
of the students

742
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:57,724
that you and Jabari questioned
about the G.T.G. kid

743
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:59,359
in the Stansfield pool.

744
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:01,361
You think
those murders are related?

745
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:03,663
Can't be a coincidence
that kid dies,

746
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:06,700
you and Jabari start asking
questions...

747
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,801
now he's dead.

748
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:13,373
I'll get you the lists.

749
00:36:13,457 --> 00:36:14,558
<i>Carrie.</i>

750
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:16,961
What?

751
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,447
Please be careful.

752
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:33,527
Not only is my dad pressuring
me to pledge his frat,

753
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:35,195
but now he's making calls

754
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:36,663
so I get tapped to be
in the same secret society

755
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:38,899
as every other frickin' Weston.

756
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:40,901
Bro, are you even
listening to me?

757
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:43,403
Yeah, basically your dad
wants you to be his mini-me.

758
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:46,673
The car, the family
hunting trips, you know,

759
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:49,910
i-it's all about hopping
on this Weston conveyor belt

760
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:52,245
that I'm supposed
to just go along with

761
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:53,813
with no regard to who I am

762
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:56,583
or what I fucking
actually want.

763
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,718
I mean, I don't blame you
for being upset.

764
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,720
I don't want to be
my father either.

765
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,456
That's why I like
selling product with you.

766
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,494
It has nothing to do with being
a fucking Weston or who I am.

767
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:08,595
You're not still thinking

768
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,430
about getting out of the biz,
are you?

769
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:12,666
I don't know, man.
Shit's crazy right now.

770
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,701
- There's a lot going on.
<i>- Listen, 'Riq, I know</i>

771
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:17,437
you've been through a lot,
but we built that shit.

772
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:20,607
<i>I mean, we can't just go
and abandon it.</i>

773
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:30,951
Holy fuck, bro.

774
00:37:31,035 --> 00:37:32,419
<i>What?</i>

775
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,254
You know your professor,
Jabari Reynolds?

776
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:36,556
Dude was shot.

777
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,358
No way. What the fuck?

778
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:40,460
I'm sorry, bro. He's dead.

779
00:37:43,547 --> 00:37:45,465
One sec.

780
00:37:59,963 --> 00:38:02,716
Hey. Keep practicing.

781
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,101
You'll get it.

782
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:05,602
Thanks, Dru.

783
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:10,457
I got a plan for us
to get out of the life.

784
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,393
- Out the business?
- This about me getting shot?

785
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:16,363
Yes, you getting shot.

786
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:18,565
Diana was
almost arrested yesterday.

787
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:21,301
I'm not risking
that shit again.

788
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:24,421
A'ight, so what you want to do?

789
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:27,707
I'm telling Zeke to sign up
for the draft this year.

790
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,510
When he's really making money
on endorsements and shit

791
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:33,513
in about three years,
we're out.

792
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,015
He's our exit plan.

793
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:37,017
Will Zeke be down with that?

794
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:38,852
That nigga ain't got a choice.

795
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:41,888
We follow him wherever he goes,
him and his team.

796
00:38:41,972 --> 00:38:45,358
Houston, Phoenix, whatever,
and we'll all have roles.

797
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:47,794
I'll manage him,
Dru will travel with him,

798
00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:49,529
and you'll ward off
all the thots

799
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,531
and be in charge of publicity.

800
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:54,567
So we're all gonna be working
for Zeke?

801
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:56,036
No, Zeke's our new product.

802
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,338
He's your cousin.
It's about family.

803
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:05,045
Stansfield professor
was murdered?

804
00:39:05,129 --> 00:39:06,479
Y'all know about this?

805
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,925
Come on, Ma. Reach out.

806
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:29,869
Lauren, what's up? You okay?

807
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:32,990
I just can't stop thinking
about Professor Reynolds.

808
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:36,876
Where's Brayden?

809
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,478
I don't know.
Probably somewhere in the hall,

810
00:39:38,562 --> 00:39:40,714
offering a girl a shoulder
to cry on or something.

811
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:42,816
He's so chivalrous.

812
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,686
Yeah. Any opportunity he gets.

813
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,389
I just don't understand.

814
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:51,591
Who would want
to kill our professor?

815
00:39:55,512 --> 00:39:58,932
Tariq, you don't
even seem upset.

816
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:01,685
Lauren, my twin sister
was murdered.

817
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:05,004
And your father.

818
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:06,606
My mother's in WITSEC.

819
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,041
You know,
over the past few years,

820
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,642
I lost two of my best friends.

821
00:40:09,726 --> 00:40:13,230
I lost my godmother,
my godfather.

822
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:16,166
And on top of everything,
I lost both of my parents.

823
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:18,985
So, honestly,
I don't even think

824
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:20,620
I have it in me
to cry for Professor Reynolds.

825
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:21,772
I ain't even know him.

826
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:24,724
I didn't know any of that...

827
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:27,678
<i>About how many people
you've lost.</i>

828
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:31,464
I can't imagine
how many times

829
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:34,885
you've been through this
and much worse.

830
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:39,706
You don't know
how I feel, Lauren.

831
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,925
I want to know.

832
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:46,179
I want you to tell me.

833
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:03,763
Tariq?

834
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:06,666
Lauren, I got to go.

835
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,034
I got to be somewhere.

836
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:15,041
Okay.

837
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:20,480
I'll see you later.

838
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:27,887
Hey, yo...

839
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:31,124
why is this nigga's face
all over the fucking news?

840
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:34,494
He's a respected professor
at an elite college.

841
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,129
It was bound to happen.
I knew it would.

842
00:41:36,213 --> 00:41:38,031
Ain't nobody saying Ramirez
did him.

843
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:40,066
That was your idea.
You fucked up.

844
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,701
So why you think
we used his gun?

845
00:41:41,785 --> 00:41:43,169
Nobody gonna look into us
for that shit.

846
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,704
They gonna have
to look into Ramirez.

847
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:46,773
All right, motherfucker,
you better be right.

848
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:48,541
I am. Don't worry about it.

849
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,784
Shit.

850
00:41:57,868 --> 00:41:59,736
It's Monet.
She want to see me now.

851
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,732
That Jabari nigga,
that was your professor, right?

852
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:07,060
That's probably what
she want to talk about.

853
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:09,562
Just act normal.
Don't say nothing.

854
00:42:09,646 --> 00:42:10,663
I don't know, man.

855
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:12,165
You know, lyin' to Monet
is kind of risky.

856
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:14,534
And tellin' her the truth
is fucking worse.

857
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:15,768
And if I remember,

858
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:17,136
you the one that said
she'll never find out.

859
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,605
And she won't, a'ight?

860
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:20,240
You the one bugging
the fuck out right now.

861
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:22,542
Just chill, man.
I... I got this under control.

862
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,811
I'm not going down for this.
Trust me.

863
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,014
If both of us shut the fuck up
about it, neither of us will.

864
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:29,816
Trust me.

865
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:55,108
Heard about Professor Reynolds.

866
00:42:55,192 --> 00:42:57,928
Why haven't you been
answering my texts?

867
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:02,949
You okay?

868
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,287
No.

869
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:10,123
I'm not okay.

870
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,209
You know what happened?
Who shot him?

871
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,663
Can you just hold me?

What's up, Tariq?

879
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,996
What up, Diana?

880
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,631
Thanks, Dru.

881
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,117
Thanks for coming, Tariq.

882
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:57,888
Sit down. I cooked.

883
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:00,757
Looks good.

884
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,912
So tell me about this professor
that was killed.

885
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:07,647
You know him?

886
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,682
Yeah.

887
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:11,184
Mr. Reynolds.

888
00:44:11,268 --> 00:44:13,987
He's one of my professors
in Canonical Studies.

889
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,321
<i>You know,
he's a pretty good guy.</i>

890
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,474
So it's definitely a tragedy.

891
00:44:17,707 --> 00:44:20,360
So what happened?

892
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,695
I have no clue.

893
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:24,815
You have no idea who shot him?

894
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,335
Nah. Look, I know you guys
are probably concerned about,

895
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,337
you know, police being all over
the campus and everything.

896
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:34,674
But everything's fine.
You don't have to worry.

897
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:37,677
You sure? 'Cause aren't
the cops still asking questions

898
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,946
about that body
in the pool and now this?

899
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,681
He was your professor.

900
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,117
You sure no one will be looking
in your direction for this?

901
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:45,852
Nobody.

902
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:47,720
You sure you had nothing to do
with this man's murder?

903
00:44:47,804 --> 00:44:50,923
I had absolutely nothing
to do with it.

904
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:52,158
<i>I swear.</i>

905
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:54,727
Now, you know what happens
if you lying, right?

906
00:44:57,814 --> 00:44:59,832
I do.

907
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:02,735
Good, because I don't need
my distro involved

908
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,371
in some stupid shit that's
gonna put more eyes on us.

909
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,907
Now, I just got a ton of brick
that needs to be moved.

910
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,909
Can you do that?

911
00:45:09,993 --> 00:45:12,078
Of course I can.

912
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:15,031
All right, then, let's eat.

913
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:25,324
Hear anything from your mom?

914
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:26,926
Nope.

915
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,961
I wish I could speak to her.

916
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:31,330
That ain't allowed, is it?

917
00:45:31,414 --> 00:45:33,332
Nope.

918
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:35,301
But I don't care
about no rules.

919
00:45:35,385 --> 00:45:36,436
Yeah.

920
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,022
I figured that out
about you already.

921
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:43,342
Look, 'Riq, I know
I'm not your moms,

922
00:45:43,426 --> 00:45:46,363
but if you want to talk,
I'm here.

923
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:50,450
And I really appreciate that.

924
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:53,152
Thank you.

925
00:45:53,236 --> 00:45:54,854
I just feel like... I just...

926
00:45:54,938 --> 00:45:57,457
Diana, get in here
and get these plates.

927
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,192
Um, I'm helping Tariq.

928
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:00,793
He can handle it.

929
00:46:00,877 --> 00:46:02,328
Can't you, Tariq?

930
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:03,963
Yes.

931
00:46:04,047 --> 00:46:06,016
Now!

932
00:46:07,884 --> 00:46:09,135
Sorry.

933
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:10,803
Meet you later, okay?

934
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:12,171
Yeah. Okay.

I saw his body.

940
00:46:42,085 --> 00:46:43,620
What?

941
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:45,338
At the morgue.

942
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:47,924
I identified Jabari's body.

943
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:52,011
And I can't get it
out of my head.

944
00:46:52,095 --> 00:46:54,347
You didn't answer me before.

945
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:56,282
What happened?
How did he get shot?

946
00:46:56,366 --> 00:46:59,485
I don't know.

Could the Tejadas have had
something to do with it?

948
00:47:06,276 --> 00:47:08,528
No.

949
00:47:08,612 --> 00:47:11,264
Why would you even say that?

950
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:13,966
Monet threatened me
the other night.

951
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,937
She told me that if I said
anything about what you told me

952
00:47:18,021 --> 00:47:19,372
about being attacked
by that gang,

953
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:22,408
she would report me
for sleeping with you.

954
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:24,877
Shit.

955
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:27,880
- She knows about us?
- Yeah.

956
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,549
And she knows that Jabari
was asking questions

957
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:31,284
about that G.T.G. member
in the pool.

958
00:47:31,368 --> 00:47:33,920
<i>That doesn't mean that
she'd hurt Professor Reynolds.</i>

959
00:47:34,004 --> 00:47:38,257
Monet would never do anything
to jeopardize my future.

960
00:47:38,341 --> 00:47:41,994
<i>It's got to be something else.</i>

961
00:47:42,078 --> 00:47:43,313
Then what?

962
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:48,318
What could Jabari
have done to get himself shot?

963
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,188
Yo, pop the trunk.

964
00:47:54,658 --> 00:47:56,108
Did you go on a shopping spree?

965
00:47:56,192 --> 00:47:58,161
A little something-something.

966
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,531
This shit's heavy as fuck.

967
00:48:06,102 --> 00:48:07,887
Jeez, what the fuck
is all this shit?

968
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,388
It's weighing down
the Braymobile.

969
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:12,108
- You want to see?
- Yeah.

970
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:18,264
Back in
fucking business, baby.

971
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:19,932
Hell, yeah, dude!

972
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:22,101
What made you change your mind?

973
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:24,570
I mean, honestly, Bray, I don't
think I had a choice, bro.

974
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:28,074
You think it's safe to move
with all this weight in my car?

975
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:30,910
I mean, yeah, you're white.
Brand-new Benz. You'll be good.

976
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:32,111
Okay, but white people

977
00:48:32,195 --> 00:48:33,546
still get pulled over
for speeding, 'Riq.

978
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,047
Shit, once they pull you over,

979
00:48:35,131 --> 00:48:36,616
you give them your license,
they see you a Weston,

980
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,384
they'll fucking apologize
for pulling you over.

981
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:41,087
White privilege is just
another tool in our bag.

982
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:43,256
- Why not use it?
- All right.

983
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,324
Just keep the shit
under 65 on the highway

984
00:48:45,408 --> 00:48:46,892
- so they don't bother you.
<i>- All right.</i>

985
00:48:46,976 --> 00:48:48,427
We'll park this
at my parent's country house

986
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,463
until we figure out a plan
and move all this product.

987
00:48:50,547 --> 00:48:52,131
You're gonna
love hunting, 'Riq.

988
00:48:52,215 --> 00:48:54,133
I can tell.
You look like a hunter.

989
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:56,102
You look like a fuckin' hunter.

990
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:02,074
I'm glad you came, Cane.

991
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:03,576
So what you want with me?

992
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,979
Well, we got
some unfinished business.

993
00:49:07,063 --> 00:49:09,482
Follow me.

994
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:12,551
I told you,
I hate rude motherfuckers.

995
00:49:12,635 --> 00:49:14,020
Oh, shit.

996
00:49:14,104 --> 00:49:15,688
Wait, that's the Guap
that got away.

997
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:17,623
Uh-huh.
So I'm giving you a choice.

998
00:49:17,707 --> 00:49:20,159
You can show him mercy.

999
00:49:20,243 --> 00:49:23,262
You could make him suffer...

1000
00:49:23,346 --> 00:49:25,331
or...

1001
00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:26,999
kill him.

1002
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:29,001
Say less.

1003
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,176
Shut your ass up.

1004
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,412
Just know that whichever
you choose tells me

1005
00:49:39,496 --> 00:49:41,364
exactly who the fuck
you are, man.

1006
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:45,518
See...

1007
00:49:45,602 --> 00:49:47,553
I don't need any handouts.

1008
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,092
And I don't need him tied up
to beat his ass.

1009
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:58,681
Get your bitch ass up.

1010
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:02,401
Stupid motherfucker.

1011
00:50:07,557 --> 00:50:10,609
Get up.

1012
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,724
<i>Come on, now.</i>

1013
00:50:31,314 --> 00:50:33,766
I ain't got shit
to prove to you.

1014
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:38,604
But that's
who I motherfuckin' am.

1015
00:50:40,824 --> 00:50:42,441
I see.

1016
00:50:45,528 --> 00:50:48,047
You see Tariq tonight?

1017
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,099
You believe what he said
about that professor?

1018
00:50:52,168 --> 00:50:54,587
Monet thinks she's smart
asking him like that,

1019
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:56,489
but no is the only real answer
he can give her,

1020
00:50:56,573 --> 00:50:58,791
no matter what the truth is.

1021
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,693
Stupid waste of time.

1022
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:04,096
You ever gonna let up on Monet?

1023
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,265
She's part of the reason
I got shot.

1024
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:08,334
She's trying to blame Cane,

1025
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:10,436
but I told her
that we needed him.

1026
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,204
Her pride
wouldn't let her hear it.

1027
00:51:12,288 --> 00:51:14,407
Now she wants to act like
a mother and be all concerned.

1028
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,275
She should have been concerned
before this.

1029
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:17,743
She is concerned, Dru.

1030
00:51:17,827 --> 00:51:19,412
She's just trying
to protect us.

1031
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:22,481
With what?
Her bullshit exit strategy?

1032
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:25,618
Without even asking us
how we feel about it.

1033
00:51:25,702 --> 00:51:28,120
We ain't kids no more, D.

1034
00:51:28,204 --> 00:51:29,639
We don't get a say?

1035
00:51:31,574 --> 00:51:33,392
I mean, did you notice?

1036
00:51:33,476 --> 00:51:35,628
She didn't even mention Dad
in that plan.

1037
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:38,063
So what, are we just gonna move
to wherever Zeke gets drafted

1038
00:51:38,147 --> 00:51:39,598
and then, what,
leave him behind?

1039
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:41,467
That's not right, Dru.

1040
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,602
And why the hell do
I want to be Zeke's bitch?

1041
00:51:43,686 --> 00:51:46,623
Like... like, who decided
that was gonna be my life?

1042
00:51:47,824 --> 00:51:50,894
It would be nice to be able to
make some of our own decisions.

1043
00:51:52,495 --> 00:51:54,113
Maybe we need to stop
waiting around for her

1044
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:55,565
to give us permission...

1045
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,585
...start making some moves
on our own.

1046
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,809
Shit.

1047
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:36,973
What the fuck you doing, man?

1048
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:38,791
Nothing, man.
I was just walking by...

1049
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,860
It's cool.

1050
00:52:40,944 --> 00:52:42,328
Okay? I ain't gonna say shit.

1051
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,330
You ain't gonna say shit?

1052
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:47,166
And what, I'm just supposed
to fuckin' trust you?

1053
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,901
Give me a reason

1054
00:52:48,985 --> 00:52:50,987
why I shouldn't
dead your ass right now.

1055
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,806
You just seen my work, man.
And I can help.

1056
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:57,376
You? Help me?

1057
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,813
I see all this weight,
but I don't see any soldiers.

1058
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:03,549
Ain't nobody more vicious
or loyal than me.

1059
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:05,551
You're gonna have to show me
a whole lot more

1060
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:08,487
to convince me of that.

1061
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:10,222
All right.

1062
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:11,423
Give me a shot.

1063
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:21,700
Yo, I cannot believe
you got me out here, bro.

1064
00:53:21,784 --> 00:53:23,769
I cannot believe I got you
out here either,

1065
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:25,771
but here we are.

1066
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:27,740
I mean, this shit
don't even make sense.

1067
00:53:27,824 --> 00:53:29,775
What the hell
did the deer do to you?

1068
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:33,345
And after we kill the deer,
old dad forces us to eat it.

1069
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:35,447
So you have that
to look forward to.

1070
00:53:35,531 --> 00:53:37,750
You're a joy today, Becca.

1071
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:40,853
All right, everyone,
let's hit it.

1072
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,292
<i>♪ I, I got to get on a roll ♪</i>

1073
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:47,927
<i>♪ I got to stay on my toes ♪</i>

1074
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:49,662
Let's go.

1075
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:51,730
<i>♪ When you working
This hard, then it shows ♪</i>

1076
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:53,532
Hey, Zeke.

1077
00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:54,767
Hey.

1078
00:53:54,851 --> 00:53:56,936
Why I got to come
looking for you?

1079
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,370
You ain't get my texts?

1080
00:53:58,454 --> 00:54:00,239
Did you threaten my professor?

1081
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:02,775
You mean that reckless-ass
professor bitch you fuckin'?

1082
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:04,610
Yeah, I told her
what time it is.

1083
00:54:04,694 --> 00:54:06,345
You should've just stayed
away from her.

1084
00:54:06,429 --> 00:54:08,547
I told you
she didn't know anything.

1085
00:54:08,631 --> 00:54:09,949
Now Professor Reynolds is dead,

1086
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:11,584
and she asking more questions.

1087
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:14,286
They were both looking into
the Guap who got murdered.

1088
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,955
Please tell me you ain't had
nothin' to do

1089
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,656
with what happened
to Professor Reynolds.

1090
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,291
Zeke, I have no idea
what happened

1091
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:20,326
with that professor nigga.

1092
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,462
- That wasn't us.
- For real?

1093
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:24,997
- Don't lie to me.
- For real.

1094
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:26,465
Now, are you done?

1095
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:29,568
Because we have
more important shit to discuss.

1096
00:54:29,652 --> 00:54:32,705
I need you to sign up
for the draft this year.

1097
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:34,506
It's time for you to go pro.

1098
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,476
Actually, I was thinking,
Auntie, I haven't been

1099
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,811
on the court much
'cause of my suspension...

1100
00:54:38,895 --> 00:54:41,380
Look, we got to make this move
for the family now, Zeke.

1101
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:42,848
I just don't know
if it's gonna be the best...

1102
00:54:42,932 --> 00:54:44,100
Well, I do.

1103
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,485
Enough of this Carrie shit.

1104
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:48,988
Enough of these distractions.

1105
00:54:49,072 --> 00:54:51,857
Get your head in the game.

1106
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:03,802
Okay.

1107
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:06,005
Okay. Yeah.

1108
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:08,841
Smells like Irish Spring
and redemption.

1109
00:55:08,925 --> 00:55:11,010
Quit it, nigga.
You ain't funny.

1110
00:55:11,094 --> 00:55:13,345
Hey, listen,
I got myself an apartment.

1111
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:14,847
So I'll be out of here
by next week.

1112
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:16,715
Okay.
So was it something I said?

1113
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,350
Nope.

1114
00:55:18,434 --> 00:55:20,519
I got a plan.

1115
00:55:20,603 --> 00:55:22,021
I'm back in motion.

1116
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:23,856
And ain't nothin'
gonna stop Rashad Tate

1117
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,858
when he's got hisself a goal.

1118
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:27,760
- Okay. I'm proud of you, boy.
- Yes, sir.

1119
00:55:27,844 --> 00:55:29,895
I am gonna need
something from you, though.

1120
00:55:29,979 --> 00:55:32,531
And there it is.

1121
00:55:32,615 --> 00:55:33,866
What you want, Rashad?

1122
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,535
I need you to log me
into the police database.

1123
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:39,605
I need to know everything there
is on Congressman Rick Sweeney.

1124
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,774
- Why Rick...
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1125
00:55:41,858 --> 00:55:44,043
Just log me in, please.

1126
00:55:54,637 --> 00:55:56,088
So we just sit out here
and wait?

1127
00:55:56,172 --> 00:55:57,990
Yep. Unfortunately.

1128
00:55:58,074 --> 00:56:00,059
<i>This is actually fun to you?</i>

1129
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:03,395
Wait. Shh, shh, shh.
There's one right there.

1130
00:56:03,479 --> 00:56:04,763
You see it?

1131
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:06,516
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1132
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:23,849
He got her.
It's hit. Let's follow it.

1133
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:30,089
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

1134
00:56:30,173 --> 00:56:32,758
What the fuck?

1135
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:51,043
Tariq.

1136
00:56:51,127 --> 00:56:52,528
Tariq!

1137
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:56,482
<i>Tariq, are you okay?</i>

1138
00:56:59,502 --> 00:57:01,620
You're lucky you
didn't hit him, Dick Cheney.

1139
00:57:01,704 --> 00:57:02,921
<i>I know what I'm doing.</i>

1140
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:04,240
<i>I'm an excellent shot.</i>

1141
00:57:04,473 --> 00:57:06,024
<i>You broke
every safety protocol...</i>

1142
00:57:06,108 --> 00:57:07,993
<i>Calm down!
He wasn't in any danger.</i>

1143
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:09,962
<i>Sorry, Tariq.
That shouldn't have happened.</i>

1144
00:57:10,046 --> 00:57:11,964
Let us make it up to you.

1145
00:57:12,048 --> 00:57:14,466
You can take the kill shot.

1146
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,135
- What?
- It's an honor, son.

1147
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:19,037
<i>Seriously?
I never get the kill shot.</i>

1148
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:21,940
Let him go.

1149
00:57:22,024 --> 00:57:23,008
<i>Do it, son.</i>

1150
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,881
There, it's done.

1151
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:31,150
- Everybody happy now?
- All right.

1152
00:57:31,234 --> 00:57:33,819
This is bullshit. I'm out.

1153
00:57:33,903 --> 00:57:35,988
Tariq!

1154
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:37,623
Tariq, wait!

1155
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,963
Hey, hey, hey.

1156
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:49,835
Young bruh, I see
your stinkin' ass all up on TV.

1157
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:52,504
- You on the come-up, huh?
- Yeah, I look good, right?

1158
00:57:52,588 --> 00:57:54,173
It's all about
the jewel tones, brother.

1159
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:56,508
Mm.

1160
00:57:56,592 --> 00:57:58,143
Where'd that come from?

1161
00:57:58,227 --> 00:58:00,078
Ah, don't worry about it, man.

1162
00:58:00,162 --> 00:58:02,047
Yeah, I'm your brother,
and I'm worried about it.

1163
00:58:02,131 --> 00:58:03,615
I said don't.

1164
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:05,184
I give it as good
as I get it in here.

1165
00:58:05,268 --> 00:58:07,553
Trust me.

1166
00:58:07,637 --> 00:58:08,954
You gettin' your meds?

1167
00:58:09,038 --> 00:58:10,022
Every day.

1168
00:58:10,106 --> 00:58:12,024
Are you taking 'em?

1169
00:58:12,108 --> 00:58:14,193
Bro, I said I'm taking them.

1170
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:16,612
Can we talk
about something else?

1171
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:21,934
I hired that attorney
we talked about.

1172
00:58:22,018 --> 00:58:23,735
Who? The white dude?

1173
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:26,872
Yeah, Saxe.
Look, he don't know it yet.

1174
00:58:26,956 --> 00:58:30,008
He's gonna help me
get you out of here.

1175
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:32,110
Get me up out of here?

1176
00:58:32,194 --> 00:58:33,745
Yeah.

1177
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:34,997
Okay.

1178
00:58:36,132 --> 00:58:37,800
I ever lie to you?

1179
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:41,220
Fuck, yeah.

1180
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,142
Not this time, man.

1181
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:50,146
I'm getting you out.

1182
00:58:51,981 --> 00:58:54,233
You ain't dying in here.

1183
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,924
A gun, Ma?

1184
00:59:19,008 --> 00:59:20,726
For real, Ma? A gun?

1185
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:23,128
Come on, you changed
the locks on me?

1186
00:59:23,212 --> 00:59:24,963
It's like that?

1187
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:28,267
Listen, we need to talk, okay?

1188
00:59:28,351 --> 00:59:30,002
I got us a new connect.

1189
00:59:30,086 --> 00:59:31,354
Let me in.

1190
