<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

4
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,790
Stansfield is having
a publicity problem.

5
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:30,113
<i>What better place
to dig up dirt on Sweeney?</i>

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,795
<i>You know he's friends
with the Westons.</i>

7
00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:34,597
My old college roommate,
Congressman Rick Sweeney.

8
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,479
I'm blessed to announce
that I will be entering

9
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:38,000
the NBA draft this year.

10
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,202
They found their suspect.

11
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:40,763
- Who is it?
- Carrie Milgram.

12
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,606
But she's not a murderer.

13
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:43,887
Where were you on the night
of Jabari Reynolds' murder?

14
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,048
Zeke was here.

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,770
Ezekiel Cross.

16
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,251
I'm recording you.

17
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:49,692
Take you downtown
for some questions.

18
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:50,853
I'ma need you to handle
the product alone.

19
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:52,695
You trust me to do that?

20
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:54,057
Yo, what happened to him?

21
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,139
He got caught
with fake product... ours.

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,540
We need a new connect.

23
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,222
Might be able
to help out with that.

24
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:01,704
If Cane's offering product,
you need to take it.

25
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,626
Yeah, I didn't think it was
gonna be like this, Renzo.

26
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:05,147
<i>I need more.</i>

27
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,750
- I needed to see you again.
- It's too late.

28
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,432
Just in case
you change your mind.

29
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:10,273
Yas, what's going on?

30
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,715
I should be allowed
to have a drink or two.

31
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:13,997
She's going
to a really good home.

32
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,678
Tariq!

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,161
You're going to need someone
with a lot of influence.

34
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,727
You wouldn't happen
to know any Westons, do you?

35
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,411
<i>You don't have to be
so modest.</i>

36
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:29,092
This is a big thing, man.

37
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:30,935
Look, just because I'm going
to be an investigator

38
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,777
in the DA's office does not
mean that I'm not gon' miss

39
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,299
<i>my brothers
and sisters in blue.</i>

40
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,740
Stop lying, bro.

41
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:37,941
You know damn well
these sad motherfuckers

42
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,503
are dead to you after tonight.

43
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,944
Just between you and me,
Rashad.

44
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,228
<i>All right, everybody,
let's raise our glasses</i>

45
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,470
to Detective Investigator
Kamaal Tate.

46
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:48,512
- Thank you very much.
- Cheers.

47
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:51,315
Hey, think you got
the wrong event, kid.

48
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,318
Oh, no, I'm-I'm here
to see my, um... my uncle,

49
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,600
<i>Councilman Tate.</i>

50
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,401
You're related
to Councilman Tate?

51
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,884
Chief Bozeman, I really
appreciate your diligence.

52
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,485
I know this young man.

53
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:03,687
- Councilman.
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:05,369
Tariq, what the fuck
are you doing here?

55
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,612
- Uh, we need to talk.
- Talk?

56
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:09,453
Nigga, this ain't
the Breakfast Club.

57
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:10,895
You know
where you are right now?

58
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,416
Look, I need
some of your connections.

59
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,058
Child Services got my sister,
and I need you

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,420
to get someone over there
to speak to me.

61
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:18,423
Yeah, I can.

62
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:20,024
But what will you do
for me, Tariq?

63
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,826
Hmm?

64
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:23,507
I'm gonna need a little quid
from you before I can quo.

65
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:25,551
Talk to me.

66
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,474
You mentioned that you know
one of the Westons, right?

67
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,356
Yes.
Brayden Weston is my roommate.

68
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,399
How well does he know
Rick Sweeney?

69
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,840
That fuckin' cocksucker.

70
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:39,603
Ah, I love when we're on
the same side of a question.

71
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,846
Can you use your relationship
with this Brayden

72
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:44,449
to get me some information
on Sweeney?

73
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,210
He has something
that belongs to me.

74
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,612
What's that?

75
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,013
A congressional seat.

76
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,615
Now, if you get
something for me

77
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:53,497
that cancels him out of office,

78
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,220
then I can get you your sister.

79
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,261
How the fuck do you
expect me to do that?

80
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,544
Don't sell yourself
so short, young brother.

81
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:02,426
We both know
what you're capable of.

82
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,752
A'ight.

83
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:10,034
Just give me a little time
to figure that shit out.

84
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,556
But I need my sister now.

85
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:14,240
I can help you now, on credit.

86
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:18,323
But you gotta get me back
with interest.

87
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:19,884
Are we clear?

88
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:21,125
Yeah, I got you.

89
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,647
All right. I'll make the call.

90
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,048
Go down to CPS in the morning.

91
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,490
I'll make sure
that they see you.

92
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:28,092
Now get the hell outta here
before these boys

93
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:30,415
sober up enough
to arrest your Black ass.

94
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,736
Mm.

95
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,898
Go on, kick rocks,
little nigga.

96
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,140
Ah, thanks
for coming by, nephew.

97
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,542
Love you.

98
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,864
Hey, where's my drink?

99
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,209
He ain't here yet?

100
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,612
He's late.

101
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:15,339
- Does Papi know I'm back yet?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

102
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,463
And he's gonna know
if you fuck it up too.

103
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,748
Hey, you late, nigga.

104
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:24,349
What's he doing here?

105
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,831
He belongs here.
Cane found a new connect.

106
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:29,073
So we all back
in business together.

107
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:30,675
Now, whatever beef
y'all still got going,

108
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:33,080
y'all need to squash
that shit right now.

109
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:38,685
Y'all hear me?

110
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,127
So you trust him again?

111
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,729
I need product, and so do you.

112
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,170
This is what's best
for all of us.

113
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,892
The greater good.
You get that, don't you?

114
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,934
- Yeah.
- Good.

115
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,376
And, Cane,
don't be fuckin' with him

116
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,659
and the way
he does business, period.

117
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:55,380
- Yes, ma'am.
- A'ight.

118
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:58,783
Whoa, hold up, hold up.
I need the money up front.

119
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,305
Oh, you don't trust me
all of a sudden?

120
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,307
New connect, new rules.

121
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:04,188
Fucking mess.

122
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,592
Make sure
you run me my shit back.

123
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,193
I got you.

124
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,402
You frame
that teacher bitch yet?

125
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:19,404
I didn't even have to do
all that shit.

126
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,927
- We good.
- Yeah, we better be.

127
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:23,168
'Cause if them bodies
come back on me,

128
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,769
I come down on you,

129
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,372
no matter what Monet says
about no greater good.

130
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,813
Listen, nigga,
you stay outta jail

131
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:30,536
and I stay outta jail,
all right?

132
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:33,058
We in this shit together,
that's the greater good.

133
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,381
Yeah, whatever.
I'll have the shit tomorrow.

134
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,942
Make sure you have
Monet's money.

135
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:40,187
I heard what she said
before she left, nigga.

136
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,228
All this shit I be doing
for this family,

137
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,272
and the niggas can't even
offer me a ride.

138
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,239
- <i>My man.</i>
- Yo, Mecca.

139
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,721
- You made it.
- I did.

140
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:56,922
- All right.
- We up and running.

141
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:58,443
All right.

142
00:07:58,485 --> 00:07:59,444
<i>Anybody wanna help
the nigga out?</i>

143
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,409
Mec!

144
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,252
<i>Fuck, man!</i>

145
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:08,574
Mec!

146
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:10,055
To the left, man.

147
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:13,378
<i>Another step forward. Bam.</i>

148
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:22,307
<i>Party favours.</i>

149
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:26,151
<i>Feliz cumpleaños,</i> Nuff.

150
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:27,272
Yo, let's go!

151
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:28,913
Let's fucking go!

152
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,963
Cane, get over here, man.

153
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,644
- What up? What up?
- This is my boy Nuff.

154
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,647
I told you about him, right?
Nuff, this is Cane.

155
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,289
He's helping us expand
into more territory.

156
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:45,451
- What's happening, playboy?
- What up? What up?

157
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,772
So this how you throw
a damn party, huh?

158
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:48,213
Man, you better pace yourself.

159
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,336
<i>Hey, I gotta take this,
but, uh, Cane,</i>

160
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:52,817
<i>fix yourself a plate, man.</i>

161
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,340
My place is your place.
My family.

162
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,662
Fire, Chef. For real.

163
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,023
Close your mouth when you chew.

164
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:00,866
Cane, how you know Mec?

165
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,828
<i>I met him through my boy Guap.</i>

166
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,072
Mec used to run the hood
same time as his dad.

167
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:07,433
<i>So he knew him
before he went to Kuwait.</i>

168
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,995
Hey, girls. Come over here.

169
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:12,039
This the birthday boy.

170
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,199
What's up? You ready?

171
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,530
Open wide.

172
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,736
Mecca, you getting in
on this shit?

173
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,538
Don't worry about that nigga.

174
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,701
Man been a lost cause
since we got to New York.

175
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,022
What you mean?

176
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:39,985
He's had a hard-on
for some bitch.

177
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,349
Don't you know
that there's a difference

178
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:45,991
between my business

179
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,033
and family business?

180
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,114
Huh?

181
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,730
Sorry about that, Janae.

182
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,332
He'll be back online
in a minute.

183
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:07,693
For now,
why don't you help, uh,

184
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,535
Zindzi out with my boy Cane?

185
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:13,179
It's a party, y'all.
Feel the love.

186
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,985
Detective Whitman, uh,
you know,

187
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:02,628
I got practice in the morning.
so whatever you need to ask me,

188
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,790
can you just ask me
so I can go?

189
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,152
You didn't seem
so worried about practice

190
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:08,635
when I grabbed you.

191
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:10,236
Looked like you were putting
your work in already.

192
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,201
Yeah, uh,
Coach is expecting me, so...

193
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,163
What sport do you play?

194
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:21,329
Basketball.
I mean, I'm Zeke Cross.

195
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:25,651
I just declared for the draft
a couple of days ago.

196
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:27,093
I don't really
follow basketball,

197
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:29,054
but, uh, that's great for you.

198
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:32,979
So, what, do you just do
a few laps in college

199
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,821
before you're off
to your new life, right?

200
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:36,622
I mean, it's not like that.

201
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:39,585
No? You like school?

202
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,308
Uh, what do you like about it?

203
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,711
You like your friends?
Like your girlfriend?

204
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,795
Yeah, I like school.

205
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,356
Did you know Jabari Reynolds?

206
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:51,998
The professor? Nah.

207
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,722
Uh, he wasn't my advisor.

208
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:59,005
Oh, okay. Who was your advisor?

209
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:03,529
Carrie... I mean
Professor Caridad Milgram.

210
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:08,016
Can you describe
your relationship with her?

211
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:11,337
That's it. She's my advisor.

212
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,539
Can I get a phone call?
I need to call my aunt.

213
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:15,621
Like, what's going on?
Like, I've been here for hours.

214
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,744
Hey, hey, you're not-you're not
under arrest, okay?

215
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,546
I don't want you to go
worrying your auntie.

216
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,428
<i>We'll be done soon.</i>

217
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,590
<i>Hey, you-you declared
for the draft, right? Whoo.</i>

218
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:26,753
I mean, can you imagine
if the press found out

219
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:28,514
<i>you were in here for hours?</i>

220
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:31,878
What kind of rumours
might that start?

221
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
That could hurt
your draft prospects.

222
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:34,921
But I didn't do anything.

223
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,683
And that's what
I'm gonna tell 'em

224
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:38,004
if you cooperate.

225
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:39,165
<i>Let's just finish up,</i>

226
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,686
<i>get you back to Stansfield.</i>

227
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:42,731
I'm cooperating.

228
00:12:44,053 --> 00:12:46,293
Good.
Just a few more questions.

229
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:49,776
About you and, uh,
about Carrie.

230
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:25,532
<i>Yeah.</i>

231
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,939
Damn, you already up at it?

232
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,101
Play hard, work harder.

233
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,743
I had Nuff take the product
to your car.

234
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:39,105
You sure your family
can move all that?

235
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:40,587
Yeah, Monet can handle that.

236
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:42,229
And she paid you up front.

237
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,471
Yeah, well...

238
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:47,914
Guap said Monet took
your product off the street.

239
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:49,636
So where you gonna sell
my shit?

240
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:51,157
Fucking Guap.

241
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,240
Man, you know Guap
got radio mouth.

242
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,762
Monet ain't like that shit.

243
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:57,805
She wanted the business
to stay under the radar.

244
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:00,767
So she runs it to this
Steve Urkel-ass nigga

245
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,088
up at Stansfield.

246
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,132
Uh-huh.

247
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,496
Right.

248
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:09,977
And what's your problem
with him?

249
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,700
I mean, Monet's right.
His system keeps us invisible.

250
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:15,502
But she don't know
what he's doing up there.

251
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:17,745
So you don't like it
'cause you don't have control.

252
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:19,266
Mm.

253
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:20,748
- You don't trust him?
- Nope.

254
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,189
So what's his name?

255
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,916
You don't trust me either.

256
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:33,442
Well, I don't work with people
who don't trust me, Cane.

257
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:39,486
I just showed you
my whole fucking life, man.

258
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:41,369
All my peoples.

259
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,133
You know what? It's cool.

260
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:49,096
You don't wanna give me
the name, there's the door.

261
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,737
I'll see you around.

262
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:01,270
Tariq St. Patrick.

263
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,155
Uh-huh.

264
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:10,317
And you need to be able to
control this Tariq St. Patrick.

265
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,359
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Okay.

266
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:14,403
Well, maybe I can help.

267
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:19,247
I am offering you a hand.

268
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,731
I know you're too smart
to turn your back on that.

269
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:24,371
Right?

270
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,020
Tate made me
give you 15 minutes.

271
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,863
That's all you got. Go.

272
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,025
Okay. Yas belongs with me.

273
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,907
Your sister needs
to be in a grounded,

274
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,709
safe, stable environment.

275
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:43,271
And I can provide that.

276
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:45,315
In a college dorm?

277
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:49,276
Look,
she's with a great family.

278
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,558
One of my favourites,
the Royces.

279
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,920
She'll stay there
'til we see what happens

280
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:54,282
with your grandmother.

281
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:55,403
But my grandmother's
the problem.

282
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,804
She-she's unstable.

283
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:58,526
Maybe if I get an apartment,

284
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:00,047
then can Yas will stay with me?

285
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,288
An apartment?

286
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:07,615
You'll also need a stable job,
proof of income,

287
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,297
a clean drug
and criminal record.

288
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:11,341
Yeah, I can do all of that.

289
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:14,263
You couldn't even
get this meeting on your own.

290
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:19,867
Trust me, money and influence
can buy a lot of things.

291
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:22,510
But it can't buy
what's good for a child.

292
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,919
I told you.

293
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:35,044
I barely know Carrie Milgram,
and I don't know anything.

294
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:39,767
I need to go to practice.
I-I can't help you.

295
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,089
You're free to go at any time.

296
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:42,490
You keep saying that,

297
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:43,491
but you have my wallet
and my phone.

298
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:45,573
Just gotta say the word.

299
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,735
I mean, this fucker's
been ringing off the hook.

300
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,817
It's probably my auntie.
Now she's looking for me.

301
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,660
Oh, uh, your auntie?

302
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,823
Does she know about
your relationship with Carrie?

303
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,465
- Should I pick up and ask her?
- No, there is no relationship.

304
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,509
Look.

305
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,351
I understand
why you'd hesitate to admit it.

306
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:05,794
If your school finds out,
she loses her job.

307
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,956
But in the eyes of the law,
nobody fucking cares.

308
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:10,518
You're both adults.
It's not a crime.

309
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,480
You know what is a crime?

310
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:15,124
Lying to the police during
a criminal investigation.

311
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:17,966
I need you
to tell me the truth.

312
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,010
Today we'll be discussing

313
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:25,773
Jeremy Bentham's theories
on utilitarianism.

314
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:27,255
- I was thinking we could...
- I'd like to take this one

315
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,299
if you'll allow me,
Professor Milgram.

316
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,502
- <i>Sure.</i>
- Thank you.

317
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:36,824
Is there
an objective greater good?

318
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,507
<i>It's a question that's played
a vital role in my dedication</i>

319
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,990
<i>to a career in public service.</i>

320
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,833
You see, Rashad Tate is

321
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,316
and will always be
for the people.

322
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,238
<i>And that includes all of you.</i>

323
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,999
Be it better education,

324
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,642
cancellation of student debt,
creating...

325
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:57,485
The act
that's purely in service

326
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:59,247
of your voting base...

327
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,970
or potential voting base...
negates its subjectivity.

328
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:05,334
Go off,
Professor Milgram, okay?

329
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,536
<i>But he has a point.</i>

330
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:10,298
Bentham argues that
an act's utility determines

331
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,020
whether it's good or bad.

332
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,421
What keeps the many happy

333
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:16,024
is objectively
the greatest act.

334
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:18,667
Ugh. A colonizer
would say that shit.

335
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:19,748
Excuse me?

336
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,229
Slavery was promoted

337
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:23,231
as being in the interest
of the many.

338
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:26,594
Sure did make your
colonizing ancestors happy too.

339
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:28,516
Okay, but Bentham
acknowledges that utility

340
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,679
and its outcome
is always changing.

341
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:32,721
We have to leave room
for moral evolution.

342
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,723
Mm, that sounds like
a slight justification

343
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,725
- for slavery to me, Luis.
- Mm. Slight.

344
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,206
<i>And that's assuming
we all operate off</i>

345
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,888
the same moral code.

346
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,490
I've been to some of
your frat brothers' parties.

347
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:42,811
I'd speak to them on that one.

348
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:45,013
- Ooh! Shh!
- Had fun, huh?

349
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:48,577
So, Lauren, you don't think
that there's a basic moral code

350
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,340
which we adhere to that informs
the overall greater good?

351
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,822
No.

352
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,144
Well, what if you knew
that BruShaundria

353
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,906
would one day be
a serial killer?

354
00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,347
Why me?

355
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,149
Would that justify
murdering her now?

356
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,791
Try that shit.

357
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,632
I think that any act
that infringes

358
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:07,516
<i>upon someone's way of being
or happiness is wrong.</i>

359
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,800
It's stripped of the mantle of
being the greater good, period.

360
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:13,121
I wouldn't kill BruShaundria.

361
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:14,562
You mean you don't
wanna get merc'd

362
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:15,804
in self-defense.

363
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,046
Well, let's find out, shall we?

364
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,448
Don't play with me.

365
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,853
So there are
fundamental truths,

366
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:27,455
virtues that lift mankind

367
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:31,140
in which we can measure
objectivity of an action

368
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:34,303
in service of a greater good.

369
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:36,264
Do you see Jackie's point,
Lauren?

370
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:41,470
- I mean...
- In leaving room for virtue,

371
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:44,273
you often risk missing an
objectively greater good act.

372
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:45,434
<i>Sometimes
if you don't eliminate</i>

373
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,835
<i>the concept of morality,</i>

374
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,917
you risk everybody
taking a loss.

375
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,961
How's that in the interest
of the greater good?

376
00:19:52,162 --> 00:19:54,083
Young man has a point.

377
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,684
I mean, are you really saying

378
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:57,126
there's not a single
good outcome

379
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:58,847
<i>you'd rather not risk</i>

380
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:01,169
<i>just to preserve
your virtue, Professor?</i>

381
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:03,051
We can fucking
do this all day!

382
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:04,573
I think they went
to school together

383
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,095
or college or something.

384
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:07,776
- That's all I know.
- You know what I think?

385
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:09,418
I think that he found out
about you two.

386
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,462
She had him killed
to shut him up.

387
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,142
There's nothing
to find out about.

388
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,866
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but like you said,

389
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:19,148
she's way older than me.

390
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,671
She's hot and very available.

391
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,715
You know I used
to work with her, right?

392
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:29,118
Very, very, very generous.

393
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,559
She enjoys it too.

394
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:34,683
You know what I mean?

395
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:36,565
Nah, I don't know
what you mean.

396
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,086
Oh, I mean that just...
I mean, Carrie

397
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:40,850
was never one
to focus on one guy, right?

398
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:42,572
Wasn't her style.

399
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,653
That's not true.

400
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,335
She's not the type.

401
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:48,377
<i>Oh, she was
Jabari Reynolds' type.</i>

402
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,859
Back in the day, but sure.

403
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:53,384
You know, he wrote
a book about her or something.

404
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:59,470
You don't know.
No, he got back in.

405
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:03,192
<i>Oh yeah, it's been
a couple of months,</i>

406
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,435
I mean,
up until he died, of course.

407
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,517
That's not true.

408
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,038
Apparently, he was very jealous

409
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,720
over someone else
she was seeing.

410
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:14,083
<i>You sure you don't know
anything about that?</i>

411
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,929
No.

412
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,652
So you weren't with her
the night he was killed?

413
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,855
<i>That's gotta be
my auntie or-or my coach.</i>

414
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,900
<i>You made me miss practice.</i>

415
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:32,221
This is not your auntie.

416
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,546
Were you in a sexual
relationship with her?

417
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,590
Hmm?

418
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:42,472
Is she calling
to get you to lie for her?

419
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:47,917
Were you with Carrie Milgram
at her apartment

420
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,159
the night Jabari Reynolds
was killed?

421
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,168
No.

422
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,532
I wasn't with Carrie the night
Jabari Reynolds was killed.

423
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,101
Can I go, please?

424
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,225
No.

425
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:17,947
<i>You need to hang tight
for a little longer.</i>

426
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:19,589
<i>I'm gonna check something out.</i>

427
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,952
In the meantime,
I'll have an officer come in.

428
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,834
Help you call your auntie.

429
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:37,607
So how did the meeting go?

430
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,488
She basically told me
to fuck off.

431
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,571
You're 19
and your sister needs a home.

432
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:43,533
- It's a big ask.
- I mean, I understand,

433
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,215
but I need to see
my sister, man.

434
00:22:45,257 --> 00:22:46,456
I need to see Yasmine.

435
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,257
I gave her my word, and...

436
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,779
it might not mean a lot to you,
but that's my little sister.

437
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:51,300
You know...

438
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:54,304
I like that it means
something to you, Tariq.

439
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:55,705
Since you gave me your word

440
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:57,987
that you'll help me out
with Sweeney.

441
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:00,510
Now, I know that he and Weston
have been friends

442
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,351
since their college days here.

443
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:04,153
There's gotta be
something on 'em.

444
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:05,956
I-I know it.

445
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:08,478
I don't know.
He looks like a closet freak.

446
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,959
But I need proof.

447
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:13,403
I'm thinking Eliot Spitzer,
Anthony Weiner.

448
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:14,844
Real creepy type shit.

449
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:16,566
That's the kind of dirt
I need, Tariq.

450
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:17,888
A'ight, look, I'll get it.

451
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,809
But I need you
to find my sister.

452
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:20,250
An address or something.

453
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:22,612
Then I'll get you
whatever you want, okay?

454
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,173
Well, young brother...

455
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,977
...that's my kind of deal.

456
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>All right.</i>

457
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,239
- Hey.
- What's up?

458
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,921
Um, thanks for helping me out
in there.

459
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,564
Of course.

460
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:57,367
Listen, uh, last night,
sorry I bolted on you.

461
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:00,890
I'm just... I feel like
you're always preoccupied.

462
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:04,855
No, it's-it's just, I got a lot
of things going on, and...

463
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,861
I gotta-I gotta take this.

464
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:12,462
You always do.

465
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,911
Fuck.

466
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:23,193
Bash.

467
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:24,674
<i>Tariq, what can I do</i>

468
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:25,875
<i>for my favourite
minority partner?</i>

469
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,677
I need a legitimate paycheck.

470
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,119
No problem,
we'll form a new LLC

471
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:30,601
and run you a paycheck
through it.

472
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,322
A'ight,
it'll look legit, right?

473
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:34,004
<i>You're questioning
my business acumen.</i>

474
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:35,485
- I'm insulted.
- <i>No, I mean, you know.</i>

475
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:36,887
I'll have my lawyers
draw up the papers.

476
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:38,568
All you'll need
is someone to sign on

477
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,969
as president of the corporation
and a 30K down payment.

478
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,332
Bash, what?

479
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:43,333
You gotta be kidding me,
bro, 30 bands?

480
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,495
There are strict
transaction fees

481
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:46,216
at the bank of Stern and Stern.

482
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:48,138
A'ight, you'll get your money.

483
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,739
Why can't I be the president?

484
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,621
<i>You want an IRS audit?
I don't.</i>

485
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:52,863
<i>We need to make this
look clean, even if it's not.</i>

486
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,665
- A'ight.
- Find someone you trust.

487
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,507
I'll call you
when the papers are ready.

488
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,758
Niggas really think
they in <i>The Fast and Furious</i>

489
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,520
and shit.

490
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:11,081
You ain't tell me you was
bringin' white boy with you.

491
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:12,602
I brought him.

492
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,924
Man, we spent
a whole evening together,

493
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:15,605
which was your choice,
not mine.

494
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,249
I'm still white boy to you?
That's fucked up, Cane.

495
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,011
Is that the product?
Come to Daddy.

496
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,813
Yo, you buggin' if you think

497
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,655
I'm givin' your stomped-out ass
any of my fuckin' product.

498
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,096
Fuck you mean, nigga?
Just give him the bags.

499
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:27,457
Look, you of all people know

500
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,502
I can move weight, Cane.
What the fuck?

501
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:33,143
You know what?

502
00:25:33,185 --> 00:25:34,384
You and Machine Gun Kelly
over here

503
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:35,946
fuck up Monet's business,

504
00:25:35,988 --> 00:25:37,988
<i>I'ma just take it back
to the streets.</i>

505
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,469
Whoa, the streets,
that's an option?

506
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:41,112
Nah, we're staying
right where we are, B.

507
00:25:41,154 --> 00:25:43,114
I really can't wait
for y'all to fuck this up.

508
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:45,436
Continue to wait.

509
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:47,237
Thank you.

510
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:54,125
<i>Yo, don't listen
to that nigga, man.</i>

511
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,726
<i>We can't keep switchin' up
how we doin' shit</i>

512
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:57,448
now that I gotta get
my sister, bro.

513
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,129
Well, how much
do we need to get her back?

514
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:00,531
I ain't gonna lie, a lot.

515
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:02,853
Fucker Bash is asking
for 30 bands.

516
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,856
Gotta make some bread.

517
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,218
Say no more.
You know I got you, fam.

518
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,300
You know that spot
that you showed me?

519
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:10,981
I did a little redecorating.

520
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:12,543
<i>You're gonna love this.</i>

521
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:14,224
Scan that, right there.

522
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:16,268
- What?
- Yeah. The brick, right there.

523
00:26:20,553 --> 00:26:23,193
What the fuck?
This what you been working on?

524
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:26,156
One of our tutors did some
sick shit with a 3D printer.

525
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:27,798
She took out a few old bricks,

526
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,041
replaced 'em with retrofitted
3D lockers.

527
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:33,364
Both columns,
fully functional storage.

528
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:34,525
<i>So, what, every tutor got</i>

529
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:36,206
<i>their own code or some shit?</i>

530
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:38,048
<i>Exactly.
Product in, cash out.</i>

531
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,932
<i>You and I are the only ones
with the master QR.</i>

532
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,774
<i>No more running around
and handing shit out,</i>

533
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,376
<i>no more storing shit
in my parents' garage.</i>

534
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,259
<i>One location for everything.</i>

535
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:51,702
<i>When we want to expand,</i>

536
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,865
<i>anybody, anywhere.</i>

537
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:02,513
And the best part,
no one will know it's us.

538
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,558
We'll be like
some fucking ghosts.

539
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,119
This shit is fire, man.

540
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,323
<i>We'll get some money
with this bitch.</i>

541
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:22,573
<i>That white boy,
he's your way in.</i>

542
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:24,617
I watched your meeting.

543
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:27,578
Tariq's partner,
you know who he is?

544
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,341
Yeah, he's some kind
of rich kid.

545
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:34,825
That nigga is <i>the</i> rich kid,

546
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,987
and he's known Tariq
for years now.

547
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,872
He's hype, easy to control.

548
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:42,834
Perfect for us.

549
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:44,796
So you want me to get at Tariq
through Brayden?

550
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:46,237
You wanna run Tariq,

551
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,919
you need to cut him
at his soft spot,

552
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:50,761
and that rich kid is it.

553
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,367
You need to get Brayden
in your pocket.

554
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:04,336
Does Daddy know Cane's back?

555
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:05,817
You know what, Diana?

556
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,298
I'm tired of y'all
running around here

557
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,060
asking me "Daddy this"
and "Daddy that."

558
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:11,022
You wanna know about Cane,
ask your father yourself.

559
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,623
You want more responsibility?

560
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,305
You wanna be the one
askin' all the questions?

561
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,308
Here.

562
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,990
You go deal with your father.

563
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,071
Fine.

564
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,842
Hey.

565
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:33,847
Um, what's the Wi-Fi passcode
again?

566
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,130
It's on your wall, Councilman.

567
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:41,175
In your office.

568
00:28:43,777 --> 00:28:46,457
Is there something I've done
to offend you, Professor?

569
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:47,819
I certainly hope not, because

570
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:51,584
I would love for us
to be friends.

571
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:55,907
Oh, I think you've done nothing
but be yourself, Rashad.

572
00:28:55,949 --> 00:29:00,071
You know, I think if you and I
spent some time together alone,

573
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,997
you'd really warm up
to my charm.

574
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,678
Detective Whitman.

575
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,360
I didn't think we had
a meeting scheduled.

576
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:10,922
We don't, but we need to talk.

577
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:12,684
Councilman,
may we have a minute?

578
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:14,565
Ah, of course, Detective.

579
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:16,408
You know, it's been a while
since I wore the uniform,

580
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,130
but if there's anything
I can do

581
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:21,333
to help the department,
please don't hesitate to ask.

582
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,376
- Appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:31,623
I have Zeke Cross
at the precinct.

584
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:33,945
What? Why?

585
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:35,747
Is he under arrest?

586
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:37,749
He's saying you have a totally
professional relationship

587
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:39,110
and that you two
were not together

588
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,712
the night Jabari was murdered.

589
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:43,875
Your alibi is up in smoke.

590
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,797
You must have confused him.

591
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:50,644
Did you put that kid up
to kill Jabari?

592
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:53,645
Or he just figure it out
on his own?

593
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:57,729
Kevin, we both know
this is personal.

594
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,130
I know you wanna
pin this on me,

595
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,612
but neither Zeke nor I

596
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:02,894
had anything to do
with Jabari's murder.

597
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:04,376
Really?

598
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:06,899
Then why lie about your alibi?

599
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,741
<i>Or is Zeke lying?</i>

600
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:11,423
I'm not lying to you, Kevin.

601
00:30:11,465 --> 00:30:13,224
I know what you're capable of,
Carrie.

602
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,947
I know the things
you can get a man to do.

603
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:19,832
Just know that I won't rest

604
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:21,593
until I put cuffs
on both of you

605
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:23,235
and you pay
for what you've done.

606
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:41,536
<i>Open five.
Prisoner coming through.</i>

607
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,653
Thank you.

608
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,775
I'm happy you finally called,
Nae-Nae.

609
00:32:42,817 --> 00:32:44,457
Don't call me that.

610
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:45,818
And that wasn't my mom's house

611
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,540
where you turned over
those cans.

612
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:49,584
<i>I got kids, Dante.</i>

613
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:53,546
<i>Yes, and a husband, right?</i>

614
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:55,548
In prison?

615
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,550
What else you think you know?

616
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:59,271
You run a bar.

617
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:01,315
Not the life
I remember you wanting.

618
00:33:02,957 --> 00:33:05,840
Look, it's been 24 years,
and not a word.

619
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:08,561
Why now?

620
00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:16,691
Thank you.

621
00:33:18,853 --> 00:33:20,855
I'm sorry, Monet.

622
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:24,136
You know, you always had me,

623
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:27,940
but when I nearly had you,
I-I got roped up.

624
00:33:27,983 --> 00:33:30,703
Wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

625
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:32,745
Now I'm finally the man
you said I could be,

626
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:35,868
and I guess I couldn't
come back until then.

627
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:41,995
Shit, I can't believe
you bought the place out.

628
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:44,757
That import-export business
must be good, huh?

629
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,160
I see you did your research.

630
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:51,043
You did yours, finding me
under my married name and shit.

631
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:54,127
I had to, Mrs. Tejada.

632
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:56,329
Nae-Nae Stewart
wasn't bringing up anything.

633
00:33:56,371 --> 00:33:58,131
That's because she's gone.

634
00:33:58,173 --> 00:34:00,693
- Look, I gotta get outta here.
- Monet.

635
00:34:00,735 --> 00:34:05,260
Look, I get it.
Your life is different now.

636
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:12,425
You know, I would really love
to take you somewhere.

637
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,786
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

638
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:15,268
Why?

639
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,630
Old friends
can't go places together?

640
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:18,632
I don't know
that we're old friends.

641
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:20,633
Okay.

642
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,677
Then what are we?

643
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,038
You really knew
I would call, huh?

644
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:31,847
I hoped that you would.

645
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,971
I can't tell you which,
but a major sports outlet

646
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,975
is gonna pay me
stupid money for this shit.

647
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:43,577
<i>Don't worry about it.
Just get your shit together.</i>

648
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,258
- <i>Come on.</i>
- You can't sell that.

649
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,740
How do we know if Zeke's okay?

650
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:48,341
Girl, calm down.

651
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:50,383
Zeke ain't no fucking
Aaron Hernandez.

652
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:52,266
He ain't do shit.
He'll be fine.

653
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,748
But I'm more curious as to why
Sierra and her goodies

654
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,269
were in Zeke's room
in the first place.

655
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,631
Uh, yeah, since when did you

656
00:34:57,673 --> 00:34:59,392
start sleeping
with people for stories?

657
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:01,915
Okay, since when did you
start slut-shaming, Lauren?

658
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:03,596
I'm not, I'm just saying,
I think it's foul

659
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,199
that you let him hit
for a story.

660
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:07,000
Lauren, calm down.

661
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:09,763
Your feelings about Tariq
clearly got you on edge, girl.

662
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:12,485
I'm not tripping off Tariq.

663
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,327
I gotta get over that.

664
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,009
<i>I just wish he would tell me
how he really feels.</i>

665
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:17,451
See, that's why I don't fuck

666
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:19,052
with none of these
undergrad niggas.

667
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:20,333
They don't know a real woman
when they see one.

668
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,775
Mm-hmm.

669
00:35:21,817 --> 00:35:23,296
But you know what you need?

670
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:24,938
Up here worrying about
that nigga's bag,

671
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
<i>but you need to get up
into this.</i>

672
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,103
Oh!

673
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:30,864
Is that weed?

674
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:33,547
- Yes, bitch. We smoking Lizzos.
- <i>Okay, no.</i>

675
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,308
<i>I have internship interviews,</i>

676
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,310
and if they drug test me...
it's a wrap.

677
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:40,114
When you ready to forget
that nigga's name,

678
00:35:40,156 --> 00:35:42,716
don't worry, I got you.

679
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:44,878
<i>Hmm.</i>

680
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,160
That bitch is gonna need
more than that to relax.

681
00:35:47,202 --> 00:35:49,482
Oh, yeah. A whole lot.

682
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,408
Look, um, I know Monet,

683
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,770
she had fronted me some money
with Cane, and...

684
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:58,131
I don't got that shit yet.

685
00:35:58,173 --> 00:35:59,973
I ain't hit you about that.

686
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:01,254
I wanna talk to you
about the lawyer

687
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:02,455
that got your mom off.

688
00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:04,018
- Davis?
- Yeah.

689
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,699
I tried to get
an appointment with him,

690
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:08,422
but the lady at the desk said
I need a referral.

691
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:10,624
Look, 'Riq, I held you down
with Monet

692
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,825
over that sugared coke.

693
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:13,026
You owe me.

694
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,912
'Riq, I need you.

695
00:36:18,954 --> 00:36:21,315
I got you, D. I got you.

696
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:23,156
Okay.

697
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:25,158
Don't worry about it.

698
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:29,924
Yo. You find her?

699
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:32,368
I'm a man of my word,
young brother.

700
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,168
<i>A'ight, so when can I see her?</i>

701
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,970
<i>Six p.m. sharp today.</i>

702
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:38,932
- Hey.
- What's up?

703
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,014
That's in a hour.

704
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:41,455
Better hop to it.

705
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,741
<i>Can you text me the address?</i>

706
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:49,343
I gotta go. Text me.

707
00:36:49,385 --> 00:36:50,944
Yo, you dead ass, Tariq?

708
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:53,427
I bring you up here,
and then you bring her?

709
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:56,150
Look, Lauren, it's not
like that, a'ight? I...

710
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,831
It's so much shit
going on right now.

711
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,473
Everything's so complicated
'cause of my mom, and...

712
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:01,875
Okay, then tell me,
what is it like, Tariq?

713
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:04,198
What's it even like
between me and you?

714
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm just asking you
to be up front with me.

715
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:10,366
You know what? Never mind.

716
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:13,206
Lauren.

717
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,568
<i>Lauren, wait!</i>

718
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,691
Come with me, please.

719
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:17,772
Look, I wanna show you
what I've been doing

720
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:19,373
this whole time.

721
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:20,494
Please?

722
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:36,670
Man, this is something else.

723
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:47,201
Never done anything
like this before.

724
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:52,046
We can do so much together

725
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:55,049
if you just let me.

726
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:58,893
Hey, Auntie, it's Zeke.

727
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:02,416
I'm at the 21st Precinct.

728
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:04,138
I need your help.

729
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:24,398
Tariq, what's this about?

730
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,442
'Riq, 'Riq.

731
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:31,726
Yas, what's up? You good?

732
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,008
Look, I got you something.

733
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,449
Yas, this is my friend Lauren.

734
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:37,251
Lauren, this
is my baby sister, Yas.

735
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:38,292
Hi.

736
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:39,613
She's pretty.

737
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:40,975
<i>She is, right?</i>

738
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:42,497
Thank you. So are you.

739
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:45,259
Hey, come on. Talk to me.
How's school?

740
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:47,622
<i>Who been bothering you?
Who I gotta beat up?</i>

741
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,430
I think you're
beating me at this.

742
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:57,071
I kinda am.

743
00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:58,633
What? I am.

744
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:01,075
An honest woman.
I respect that.

745
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:02,756
Are you Tariq's girlfriend?

746
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,239
- <i>Um...</i>
- Whoa, Yas.

747
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:07,162
Um... Tariq?

748
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:08,443
I'm the one
that's supposed to be

749
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:09,804
asking you the questions.

750
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,766
<i>A'ight? So talk to me.</i>

751
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,327
You hanging in there, right?

752
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:15,650
You'll be home soon. Okay?

753
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:17,892
I don't wanna go home,
not with Big Mama.

754
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:19,334
<i>When you come back,</i>

755
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,375
<i>you won't have to go
with Big Mama.</i>

756
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,496
You can come stay with me.

757
00:39:21,538 --> 00:39:23,017
You really mean that, 'Riq?

758
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,258
Yeah, of course I do.

759
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,579
I can be with you all the time,

760
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:26,861
and Lauren can visit.

761
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:28,183
- I hope so.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

762
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:29,504
And so can Mom.

763
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:33,067
Um, I don't know
about Ma yet, Yas.

764
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:34,268
You know, I'm still
working on that.

765
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,030
It might take a little minute.

766
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:37,552
But look, I got this

767
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,273
so I'm with you
anywhere and everywhere you go.

768
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:40,755
Thank you.

769
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:47,404
Excuse me.

770
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:53,008
Um, where's your bathroom?

771
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,970
Down the hall to the left.

772
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:58,655
<i>Okay, but is that,
like, your left or my left?</i>

773
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:08,183
Hey, look, so you can call me
at any time you need me, okay?

774
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:09,424
My number's right here.

775
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:12,427
Go like this, this, and boom.

776
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:14,228
Just make sure nobody
sees this phone.

777
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,031
- Okay.
- Nobody, okay?

778
00:40:18,355 --> 00:40:19,794
Okay, time's up.

779
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,157
I-I could have sworn
we just got here.

780
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:24,078
I bent over backwards
to make this happen,

781
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,199
<i>Mr. St. Patrick.</i>

782
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:26,921
<i>Yasmine, let's go.</i>

783
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:30,886
See you soon, okay, Yas?

784
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:40,095
Thank you
for bringing me today.

785
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,538
Watching you and your sister,
I get it now.

786
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,181
- You're all she has.
- Yeah.

787
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:48,143
You know,
I wanted to show you that.

788
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:49,904
<i>I just didn't want you
to think</i>

789
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:51,787
<i>I'm just bullshitting you,
you know?</i>

790
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,909
I got a lot of shit going on,

791
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,071
and I hope that's okay for you.

792
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:26,981
You sure?

793
00:41:49,446 --> 00:41:52,128
<i>Hey, Auntie, it's Zeke.</i>

794
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,249
<i>I am at the 21st Precinct.</i>

795
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:55,931
<i>I need your help.</i>

796
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,372
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

797
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,694
What is it? Can I help?

798
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:00,495
Nah, I gotta do this alone.

799
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:21,917
I told you she would
text you back.

800
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,081
What, you a psychic now?

801
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:28,284
- Mr. Cross.
- <i>Excuse me. Rude.</i>

802
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:29,725
You can shut the fuck up.

803
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:31,527
- <i>Put your pants on.</i>
- What the fuck?

804
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:32,928
What-what's wrong?

805
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,170
Fucking cops
just grabbed up Zeke.

806
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:37,132
I know.

807
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:38,774
What do you mean you know?

808
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:40,896
Sierra was there.
She was the one who shot it.

809
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,578
She-she showed me.

810
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,300
Fuck, are you serious, Lauren?

811
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:45,701
Look, with everything going on
with your sister today,

812
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,543
- I just forgot.
- Oh man.

813
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:49,985
Lauren, if anything happens
to Zeke, I'm outta here.

814
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,508
A'ight, half of my acceptance
was based on me helping him.

815
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,150
Wait, what?

816
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:55,871
This doesn't-that doesn't
make any sense.

817
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:56,912
There's a lot of shit
that's not gonna make sense

818
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,514
to you right now, Lauren.

819
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:00,155
Fuck.

820
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:02,199
Tariq, I'm so sorry.

821
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:05,761
Is there anything I can do?

822
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:08,284
No, it-it's fine.
I, um... I'm sorry.

823
00:43:08,326 --> 00:43:09,485
It's not your fault.

824
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:11,006
I gotta go handle this, okay?

825
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:13,088
I'll hit you later.

826
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:21,899
Yo, Davis, I need you to handle
something for me ASAP.

827
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,064
She ain't comin'.
I need to call somebody else.

828
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:30,026
Zeke, you need to trust me,

829
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,227
'cause there's no one else
who can help you.

830
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:33,149
Wait.

831
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:35,271
Check out my PBA card.

832
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,952
It's in my wallet.

833
00:43:38,876 --> 00:43:42,038
Of course you have a PBA card.

834
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,164
He'll help me.

835
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:50,846
Detective Ramirez?

836
00:43:53,692 --> 00:43:55,291
Where's Zeke Cross?

837
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,053
I'm his guardian.
You can't hold him.

838
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,974
- You need to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

839
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:00,216
And don't you
fuckin' touch me either.

840
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:01,537
Now, where is my nephew?

841
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:03,582
Where'd you get this card?

842
00:44:04,462 --> 00:44:06,783
I don't remember.
Call him. Ask him.

843
00:44:06,825 --> 00:44:09,025
When was the last time
you saw Detective Ramirez?

844
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:10,586
He's a fan.
I met him at a game.

845
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:11,987
He told me to show the card

846
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:13,589
in case I-in case
I got jammed up.

847
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:16,473
- Zeke!
- Hold on, ma'am.

848
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:18,795
- <i>Ma'am!</i>
- Zeke.

849
00:44:18,837 --> 00:44:20,076
Ramirez gave you
this card himself?

850
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:21,317
- Zeke!
- I just... I don't...

851
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,239
- Huh?
- Uh-uh, get up, Zeke.

852
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:24,680
Who the fuck are you?

853
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:25,761
You need to watch
how you talk to me.

854
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:27,484
Now, are you chargin' him?

855
00:44:27,526 --> 00:44:29,005
I'm asking him some questions.
He's here voluntarily.

856
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:31,768
Well, now he's
voluntarily leaving, asshole.

857
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,569
Give me a fuckin' break.

858
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:35,251
Where's my client
Ezekiel Cross?

859
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:36,772
I wanna see him now.

860
00:44:36,814 --> 00:44:39,576
Your client?
Who the fuck hired you?

861
00:44:39,618 --> 00:44:42,539
Ah, I'm Davis McLean,
criminal defense attorney.

862
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:43,780
- A mutual friend.
- Yeah, yeah.

863
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:45,181
I know who you are.

864
00:44:45,223 --> 00:44:46,542
And we don't need
a criminal lawyer.

865
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,344
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Listen.

866
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:51,026
I-I just ran a gauntlet
of reporters outside

867
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:52,269
to get in here.

868
00:44:52,311 --> 00:44:53,830
It's a zoo.

869
00:44:53,872 --> 00:44:56,192
Now, you go out there,

870
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:58,236
they'll eat this kid alive.

871
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,477
Yeah, use the back door.

872
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,840
I'll handle the press for you.

873
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:05,242
<i>Hold up. Just let me ask him...</i>

874
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:06,803
You wanna lose
your motherfuckin' badge?

875
00:45:06,845 --> 00:45:08,444
Get the fuck outta my face.

876
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,649
Ezekiel Cross
voluntarily presented himself

877
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:17,174
to detectives to assist
in an investigation.

878
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:18,855
He was never a suspect,

879
00:45:18,897 --> 00:45:22,018
just a good citizen
looking to help the police.

880
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,900
Detectives will tell you
he was not charged

881
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:25,982
with anything and in fact,

882
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:28,387
they were more than happy
to have this help.

883
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:39,636
<i>Look at me. Did they hurt you?</i>

884
00:45:39,678 --> 00:45:40,717
<i>What happened?</i>

885
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,042
Professor Reynolds.

886
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,442
They think me and Carrie

887
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:48,845
had something to do
with his murder.

888
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:52,329
The fuckin' professor bitch
I told you to stop fuckin'.

889
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:53,530
Zeke, you need to end
this shit now.

890
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:54,691
I did.

891
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:56,293
Obviously not soon enough.

892
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:58,855
Why they tryin' to pin
this shit you?

893
00:45:58,897 --> 00:46:00,899
What are you not telling me?

894
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,741
She was with Jabari.

895
00:46:04,783 --> 00:46:07,504
So your girlfriend was fuckin'
the dead professor nigga.

896
00:46:07,546 --> 00:46:09,185
Zeke, you on your way
to the NBA,

897
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:10,186
and you out here
getting caught up

898
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:11,868
in some community pussy?

899
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:12,989
Come on, man.

900
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:14,390
Look, I-I didn't say anything.

901
00:46:14,432 --> 00:46:17,794
I-I didn't know what to do.

902
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:19,838
I called you.
You didn't answer.

903
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:23,039
And then I gave them
Ramirez's PBA card.

904
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,081
Wait, you did what?

905
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:26,803
Fuck!

906
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:29,086
You fuckin' gave them
Ramirez's PBA card?

907
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:31,448
That's what you told me to do.

908
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,290
Isn't it?

909
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,652
Monet.

910
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:37,976
Is there something wrong
with Ramirez?

911
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,940
Shit!

912
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:45,422
You always talk about having
my best interest at heart,

913
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:47,584
but don't tell me shit
to protect myself!

914
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:51,190
This is my life, my career.

915
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:55,472
What the fuck did you
just get me into?

916
00:46:55,514 --> 00:46:57,034
Damn, I'm sorry, Zeke.

917
00:46:57,076 --> 00:46:58,475
I should have took that card
away from you.

918
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:00,277
Look, I'ma make this right.
I promise.

919
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,719
I promise, baby.

920
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:10,647
As promised.

921
00:47:10,689 --> 00:47:12,409
Business is poppin'.

922
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:14,371
Oh, so you
the new delivery boy now?

923
00:47:14,413 --> 00:47:16,614
Tell your boss nice work.

924
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:17,695
Boss?

925
00:47:17,737 --> 00:47:20,097
Nah, me and Tariq are partners.

926
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,418
You think I'd be
running this shit down here

927
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,100
if I was just a delivery boy?

928
00:47:23,142 --> 00:47:25,021
Nah, we split our shit 50-50.

929
00:47:25,063 --> 00:47:27,065
Uh-huh.

930
00:47:28,187 --> 00:47:29,787
You good?

931
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,468
Yeah, this isn't all
I need to pull down tonight,

932
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,509
if you know what I mean.

933
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:33,750
How much you need?

934
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:35,794
At least eight bands.

935
00:47:36,235 --> 00:47:38,194
Y'all pressed over eight bands?

936
00:47:38,236 --> 00:47:39,957
You know that's not even
lunch money, right?

937
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:41,318
Listen, I keep telling you,

938
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,680
if you wanna make
some real money,

939
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:44,201
might as well
run the streets with me.

940
00:47:44,243 --> 00:47:46,803
Make that stack
look like change.

941
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:49,126
Nah, we're not
diversifying right now.

942
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:52,850
Ah, right.
Them your boss' orders.

943
00:47:52,892 --> 00:47:55,492
I told you, Cane,
I handle my own shit.

944
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:59,176
You ain't a real hot nigga.

945
00:47:59,218 --> 00:48:02,100
Look, we're working together,
so put some respect on my shit.

946
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:06,704
Okay, big man, you got drip,

947
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:08,465
come get into it
with me tonight.

948
00:48:08,507 --> 00:48:09,987
See how a real operation runs.

949
00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:11,308
I'm not working
the corner again, fuck that.

950
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,431
I'm not trying
to pimp you out, bro.

951
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:16,794
You coming or not?

952
00:48:16,836 --> 00:48:19,156
Look you can either
get in the car and trust me

953
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:22,760
or come up short for your
boss... your business partner.

954
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,489
Fuck it.

955
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,330
What are we gonna do?

956
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:35,532
Shit, I know a couple Guaps
we can run this through.

957
00:48:35,574 --> 00:48:37,374
A'ight, bet.

958
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,419
Oh, shit, I gotta dip.

959
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,539
Wait, what?

960
00:48:41,581 --> 00:48:43,220
I gotta go, nigga.
Get the fuck out.

961
00:48:43,262 --> 00:48:44,862
- You just said that we were...
- I got shit to handle.

962
00:48:44,904 --> 00:48:46,664
Okay, leave the bag.

963
00:48:46,706 --> 00:48:48,465
And once I figure out what the
fuck is going on, I'll turn it.

964
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:49,867
Leave the bag?

965
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:51,589
No, I don't know
if I can do that, Cane.

966
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:53,391
You wanna
make the money or not?

967
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:58,556
Yeah, figure out your broke-ass

968
00:48:58,598 --> 00:49:01,038
Tariq daddy issues
outside on the curb.

969
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:11,769
Fuck.

970
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:17,935
Cane, wait, wait!

971
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,460
I need it tomorrow by ten a.m.,
not a second later.

972
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,942
Say less.

973
00:49:24,984 --> 00:49:26,623
Just send me the addy
and I'll pull up.

974
00:49:26,665 --> 00:49:28,668
Don't fuck me on this, bro.

975
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:32,310
Nigga, please.

976
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:34,992
Fuck.

977
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,600
Zeke is upstairs resting
right now,

978
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:46,123
but I'm telling you, Cane,
if he goes down for this shit,

979
00:49:46,165 --> 00:49:47,765
Lorenzo won't be able
to save your ass.

980
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:50,968
God couldn't walk through
that door and save you.

981
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:52,650
<i>You understand me?</i>

982
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:54,012
We gotta fix this.

983
00:49:54,054 --> 00:49:56,013
We? Nah, nigga, me.

984
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:58,856
All you ever do is
fuck things up for this family.

985
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:07,665
Y'all so smart.

986
00:50:07,707 --> 00:50:09,427
Y'all ain't tell him
not to use the card?

987
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:12,189
That's why she's mad.
She gave him the card.

988
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:14,832
But when you shot the nigga,
she never asked for it back.

989
00:50:14,874 --> 00:50:16,877
Oh, so she blamin' me for it.

990
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:19,197
Shit, man, if something
happens to Zeke...

991
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:20,598
She I'll never get over it.

992
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,959
I should've known
something was up

993
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:24,442
when Ev told me
Zeke missed practice.

994
00:50:24,484 --> 00:50:26,484
Dru, Monet got the call
while you were here.

995
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:28,528
What happened?

996
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:31,769
Monet wasn't here.

997
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:34,292
She left a few minutes
after you.

998
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:35,813
Where did she go?

999
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:51,229
Yo, what the fuck?

1000
00:50:51,271 --> 00:50:53,351
That's your fuckin' plan, huh?

1001
00:50:53,393 --> 00:50:54,913
Lettin' Zeke
go down for your murder

1002
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:56,474
'cause you knew he was
fuckin' his professor?

1003
00:50:56,516 --> 00:50:58,196
- What professor?
- Nigga, Carrie something.

1004
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:00,037
Listen, how the fuck
I'm supposed to know

1005
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,679
he's fuckin' his professor?

1006
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:03,041
I sent my lawyer up there
to handle that shit.

1007
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,443
You need to chill the fuck out.

1008
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:06,044
Chill the fuck out?

1009
00:51:06,086 --> 00:51:07,365
Nigga, they had Zeke down there
all fuckin' night

1010
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:08,686
askin' him questions.

1011
00:51:08,728 --> 00:51:10,168
They're fishin'.
That's what they do.

1012
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,689
I told you
Davis'll handle the shit.

1013
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:13,851
It's gonna be harder
than you think, Tariq.

1014
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,614
Zeke dropped Ramirez's PBA card
on them

1015
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,295
before Monet could get him out.

1016
00:51:17,337 --> 00:51:19,297
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Why the fuck would he do that?

1017
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:22,420
'Cause he don't know
fuckin' Ramirez is dead.

1018
00:51:22,462 --> 00:51:23,501
Monet never told him
what I did.

1019
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:25,022
Now Zeke's caught out there.

1020
00:51:25,064 --> 00:51:27,426
Now, if the cops find out
Ramirez is dead,

1021
00:51:27,468 --> 00:51:29,187
Zeke can get jammed
for both bodies,

1022
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:31,710
since it was your fuckin' idea
to link them together.

1023
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:33,231
Yeah, but you so fuckin' sure

1024
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:34,632
that the body
ain't comin' back, right?

1025
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,994
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

1026
00:51:36,036 --> 00:51:37,595
But when it comes down to it,

1027
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,438
you gonna take the weight
for all that shit.

1028
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,039
Ramirez, the professor,

1029
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:42,881
all that shit is gonna be
on your fuckin' ass.

1030
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:45,203
Listen, it ain't gonna
come down to shit, a'ight?

1031
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:46,965
Like I said, Davis'll fix this.

1032
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:48,846
Zeke'll be safe.
You'll be safe. I'll be safe.

1033
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:50,408
We'll all be safe, a'ight?

1034
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:54,252
Ain't nobody safe, nigga,
especially you.

1035
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:57,776
Fuck outta here.

1036
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,620
Fuck!

1037
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:08,467
Your family hired
some of the best

1038
00:52:08,509 --> 00:52:10,629
<i>appellate lawyers
in the state.</i>

1039
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:13,831
Yeah, but my father
thinks they robbed us.

1040
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:16,435
Unhappy clients always
believed they've been robbed.

1041
00:52:16,477 --> 00:52:20,318
But the truth is,
sometimes there is no way out.

1042
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,041
Which sadly is the case here.

1043
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,082
Are you sure?

1044
00:52:24,124 --> 00:52:25,763
Oh, yes. We're sure.

1045
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:28,767
Uh, Ms. Tejada,

1046
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:33,251
obviously we
will remain vigilant.

1047
00:52:33,293 --> 00:52:36,134
If there is indeed a way
in which we can be of service,

1048
00:52:36,176 --> 00:52:38,456
we'll absolutely reach out
to you and your mother.

1049
00:52:38,498 --> 00:52:41,100
No, she doesn't need to know,

1050
00:52:41,142 --> 00:52:43,143
but thank you for your time.

1051
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,111
Could you try to look
a little less gleeful

1052
00:52:52,153 --> 00:52:54,393
when you're sending
our paychecks out the door?

1053
00:52:54,435 --> 00:52:55,714
So what?

1054
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,195
I don't wanna represent
a psychotic,

1055
00:52:57,237 --> 00:52:58,957
murderous drug dealer.

1056
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:00,438
It was a lose-lose situation.

1057
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,721
If we had lost, he'd kill us.

1058
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,203
If we'd won,

1059
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:05,804
then Lorenzo Tejada
would go back to just...

1060
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:08,128
Sounds like
a repeat customer to me.

1061
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,650
What's in our best interest?

1062
00:53:13,814 --> 00:53:16,295
Remember that.

1063
00:53:24,144 --> 00:53:26,184
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1064
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:29,909
Shit, shit.

1065
00:53:29,951 --> 00:53:32,711
Come on, fuck.

1066
00:53:34,235 --> 00:53:37,035
Thank you, God.
You're a real one for this.

1067
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:43,122
Cane, where have you...

1068
00:53:43,164 --> 00:53:44,763
been all my life? Damn.

1069
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,726
Listen, I had a few
pickups of my own to make.

1070
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:50,008
- You what I mean?
- Yeah. No, I can see that.

1071
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,971
Bro, I didn't think you were
gonna show, to be honest.

1072
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:53,733
Nah, man, listen,
we business partners.

1073
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,694
You trust me,
I trust you, remember?

1074
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,096
Facts.

1075
00:53:57,138 --> 00:53:58,697
Hand me that bag.

1076
00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:06,866
Oh! Fuck!

1077
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:08,988
Bro, this is way more
than we needed.

1078
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,989
Man, you are right,
the streets are where it's at.

1079
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:13,512
You had me for real.

1080
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:14,794
Nah, I gotta link Tariq, but...

1081
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,155
Aw, "I gotta link Tariq"?

1082
00:54:16,197 --> 00:54:17,677
You sure
you wanna get your boy?

1083
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:19,078
Come on, you don't wanna join?

1084
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,840
Come on, let's have some fun.

1085
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:24,363
<i>Come on, baby. Let's have fun.</i>

1086
00:54:24,405 --> 00:54:26,886
Nope, I gotta go. I gotta go.

1087
00:54:26,928 --> 00:54:28,207
I gotta go.

1088
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:29,729
Fuckin' Tariq.

1089
00:54:33,614 --> 00:54:36,895
Why don't you buy yourself
something nice, on me?

1090
00:54:36,937 --> 00:54:38,577
My name's Brayden.

1091
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:40,900
And I think I'm in love
with you already.

1092
00:54:42,503 --> 00:54:43,783
"My name's Brayden.
I'm in love."

1093
00:54:45,186 --> 00:54:46,745
- Bye, Brayden.
- God damn it, Tariq!

1094
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:48,667
I know I'm gonna regret asking,

1095
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:51,271
but what's, uh...
what's going on, Cooper?

1096
00:54:51,313 --> 00:54:53,913
There is this case
I turned down,

1097
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:55,755
but it's the high-profile,

1098
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:58,998
big-fish shit
that uh, Davis likes, so...

1099
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,719
What was it?

1100
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:03,685
Lorenzo Tejada, appeal.

1101
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:07,607
I remember him.

1102
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:09,328
Manslaughter?

1103
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,450
Uh, and multiple drug offences.

1104
00:55:11,492 --> 00:55:13,572
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1105
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:16,936
Well, if Walter Griffith
was good at one thing,

1106
00:55:16,978 --> 00:55:19,899
<i>it was prosecuting
those types of cases.</i>

1107
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,982
Wait. Wait, that was
Walt Griffith's case?

1108
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:27,427
I heard he got fired
for-for, uh,

1109
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:28,788
tampering with evidence
or stealing drugs from...

1110
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,950
From the evidence locker, yeah.

1111
00:55:30,992 --> 00:55:32,832
<i>But he did a fantastic job
of putting monsters</i>

1112
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:34,193
like that Tejada guy away.

1113
00:55:42,123 --> 00:55:43,843
<i>Cooper, you coming?</i>

1114
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:46,886
Yeah, yeah. One sec.

1115
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,977
My bad, bro.
Parking was a bitch.

1116
00:55:58,019 --> 00:55:59,859
Listen, man, you can't be late
to shit like this.

1117
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:02,141
A'ight, I gotta know you
serious.

1118
00:56:02,183 --> 00:56:03,343
You got the money from
the dead drop, though, right?

1119
00:56:03,385 --> 00:56:05,387
- It was enough?
- Yeah.

1120
00:56:06,828 --> 00:56:09,669
I'm in this, Tariq. 30K.

1121
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:11,991
Know I got you bro.
You don't gotta worry.

1122
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,993
Speaking of business,
I know you said no

1123
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:15,515
about diversifying
to the streets, but I...

1124
00:56:15,557 --> 00:56:16,596
How many fucking times
I gotta tell you

1125
00:56:16,638 --> 00:56:17,837
we're not fuckin' with Cane, B?

1126
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:19,359
- I know.
- Listen, we pick up

1127
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:20,760
the product from him
like we've been doing

1128
00:56:20,802 --> 00:56:21,881
and continue business
like usual.

1129
00:56:21,923 --> 00:56:23,162
Be fine.

1130
00:56:24,886 --> 00:56:27,687
Gentlemen, I'm interrupting
my massage for this.

1131
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:29,289
See you found someone
you can trust.

1132
00:56:29,331 --> 00:56:31,291
Yes, I did.

1133
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:34,133
All Mr. Weston
has to do is sign here

1134
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:37,376
and you'll have a president
and a legitimate paycheck,

1135
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:39,980
provided you have my cut,
of course.

1136
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,024
I have your cut.

1137
00:56:42,384 --> 00:56:45,225
You ready, Mr. President?

1138
00:58:12,332 --> 00:58:17,332
