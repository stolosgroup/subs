00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,800
What's the key to being a great dad?

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:07,436
That's a tough one.

3
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:12,441
Giving them the freedom to be
whatever they want to be...
Right, exactly, and --

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,776
...Wha pilot, a president...
Me

5
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:15,578
And for us,
what we're gonna --

6
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:18,414
...Of a company
or of a country.

7
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:22,518
Patience.

8
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:25,488
Well, be their buddy.

9
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:27,056
That's your answer?

10
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:29,024
And stay in school.
No.

11
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:30,326
And don't do drugs.
No!

12
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,694
Just give me the answer.

13
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:32,995
Oh, god.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,667
Still thinking.

17
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,653
Hey.
Hey.

18
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:58,654
Hi.

19
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:59,855
Oh, okay.

20
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:01,457
Hi, um...

21
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,359
This is my husband,
phil.
Hi.

22
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:05,928
And that's my son, luke,
right there.

23
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:07,229
This is...
Desiree.

24
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:08,798
Desiree -- right.
Sorry.

25
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:11,333
Desiree just moved in
down the block.

26
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,668
Fun. Where?
314.

27
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:14,670
Oh,
the two-bedroom cottage

28
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,605
With the indoor/outdoor
family room.

29
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:18,274
Very good.
How did you --

30
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:19,775
Bet you're loving
that steam shower.

31
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:21,777
Phil, that's creepy.
Oh, sorry.

32
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:24,079
[ laughs ]
I'm a real-estate mogul.

33
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:26,449
What?! No, I am
a real-estate agent.

34
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,017
Um, we caravanned
that house.

35
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:29,185
Great, uh, deck.

36
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:30,319
Thanks.

37
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,588
I'm just there
till my divorce is final.

38
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:34,924
Now, who is coconuts enough
to dorce you?

39
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,393
We got to go,
but we'll see yoaround.

40
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,662
Well, we'll have to
have you over sometime.

41
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,397
I'd love it.
All right.

42
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:43,365
Bye.
Bye.

43
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,366
She's awesome.

44
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,968
No, we are never
having her over.

45
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:48,838
I heard she already slept
with two dads from the school.

46
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,005
What?
Mm-hmm.

47
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,107
That's...Horrible.

48
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,476
Luke: Dad!
Watch out.

49
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:55,244
Oh,
watch it, buddy.

50
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:56,412
Grandma.

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,546
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,315
That still looks like
a girl's bike.

53
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:01,083
Well, we'll add
more black tape.

54
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,753
Phil: My son has been riding
his sister's old bike.

55
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:06,155
Until he's
responsible enough

56
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,623
To take care
of his own bike.

57
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:09,492
Look, he spilled a soda
on my computer.

58
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,561
He ruined our digital
camera taking pictures
of himself underwater.

59
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,796
It's a girl's bike.

60
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:15,397
I'm all for teaching him
a lesson,

61
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:17,600
But I worry about
the ridicule he might get

62
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,435
From some
loudmouth bully.

63
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:20,636
[ horn honks ]

64
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,137
[ laughing ] hey.

65
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,606
Nice bike, sally.

66
00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:25,007
Dad!

67
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:27,209
Come on. He looks like
little bo peep on that thing.

68
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,778
Actually, not for long.
He's getting a new
bike this afternoon.

69
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:30,746
I am?
Mm-hmm.

70
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:32,014
He is?

71
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:34,717
Phil: Sometimes a man's
gotta put his foot down

72
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:36,585
And do what a man's gotta do.

73
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,487
And if the old lady
don't like it...

74
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:40,122
Honey?

75
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:44,994
...That's too damn bad.

76
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,763
Mitchell: Yes!
Who's excited, huh?

77
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,399
Cam, come on. Hurry up.
We're gonna be late.

78
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,135
It's a toddler play class,
not a flight to cabo.

79
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:55,371
We're gonna be judged enough
as the only gay parents there.

80
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:56,839
I don't want to be
the late ones, too.

81
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:59,608
<i>Wow.
Paisley and pink.</i>

82
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,810
Was there something wrong
with the fishnet tank top?

83
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:03,812
Obviously not --
I'm wearing it underneath.

84
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,414
Kidding.
Just chill, please.

85
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,716
I'm sorry. I just want to make
a good first impression.

86
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:10,052
You mean you want to fit in
and not terrify the villagers?

87
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,988
No, hey, come on.
Today is about lily, all right?

88
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,291
We -- her future best friend
might be in that class,

89
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:17,693
And I don't want to rub anyone
the wrong way.

90
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,863
Can you please just...
Change your shirt?

91
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,331
Fine.
You know what?

92
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,799
I'll just go put on a pair
of khakis, maybe a polo shirt,

93
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:24,833
And everybody will think

94
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,502
We're a couple
straight golfing buddies

95
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,704
Who just decided
to have a kid together.

96
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,308
Hey, I called
that place in napa

97
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,610
And got us upgraded
to a villa with a hot tub,

98
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:36,579
So pack whatever you wear
in a hot tub.

99
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:38,414
Mwah!

100
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:41,283
I usually wear nothing
when I'm in a hot tub.

101
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,620
Neralmente no uso nada
and my college roommate's wife
just had to get a new hip.

102
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,388
[ laughing ] sucker.

103
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,491
Manny's father is
taking him for a couple
of days to disneyland,

104
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,660
So we're gonna go...
To the wine country!

105
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:54,163
We're gonna drink some wine,
eat some good food.

106
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,066
You know, we would do something
like this a lot more often

107
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,934
If it sn't for,
you know, manny.

108
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,970
It's good.
He keeps us grounded.

109
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:02,738
Yeah.

110
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:05,240
Like fog at  airport.

111
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:06,942
Limo gets here at 4:00.

112
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,744
This morning, I thought
I'd go over to the club,
hit a few balls.

113
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,480
No! What about the fan
in manny's room?

114
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:12,681
Oh, yeah.

115
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:13,782
Call a guy.

116
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,352
No! You're supposed to
do it with him.

117
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:19,154
It's important that
we teach him how to
do things for himself.

118
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:21,991
In my culture, men take great
pride in doing physicalabor.

119
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:25,527
I know. That's why I hire
people from your culture.

120
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:26,862
[ laughs ]

121
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,797
You're snny!

122
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,866
I'm gonna share that one
with my next husband

123
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:33,369
When we're spending
all your money.

124
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:37,139
Dad, this is
the coolest bike ever.

125
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:38,240
Awesome.

126
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:40,376
So, listen, buddy.

127
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:42,177
Certain members
of this family

128
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,713
Don't think you can take care
of this bad boy.

129
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,715
U mean mom?
Your words, not mine.

130
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:50,552
Look, uh,
your mom and I are a team,

131
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,389
And she -- we feel
like this is a chance

132
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,891
For you to show
some responsibility.

133
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,993
Don't make us
look like jerks here.

134
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,194
I won't.

135
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:01,330
Okay.
One more rule.

136
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:02,398
What?

137
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:05,234
Have, like,
three buttloads of fun.

138
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:06,301
Thanks, dad.

139
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:16,679
So, let's do this.

140
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,547
Okay, but I need to be done
by 3:00.

141
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:20,616
That's when
my dad's picking me up.

142
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:21,984
Hey, if we're not done
by 3:00,

143
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,686
I'm gonna tie a noose
on this thing.

144
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:25,521
Gloria: In colombia,
there's a saying --

145
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:29,224
If you have two stubborn burros
that don't like each other,

146
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,593
You tie them to the same cart.

147
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,396
The ceiling fan is the cart.

148
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,532
My dad's takg me
on space mountain.

149
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,535
It's supposed to be
really fast, but he's
not scared of anything.

150
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:42,004
He d't even wear a seat belt
when he drives.

151
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:43,505
Wow.
How about that?

152
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:44,973
He killed a bear once.

153
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,177
Really? Was the bear sitting
in the passenger seat?

154
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,713
Read me the instructions.

155
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,980
"safety tips.

156
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:54,183
Warning. To reduce the risk
of electrical shock --"

157
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,684
We can skip that.

158
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,154
Uh, "failure
to heed these warnings

The truth?
He's a total flake.

In fact, the only way
he's like superman

Is that they both landed

Luke, you in there?

317
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:06,828
Luke: Hey, dad.

318
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:07,863
Hey.
Hey, buddy.

319
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,264
[ video game beeping ]

320
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,466
That was, uh, that was
pretty fun today, huh,

321
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:12,634
Gettin' a new bike?

322
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:13,902
Yeah, it was awesome.

323
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,737
So, uh, what happened
after I took off?

324
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:17,673
Anything you want to
share with me?

325
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,041
Not really.

326
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,842
So if I went out
to the garage

327
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,111
To take a picture
for the scrapbook,

328
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,646
There'd be no surprises?

329
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,683
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it.

330
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,951
I just made a mistake.

331
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:30,986
<i>Yeah, a big mistake!</i>

332
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:33,055
You're making me look
really bad here.

333
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:35,057
I told mom
you were ready for this.

334
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:36,191
It's just a scratch, dad.

335
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,859
That's not the point,
luke -- what?

336
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:40,128
I scratched it
on my way into the driveway.

337
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:41,530
I'm sorry.

338
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:44,099
So...It's not stolen?

339
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,535
No. Why?

340
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,638
That's good, 'cause...

341
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:51,940
There are bad people out there
who would steal a bike.

342
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:53,742
Those are thieves.

343
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,612
You sit there and think
about the scratch part.
That's not good, either.

344
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,946
[ crack ]
gonna fix that step.

345
00:12:58,014 --> 00:12:59,881
So don't scratch anything
while I'm gone.

346
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,450
Unless it itches --
that's different.

347
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:06,021
The good news is,
luke has his bike.

348
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,656
More good news --

349
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:09,925
I taught some random kid
a valuable lesson

350
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,460
By stealing his bike.

351
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:14,029
Best news --
claire knows nothing.

352
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:17,099
So, I figure
I'll just dump the new bike

353
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,800
Where I stole the first bike.

354
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,036
That way,
random kid gets his back,

355
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,805
And this new bike doesn't rais
a lot of embarrassing questions,

356
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:25,007
Like why I had it

357
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,843
Or who boosted who
through a bedroom window.

358
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,412
So, everybods happy.

359
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,649
Uh-oh.

360
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:34,183
Oh, son of a --

361
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,219
You gave me
the wrong screwdriver.

362
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,254
Maybe you're
just using it wrong.

363
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:39,856
My dad's great with tools.

364
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,991
He can get the wheels off a car
in less than a minute.

365
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,193
Just get me to wine country.
Just get me to wine --

366
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:45,194
Ooh. Oh!

367
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:46,429
Aah!
Sorry.

368
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:47,964
I think
my arm is broken.

369
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,332
Relax.
It's not broken.

370
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,401
How do you know?
You don't know anything!

371
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:53,102
You have no concern
for safety.

372
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,038
Because it didn't hit you
that hard.

373
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:57,440
Why don't you just say it?
You don't want me around.

374
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:58,841
You know what?
Right now, I don't.

375
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,743
I don't want to be
with you, either.

376
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:02,078
I'm gonna go wait
for my dad.

How will I ever finish?

00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:08,751
You know what?
I wish you never married my mom.

380
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,053
I hate living here.

381
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,521
You think
I like this arrangement?

382
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:14,891
I got a two-seater
parked in the driveway.

383
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,141
[ laughs ] I mean,
I don't understand.

384
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,210
Why are you trying to sneak
around and hide things from me?

385
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,578
I actually think
it's pretty funny.

386
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:23,746
You do?

387
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,180
I do, yes.

388
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:27,683
I mean, you steal a bike
from some poor kid

389
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:30,219
And then the bike
gets stolen from you --

390
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,387
That's hilarious.

391
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,656
[ laughs ]
classic me, right?

392
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:36,392
Yeah! So, where were you
when it got stolen?

393
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,927
Oh,
I was getting some gas.

394
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:39,228
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

395
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,363
You don't stand near the car
when you get gas?

396
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:43,098
Yep, but, uh,
I went inside

397
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,567
To get a soda
because I was thirsty,

398
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,669
And if I had a sod
I wouldn't be thirsty anymore,

399
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,871
So I bought one, and then
I drank it all right there,

400
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:50,306
Which is why
I don't have the can.

401
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:51,540
Well, honey, please,

402
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,543
Let's try to remember that
I'm your wife, not your mom,

403
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:57,846
So in the future, you don't need
to hide things from me, okay?

404
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,848
Okay.
Okay.

Claire:
What are you doing, phil?

408
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,056
I just love you
so darn much!

409
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,724
I know, I love you, too,
but that hurts.

410
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,159
Let's get you inside.

411
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:11,193
It is a hot one.
Hi!

412
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,595
I know.
That's hurting a lot.

413
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,196
This is a hot one.
Hello! Hi, there!

414
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:15,798
Oh, hi!
Hi, again.

415
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:18,000
I, uh,
found your bike.

416
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:19,201
Uh...

417
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,770
Oh, good! You -- the --
at the gas station?

418
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,238
No, at my house.

419
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,441
One of my neighbors saw it
and put it in my garage

420
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,676
When you were
in my bedroom, so...

421
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:32,982
Classic me?

422
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,884
Come on, honey,
grab the block.

423
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,653
See, like  did.
You got to do that.

424
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:38,821
You got to grab it like him.

425
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:41,557
So, you seen
any m-movies lately?

426
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,891
Uh, yeah.

427
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,962
You know, my husband and I
just rented, uh, "mamma mia,"

428
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,597
Which I liked, but...

429
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:51,166
I don't know that meryl streep
was the right choice.

430
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:53,268
What did you think?

431
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,638
Cameron:
Excuse me --

432
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,674
Meryl streep could play batman
and be the right choice.

433
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,175
She's perfection,

434

Whether she's divorcing kramer,
whether she's wearing prada.

435
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:06,081
Don't even get me started
on "sophie's choice."

436
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,550
I get emotional
thinking about it.

437
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,621
She couldn't forgive herself.

[ whimpers ]

439
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:19,695
I guess she was okay.

Mitchell:
Grab the block, sweetheart.

You're not even interested
in it.

Yeah.
Would you like
a videotape?

I don't know

to do it again, so...

458
00:16:57,702 --> 00:17:00,770

all of our classes.

bringing cameras in.</i>

out of the moment.</i>

[ laughter ]

00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:30,033
Are you kidding me?

476
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:31,434
I am so sorry.

477
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:32,535
Look at those queens.

478
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:34,170
I would have killed
with this crowd,

479
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,872
But you had to
clip my wings,

480
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,707
Which you used to be
the wind beneath.

481
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:39,042
I know. I'm sorry.

482
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,777
This class has turned me
into a complete monster.

483
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:41,878
I'm -- I just --

484
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,379
I'll make it up to you.
Let's just go.

485
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:46,349
Okay, it's time
for parents dance!

486
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,085
Everybody dance
for your baby!

[ dance music plays ]

488
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,257
You want to do it,
don't you?

489
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:56,025
I do.

490
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,894
I want to dance
for my baby.

491
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:59,896
[ sighs ] all right,
go on, get in there.

492
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:00,897
You sure?

493
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:03,466
Make that horsey move.
Go ahead.

[ all cheering ]

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,155
Oh,

Hello.

00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,875
Hey, javier.

500
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:48,878
Manny's waiting for you outside.

501
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:50,446
What?

502
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:53,116
Why not?

503
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,652
Hold that thought.

504
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:59,622
His son's sitting on a curb,
waiting to go to disneyland,

505
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,960
And superman can't drag himself
away from a craps table.

<i>And I'm the jerk.</i>

507
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,667
Say, listen...

508
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,969
I, uh...

509
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:15,171
Sorry, but I got
some bad news.

510
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,339
What?

511
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,808
Your dad
couldn't make it.

512
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:20,143
Why not?

513
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:21,544
The plane was full,

514
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:24,280
And this old lady
needed to get home,

515
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:25,982
So he gave up his seat.

516
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,550
You're making that up,
aren't you?

517
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:28,551
No.

518
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:30,020
He just didn't
want to come.

519
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,122
Are you kidding me?
He was very upset.

520
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:35,325
He was dying to see you.

521
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:38,328
In fact,
look what he sent.

522
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:39,496
A limo?

523
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:40,764
Yeah!

524
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,667
He wanted me and your mom
to take you to disneyland.

525
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:45,535
I told you
he was an awesome dad.

526
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:47,604
Yeah, he's a prince.

Let me see...

528
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,009
Okay, the key to being
a good dad?

529
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,979
Look, sometimes things work out
just the way you want.

530
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:56,347
Race you to the end.

531
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:59,116
That is not a good idea...
For you.

532
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:02,753
Sometimes they don't.

533
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:04,655
You got to hang in there...

534
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:07,925
Because when all is said
and done...

535
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:13,230
...90% of being a dad --

Hey!
That's my bike!

Oh.
I don't, uh...

539
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:34,251
Well...

540
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:37,403
I was giving it back!

[ voice breaking ]
she couldn't forgive herself.

542
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:45,361
And...

543
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:46,863
She had to choose.

544
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:49,465
And I think
because now I have --

545
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,301
We have -- we have l--

546
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:52,635
We have lily,

547
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:57,073
It's so hard to imagine
being put in that position.

548
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:59,542
If I had to choose
lily or mitchell,

I mean, I would choose l--
