Pasquale.

Pasquale!

00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:16,923
Pasquale, wake up.

5
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,883
What happened? Nothing.

6
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:41,323
No, tell me what happened.

7
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:42,763
No, it was nothing.

8
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:45,379
It was just some shit
with some Lebo dogs.

9
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:47,003
Yeah, did you start it?

10
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:49,603
No, I didn't start it.

11
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:09,043
Oh what, you can't take
a joke, fellas? Come on.

12
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:10,203
They were pretty sick rhymes,

13
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:12,803
but, ah, you gotta give
me credit for that.

14
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:15,443
Hey, LC!

15
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:16,723
Little Crazy.

16
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,883
What's happening, man?
What's goin' on, my brother?

17
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:22,163
Nothing. Oh, yeah?

18
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:25,443
I hear your cousins were making
some calls from Supermax.

19
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:27,163
How'd he get that
phone in there, mate?

20
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,043
Someone sneak it up
their arse, or what?

21
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,483
That phone must stink.

22
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:33,043
I would not be putting
that thing near my face.

23
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,923
Someone got a charger
in there too, huh? Huh?

24
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,099
You're talkin' shit, brother.
Why don't you fuck off?

25
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:41,523
Hey, whaddya bein' a prick
for? I was just mucking around.

26
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:43,763
Just show me some respect, bro.

27
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:45,083
I'm a 'Ndrangheta.

28
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:46,763
What's that?

29
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:48,043
Calabrian old school.

30
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,403
Goes way back to the old days.

31
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,523
Never heard of it. Yeah?

32
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,443
'Cause you're a dumb
Arab. You don't know shit.

33
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:55,763
If you knew anything,

34
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,139
you'd put respect on
this Barbaro name.

35
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:58,523
It's 400-years-old.

36
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:03,883
Do yourself a favour
and fuck off, you dog.

37
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:06,763
Why you so upset, bro? I
was just muckin' around.

38
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,963
Get outta my face,
you little mutt.

39
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:11,763
Yeah, what'll happen if I don't?

40
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,483
What, you wanna have a crack?

41
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,163
You little prick, huh? Huh?

42
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,563
Fuckin' dog, huh?

43
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:26,123
Huh? You fuckin' dog.

44
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,723
You little mutt!

45
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,123
You little prick, huh?

46
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:39,163
Yeah, Brothers For Life?

47
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:40,859
More like Bumchums For
Life, you fuckin' dogs!

48
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:41,963
You're a weak, dog.

49
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,163
Yeah, you little rat dog.

50
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:44,443
Big for nothing. Yeah?

51
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:45,939
Hey, guess what? When
I get outta here,

52
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:47,963
I'm gonna fuck your
missus in the arse.

53
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,403
My missus?

54
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:50,733
Watch your mouth. You're dead!

55
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,283
You fucking dog,
I'm gonna kill you!

56
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,003
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!
Yeah, you little rat dog, huh?

57
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,563
Oh!

58
00:03:57,643 --> 00:04:00,763
You just signed your own
death warrant, you dog.

59
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,803
But where are the
kids? They're at kindy?

60
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:11,003
Yeah. Yeah, and then
there's dramas with Maria.

61
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,923
Why? What's up?

62
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:16,003
She's been biting kids.
It's happened a few times.

63
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,763
Why is she biting?

64
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,643
I don't know, but we've gotta
go see the teacher, Mrs Kimble.

65
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:21,963
She's not happy. When?

66
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,323
Now.

67
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:24,403
How come?

68
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,283
Because we've gotta
pick up the kids.

69
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:28,139
I thought we were gonna
go home and have a root.

70
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:29,603
We just had one.

71
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:31,683
Yeah, but I meant
like a proper one.

72
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:33,563
What was the last
one, not good enough?

73
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:35,883
Oh, I don't know, maybe
I feel like another one.

74
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:37,603
You're a greedy root pig.

75
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,923
How'd you make bail, by the way?

76
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:45,323
Oh, good behaviour.

77
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:47,563
Oh yeah, was this before
or after the fight?

78
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,099
I hear you've been in
the wars, Pasquale?

79
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:01,203
Yeah, no, sweet as.

80
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,323
Have a seat, mate. Yeah.

81
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:07,523
So, we hear you might have
some information for us.

82
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:10,283
That depends, mate, that depends.
What kind of info youse after?

83
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,179
You're not gonna waste
our time again, are you?

84
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,043
Ah, come on, I'm
just muckin' around.

85
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,459
I've got something
for youse for sure,

86
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:18,763
but first, I want something,
you know what I mean?

87
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,603
It doesn't work like that, Pat.

88
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,643
You of all people should
know that. I want bail.

89
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:25,057
If I'm gonna give you something,

90
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,979
I wanna know what guarantees
youse are gonna give me.

91
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,363
None.

92
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:31,123
That's bullshit. Forget it.

93
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:33,419
OK, Pat. If you've got nothing
to give us, we'll get going.

94
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:36,163
Oh, alright, alright, alright,
alright, alright, you pricks.

95
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:37,723
I've got some guns.

96
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:39,963
Guns? What kind of guns?

97
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:42,723
Big guns.

98
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:15,443
Maria's a very sweet little
girl, but she's excitable.

99
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:17,603
She gets over-emotional
at times.

100
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:18,963
It's probably due to the fact

101
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:21,083
her speech hasn't
quite fully developed.

102
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:23,483
She gets frustrated, yeah?

103
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,243
And it's in those times that
she's sometimes lashing out,

104
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,403
and it's coming in
the form of bites.

105
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,603
What kind of bites?
Like little nips?

106
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:32,763
Well, no.

107
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,459
There's been one or
two quite serious bites

108
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:37,203
where she's broken through the
skin and left nasty bruises.

109
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,523
But she's only little.

110
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:40,539
She probably doesn't even
know what she's doing.

111
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,083
Yeah, I appreciate that, but
in the interests of safety

112
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,483
of the other children,

113
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:45,683
I'm afraid if it doesn't stop,

114
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,259
we're going to have
to ask her to leave.

115
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,763
It's the law.

116
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:51,763
Maria!

117
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:53,083
It's your daddy!

118
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:54,363
Come here, darling.

119
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:56,283
It's OK, it's
daddy. Daddy's home.

120
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:57,883
Hello, my beautiful girl.

121
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:59,259
Oh, my god, I've
missed you so much.

122
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,603
He's been away, working.

123
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:03,203
I'm a dinosaur! Gnar,
gnar, gnar, gnar!

124
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,003
"The Lord said to Moses,

125
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,283
"go to Pharaoh and say to him,

126
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:18,483
"'Let my people go, so
that they may worship me.'

127
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:21,763
"If you refuse, I will
send a plague of frogs

128
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,403
"on your whole country." Frogs?

129
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,723
Yeah. What's a plague, Daddy?

130
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:28,603
A plague's kinda like,
like, a shitload.

131
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:29,763
Means like millions of 'em.

132
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,203
Millions of frogs?

133
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:33,203
Yeah, frogs everywhere.

134
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:34,883
"The Lord to Moses,

135
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:39,043
"stretch out your hand with
your staff over the streams"

136
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:41,363
"and canals and ponds"

137
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:45,163
"and make frogs come up
on the land of Egypt."

138
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:47,523
How many frogs were there?

139
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:49,003
I don't know, heaps.

140
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,283
What colour were they?

141
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,563
I don't know,
green. Brown, maybe.

142
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:54,803
Ross catches frogs. Does he?

143
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,363
I'd kiss the frogs.

144
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,563
What for? They could
turn into a prince.

145
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:00,003
I've eaten frogs.

146
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,283
You can eat their legs.

147
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:02,683
Eww, I don't wanna eat frogs!

148
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:03,723
Nah, nah, they're good.

149
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:05,419
They taste like, ah,
like chicken wings.

150
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:08,323
Dad, I think a frog
plague would be awesome.

151
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:11,203
Yeah, be pretty cool to
see all them frogs, huh?

152
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,643
Alright, it's gettin' late.

153
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:15,363
Come on, you little monster.

154
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:16,643
Bedtime.

155
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:19,483
Oww!

156
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:20,723
Oww!

157
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,363
Under the covers, bro.

158
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:25,603
Come on.

159
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,083
Goodnight, little one.

160
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:30,523
Goodnight, princess.

161
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,323
Goodnight, Daddy.

162
00:09:44,003 --> 00:09:46,603
Pasquale, I told you
to put down that sword.

163
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:48,283
Stop hurting the dog!

164
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,443
He's not a dog,
he's a cassowary.

165
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,083
You stop that!

166
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:57,043
Get to school.

167
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,883
Hey, what are you doing,
you little shit bag?

168
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:18,043
Argh! Let's go.

169
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:21,043
Help!

170
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,363
Argh!

171
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:29,243
It got paid out.

172
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,739
Hey, Les. What are
you tryin' to say?

173
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:32,163
Get off the phone, you wanker.

174
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,203
Mate, that's a load of
bullshit. You know it.

175
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,459
But I've gotta go,
mate, I've gotta go.

176
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,979
I'm not dealing with
this. I'll ring you later.

177
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:39,083
Alright, bye.

178
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:40,243
Idiots.

179
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:41,283
Brother! Hey.

180
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,003
Oh, look at you,
man! Yeah, mate.

181
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,643
Huge. So how many
things did you want?

182
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:46,219
Hey, hey, hey, keep
it down, you dickhead.

183
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:47,523
Relax. Come here, come here.

184
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:48,803
Come over here.

185
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:52,963
So how many things did you want?

186
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,083
Just give us ten.

187
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:55,563
A lot of pre-packing.

188
00:11:56,403 --> 00:11:57,443
Thank you.

189
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:58,563
It's all there, bro.

190
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:00,283
Yeah. No worries. Beautiful.

191
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:02,883
Did you hear about Little
Crazy? What about him?

192
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:04,379
He's' got his bail
hearing in a few days.

193
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:05,523
He's not gonna get bail.

194
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:07,459
What'd you say to him to get so
pissed off with you, brother?

195
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:08,939
Said I was gonna root
his missus in the arse.

196
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:10,419
You'd better hope he
doesn't get bail, mate,

197
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:11,699
I'm telling you. I
couldn't give a shit.

198
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:12,763
Hey, come here. Come with me.

199
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,083
Where? Here.

200
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:15,203
Come here, have a look at this.

201
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:16,883
Have a look at what?

202
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:19,203
It's the best view in
Sydney right there, mate.

203
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:21,003
Look at it. The best view?

204
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,083
How can you say that?
How can you not, mate?

205
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:24,363
That's a world-class view.

206
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,723
What do you mean?
It's an alright view.

207
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:28,339
There's plenty of other
good views around here.

208
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:29,699
You can't say that
this is the best one.

209
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:30,763
Yes, you bloody can, man.

210
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:32,339
Look, New Year's Eve,
here, the fireworks.

211
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:34,139
There's no other place to
be in the whole city, mate.

212
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:35,579
Look at it. That's no
bullshit. You serious?

213
00:12:35,603 --> 00:12:37,739
What about the Toaster
building? It's too close, man.

214
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:39,819
I've been there New Years Eve,
mate. You can't see anything.

215
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,123
You can't see nothing.

216
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,619
It's like you're sitting
too close to the TV.

217
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:44,099
You sound up yourself.
"This is the best view!"

218
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,859
Can you stop being a dickhead?
You sound like a poofter.

219
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:47,003
Stop being a dickhead, man.

220
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,163
Hey, you know what
that is out there?

221
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:49,739
Look at it. Money. What
are you talking about?

222
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:52,139
That's billions of dollars locked
up in bricks and mortar, mate.

223
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,779
Right there, mate. That's
where the real money is.

224
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:54,763
Building, mate.

225
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,093
The big players in this town,
mate, they run that game.

226
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,739
Why do you think I'm
getting into building, mate?

227
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:00,739
Who's richer, drug dealers
or property developers?

228
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:01,963
Think about it.

229
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:05,563
Yeah, alright,
I'll take it. What?

230
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:06,723
This apartment, right here.

231
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,139
The second it's
finished, I'm movin' in.

232
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,499
You just said you
don't like the view.

233
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,219
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, I've been
thinkin' these things a lot lately.

234
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:13,963
Yeah. What are
you talking about?

235
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,603
Goin' places, movin' up.

236
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:17,323
Bruv, I'm free. I'm outta jail.

237
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,483
I've got connections.
I've got a heap of cash.

238
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:21,699
I'm not thinkin' small-time anymore.
Do you think it's that easy?

239
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:23,379
I'm not gonna be some
shitkicker, I'm gonna be a boss.

240
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,523
Do you think it's
that easy, brother?

241
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,643
Listen to me, brother.

242
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:27,699
You wanna be something, you
wanna be somewhere in this world,

243
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,779
you want something, you gotta go
out there and you gotta take it.

244
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:31,139
It's what's called
positive speaking.

245
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,923
It's called speaking
out of your arse.

246
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:36,043
Shut up, you idiot. Hey,
I'm movin' up, seriously.

247
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,243
Hey, get in here.

248
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:38,539
What are you doin'?
Takin' a photo.

249
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:39,859
I don't take selfies.
Shut up, shut up.

250
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:41,083
One for me, please.

251
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:44,203
You never actually own the car.

252
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,403
What's that mean?

253
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:47,763
Well, the title's not in
your name. You don't own it.

254
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,043
Who owns it?

255
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:50,243
Some company in Dubai.

256
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:51,563
It's all untraceable.

257
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:54,443
Your name only appears on
the insurance as the driver.

258
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:57,003
But look, mate, bottom line,
you pay cash for the car,

259
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,843
they transfer ownership
to the company,

260
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:00,123
then you get to drive it.

261
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:02,299
You wanna sell it, you
just bring it back.

262
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:05,083
They give you back your money,
minus a bit of depreciation.

263
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:07,603
The original cash is washed

264
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:09,683
and you've been driving
a Lambo this whole time.

265
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:13,243
What's not to like, mate?

266
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:18,643
You wanna take it for a spin?

267
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,923
Yeah.

268
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,683
Always known I was
gonna be a boss,

269
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,138
ever since I was
a kid, I knew it.

270
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:06,899
And not like all the
old-timers in Griffith.

271
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,339
They were just a bunch
of wankers, mate.

272
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:10,539
Proper dinosaurs, you know, of
the round ones and these ones

273
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:11,563
and those ones.

274
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,259
They were old school but
it was always with the gear

275
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:15,179
and da-da-da-da-da. They
thought they were the bomb

276
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:16,739
but really, they were
just a bunch of wankers.

277
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:18,723
Anyway, that's why I had
the dust-up with 'em.

278
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:20,979
You know, they started sellin'
the pingers and that bullshit,

279
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,403
so I thought I'd
give it a crack.

280
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:23,763
I did it way better than 'em.

281
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:24,843
Better gear, cheaper.

282
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,019
Suddenly I'm doin' good, next
thing you know they're like,

283
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:29,003
"Hey, this is our spot,"
you know what I mean?

284
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,123
Anyway, I told the lot of 'em,

285
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:33,203
"Go fuck yourselves. Piss off,
you bunch of wankers," you know.

286
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,763
Sydney's where the real cash is.

287
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:35,843
It's big-time shit here.

288
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:38,603
Hey, I've got a Lambo, I've
got a place with the best view

289
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,723
in the whole city,
I've got a hot wife.

290
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,883
I'm going places,
you know what I mean?

291
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:45,123
Heard about Little
Crazy? He got bail.

292
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,883
When? Couple of days ago.

293
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,443
Who gives a shit, eh?

294
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:49,963
Well, he's gunnin' for you.

295
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:51,603
Who told you that?

296
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,003
Apparently you said something
vulgar about his missus.

297
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,363
Yeah, so what if I
did? Who gives a shit?

298
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:57,643
What, you not worried?

299
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:00,963
Nah. Nah, I couldn't
give a shit.

300
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:05,403
Yeah?

301
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:08,483
Mate, he was talkin' shit
about my missus, I told you.

302
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:10,763
Brother, he said he
was gonna stick it

303
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:12,523
in her arse.

304
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:14,123
Yeah.

305
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:15,899
All the boys heard it,
every single one of 'em.

306
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:17,443
All the boys were there.

307
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:19,803
Alright, fine.

308
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:21,643
You know, he's dead.

309
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,563
Unless he gives me 300K.

310
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:25,083
If he give me 300K, you know,

311
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:26,403
I'll forget about the insult.

312
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:29,843
He doesn't give me 300K, I'm
gonna put two in his head.

313
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:32,083
Yalla, bye.

314
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:35,683
He fucking, you never talk shit
about another bloke's missus,

315
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:36,763
you know what I mean?

316
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:38,379
That's like, that's an
area you do not cross.

317
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:39,403
Yeah.

318
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,019
And I'm gonna fuckin' kill
you once you cross it,

319
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,819
'cause it says there's barbed wire.
It's got the X. It's got the skull.

320
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:44,803
Do not enter.

321
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:47,123
He fuckin' entered, and
now he's fuckin' dead,

322
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:49,019
you hear what I mean? Like
I might kill him, mate.

323
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,763
It's easy for me. Like
one, two, pup-pup,

324
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,619
you know what I mean, two
bullets, like all I need is two,

325
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:54,339
all I need is two, all I need
is fuckin' one bullet, cuz.

326
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,259
One bullet through the heart,
pierce him through the heart.

327
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,203
Yalla, drive to Maccas,
get me a Big Mac.

328
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:00,643
300K?

329
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:01,763
What, is he off his head, mate?

330
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:04,483
That's your problem, mate.
He's completely insane.

331
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:06,403
Why would he think I'm
gonna pay him 300,000.

332
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,692
Mate, to be perfectly honest,

333
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,263
I don't even think
he wants the 300K.

334
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:11,043
I reckon he just
wants to knock you,

335
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,843
and he's just come
up with a number

336
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:14,459
that makes him feel
good about not doing it.

337
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,979
You're talking shit. Does
it make sense to you?

338
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,259
What he's trying to
say, you dumbarse,

339
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,403
is if you don't pay
up, you're dead.

340
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:19,819
You think I'm scared
of that little prick?

341
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:20,803
Well, you should be, man.

342
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,539
You said you were going to
root his wife in the arse.

343
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:23,563
Yeah, what about it?

344
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,539
These blokes knock people for
making fun of their haircuts.

345
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:27,723
You said you're gonna
have anal with his wife?

346
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,083
What do you think?

347
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,163
I pay that little prick,

348
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:33,739
everyone in Sydney's
gonna stand over me.

349
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:34,803
Yeah? Yeah.

350
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:36,083
Unless I knock him first.

351
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:39,323
Oh, yeah? Mate, you wouldn't be
able to knock a disabled Nanna,

352
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:41,320
let alone a psychopath
like Little Crazy, mate.

353
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:42,403
Yeah, yeah?

354
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:43,939
How would you like a
smack in the head, huh?

355
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,259
Hey, hey, now you're
getting personal.

356
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:46,803
Take it easy. We're
on the same side.

357
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:48,539
Hey listen, we got a
plan all worked out.

358
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:49,563
Yeah, what?

359
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,923
Farhad Qaumi. They
call him the Afghan.

360
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:55,283
He's the head of the
Blacktown chapter of BFL.

361
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:56,563
Well, what about him?

362
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,299
Well there's shit goin'
down with the Brothers.

363
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:00,523
Their top dog, Bassam
Hamzy, he's in Supermax

364
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:03,763
and just got 15 years added
to his sentence, so he's gone.

365
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:05,363
Yeah, I reckon
they're goin' tits up.

366
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:06,403
Why?

367
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,059
Well, half the brothers
hate the other half.

368
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,083
So how does that help me?

369
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,563
Well, you get in
with The Afghan.

370
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:12,203
He's a powerful
bloke in Blacktown.

371
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,203
Runs the whole show
and the best thing is,

372
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:15,603
he hates Little Crazy.

373
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:17,779
It could be good to get in
with him, you know what I mean?

374
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:18,763
He's majorly cashed up.

375
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:20,299
Good for all of us, you
know what I'm saying?

376
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:21,579
Hey, man, awesome
party. Thanks a lot.

377
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:22,923
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No worries.

378
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,219
No, no, seriously, though, thank you
so much for bringing us down here.

379
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:26,539
We were just gonna
have a quiet party...

380
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,003
Piss off, would
you? We're talkin'.

381
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:31,443
This Afghan bloke. Hey!
What do I do about him?

382
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:33,163
I'll try and set up a meeting.

383
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:36,323
You go in, you have a chat, you
try and get into his good books.

384
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:38,643
What do you reckon?

385
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:40,982
Yeah, what's he
s'posed to be like?

386
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:42,523
Well, he's a very scary bloke.

387
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:45,083
All the crims in Sydney are
shittin' themselves over him.

388
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:46,643
But that doesn't matter, right?

389
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,283
He might just save your life.

390
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:58,163
And two more, come on. Two more.

391
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:01,283
I'm not doin' it for you.
Let's go. Drop your traps.

392
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:05,403
Posture. Nice. Let's go,
one more. One more. All you.

393
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,403
All you. Nice,
you're almost there.

394
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:09,083
And nice.

395
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:11,243
Look at the difference.
Look at the difference.

396
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:14,003
Come and have a look at why those
last two reps are so important.

397
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,563
.

398
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:17,259
Yeah, just rotate towards
that a little bit.

399
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:18,523
Nice.

400
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:19,923
That.

401
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:23,123
Yeah, I look
fuckin' hectic, boy.

402
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,123
I'm gonna post that.
Please like it.

403
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:27,123
Priorities, mate.
You're pumped. Let's go.

404
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:33,003
Holy shit, look at that chick.

405
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,603
Ah, Zina. What, you know her?

406
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,483
Every day, mate, she's
in here. Bullshit.

407
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:39,763
Furniture. Look at those tits.

408
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:41,923
Top-quality fakes,
mate. Expensive.

409
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,563
Oh yeah, that's an incredible
rack of tits, though.

410
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:45,723
Yeah.

411
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:47,163
Hey, hey, hey, one second. What?

412
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:48,443
One second. Just one second.

413
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:49,843
See you.

414
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:57,843
Hey. How's it goin'?

415
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,963
I'm OK. You're Zina?

416
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,003
Yes.

417
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,059
My mate over there, Mohey, he
works here. Told me your name.

418
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,283
Oh.

419
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:05,323
So you come here a bit, right?

420
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,059
I mean, you look like
you, you like to work out.

421
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,763
Like, you look good. Like toned.

422
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:10,843
Thanks.

423
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,483
Nah, nah, seriously,
your body is amazing.

424
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:15,003
Can I ask you something?

425
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,603
Do you do anything like a special
diet or anything like that?

426
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,203
No, I don't have a special diet.

427
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:20,243
You serious?

428
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:24,363
Well I mean, I avoid
sugar, and salt and gluten,

429
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:26,763
processed carbs, and dairy.

430
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:30,163
Oh, and I take amino,
protein, probiotics, Omega-3s,

431
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:33,243
and you know, the usual supplements
like calcium, magnesium,

432
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:36,083
turmeric, flaxseed oil,
zinc, B-supplements.

433
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:37,483
Oh, and I drink kombucha.

434
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,323
But other than that,
I don't do anything.

435
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,172
And what do you do for a job?

436
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,643
You must be like a
model or something.

437
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:48,803
I'm a dancer. Well,
shit, no wonder.

438
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,683
That's why your body's so hot.

439
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,923
Hey, wanna know something?

440
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,739
There's plenty of smoking
hot dancers out there,

441
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:57,083
but I reckon probably for sure

442
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:58,699
you're pretty much
hotter than any of them,

443
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:00,923
and the reason is
because you have like a,

444
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:02,243
like a model's face.

445
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,203
Like you could be
a model easily.

446
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:05,563
I don't think I could.

447
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:07,123
Nah, nah, nah, no bullshitting.

448
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:10,123
Your face is almost as
pretty as Miranda Kerr's.

449
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,163
And your body's probably hotter.

450
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:15,563
Oh, my god. I mean...

451
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,523
You look like you
work out a lot, too.

452
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:20,403
Yeah, yeah, every day.
I love to stay in shape.

453
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:23,083
I think the most important
thing in life is looking good.

454
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:25,259
'Cause if you look like shit
you may as well be dead.

455
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:27,283
You know what I mean?

456
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:28,763
Yeah.

457
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:34,043
Hey, I'm, ah, Pat.
Pasquale. Pasquale.

458
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:36,443
Hey. Pasquale? Yeah,
yeah, it's Italian.

459
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:37,603
I'm Italian.

460
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:41,083
Oh, my god, what a small world.
I'm from Croatia originally.

461
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:42,763
Yeah, right.

462
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,243
Oh, so both of those
countries are in Europe.

463
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,323
Yeah.

464
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:51,243
So, ah, can I get your number?

465
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:52,603
I'll take you out somewhere.

466
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:55,043
I'll take you somewhere really
nice. What do you reckon?

467
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:57,563
How do I know you're not a
serial killer or something, hm?

468
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,643
Me? Do I look like
a serial killer?

469
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,803
Pull up alongside.

470
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,043
What's goin' on, brother?
Mahmoud, how are you?

471
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:17,403
Chu.

472
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,603
So Yehya, how's
your mum and dad?

473
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:20,975
She's a bit sick at the moment.

474
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:23,003
I think it's just a cold. Yeah?

475
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,283
Salamtik.

476
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:28,003
So I wanna know what
you boys are thinking.

477
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,163
About what, mate?

478
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:30,923
Don't talk shit. You know what.

479
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:33,203
Relax, bra, I'm just
jokin' with you.

480
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:35,259
You wanna know who's runnin'
things with the Brothers?

481
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:36,363
Yeah.

482
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:39,363
You boys know it should be me,
you know, I've been good to you.

483
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,963
Very good.

484
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:42,710
So I wanna know if
I've got your loyalty.

485
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:44,659
How about you clear
something up with me first?

486
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:46,443
Something I heard about.

487
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:47,843
What's that?

488
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:51,163
That you tried to
bang my missus.

489
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,323
What?

490
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:54,683
Who said that, brother?

491
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:57,243
Doesn't matter who said it.
Did you try to bang her?

492
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:59,683
No way. Why would I
wanna bang your missus?

493
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:02,203
She's the last chick on
earth I'd try to bang.

494
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:06,059
Are you saying she's
ugly or something?

495
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,083
What?

496
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:08,459
Did you just say
my wife is ugly?

497
00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:10,608
Get this guy a tissue, bro.
He's gonna start crying.

498
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:12,099
Do you wanna start
something with me?

499
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:14,643
I'm just askin' you, if you
just said that my wife is ugly.

500
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:17,323
Yeah, she's ugly.

501
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:18,363
What about it?

502
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:19,803
Well then your wife's a slut.

503
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:23,403
What?

504
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,003
You just said my
wife's ugly, bra.

505
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,323
You said my missus was a slut?

506
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:29,723
Listen, bra, you tried
to bang my missus

507
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,203
and then you bullshit about it,

508
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:33,099
saying that she's ugly and
you don't wanna bang her.

509
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:34,363
Well, guess what?

510
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:36,283
Your wife's a gold
digger and a slut.

511
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:37,683
How about that?

512
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:40,643
Say it again. I dare you.

513
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,859
Say it again, one more time.
You got balls, you say it again.

514
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,259
Can't believe this
guy, mate. Go for it.

515
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:45,643
Bruz, can we just cool it?

516
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:48,683
Nobody said anything about
anyone's wife being ugly or sluts.

517
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,930
We're here to talk about
leadership for the chapters.

518
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:52,483
Come on, we're
together, aren't we?

519
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:55,643
Say it again.

520
00:23:57,123 --> 00:23:59,283
Your wife's a gold-digger
and ,

521
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:00,723
what are you gonna do about it?

522
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:05,043
How's this for a
?

523
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:07,883
How's that for
?

524
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,523
He said , yeah?

525
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:11,483
He said he had a gun.
You heard it, yeah?

526
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:13,139
You heard it, yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bro.

527
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,330
Yeah, yeah, drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive, drive.

528
00:24:22,123 --> 00:24:24,843
What do you think about
the Lambo? Pretty sick, eh?

529
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,723
I don't know. I mean, these
seats are a bit hard, you know?

530
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:31,003
It's a fuckin' racing car, not
a lounge chair, you spastic.

531
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,539
I'm just saying, mate.
With all this money,

532
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:34,259
you think they'd be a
little bit more comfortable,

533
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:35,243
you know what I mean?

534
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:36,539
Why do you gotta
be such a dickhead?

535
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:37,859
Hey, look, look,
look, look! Hey!

536
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:38,843
Hey! Check it out.

537
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:40,123
Hey! Hey! How's it goin'?

538
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:42,043
Come here! The one on
the left, she wants me.

539
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:43,083
Shut up.

540
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:44,563
I mean, look at
her! She wants me.

541
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:45,843
Shut up.

542
00:24:45,923 --> 00:24:47,123
Hey!

543
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:49,443
I mean, you see
all those cranes?

544
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,803
See all those big cranes
up the top there, man?

545
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:54,443
That's where the
real money is, man.

546
00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:55,779
That's where you
need to be thinking.

547
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:57,739
If you say you wanna step up, that
where you need to be thinking.

548
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,843
What do you mean? Construction.

549
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:00,219
Shitloads of it,
man. Those cranes.

550
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:01,819
How much do you think
they're pulling in?

551
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:02,923
What are you talkin' about?

552
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,283
I got a mine, he's selling
a whole bunch of cranes.

553
00:25:05,363 --> 00:25:06,603
You can pay cash for it, too.

554
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:09,483
How much? About eight mill.

555
00:25:09,563 --> 00:25:11,243
8 million bucks? Yeah.

556
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:12,763
Can you come up with two?

557
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:18,883
Take me a few months,
but... What about the rest?

558
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:20,083
Well, we're gonna
need a partner.

559
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:22,003
Someone who's got a
bit of a cash problem.

560
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,243
Like who? Like BFL.

561
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,043
Mate, they're moving
that much gear,

562
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:27,659
they gotta be cashed
up to the eyeballs.

563
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:29,499
That's why you need to
know this Afghan bloke,

564
00:25:29,523 --> 00:25:30,723
you know what I'm saying?

565
00:25:44,203 --> 00:25:45,443
Let's go.

566
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:54,643
Whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

567
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,523
What the fuck you doin', man?

568
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:57,923
What have I done?

569
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:02,843
You know who I am?

570
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:04,963
Yeah, you're Farhad
Qaumi, The Afghan.

571
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,283
I know who you are,

572
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:07,819
but I haven't done
anything wrong, mate.

573
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:09,043
You hear about Bassam Hamzy?

574
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,403
No, what happened?

575
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:12,059
He made me the leader.
I'm the boss now.

576
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,283
OK, cool.

577
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,179
Bankstown Brothers For
Life. It's closed down now.

578
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:17,203
There's no more Bankstown
chapter. Alright.

579
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:19,259
Everyone over there has to
come over to Blacktown, yeah?

580
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:21,259
Alright, sweet. I have no
problem with that, man.

581
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:23,533
I thought the other two
chapters were bullshit, anyway.

582
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,843
Tell your guys, alright?

583
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:29,323
Yeah, I will. I will, I promise.

584
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:32,243
I, I will let them know.

585
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,523
Hm.

586
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:43,259
Hey, so that Darling Point place,
it'll be ready in about two months.

587
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:44,859
But we gotta work out if
we're gonna take our stuff

588
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:46,219
from the home or we're
gonna get new stuff.

589
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:47,859
I haven't even seen the
place yet. What do you mean,

590
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:49,259
it's the best place to
watch the fireworks.

591
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:50,619
I don't give a shit
about fireworks, Pas.

592
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:51,643
I give a shit about
all my friends.

593
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:52,843
I don't know anyone
in Darling Point.

594
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:54,499
Your friends could come
hang out. They'll love it.

595
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:57,059
Oh, what about my coffee shop?
You know, my gym, my waxing place?

596
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,123
It's Darling Point. There's
waxing places there.

597
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,328
Chicks get their pubes done
too. How would you know?

598
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,099
You can't get the yoghurt
with the sugar in it.

599
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,979
But Giovanni likes that
one. It's bad for you.

600
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,459
Giovanni likes it 'cause
it's got sugar in it.

601
00:27:09,483 --> 00:27:10,483
Get the other one.

602
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,619
God, it's hard enough to get him
to eat anything at the moment, Pas.

603
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:14,499
You're gonna get him
fat. You try feeding him.

604
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:22,323
This is it, babe.

605
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:23,643
What's that?

606
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:25,403
Hey, I got a big
business deal goin' on

607
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,203
with a big potential
business associate.

608
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:28,363
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

609
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:30,163
Hey, Darling Point,
it's just the start.

610
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:32,419
Pretty soon I'm gonna move us
somewhere like Point Piper,

611
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:33,843
with a killer view.

612
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:35,859
I promise you. I've got some
big business deals going on.

613
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,603
Is that right, Mr Big Dick?

614
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:40,177
Why are you sayin' it like that?

615
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,003
Because I'm worried. About what?

616
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,483
About the fact you
just got out of jail.

617
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,979
Yeah, what about the court case?
What are you going to do about that?

618
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:48,920
Why are you always trying
to shit on my dreams?

619
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:50,723
I drive a Lamborghini. Mm.

620
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,512
I've got some big
business deals goin' on.

621
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,043
I've got plenty
of cash comin' in.

622
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:55,998
I'm gonna get the court
case thing sorted, OK?

623
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:58,083
Alright, I'm allowed
to ask, aren't I?

624
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:00,643
Hey!

625
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:02,763
Hey! Pas!

626
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,323
I'm not gonna be a shitkicker,
I'm gonna be a boss.

627
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:08,803
Babe, I'm telling you.

628
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:10,283
OK.

629
00:28:10,363 --> 00:28:13,643
OK? I need you to
support me on that.

630
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:15,243
Yeah, OK. This is serious.

631
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:19,923
Answer your phone.

632
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,003
Hello?

633
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,443
Yes, speaking.

634
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,403
What?

635
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:28,923
Oh, my god.

636
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,043
Oh, no.

637
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,803
What? Oh, my god.

638
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:36,123
Yes, yes, yes we will. We
will be there straight away.

639
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:37,683
Thank you. Be where?

640
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:38,763
Shit. What?

641
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,803
Maria's bitten another kid.

642
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:44,563
You'll see here in the
guidelines, that Article 18B says,

643
00:28:44,643 --> 00:28:47,043
"The parents of any child
continuously endangering"

644
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:49,643
"the safety of other children
shall receive a formal warning"

645
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:51,843
"from a senior staff member."

646
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:54,563
The last time both of you
were here, we discussed this.

647
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,683
That was your
official warning, yes?

648
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:58,683
I emailed you confirmation.

649
00:29:01,643 --> 00:29:03,643
"And in the event that
the behaviour continues

650
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:05,483
"and a formal complaint is made,

651
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:08,603
then the child shall be
removed from the facility."

652
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:11,603
Can I see that, please?

653
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,003
What you trying to say?

654
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:18,483
It means we're going to have to
ask Maria to leave the school.

655
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:22,243
What? What are
you talking about?

656
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,323
You can reapply to
have her reinstated

657
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:25,987
but we have to be
assured the behaviour

658
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:27,003
is not going to continue.

659
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,643
No, hang on. Reapply? Why?

660
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:30,499
Well, her place will be
filled by the next child

661
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:31,643
on the waiting list.

662
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:33,379
Does that mean we go to the
end of the waiting list?

663
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:34,603
Yes, I'm afraid so.

664
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:36,683
But it would take a
year to get her back in.

665
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:39,843
It's bullshit! No,
Pas, stop, I'm sorry.

666
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:42,219
No, Mrs Kimble, there has to
be something we can do here.

667
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:43,763
I'm sorry, no.

668
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:45,523
Once a complaint
has been registered,

669
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:47,203
then we have no choice.

670
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,923
Who made the complaint?

671
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,523
I can't give out that
information. Come on, tell us!

672
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,739
Who made the complaint? Can't
we just sort it out with them?

673
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:54,963
I can't say.

674
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,579
It's covered under Federal
Privacy legislation.

675
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:57,899
If I was to give you
that information,

676
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,523
I'd be breaking the law.

677
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:01,203
Look, I'm sorry.

678
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:02,763
Maria's a very sweet child.

679
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,003
But once a complaint
has been made,

680
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:07,923
under our guidelines,
my hands are tied.

681
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,323
Thank you.

682
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,203
That's bullshit. Let's go.

683
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:20,283
Hey, Maria, which was
the kid that got bitten?

684
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:22,483
Which one was it?

685
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:24,459
No, you're not in trouble,
you're not in trouble.

686
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:26,567
I'll give you a big piece
of chocolate, how's that?

687
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:27,843
Just tell me which one.

688
00:30:27,923 --> 00:30:29,643
Sophie got bitten.

689
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:35,683
Can we get out of here, please?

690
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,883
One second. What are you doing?

691
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,523
Wait, one second. What for?

692
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:44,443
There.

693
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:49,483
Oh, my god. What are you doing?

694
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:51,163
I'm sorting this out.

695
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:52,443
Sorting this out? Pas!

696
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,843
Hey, bubba. Hey, bubba.

697
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:54,963
I'm sorting this out.

698
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,539
Are you out of your mind?
Chill out, would you?

699
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,019
Would you stop the car?
Chill out, would you?

700
00:30:58,043 --> 00:30:59,603
Stop the car right now. Stop it.

701
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:00,803
Shut up!

702
00:31:00,883 --> 00:31:02,363
Stop it! Maria, you OK? Yeah.

703
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,443
Shit! What?

704
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:05,243
My meeting! Would you
just watch the road?

705
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,803
Shut up! You're
doin' my head in!

706
00:31:06,883 --> 00:31:08,259
Pas, watch the road!
I wanna sort this out.

707
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,483
Shut up!

708
00:31:09,523 --> 00:31:10,723
Where is he?

709
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,403
I dunno. He's
supposed to be here.

710
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:24,283
No, no, no, don't, no,
no, no, don't you dare!

711
00:31:24,363 --> 00:31:25,323
I'll just be a minute.

712
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:26,859
No, no, don't you
dare move, dickhead.

713
00:31:26,883 --> 00:31:27,923
You stay in the car.

714
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,443
I mean it. Stay.

715
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:32,963
Hi, I'm Melinda Barbaro.

716
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:34,963
Excuse me, hi.

717
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,723
Look, I'm so sorry
to bother you.

718
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,603
I'm Maria's mum.

719
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,603
Maria's the little girl
who bit your daughter.

720
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:42,043
Oh, yes? What are
you doing here?

721
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:43,819
How did you, how do
you know where we live?

722
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:45,203
Yeah, look, I'm so sorry.

723
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:47,163
I know this seems kind
of weird right now...

724
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:48,243
Kind of?

725
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,699
Yeah look, I just
wanted to talk about

726
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:51,163
what happened at the school.

727
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,019
I'm so sorry about the
bite. I feel terrible.

728
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,603
Oh, I'm sure you do.

729
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:57,019
Yeah, I just wanted to ask maybe
if you'd maybe change your mind

730
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:58,363
about the complaint?

731
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,379
They've told us that she
has to leave the kindy.

732
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:02,123
Shit.

733
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,619
I'm very sorry but do you know
how badly she hurt my daughter?

734
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:06,723
Stay here, baby girl. OK, Dad!

735
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:07,923
One second.

736
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:10,163
She broke the skin, and
there's severe bruises.

737
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:11,577
I had to take her to the doctor.

738
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:12,763
I'll pay for that if you like.

739
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,843
That's not the point.
Your daughter's dangerous.

740
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:16,507
The school's right
to ask her to leave.

741
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:18,855
You can't have a kid in there
that's hurting other kids.

742
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:21,003
Oi! Come here. Come with me.

743
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,883
Pas. I'm gonna call the police.

744
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:25,172
You call the cops, I'll shove
that phone up your arse.

745
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,083
Listen, brother, we're standing
outside your house, right?

746
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:32,603
That means I know
where you live.

747
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:34,163
Get what I'm saying?

748
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,452
I need you to drop that
complaint against my daughter.

749
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:38,059
You're gonna call
the school tomorrow,

750
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,939
you're gonna tell 'em it
was a big mistake, OK?

751
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,739
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna come back here

752
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,099
and I'm gonna break
both your legs.

753
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:44,699
You call the cops,
I'll fuckin' kill you.

754
00:32:46,243 --> 00:32:47,723
Do you get what I'm saying?

755
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,763
Yep. Hello?

756
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,339
Now I've got this expensive bottle
of wine for you and the missus.

757
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:53,683
Do you like red?

758
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,963
Yeah, we drink red.

759
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:56,603
Good.

760
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,643
Call the kindy. Sort it out, OK?

761
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:01,003
Yeah.

762
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,843
This is kinda awkward.

763
00:33:03,923 --> 00:33:05,443
Mrs Kimble just called.

764
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:08,723
Apparently it was a little boy
named Daniel who did the biting.

765
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:10,595
She just caught him
doing it to another kid.

766
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:12,363
What?

767
00:33:12,443 --> 00:33:15,043
Yeah, apparently Maria
didn't bite anyone.

768
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:16,963
So sorry.

769
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:19,283
Taking the piss.

770
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:21,083
Sorry. Get in the car.

771
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:22,283
Get in the car.

772
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:23,763
Get in the car.

773
00:33:23,843 --> 00:33:25,243
If I could ring
your fuckin' neck.

774
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:26,723
Shut up and get in the car.

775
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:36,043
Alright, I gotta go.

776
00:33:36,123 --> 00:33:38,363
Hey, hey. Good luck
with your meeting.

777
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:40,363
Thanks. Hey.

778
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:42,243
I love you.

779
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:43,763
Love you too.

780
00:33:47,603 --> 00:33:49,043
Alright, I'll be back. Alright.

781
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:50,323
Wish me luck.

782
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:13,803
What are you gonna do to me?

783
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:17,803
Where are we going?

784
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:19,283
Someone you gotta meet.

785
00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:48,163
Hey, ah, you seen some blokes?

786
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:50,323
Some Middle Eastern
lookin' blokes?

787
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:53,123
Ah, yeah. They left
just a few minutes ago.

788
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:55,483
Shit!

789
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:08,523
Shit.

790
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:22,283
Hey! Hey! How are
you? I'm Barbaro.

791
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:25,363
My mates call me Pat. You're
Farhad Qaumi? The Afghan?

792
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:26,643
That's you, right?

793
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:28,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
heard a lot about you.

794
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,292
We're going. Hey, yeah, wait.

795
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,619
I got caught up. I got caught up.
One of my kids, they were at kindy.

796
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:33,339
There was this bullshit.
They were biting each other.

797
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:35,219
It was this whole thing. Hey,
can we go back inside, please?

798
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:36,363
We've got a lot to
talk about. Please.

799
00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:37,403
No, no, I've gotta go.

800
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:38,859
No, no, hey, please,
please, wait a second,

801
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,403
brother. Brother,
brother, please.

802
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,659
I got big dramas with Bankstown
at the moment. I need you.

803
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,363
Who? What's that? That
Little Crazy bullshit.

804
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,963
He reckons I owe I'm 300K.

805
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:48,483
Yeah, what about it?

806
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,043
Mate, I'm in remand with the
guy, I'm just joking around.

807
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:52,459
Next thing you know
he cracks the shits

808
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,659
and he picks a fight with me.
And I thought maybe you know...

809
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:56,219
I don't give a shit
about Little Crazy.

810
00:35:56,243 --> 00:35:58,043
He's a prick. I don't
give a shit about him.

811
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,643
That's what I reckon, too.

812
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,203
Hey, I reckon he's
an absolute prick.

813
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:03,483
I swear.

814
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,203
Hey, one second, one second.

815
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:11,260
Thank you, brother.
Thank you, sir.

816
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,523
Appreciate it, man. Easy.

817
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,843
Hey, listen... This your car?

818
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,003
Yeah. Do you like it?

819
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,683
Seriously? Yeah.

820
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:20,363
Hey, listen, brother,
it's a nice car.

821
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:21,643
It goes hard.

822
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,939
Hey, if you wanna take it for
a drive, here, take the keys.

823
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:25,539
You don't even need to
bring it back, whenever.

824
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:28,323
Just take the key. Easy. Go.

825
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,112
Hey, my mate, he can
get you one of these.

826
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:31,163
Easily.

827
00:36:31,243 --> 00:36:32,803
He's got a mad deal
goin' with 'em.

828
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:34,723
I can get you one of
these, bro. No problem.

829
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:37,403
Thanks.

830
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:38,683
Easy.

831
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:41,003
Yeah, bring it back whenever.

832
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,723
What is that? Is that a
cucumber of a vibrator?

833
00:37:13,123 --> 00:37:14,323
Again.

834
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,003
I bought a dildo
exactly like that

835
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,763
for one of the lowies
back in the day.

836
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,619
No, we'll show him the
other one with the swan.

837
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,268
The swan. You'll love
this one, brother.

838
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:29,099
You'll love this one. The
guy falls in the lake.

839
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,123
Watch it, watch it.
Chuck it on, chuck it on.

840
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:33,323
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, ready?

841
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:38,283
Brother, if that
goose has got balls,

842
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:39,323
he'll go you one on one.

843
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:40,683
It's a swan, bro.

844
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:19,963
How's it goin', boys?

845
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:24,643
If you gonna open your mouth,

846
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:26,723
you'd better step up to
the plate there, brother.

847
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:28,763
Yeah.

848
00:38:30,563 --> 00:38:32,883
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

849
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:34,243
What's happening, fellas?

850
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:36,003
They missed him. What?

851
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,323
Little Crazy. He got away.

852
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:39,803
Who gives a shit, eh?

853
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,283
Better watch your back, bro.

854
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,619
He's gonna come after all of us.

855
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:44,299
Yeah, I'm not worried
about that little prick.

856
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,323
You should be.

857
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:46,739
This Little Crazy,
mate, he doesn't care.

858
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:48,643
Killed his own mate. Who?

859
00:38:48,723 --> 00:38:51,003
His mate, Yehya, a
couple of weeks ago.

860
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,875
Little Crazy's out with
his cousin, Mahmoud.

861
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,643
They get into an
argument with Yehya.

862
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:57,323
LC just shoots him in
the neck, brother. Dead.

863
00:38:58,163 --> 00:38:59,603
Know what I mean, bro?

864
00:38:59,683 --> 00:39:01,850
You're goin' out, you take
The Shadow with you, yeah?

865
00:39:04,403 --> 00:39:07,763
Yeah, OK, no worries. But hey,
listen, I got you something.

866
00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:09,963
New clothes. What for?

867
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,243
So you look fresh, bro.

868
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:13,219
These are designer labels.
They're expensive as shit.

869
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:15,483
That one there,
Versace. Look at it.

870
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:16,763
This one here, Armani.

871
00:39:16,843 --> 00:39:19,323
Not the Emporio, neither.
That's the proper Armani shit.

872
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,563
Try 'em on.

873
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:26,323
I got you something else, too.

874
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,523
Got you some jeans.

875
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,643
Diesel.

876
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:33,443
Huh? They're cool as shit.

877
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:35,483
Pop 'em on, pop
'em on. Hurry up.

878
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,323
Look at that, bro.
Are you serious?

879
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:42,763
You look so much better.

880
00:39:42,843 --> 00:39:44,643
That look, it suits
you completely, bro.

881
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:45,763
Look.

882
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:48,203
But, do you wanna
know something?

883
00:39:48,283 --> 00:39:49,723
Don't take this the wrong way.

884
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:52,483
You gotta lose the beard. What?

885
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:54,299
You gotta shave it off,
bro. What's wrong with it?

886
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:56,059
I'm serious, it looks
like a terrorist beard.

887
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,563
You can't be looking like that,

888
00:39:57,643 --> 00:39:59,803
not with everything we're doing.

889
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:03,883
It does attract
attention, bro. What?

890
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:05,883
Been meaning to say
something for a while.

891
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:08,963
Maybe it's better you did
get rid of that beard, hm?

892
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:11,323
Shave it, yeah? What about
you? What do you reckon?

893
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:24,083
The reason I want you to look good
is 'cause you're gonna be a boss.

894
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:25,963
I mean, a big-time
boss, my brother.

895
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:27,283
Yeah?

896
00:40:27,363 --> 00:40:30,683
My mate, Les, right? He's
in construction, properties.

897
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,763
He's got places
all around Sydney.

898
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,963
Yeah, there's heaps of
money in construction.

899
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:36,585
Nah, nah, nah, heaps,
brother, heaps.

900
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,768
Why do you think all the
big-time guys are doing it?

901
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,803
Yeah, my mate, he does
scaffolding for painting houses.

902
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:43,123
He makes heaps of money.

903
00:40:43,203 --> 00:40:45,099
Yeah, now picture your mate
in scaffolding for houses,

904
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:47,843
but instead of houses,
they're huge skyscrapers.

905
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:50,283
And instead of
scaffolding, it's cranes.

906
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:51,963
Cranes? Yeah.

907
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,779
Listen, brother, all
the construction sites

908
00:40:53,803 --> 00:40:55,603
around Sydney you
see, every single one,

909
00:40:55,683 --> 00:40:56,883
dotted with cranes.

910
00:40:56,923 --> 00:40:59,603
Every single one of them
cranes is makin' money.

911
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:01,003
Shitloads.

912
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,443
My mate, Les, knows a bloke
selling a bunch of cranes.

913
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:05,899
I don't know anything
about that shit.

914
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:07,603
You don't need to know about it.

915
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,963
Youse are making plenty
of cash out here, yeah?

916
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:14,123
You've got what, maybe ten
drivers, more? Yeah? Shit, OK.

917
00:41:14,203 --> 00:41:16,245
So you know what it's like
to have cash piling up.

918
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:17,699
Can't put it in
the bank, can you?

919
00:41:17,723 --> 00:41:20,563
You can't buy a house. Crime
Commission will seize it.

920
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,179
See, the best thing
about the cranes,

921
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:24,683
you can pay for the
whole thing in cash.

922
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:27,923
They put your name on the thing, all
the money you make back is legit.

923
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,203
Proper legit.

924
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:30,283
Seriously, listen.

925
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,905
I know youse are
doin' well out here.

926
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:33,603
And a year from now, you and me,

927
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:36,043
we can practically be
running this entire city.

928
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:37,883
This is how you step up.

929
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:39,443
Know what I'm saying?

930
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:40,723
Yeah.

931
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:43,723
Want a kebab?

932
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:46,203
Yeah, what kind are they?

933
00:41:46,283 --> 00:41:48,443
C is chicken, M is meat.

934
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,403
Can I get a snack pack?

935
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:53,763
Yeah, sure.

936
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:55,203
Cheers, bro.

937
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:01,323
Hey, look at that.
You look good.

938
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:03,683
That's totally changed
the way you look.

939
00:42:03,763 --> 00:42:05,923
You do look better
without the beard, bro.

940
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:09,083
Look at that. Hey, it's changed
the whole shape of your face.

941
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:10,643
I'm telling you, brother.

942
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:12,763
We're gonna be the bosses, yeah?

943
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:14,163
We're gonna run this city.

944
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:15,683
What do you think about that?

945
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:21,780
Good evening. I'm Angela Cox.

946
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:25,443
Up to ten shots ring out last
night before a car speeding away.

947
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:27,843
This morning associates
of the two men

948
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,803
arrived at the crime scene.

949
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,979
What can you tell us about
what happened here overnight?

950
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:33,523
Just a bit of fireworks.

951
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:34,603
Fireworks?

952
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:36,363
New Year's Eve came early.

953
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:38,019
It is believed that the
people involved here...

954
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:39,083
Bloody idiots.

955
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:41,059
Links to the notorious
Brothers For Life crime gang.

956
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,283
Pas?

957
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:48,803
Where are you going? Out.

958
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:50,523
Obviously. Where?

959
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:52,083
To dinner.

960
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:54,403
I've got a big business
meeting in the city.

961
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:58,003
What do you think, for the
kitchen in Darling Point?

962
00:42:58,083 --> 00:42:59,763
You wanna paint it yellow?

963
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,643
Well, it's not yellow,
it's buttermilk.

964
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:03,765
What's wrong with the
colour that's already there?

965
00:43:03,803 --> 00:43:05,363
I hate it. It's revolting.

966
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:07,419
What do you mean? It's juicy red.
I think that colour's awesome.

967
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:09,299
Yeah, well your taste is
dodgy at the best of times.

968
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:11,403
Bullshit. It's what
you'd paint a brothel.

969
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:14,323
What are you
putting that on for?

970
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:16,243
So I can smell good.

971
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:19,923
You're going to a business
meeting smelling of perfume?

972
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:21,243
What's that all about?

973
00:43:21,323 --> 00:43:22,899
It's not perfume,
it's men's fragrance.

974
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:24,779
You're sure you're not going
to a gay bar or something?

975
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,899
It's a bit weird, if you ask
me. Why are you bein' a bitch?

976
00:43:26,923 --> 00:43:29,643
Because I know when you're up
to something, Pasquale Barbaro.

977
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:30,923
Piss off.

978
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:44,123
So, I've never actually
asked you before.

979
00:43:44,203 --> 00:43:46,243
What do you do?
For work, I mean.

980
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,683
Oh, I'm in the
construction business.

981
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:50,163
Yeah, yeah.

982
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:52,410
I got some property being
developed in Darling Point.

983
00:43:52,443 --> 00:43:54,283
The best view. It's
an awesome spot.

984
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:56,163
Right, so you're a
property developer?

985
00:43:56,243 --> 00:43:58,683
Yeah, yeah. That's right,
a property developer.

986
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:01,403
But I'm into
construction and stuff.

987
00:44:01,483 --> 00:44:03,483
I'm getting some cranes.

988
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:05,683
Right, OK.

989
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:07,683
What?

990
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:10,963
Nothing. No, no, tell me, what?

991
00:44:11,043 --> 00:44:12,502
Is there something
wrong with that?

992
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:14,923
No, I was...

993
00:44:15,003 --> 00:44:16,443
This is gonna sound
really stupid,

994
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:20,323
but I thought maybe you were
like a gangster or something.

995
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,203
My girlfriend asked
me what you did

996
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:25,003
and I was like, "Well,
he's got all these tatts"

997
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,283
"and money and he
drives a Lambo,"

998
00:44:27,363 --> 00:44:29,447
and she was like, "Well,
maybe he's a drug dealer."

999
00:44:29,523 --> 00:44:33,643
And I was like, we were laughing
about how funny that would be that,

1000
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:34,939
you know, maybe I
was going on a date

1001
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,083
with a big-time gangster like
in 'The Sopranos' you know?

1002
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:40,083
Yeah, I mean how stupid is that?

1003
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:41,723
Well, yeah, yeah.

1004
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:44,563
I mean, um... That's cool.

1005
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:52,963
Ah. Shit.

1006
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:54,963
What?

1007
00:44:55,043 --> 00:44:56,403
Nothing.

1008
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:57,899
Just ah, if something
kicks off, just...

1009
00:44:57,923 --> 00:45:00,723
Barbaro. Hey, hey,
fellas, what's happening?

1010
00:45:00,803 --> 00:45:02,739
Aren't youse in the wrong
joint? KFC's down the road, huh?

1011
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:04,043
What are you doing, you dog?

1012
00:45:04,123 --> 00:45:05,603
What do you mean?
I'm havin' dinner.

1013
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:06,939
What does it look
like? You're dead.

1014
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,539
We know what you did to
Mahmoud. Hey, I did nothing.

1015
00:45:08,563 --> 00:45:10,022
What are you talking
about? Barbaro.

1016
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,219
Right in front of me. Hey,
why don't you piss off, huh?

1017
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:13,699
Shut the hell up. Little
Crazy's on his way.

1018
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:15,019
What do you mean?
Come outside now.

1019
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:16,460
Hey, hey, hey,
piss off, shithead.

1020
00:45:22,843 --> 00:45:24,643
Hey, come here. Come
here, come here.

1021
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,683
Hey, piss off! Get
out of the way.

1022
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:28,363
Come on. Fuck you.

1023
00:45:35,683 --> 00:45:37,403
Oh, my god.

1024
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:38,843
Mm-hm.

1025
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:41,523
So what do you reckon?

1026
00:45:41,603 --> 00:45:43,203
Oh, this view.

1027
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,443
Fuck, you can see everything.

1028
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:46,603
Yeah, told you.

1029
00:45:46,683 --> 00:45:48,043
This kitchen.

1030
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:49,723
I love that colour.

1031
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:51,003
What? Yeah.

1032
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:52,083
That's what I reckon. Mm.

1033
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:53,563
Really? Yeah.

1034
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,083
What was that for?

1035
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:02,523
Well did I say
you could kiss me?

1036
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:03,843
Nah, but like I thought...

1037
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:08,483
Are you...

1038
00:46:26,363 --> 00:46:27,643
Hurry up.

1039
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:39,563
What are you doing?

1040
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:42,043
Eating a sandwich.

1041
00:46:42,123 --> 00:46:43,723
I thought you went
out for dinner.

1042
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:46,363
What happened to
your shirt? Nothin'.

1043
00:46:46,443 --> 00:46:47,963
And your face. Your
face is all red.

1044
00:46:48,043 --> 00:46:50,443
It's nothing. Just some shit
with some blokes, that's all.

1045
00:46:50,523 --> 00:46:52,683
Well, what blokes?
Some BFL dogs.

1046
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:54,363
I sorted 'em out, OK?

1047
00:46:57,563 --> 00:46:59,443
What? Were they wearing perfume?

1048
00:46:59,523 --> 00:47:02,403
What? The BFL dogs.

1049
00:47:02,483 --> 00:47:05,123
Were they wearing
Chanel No 5? No.

1050
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:07,323
You come at 3:00am
from a business dinner

1051
00:47:07,403 --> 00:47:08,899
and still hungry,
with a ripped shirt

1052
00:47:08,923 --> 00:47:10,603
and stinking of
perfume. Oh, my god.

1053
00:47:10,683 --> 00:47:11,939
Get dodgier. Stop
being paranoid.

1054
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,755
Get dodgier. Stop being
paranoid, would you?

1055
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:16,137
I got into a fight with some
Arabs. They ripped my shirt.

1056
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:17,803
I belted the shit
out of them, OK?

1057
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:19,523
It's all good. I'm goin' to bed.

1058
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:45,363
How's it goin', Pat?

1059
00:47:46,203 --> 00:47:47,683
Who are you?

1060
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:49,643
Have a seat, mate.

1061
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:51,683
I thought I was meeting
the bloke and the chick.

1062
00:47:51,763 --> 00:47:54,443
Doesn't make a difference.
It's all the same.

1063
00:48:01,163 --> 00:48:02,523
So what's news?

1064
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:06,443
Look, I don't even why
I'm talking to youse.

1065
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:08,139
I don't even know
youse. Doesn't matter.

1066
00:48:08,163 --> 00:48:09,683
We know your case back to front.

1067
00:48:10,523 --> 00:48:11,603
Same rules apply.

1068
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,123
If you don't give us anything
then you go back to prison.

1069
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,923
This is bullshit.

1070
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:20,243
It is what it is, mate.

1071
00:48:20,323 --> 00:48:23,043
We didn't put you in
this situation, you did.

1072
00:48:23,123 --> 00:48:24,403
Yeah?

1073
00:48:27,283 --> 00:48:29,003
So how do you want
to play things, Pat?

1074
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:36,643
You heard of Little Crazy?

1075
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:38,723
The name's Hamzy.

1076
00:48:40,363 --> 00:48:43,323
Hamzy? Mohammed
Hamzy? What about him?

1077
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:45,483
Yeah, yeah, I heard something.

1078
00:48:45,563 --> 00:48:47,523
I heard he shot his
mate or something.

1079
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:49,003
Yeah? Yeah.

1080
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,283
Who?

1081
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:53,643
Gets in a fight with his own mates.
Shoots one of 'em in the neck.

1082
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:54,923
Killed him.

1083
00:48:57,163 --> 00:48:58,723
You're talkin'
about Yehya Amoud?

1084
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:00,083
He was murdered in Yagoona.

1085
00:49:00,163 --> 00:49:02,483
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1086
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,803
Little Crazy done that.

1087
00:49:05,883 --> 00:49:07,763
With his cousin, um...

1088
00:49:10,963 --> 00:49:14,003
Cousin, um, Mahmoud.

1089
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:16,483
With his cousin Mahmoud.

1090
00:49:19,443 --> 00:49:21,883
Get up! Get up!
Get your hands up!

1091
00:49:27,043 --> 00:49:29,963
Baby, look, it's the
three little pigs,

1092
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:32,883
Officer Bacon, Officer
Ham and Officer Pork.

1093
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:35,579
So boys, when youse eat breakfast
in the morning, you know, bacon,

1094
00:49:35,603 --> 00:49:37,163
'cause I know youse love bacon,

1095
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:39,163
does that make you
cannibals or what?

1096
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:53,243
Hey, to good health.

1097
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:58,123
Hang on tighter, 'cause
here comes the earth!

1098
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:39,363
Thank you.

1099
00:50:39,443 --> 00:50:40,803
What'd I tell you, huh?

1100
00:50:40,883 --> 00:50:43,723
Top of the world. Here,
come here, look at this.

1101
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:45,443
Cranes everywhere.

1102
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:48,923
One, two, three, four,

1103
00:50:49,003 --> 00:50:51,763
five, six, seven, eight.

1104
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,292
You see those building sites?

1105
00:50:55,363 --> 00:50:56,563
Any of 'em.

1106
00:50:57,123 --> 00:50:58,659
All them companies
that own those cranes

1107
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:01,723
would turn around about 20
million bucks a year, all legit.

1108
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:03,219
But they're doin' like
heaps of other jobs.

1109
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:04,843
Heaps of 'em. Tell
him, tell him.

1110
00:51:04,923 --> 00:51:06,939
Most of these companies have got
five to ten jobs going at once.

1111
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,579
I've already told him that.
Tell him about the cash.

1112
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:09,603
Tell him about that.

1113
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:12,219
Now, what we do is pay part of
the wages to the tradies in cash.

1114
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:13,603
Cash. All cash.

1115
00:51:13,683 --> 00:51:16,203
No, it's not all cash,
it's partly cash.

1116
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:19,003
So you wash the money that
you're making selling gear

1117
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,003
by paying out wages, right?
Equipment hire too, yeah?

1118
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:24,763
So you pay out in cash,
get proper receipts,

1119
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:27,339
and then suddenly all that money
that you're making selling gear

1120
00:51:27,363 --> 00:51:29,139
becomes legit. It's a
win-win. You can't lose.

1121
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:30,419
Tell him about the other thing.

1122
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:32,059
Tell him about the tradies
wanting these ones.

1123
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,939
Well, I'm trying to. Yeah, but
hurry up, you slow bastard.

1124
00:51:33,963 --> 00:51:35,379
You're taking too long.
Can you just shut up?

1125
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:36,939
Just let me finish,
say what I gotta say.

1126
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,083
Say it.

1127
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:41,603
Alright, the bonus is, tradies,
they love to get wasted, right?

1128
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,139
So you can sell 'em a bit
of this, a bit of that,

1129
00:51:43,163 --> 00:51:44,379
so straight off
the building site

1130
00:51:44,403 --> 00:51:46,363
and use that same cash
to pay their wages.

1131
00:51:46,443 --> 00:51:48,019
I've already told him that.
You'll make a fortune.

1132
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,543
So then why do you
want me to say it?

1133
00:51:49,603 --> 00:51:52,563
What do you want me to say
this for? Sit down, sit down.

1134
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:53,923
What do youse reckon?

1135
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:58,243
Yeah. Like the
sound of it or what?

1136
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,883
I told you. Yeah.

1137
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:01,163
Didn't I? Mm-hm.

1138
00:52:01,203 --> 00:52:04,123
Huh? So his mate is selling
a piece of his crane company.

1139
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:07,683
Yeah. I've got an associate of mine
selling a stake of his company.

1140
00:52:07,763 --> 00:52:09,843
A whole bunch of cranes
all over the place, man.

1141
00:52:09,923 --> 00:52:11,779
We're buying into something
that's already making money,

1142
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:13,123
you know what I'm saying?

1143
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:14,859
All we gotta do is come up
with the cash for the buy in.

1144
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:17,963
We put it in three ways. We
go in equal partners. Easy.

1145
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:19,323
How much, brother?

1146
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:21,163
8.5 mill, all up.

1147
00:52:21,963 --> 00:52:24,683
Yeah? But each of
us needs to put 2.2.

1148
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:25,963
You're good for it?

1149
00:52:26,963 --> 00:52:29,123
Yeah. Good.

1150
00:52:29,203 --> 00:52:32,043
The rest is gonna come from assets
I own from a scaffolding company.

1151
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:33,323
What's that?

1152
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:35,862
It's just this company I owned
with a guy called Joe Antoun,

1153
00:52:35,923 --> 00:52:38,099
but he's being a bit of a prick
at the moment but don't worry,

1154
00:52:38,123 --> 00:52:39,323
I'll sort it out.

1155
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:41,123
Who is this bloke?
He's a dickhead.

1156
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,243
Don't worry about it.

1157
00:52:42,323 --> 00:52:44,243
He's moved onto this
big George Alex project.

1158
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:45,523
He's all up himself now.

1159
00:52:45,603 --> 00:52:47,563
George is a massive,
massive property developer.

1160
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:48,859
He's doing shit all over town.

1161
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:50,739
Joe's just stalling me on
this scaffolding thing.

1162
00:52:50,763 --> 00:52:52,619
Don't worry. I'm gonna meet
up with him tomorrow night,

1163
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:54,419
but we're gonna get it sorted
out. It's normal bullshit.

1164
00:52:54,443 --> 00:52:55,985
Youse just don't
need to worry at all.

1165
00:52:56,043 --> 00:52:57,243
It's alright. Don't worry.

1166
00:52:58,483 --> 00:52:59,763
Sort this out, you know?

1167
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:03,203
So we put in 2.2,

1168
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:05,243
then we're in business
with the cranes?

1169
00:53:05,323 --> 00:53:07,003
Yeah.

1170
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,443
But the deal can't go ahead
till you sort your shit out

1171
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:10,723
with this Antoun bloke?

1172
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:13,163
Pretty much.

1173
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:16,683
You want us to
help sort that out?

1174
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:21,043
If we're partners.

1175
00:53:21,803 --> 00:53:22,883
For sure.

1176
00:53:22,963 --> 00:53:25,163
We'll come with youse
tomorrow night then, brother.

1177
00:53:28,723 --> 00:53:30,963
Told you. Didn't I?

1178
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:33,923
We're partners now, brother.

1179
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,803
We're gonna run this city.

1180
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:47,883
Are you goin' out?

1181
00:53:47,963 --> 00:53:48,963
Yeah.

1182
00:53:49,043 --> 00:53:50,643
Where?

1183
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:52,283
To the movies with Suze.

1184
00:53:57,723 --> 00:53:59,083
Where are you going?

1185
00:53:59,163 --> 00:54:01,163
I've got a meeting. A big one.

1186
00:54:01,243 --> 00:54:02,283
Important.

1187
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:04,163
Hope you got a babysitter.

1188
00:54:04,243 --> 00:54:06,123
What? I didn't get one.

1189
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:07,323
Why not?

1190
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:10,163
Because I'm sick of organising
everything around here,

1191
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:12,123
so you can go out
rooting skanks.

1192
00:54:12,203 --> 00:54:14,203
I'm not rooting
skanks. What are you...

1193
00:54:14,283 --> 00:54:16,723
Whatever. I'm going
to the movies.

1194
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:18,619
I didn't get a babysitter.
It's your problem.

1195
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:20,352
No, no, I've got a
meeting. I've got, hey!

1196
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:22,612
I've got an important meeting.
I couldn't give a shit.

1197
00:54:23,763 --> 00:54:25,283
I've got an important meeting!

1198
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,523
Ah, that's mine!

1199
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:33,123
It's not. That's mine!

1200
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,003
Hey, hey, stop it! Hey,
stop it, youse two.

1201
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:38,043
Get on the couch. Get on
the couch, Maria, right now.

1202
00:54:38,123 --> 00:54:40,843
I want you to stop
this nonsense, alright?

1203
00:54:40,923 --> 00:54:42,163
Hey, dinner's almost ready.

1204
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:44,843
I need both of you to cut
this shit out now, OK?

1205
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:48,363
If you're good, you can watch a movie
but only if you're good, alright?

1206
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,403
Yeah, Les.

1207
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:55,203
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, OK, OK, OK.

1208
00:54:55,283 --> 00:54:57,783
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I gotta sort
out this shit with the kids.

1209
00:54:57,843 --> 00:55:00,043
Yeah, I had to get a
babysitter last minute.

1210
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:01,483
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1211
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:05,843
Yeah, OK, OK, OK, I'll
be there. Half an hour.

1212
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:07,803
Hey, listen, alright, bye.

1213
00:55:08,843 --> 00:55:10,043
Shit.

1214
00:55:11,163 --> 00:55:12,483
Alright, listen.

1215
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:16,083
I need both of youse to sit
here and watch the movie, OK?

1216
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:17,899
But if I hear any noise
out of both of you,

1217
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:21,243
you're going straight
to bed. Alright? OK?

1218
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:23,203
I love you both.
Dinner's almost ready.

1219
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:37,763
Shit.

1220
00:55:37,843 --> 00:55:39,203
Ah!

1221
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,203
Hey. Hey. Hey, Pat.

1222
00:55:48,283 --> 00:55:51,203
Sorry. I've cooked some pasta,
the kids are watching a movie.

1223
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:53,099
If you can throw some cheese
on it, give it to 'em, yeah?

1224
00:55:53,123 --> 00:55:54,203
Yeah, too easy.

1225
00:55:54,283 --> 00:55:56,139
Hey, if they eat all their
dinner, give 'em a Tim Tam, yeah?

1226
00:55:56,163 --> 00:55:57,123
OK. Yeah.

1227
00:55:57,203 --> 00:55:58,979
Hey, thanks a lot for this.
I'll be back in a few hours.

1228
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:00,219
I'll give you some
extra cash, yeah?

1229
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:02,443
Yeah, yeah, it's
all good. Thank you.

1230
00:56:27,123 --> 00:56:29,163
Have a look at this place, huh?

1231
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:31,803
Yeah, what'd I tell you?

1232
00:56:33,043 --> 00:56:34,923
I said it, didn't I? I
said you and me, mate.

1233
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:36,323
Pretty soon blokes like this,

1234
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:37,819
they're gonna be walking
around this joint.

1235
00:56:37,843 --> 00:56:39,139
You know what they're
gonna be saying?

1236
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:40,163
"Look at them two dudes,

1237
00:56:40,243 --> 00:56:42,283
"with the fresh clothes
and them awesome tatts.

1238
00:56:42,363 --> 00:56:44,443
"Them dudes is bosses."
You know what I mean?

1239
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:45,563
Yeah?

1240
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:47,363
Hey, Les. Yeah?

1241
00:56:47,443 --> 00:56:48,683
How're you goin'?

1242
00:56:48,763 --> 00:56:50,803
Joe.

1243
00:56:50,883 --> 00:56:52,963
See you brought some mates
with you, did you, Les?

1244
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,963
What's all this about, mate?

1245
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:57,363
What's with this? I see
you brought some mates too.

1246
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:00,683
What'd you wanna see
me about, brother?

1247
00:57:00,763 --> 00:57:02,563
I need the paperwork
for the scaffold

1248
00:57:02,643 --> 00:57:04,163
and the title deeds.
Can I have 'em?

1249
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:07,003
I thought I told you,
mate. They're all gone.

1250
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:09,443
You tryna be funny?
Not at all, buddy.

1251
00:57:09,523 --> 00:57:10,843
The company went broke.

1252
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:12,123
Assets have all been sold

1253
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:13,419
and the receivers
took all the money.

1254
00:57:13,443 --> 00:57:14,859
Are you seriously trying
to phoenix me, Joe?

1255
00:57:14,883 --> 00:57:16,083
Phoenix you?

1256
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:18,099
Hey, given that you fucked the
company in the first place.

1257
00:57:18,123 --> 00:57:20,373
Mate, it went broke. No one's
trying to phoenix anyone.

1258
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,945
That's total bullshit
and you know it.

1259
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:23,363
Hey, listen.

1260
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:25,003
We come for the
title deeds, yeah?

1261
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,563
We're not leavin'
till we get 'em.

1262
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,243
Is there a circus in
town or something?

1263
00:57:29,323 --> 00:57:30,923
What's that?

1264
00:57:31,003 --> 00:57:32,243
You're a clown.

1265
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,123
What I'm saying is,
you're a fucking clown.

1266
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:36,363
Fuck you, arsehole. You
wanna have a crack or what?

1267
00:57:40,363 --> 00:57:41,763
Listen here, bozo.

1268
00:57:42,443 --> 00:57:45,403
There's 20 different sites
around here all pouring concrete.

1269
00:57:45,483 --> 00:57:47,459
You could find yourself part
of the construction industry

1270
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:49,523
in a way that you
might not like.

1271
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:51,243
You get the drift, dickhead?

1272
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:53,043
Yeah? Fuck you!

1273
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:54,643
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey.

1274
00:57:54,723 --> 00:57:56,283
Pull your head in. Just relax.

1275
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:57,483
Fuck you.

1276
00:57:57,563 --> 00:57:59,563
Get back. Get back.

1277
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,483
No one's trying to have
a crack at you guys.

1278
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:02,763
Just get back.

1279
00:58:04,843 --> 00:58:08,243
By the way, Les,
you owe me 47 grand

1280
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:09,883
for legals and stamp duty, OK?

1281
00:58:09,963 --> 00:58:11,843
I paid for it after the sale.

1282
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:14,048
Why don't you let me know
how you're gonna pay that?

1283
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:22,443
You're a real prick,
you know that, Joe?

1284
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:25,723
By the way, fellas, this
is George Alex's site, hey?

1285
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:28,095
He's a respectable bloke and
he doesn't like crims here,

1286
00:58:28,163 --> 00:58:31,403
so I suggest you leave. Thanks.

1287
00:58:32,203 --> 00:58:33,963
Let's go, boys. Yeah, dickhead.

1288
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,483
That's right, keep walking!

1289
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:38,963
Natalie?

1290
00:58:39,043 --> 00:58:40,043
Yeah, hi.

1291
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:41,803
Um, so the kids are
really freaking out.

1292
00:58:41,883 --> 00:58:43,403
They're like super upset.

1293
00:58:43,483 --> 00:58:44,683
Why, what's happened?

1294
00:58:44,763 --> 00:58:47,163
Someone put a horror
movie on the DVD player.

1295
00:58:47,243 --> 00:58:48,843
It's the about that psycho doll.

1296
00:58:48,923 --> 00:58:50,123
Shit!

1297
00:58:50,163 --> 00:58:51,499
Anyway, I didn't
realise it was on

1298
00:58:51,523 --> 00:58:52,979
and they've watched
quite a bit of it.

1299
00:58:53,003 --> 00:58:54,619
It's completely freaked
the shit out of them.

1300
00:58:54,643 --> 00:58:56,083
Like, they won't stop crying.

1301
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:58,403
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey listen,
I'll be home soon, OK?

1302
00:58:58,483 --> 00:58:59,683
OK, easy.

1303
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:01,923
Hey, I've gotta go.

1304
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:04,563
My kids, I've gotta go.

1305
00:59:09,523 --> 00:59:10,523
It's OK, guys.

1306
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:12,299
Hey, hey, hey, come here,
come here, come here.

1307
00:59:12,323 --> 00:59:13,323
Come here.

1308
00:59:13,403 --> 00:59:16,443
Hey, buddy, hey, it's alright.
It's alright, it's OK.

1309
00:59:16,523 --> 00:59:18,763
It's alright. Hey,
hey, hey what happened?

1310
00:59:18,843 --> 00:59:21,363
The doll put a
knife in the doll,

1311
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:23,403
blood came out and she got dead.

1312
00:59:23,483 --> 00:59:25,763
Hey, it's only a movie.
It's only a movie.

1313
00:59:25,843 --> 00:59:27,499
It's not real. There's
nothin' to worry about.

1314
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:28,643
Don't worry.

1315
00:59:28,723 --> 00:59:30,819
They've kinda been alternating
between being quiet for a while

1316
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:31,923
and then just losing it.

1317
00:59:32,003 --> 00:59:33,483
What the fuck? Should I...

1318
00:59:33,563 --> 00:59:36,323
Hey, hey, what's happened?

1319
00:59:36,403 --> 00:59:37,683
What's wrong with the kids?

1320
00:59:37,763 --> 00:59:40,043
Hey, you two. It's OK.
Nothing, they're just tired.

1321
00:59:41,363 --> 00:59:43,483
They've been great,
haven't they, Natalie?

1322
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:44,883
Um, yeah.

1323
00:59:44,963 --> 00:59:46,403
Just gonna fix her up, babe.

1324
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,108
Hey, come up here.
Come here, come here.

1325
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:52,043
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
say anything, yeah?

1326
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:53,323
Yeah.

1327
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:16,683
I don't know what's
got into those kids.

1328
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:18,883
It's almost like
something scared them.

1329
01:00:19,843 --> 01:00:21,043
You reckon?

1330
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:24,283
Do you think the
babysitter did something?

1331
01:00:24,363 --> 01:00:26,003
I don't know, maybe.

1332
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,003
I don't think we
should get her anymore.

1333
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,323
Ah, no way.

1334
01:00:31,043 --> 01:00:34,043
She probably told 'em, like,
a ghost story or something.

1335
01:00:39,043 --> 01:00:40,603
What movie did you see?

1336
01:00:40,683 --> 01:00:43,123
'Bad Grandpa'. It was so funny.

1337
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:45,203
Cool.

1338
01:00:47,203 --> 01:00:50,123
Hey, sorry I gave you
all that crap before.

1339
01:00:50,203 --> 01:00:51,843
How was your meeting?

1340
01:00:51,923 --> 01:00:54,283
It was pretty shit,
but it'll be sweet.

1341
01:01:14,363 --> 01:01:17,523
They just need a good
night's sleep, that's all.

1342
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:21,003
Goodnight. Night, babe.

1343
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,539
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey! Relax.

1344
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:35,123
Shh! Shh, shh.

1345
01:01:35,203 --> 01:01:36,699
I should have just decked
him when I got there.

1346
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:38,139
I shouldn't have
even asked questions,

1347
01:01:38,163 --> 01:01:39,603
just go bang, just
give it to him.

1348
01:01:41,723 --> 01:01:43,683
Hey, what happened to you?

1349
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:45,403
Mate, I'm so tired.

1350
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:47,923
My kids, they've been
having these nightmares.

1351
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:49,563
They've been kicking
me in the back.

1352
01:01:49,643 --> 01:01:51,083
I haven't slept at all.

1353
01:01:51,163 --> 01:01:52,603
Want a coffee, bro?

1354
01:01:52,683 --> 01:01:57,083
Shit, yeah. Ah, latte,
it be awesome. Yeah.

1355
01:01:57,963 --> 01:02:00,363
We're just talking about
this Joe Antoun bullshit.

1356
01:02:00,443 --> 01:02:02,963
Guy's a fucking wanker. What
was all that shit about?

1357
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:04,523
He finished the company we had.

1358
01:02:04,603 --> 01:02:07,003
I mean, he siphoned all my
assets, man. I'm screwed.

1359
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,403
I'm down more than two mill.

1360
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:10,363
What does that mean
with the cranes?

1361
01:02:10,443 --> 01:02:12,610
I don't know, brother. I'll
just have to work it out.

1362
01:02:12,643 --> 01:02:15,163
Work it out? Why didn't
you work it out before?

1363
01:02:15,243 --> 01:02:16,899
I mean, you don't have
to have a go at me, man.

1364
01:02:16,923 --> 01:02:18,859
How was I s'posed to know he was
gonna pull this bullshit on me?

1365
01:02:18,883 --> 01:02:20,099
What do you mean?
You shoulda known.

1366
01:02:20,123 --> 01:02:21,579
Is this gonna affect
the deal? Yeah, maybe.

1367
01:02:21,603 --> 01:02:23,019
But you don't have to
be a dickhead about it!

1368
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,259
Hey, it affects all
of us. I get it.

1369
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:26,179
Yeah, so what are you going to
do about this Antoun wanker?

1370
01:02:26,203 --> 01:02:27,563
I'll work it out.

1371
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:30,283
Work it out. I'll
work it out, man.

1372
01:02:30,363 --> 01:02:31,963
I always do.

1373
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:33,443
Why don't you just kill him?

1374
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:38,763
What are youse talkin' about?

1375
01:02:38,843 --> 01:02:40,803
Antoun. We should knock him.

1376
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:42,803
Yeah. Good idea.

1377
01:02:42,883 --> 01:02:44,403
Well, that's a very good idea.

1378
01:02:44,483 --> 01:02:47,323
Yeah, and you should pay for it.

1379
01:02:47,403 --> 01:02:48,483
Why should I pay for it?

1380
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:50,203
You brought us a
deal covered in shit.

1381
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:51,539
You should be the
one to clean it up.

1382
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:53,419
No, no, no, no, I'll pay for
it, no problem, I'll pay for it,

1383
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:54,819
but you do the hit,
smartarse. Piss off!

1384
01:02:54,843 --> 01:02:56,843
Come on, you big mouth.
Yeah, you should do it.

1385
01:02:56,923 --> 01:02:58,163
You scared? Nah.

1386
01:02:58,243 --> 01:02:59,779
You're scared, eh. Nah,
we should talk about...

1387
01:02:59,803 --> 01:03:01,299
You're scared. We should
talk about who does it.

1388
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:02,699
He insulted you. He
called you a clown.

1389
01:03:02,723 --> 01:03:03,939
Hey, he's a dog,
yeah, but you know...

1390
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:05,713
Yeah, but what? You
have to do it, brother.

1391
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,483
Alright, I'll do it.

1392
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:11,803
For 200K. That's
how much I want.

1393
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:14,043
Here you go. You're
not gonna do it.

1394
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,459
I'll do it. You're
not gonna do it.

1395
01:03:15,483 --> 01:03:18,123
He's not gonna do it, man.
Hey! Bullshit, I'll do it.

1396
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:20,123
Just said I will.

1397
01:03:20,683 --> 01:03:22,163
Got no problem, mate.

1398
01:03:41,523 --> 01:03:43,483
Hey, did you ever
see 'Mr Squiggle'?

1399
01:03:43,563 --> 01:03:45,723
What's that? The TV show?

1400
01:03:45,803 --> 01:03:48,243
You never saw 'Mr
Squiggle'? Nah.

1401
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:49,803
It was kind of a weird show.

1402
01:03:49,883 --> 01:03:52,203
It was about this like puppet
or a bird or something,

1403
01:03:52,283 --> 01:03:55,043
I don't really know. And he
had this long, pencil nose.

1404
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,403
And the blackboard on
it always had the shits.

1405
01:03:57,483 --> 01:03:59,723
What? The blackboard.

1406
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:02,059
He was like this grumpy prick and
he was always telling him like,

1407
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,763
"Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up."

1408
01:04:03,843 --> 01:04:06,323
And Mr Squiggle would always
draw these like cartoons,

1409
01:04:06,403 --> 01:04:08,299
and they'd always be upside
down when they started

1410
01:04:08,323 --> 01:04:10,179
and then he'd flip 'em up
the right way when he...

1411
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:11,883
You never saw 'Mr Squiggle'?

1412
01:04:11,963 --> 01:04:15,083
Nah, I was in Kandahar.
Where's that? Out west?

1413
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:18,403
Afghanistan. We
didn't have a TV.

1414
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:20,923
You're serious? You
didn't have a TV?

1415
01:04:21,603 --> 01:04:22,883
Nah.

1416
01:04:22,963 --> 01:04:26,403
When I was eight, my school
got bombed by Russians,

1417
01:04:26,483 --> 01:04:28,883
and my teacher and most
of my mates got killed.

1418
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:33,323
I ran to a shelter, so I was
OK, but my family had to leave.

1419
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,923
So we lived in refugee
camps and shit.

1420
01:04:39,563 --> 01:04:41,403
Shit man, that's pretty heavy.

1421
01:04:45,203 --> 01:04:46,403
There he is.

1422
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:47,483
Is that him?

1423
01:04:47,563 --> 01:04:48,763
Mm-hm.

1424
01:05:05,683 --> 01:05:08,443
That's when you can get him,
when he gets out of the car.

1425
01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:12,523
Before he goes back inside.

1426
01:05:13,283 --> 01:05:14,483
Yeah.

1427
01:05:18,763 --> 01:05:20,043
You gotta be waiting.

1428
01:05:21,443 --> 01:05:24,083
Yeah. Sweet.

1429
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:31,179
OK, you two, I'm going to run
a bath and put you to bed,

1430
01:05:31,203 --> 01:05:33,083
and tonight, you're
sleeping in your own beds.

1431
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:34,643
No! Yeah.

1432
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:36,283
Yes, I'm sick of
you in the big bed.

1433
01:05:36,363 --> 01:05:38,499
Daddy and I haven't had a
decent night's sleep in ages.

1434
01:05:38,523 --> 01:05:40,683
No, Mummy, I don't want
to sleep in my bed.

1435
01:05:40,763 --> 01:05:43,803
What's wrong with your
bed? The doll will get me.

1436
01:05:43,883 --> 01:05:45,603
What's all this about a doll?

1437
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:47,499
They keep saying they're
scared of some doll.

1438
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:48,979
I don't know what
they're talking about.

1439
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:50,283
The doll in the movie.

1440
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,579
OK, let's get youse in the bath.

1441
01:05:51,603 --> 01:05:52,853
Hey, what'd you just say, Gio?

1442
01:05:52,923 --> 01:05:54,243
The doll in the movie.

1443
01:05:54,323 --> 01:05:55,443
What doll movie?

1444
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:56,803
Daddy, show it. The DVD.

1445
01:05:56,883 --> 01:05:58,699
Come on, mate. Come on.
Let's get you in the bath.

1446
01:05:58,723 --> 01:06:00,163
What DVD? In there.

1447
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:01,363
Well, can you go
get it? Come on.

1448
01:06:01,443 --> 01:06:03,163
Can you go get
the DVD for Mummy?

1449
01:06:03,243 --> 01:06:05,683
Did you show them some DVD?
Hey, he's making it up.

1450
01:06:05,763 --> 01:06:06,963
Come on, come on.

1451
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:08,483
Maria.

1452
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:10,163
Maria, come on, come on.

1453
01:06:10,243 --> 01:06:13,443
'Child's Play'? This
is a horror movie.

1454
01:06:13,523 --> 01:06:14,563
I've never heard of it.

1455
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:16,643
It's a movie about the
killer doll, Chucky.

1456
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,843
Chucky makes people be dead.

1457
01:06:18,923 --> 01:06:20,483
Daddy show it. No. Hey!

1458
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:22,139
Did you show them this?
No! No way. Come on.

1459
01:06:22,163 --> 01:06:23,979
Let's go to the bath... Well,
why are they saying you did?

1460
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:25,579
I don't know. Come on, let's
get you two in the bath.

1461
01:06:25,603 --> 01:06:26,683
You showed them
Chucky, didn't you?

1462
01:06:26,763 --> 01:06:28,219
That's why they won't
sleep in their own beds.

1463
01:06:28,243 --> 01:06:30,163
Because you showed our
children a horror movie.

1464
01:06:30,243 --> 01:06:32,963
No, I, but not on purpose.
Oh, my god, Pas. Oh, my god.

1465
01:06:33,043 --> 01:06:35,139
It was an accident. I thought
it was something else.

1466
01:06:35,163 --> 01:06:37,059
I was racing out the other night.
It was when I was in a hurry.

1467
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,979
You're an idiot. You're an idiot.
It was when I was in a hurry.

1468
01:06:39,003 --> 01:06:40,659
They're gonna need
psychiatric treatment.

1469
01:06:40,683 --> 01:06:42,923
Come on you two, bath time.
You are a little dickhead!

1470
01:07:11,123 --> 01:07:14,163
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1471
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:17,843
Shh, shh, shh!

1472
01:07:17,923 --> 01:07:20,203
Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh,
shoosh. It's OK, it's OK.

1473
01:07:20,283 --> 01:07:21,563
Shh, shh.

1474
01:07:55,563 --> 01:07:57,683
You alright with this? Yeah.

1475
01:08:00,483 --> 01:08:03,003
We're all brothers, yeah?
This is for your family.

1476
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,723
We're gonna rule
this city, yeah?

1477
01:08:04,803 --> 01:08:06,003
Yeah.

1478
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:08,483
You cool?

1479
01:08:16,243 --> 01:08:17,243
You sure?

1480
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:21,483
Yeah, yeah, I just,
bro, I'm so tired.

1481
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:24,323
You know I got the kids
in the bed every night,

1482
01:08:24,403 --> 01:08:26,379
falling out of the bed, they're
kicking the shit out of me.

1483
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,523
I haven't had a good
night's sleep in ages.

1484
01:08:28,603 --> 01:08:30,203
Should I get you a coffee, bro?

1485
01:08:31,803 --> 01:08:33,203
Yeah, it be awesome.

1486
01:08:37,043 --> 01:08:38,243
All good.

1487
01:09:29,323 --> 01:09:30,563
Fuck.

1488
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:05,843
Shit!

1489
01:11:05,923 --> 01:11:07,323
Shit.

1490
01:11:12,763 --> 01:11:15,323
Oh, shit!

1491
01:11:16,483 --> 01:11:17,723
Fuck.

1492
01:11:18,963 --> 01:11:20,163
Fuck.

1493
01:11:28,153 --> 01:11:29,353
What happened?

1494
01:11:29,403 --> 01:11:30,363
Nothin'.

1495
01:11:30,443 --> 01:11:31,923
What? Didn't happen, OK?

1496
01:11:32,003 --> 01:11:33,243
Why not?

1497
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:35,883
'Cause he came home with his
kids. His kids were there.

1498
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:37,499
I knew you'd fuck it
up. Hey, I didn't.

1499
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:39,059
I would have done him but
he had his kids with him.

1500
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,083
What does that mean?

1501
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:41,455
It means there were kids there.

1502
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:44,283
Couldn't do it. It's the code.

1503
01:11:44,363 --> 01:11:46,243
What code? 'Ndrangheta.

1504
01:11:46,323 --> 01:11:47,539
You can't do a hit
in front of kids.

1505
01:11:47,563 --> 01:11:48,803
Who says that?

1506
01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:50,923
It's old school Italians.
It's mafia, mate.

1507
01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:51,963
That's how it works.

1508
01:11:52,043 --> 01:11:54,643
Doesn't worry me. I've got
no problem with the kids.

1509
01:11:55,323 --> 01:11:57,243
You serious? Yeah.

1510
01:11:58,003 --> 01:12:00,763
You wanna do the hit? For 200K?

1511
01:12:00,843 --> 01:12:02,523
If you do it properly, yeah.

1512
01:12:02,603 --> 01:12:05,323
Hey, where I'm from, it's not
cool to do something like that

1513
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:06,683
in front of kids.

1514
01:12:11,163 --> 01:12:13,083
But you blokes
are different, eh?

1515
01:13:08,883 --> 01:13:10,523
You're going out again?

1516
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:12,283
Yeah.

1517
01:13:12,363 --> 01:13:14,123
I don't want to, but.

1518
01:13:15,003 --> 01:13:16,963
I don't even wanna go out.

1519
01:13:18,123 --> 01:13:19,803
Wish I was stayin' at home.

1520
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,363
Why don't you, then?

1521
01:13:23,003 --> 01:13:24,243
'Cause I gotta go.

1522
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:30,283
You OK?

1523
01:13:31,243 --> 01:13:32,763
Yeah, why?

1524
01:13:33,803 --> 01:13:35,259
That's the first time
I ever heard you say

1525
01:13:35,283 --> 01:13:36,523
you don't wanna go out.

1526
01:13:36,603 --> 01:13:38,203
Nah, it's all good.

1527
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:41,723
Just got some shit
goin' on, you know?

1528
01:13:41,803 --> 01:13:43,643
It's nothin' to
worry about, but.

1529
01:13:45,163 --> 01:13:46,363
I better go.

1530
01:13:47,443 --> 01:13:49,283
Hey. Be careful.

1531
01:13:58,243 --> 01:13:59,283
Hey.

1532
01:13:59,363 --> 01:14:00,723
Hey, I like this beef.

1533
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,887
I don't know what's in it
but I like it. It's good.

1534
01:14:03,963 --> 01:14:05,643
Why are you guys not eating?

1535
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:08,163
Want some?

1536
01:14:13,963 --> 01:14:15,643
Yo, Masab, it's
right here. Up here.

1537
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:17,763
It's right further up.
No, it's right here.

1538
01:14:17,843 --> 01:14:19,243
I'm tellin' you,
it's right here.

1539
01:14:19,323 --> 01:14:20,443
It's hard to turn
left further down.

1540
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:22,219
It's easier if we go
right on the next one.

1541
01:14:22,243 --> 01:14:23,443
I googled it.

1542
01:14:36,843 --> 01:14:38,523
Hey, you heard anything yet?

1543
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:39,803
Nah.

1544
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:43,603
Hey, we're s'posed to be seen,
yeah? Make a lot of noise.

1545
01:14:43,683 --> 01:14:46,683
Yeah. That's right. Yeah?
Get up there. Go on.

1546
01:14:46,763 --> 01:14:48,643
Why do I have to get
up there, wanker?

1547
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:50,179
Who thinks Les
should get up there?

1548
01:14:50,203 --> 01:14:51,483
Yeah, go on. Get up there.

1549
01:14:51,563 --> 01:14:53,163
Get up there. Go, brother.

1550
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:54,643
Take your beer with you.

1551
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,019
Don't worry, I'm
gonna get up there.

1552
01:14:56,043 --> 01:14:57,723
Get the applause ready, yeah?

1553
01:14:58,443 --> 01:15:00,523
Take it easy, alright.

1554
01:15:00,603 --> 01:15:01,803
Hello, darling.

1555
01:15:14,683 --> 01:15:17,523
Put your hoodie up, man. Make
sure it's over your face.

1556
01:15:17,603 --> 01:15:19,403
Yeah, yeah. I know
what I'm doing.

1557
01:15:32,043 --> 01:15:34,083
Go on, be loud. Show
us how loud you can be.

1558
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:35,843
Show us all for the boys.

1559
01:15:39,603 --> 01:15:42,243
Just sing it! Just
sing it, you dog!

1560
01:15:42,323 --> 01:15:44,043
What song are you singing?

1561
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:46,323
Ah, this one's to you,
you fuckin' dickhead.

1562
01:15:46,403 --> 01:15:47,763
Oh, you, dickhead!

1563
01:16:10,883 --> 01:16:12,563
Yes?

1564
01:16:12,643 --> 01:16:14,563
Ah, hello.

1565
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:15,923
Is, ah, Joe there?

1566
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:18,643
I have this ledger
book to deliver to him.

1567
01:16:19,243 --> 01:16:21,163
Ah, yeah.

1568
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,083
Hang on. Thank you.

1569
01:16:24,323 --> 01:16:25,523
Joe!

1570
01:16:37,803 --> 01:16:39,643
Come on, boys, yeah!

1571
01:16:47,123 --> 01:16:48,323
Yeah, mate.

1572
01:16:53,883 --> 01:16:55,323
One more time!

1573
01:16:57,923 --> 01:16:59,923
Now, sing it, boys!

1574
01:17:08,283 --> 01:17:10,163
Send an ambulance!

1575
01:17:10,243 --> 01:17:12,403
Go, in the other room. Go!

1576
01:17:23,563 --> 01:17:25,563
Hey. It's done.

1577
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:31,323
Come on, guys!

1578
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:33,723
Fuck, I love it.

1579
01:17:37,643 --> 01:17:39,459
What's that? You shoulda
done that song, bro.

1580
01:17:39,483 --> 01:17:41,123
Hey, hey, hey! What?

1581
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:42,443
Look.

1582
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,843
No one's gonna fuck
with us now, eh?

1583
01:17:48,763 --> 01:17:50,083
Yeah.

1584
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:03,603
Come on, let's go.
Let's get a feed.

1585
01:18:41,443 --> 01:18:43,123
We're OK.

1586
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:46,123
I love you. I love you too.

1587
01:19:29,803 --> 01:19:31,203
How's it going?

1588
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,843
I'm your dad.
