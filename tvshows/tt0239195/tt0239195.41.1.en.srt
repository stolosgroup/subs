1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,437
It's been a while.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,072
I've missed you.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,108
Well, I've missed the jungle,
and I've missed the ocean,

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,877
but mostly, I've missed
our time together.

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,347
<i>Survivor</i> started out as this
tiny little social experiment,

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,751
and it has evolved into one
of the most mentally draining,

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,787
physically challenging
and socially complicated games

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,522
ever seen on television.

9
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,158
And you've been there
every step of the way,

10
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,260
which is why we thought
it would be fun this season

11
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,396
to invite you inside the game
a little more,

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,164
make you coconspirators.

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,532
So, at times, you'll know

14
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,634
what's happening
before the players know.

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,737
You can play along,
second-guess, like this.

16
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,440
It's a new advantage,
the Beware Advantage.

17
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,842
This advantage comes with risk.

18
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,578
So, if you want this,
you better be sure.

19
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,614
What would you do
if you found it?

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,916
I'm gonna hide this
at the Yase tribe camp.

21
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,185
The other two tribes
will have one as well.

22
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,920
We just want
to have fun this season,

23
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,157
so we're gonna lean into
the best kind of<i> Survivor</i> fun,

24
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,925
the dangerous Kind.

25
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,527
Plus, we're gonna
increase the pace.

26
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,228
These players will go 26 days,

27
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,164
which means they have to hit
the ground running

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,734
because there will be nowhere
to hide and no time to hide.

29
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,703
Plus, small tribes, no rice,

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,439
penalties for losing,

31
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,441
and you've got to earn
everything.

32
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,711
And even then,
the unexpected dangerous twist

33
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,547
can take it all away.

34
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:21,981
What do you want from me?

35
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,151
We're just trying to evolve
the experiment a little more

36
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,887
and see how it goes,
and we'll do it together.

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,961
-Naseer.
-Naseer.

155
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,497
What is it, Naseer,
about this show

156
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,033
that keeps everybody coming back
with the same enthusiasm?

157
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,870
I can tell you, Jeff, this--
at this moment,

158
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,506
I'm the happiest human being
on the earth.

159
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,308
I started watching
<i>Survivor</i> season 21

160
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,877
and never been to America.

161
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,745
I hardly spoke English.

162
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,883
I learned English
watching<i> Survivor.</i>

163
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,818
(chuckles) Thank you.

164
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,219
-You are my teacher.
-(laughter)

165
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,221
And you're my dictionary, too.

166
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,557
I'm sorry about that.

167
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,260
Well, we're glad
to have you here.

168
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,528
-Woman in the front.
-Hi.

169
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,929
-What's your name?
-My name is Heather.

170
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,831
When did you first start
watching<i> Survivor?</i>

171
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,634
-20 years ago.
-So you... you're a day one.

172
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,670
-Day one. Day one.
-Right... right on.

173
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,139
What is it about this show

174
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,942
that you missed
when it wasn't on for a year?

175
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,178
Oh, I missed everything
about it.

176
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,914
This is routine for me.
This has been a habit.

177
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,217
I started watching 20 years ago
with my boyfriend,

178
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,119
who is now my husband,

179
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,354
and now we watch it
with our children.

180
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,557
-PROBST: Wow.
-So this has been a tradition

181
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,093
in my family--
or creating a family with you.

182
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,461
Thank you. Thank you for this.

183
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,497
Well, thank you
for the family experience,

184
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,266
because that is a big part
of why everybody here--

185
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,335
this entire crew behind me--

186
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,670
-makes this show...
-Yeah.

187
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,971
...is for families like yours.

188
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,506
That's what makes<i> Survivor</i>
special to us.

189
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,174
-Yeah.
-PROBST: All right.

190
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,643
Now, as we all know,
we are in the midst

191
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,080
of one of the most powerful,
still evolving periods of time

192
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,883
that we will probably ever
go through in our lives.

193
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,154
So, while you're out there
backstabbing, blindsiding,

194
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,457
swearing on kids that you may
or may not really have,

195
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,693
if something comes up
that you want to talk about it,

196
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,760
talk about it.

197
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,828
Who knows?
We might learn something.

198
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,996
In fact, I'll start because

199
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,965
I need your guidance
on something.

200
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,667
For 20 years,
I have used one phrase

201
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,636
to call people in
for challenges.

202
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,339
ALL:
Come on in, guys.

203
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,406
-(laughter)
-PROBST: "Come on in, guys."

204
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,507
Yeah.

205
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,109
Love saying it--
it's part of the show--

206
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,044
but I, too, want
to be of the moment.

207
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,214
So my question to you
to decide for us,

208
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,183
in the context of<i> Survivor,</i>

209
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,185
is a word like "guys" okay,

210
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,187
or is it time
to retire that word?

211
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,356
What do you think?

212
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,258
I personally think
"guys" is okay.

213
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,560
It's part of, you know--
"Come in, guys"

214
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,695
is, like, such a signature
expression, and, you know,

215
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,398
I as a woman, as a queer woman,
do not feel excluded by "guys."

216
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,734
Hmm. Yeah.
Does anybody disagree?

217
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,738
-No.
-We feel okay keeping "guys"?

218
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,172
"Guys" is good.

219
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,842
Okay, mark it down--
discussed and decided.

220
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,778
-(laughter)
-All right, tribe names.

221
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,680
Wearing blue, you are Luvu.

222
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,782
-Luvu.
-(whooping)

223
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,452
Wearing yellow,
Yase in the middle.

224
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,955
-Yase!
-(whooping)

225
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,723
-And Ua, wearing green.
-Ua! Yeah!

226
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,925
-Ua!
-Yeah.

227
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,493
PROBST:
I'm gonna tell you up front,

228
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,895
this season is going to be
more difficult than ever to win,

229
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,830
and here are
a few of the reasons.

230
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,066
It's going to be
a shorter season,

231
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:32,071
which means an already fast pace
will be relentless.

232
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,840
There will be no time to breathe
and nowhere to hide.

233
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,444
You are also starting
with very meager supplies.

234
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,181
One pot, one machete, one flint.

235
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,582
That's it.

236
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,253
No rice, no food source, and...

237
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,358
gameplay that I promise you
has never been so dangerous.

238
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,926
-Ooh!
-(whooping)

239
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,562
PROBST:
When you look at your box,
you see a four and a one,

240
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,265
my suggestion is
drop the four, keep the one.

241
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,500
This is a new era of<i> Survivor.</i>

242
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:05,905
Let's get to your first test
as brand-new tribes.

243
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,641
On this boat, scattered,

244
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,778
<i>18 color-coded paddles,</i>
<i>six for each tribe.</i>

245
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,246
<i>On my go, you got to get</i>

246
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,716
<i>your six paddles</i>
<i>and your six tribe members</i>

247
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,185
<i>off this barge</i>
<i>and onto your raft.</i>

248
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,988
<i>Then you're gonna paddle out</i>
<i>and around a buoy</i>

249
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,357
<i>and race back to where</i>

250
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,325
<i>you'll see a flint</i>
<i>dangling from a pole.</i>

251
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,728
<i>The first tribe to get the flint</i>

252
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,130
earns those meager supplies--
pot, machete, flint.

253
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,733
The other two tribes
will leave here with nothing.

254
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,503
You'll have to go back to camp
and try to earn them again,

255
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,905
wasting valuable
shelter-building time.

256
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,541
I wish you all good luck.
And go!

257
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,245
<i>Survivor</i> 41 is on!

258
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,016
Opening moments.
You don't know each other,

259
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,417
you've not said a word,

260
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,952
but you've got to quickly
figure out

261
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,187
how to work together.

262
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,157
You are looking for six
of your tribe-colored paddles.

263
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,792
They're not gonna be easy
to get to.

264
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,228
If there are knots,
you got to untie them.

265
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,630
If there's something on top
of it, you got to get it off.

266
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,032
ABRAHAM:
I got two.

267
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,934
PROBST:
All you need is six
of your paddles

268
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,671
and your six tribe members
off the barge and on your raft.

269
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,407
Somebody get in the water
for blue!

270
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,277
Here's another blue!

271
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,383
PROBST:
Doing a nice job there
gathering all their paddles,

272
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,819
and now they're
tossing them over.

273
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,521
Great strategy.

274
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,258
"Do they have all six?"
is the question.

275
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,728
VOCE: No, no, no, no!
One, two, three, four, five.

276
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,996
-There's one more yellow.
-One more.

277
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,164
One more yellow.

278
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,668
Ua has their sixth.

279
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,003
Blue, we got six.

280
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,271
Blue, we got six. Come on.

281
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,506
PROBST:
Who's gonna get all six paddles

282
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,208
and get to their boat first?

283
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,846
Danny's in the water.
Genie's in the water.

284
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,618
Brad getting ready to leap.

285
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,991
Nice entry.

286
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,995
All the paddles
were in the same spot,

287
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,264
so it's interesting
that one tribe is struggling.

288
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,166
-Nothing up here. I promise.
-VOCE: Okay.

289
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,069
-TIFFANY: We have 'em?
-ABRAHAM: No, we're missing one.

290
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,806
PROBST:
They were all in six groups.

291
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,241
What happened?

292
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,709
Hold it. Hold it.

293
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,044
Ready. Go, go!

294
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,948
Luvu has all six paddles
and all six players,

295
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,950
and they are heading out.

296
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,218
(indistinct shouting)

297
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,757
PROBST:
You got to unclip
in the front and the back.

298
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,829
PROBST:
Ua taking a long time.

299
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,631
-Okay.
-Paddle!

300
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,167
RICARD:
You two guys on the left...

301
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,008
PROBST:
Tiffany now in the water
for Yase.

302
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,676
Things not looking good
for Yase.

303
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,045
-Go, go!
-(indistinct shouting)

304
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,748
PROBST:
It is all Luvu right now.

305
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,618
Even though they appear
to be... not moving.

306
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,653
-One, two, three...
-PROBST: Slowly,

307
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,755
they are inching their way

00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,028
<i>and there were too many details</i>

1055
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:01,031
to not... to not mess up.

1056
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:04,234
<i>And I feel everybody is</i>
<i>believing Danny's story.</i>

1057
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,669
You made a good decision, then.

1058
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,604
Yeah, we didn't get
no damn rice.

1059
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,008
XANDER:
After we meet and everything,

1060
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,309
we each get to play,

1061
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,744
-like, a game of chicken.
-Oh.

1062
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:18,549
And if everyone risks
their vote, then we all lose it.

1063
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,952
If everyone plays it safe,
we all keep it.

1064
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,954
Oh, okay, okay.
I see what you're saying.

1065
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,789
XANDER:
If one other person
or two other people

1066
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:29,193
played it safe and I risked it,
then we get an extra vote.

1067
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:32,129
<i>My tribe knows</i>
<i>I'm coming back with something</i>

1068
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,797
<i>that helps me or the tribe.</i>

1069
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,467
<i>And we all know</i>
<i>how this game works.</i>

1070
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,368
<i>If I come back empty-handed,</i>

1071
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:42,206
<i>they're left to assume</i>
<i>the worst, which is bad for me.</i>

1072
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,141
<i>ABRAHAM:</i>
<i>No guts, no glory.</i>
<i>I say you went for it.</i>

1073
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,442
<i>XANDER:</i>
<i>I risked it.</i>

1074
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,878
I don't know
what the other two tribes chose.

1075
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,746
We won't know until Tribal.

1076
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,949
We could use it
come swap time or whenever.

1077
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,217
-EVVIE: Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

1078
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,585
-You made the right decision.
-Yeah.

1079
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:55,686
<i>EVVIE:</i>
<i>Xander is smart.</i>

1080
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:56,954
This idea of risking your vote

1081
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,322
and kind of
a prisoner's dilemma,

1082
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,191
<i>that's a complex story,</i>
<i>and I think Xander knows</i>

1083
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,127
<i>he'd get caught if he tried</i>
<i>to lie too much.</i>

1084
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,862
<i>So we'll see, but that is, like,</i>

1085
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,264
a huge advantage,
an extra vote at any time.

1086
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,333
Like, we don't know what's
coming to us. That's amazing.

1087
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,635
XANDER:
This is something that
we can do for the team,

1088
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:14,304
and, like, I'm willing to put
my neck on the line for it.

1089
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,773
<i>With the way I was able</i>
<i>to present my story,</i>

1090
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,443
<i>I didn't have to keep up</i>
<i>with my lie</i>

1091
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,245
<i>and, you know, remember</i>
<i>the little things</i>

1092
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,313
<i>I changed and tweaked.</i>

1093
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,516
So, I always find it
interesting that people love

1094
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:29,086
to lie about these, you know,
risk/reward scenarios.

1095
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,456
<i>BRAD: You got a big bag</i>
<i>of rice in the bag?</i>

1096
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,991
-JD: No, I wish.
-(laughs)

1097
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,759
But, like, if y'all really want
to check, like, here's my bag.

1098
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,427
-Go through the bag.
-BRAD: Oh, no, no, no, no.

1099
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,163
RICARD:
Oh, honey, I'm going through it.

1100
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,831
I will...
I will literally, like,

1101
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,233
nothing in here,
and I will take my pants off.

1102
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,903
<i>I sit everybody down,</i>
<i>and I'm like,</i>

1103
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,905
"I have a story to tell."

1104
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,673
From the beginning,
get on the boat.

1105
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,642
You know, we're cruising,
and I'm like, mmm,

1106
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,477
and my hair's, like,
flowing through the wind

1107
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:54,978
and I think I look amazing.

1108
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,848
I look over, and then there's
two people in different boats

1109
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,050
whose hair looks
even more amazing.

1110
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,085
And we jump out the boat,
and we're like, "Oh, what's up?"

1111
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,288
And, like, we're all stoked
to meet each other.

1112
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:08,225
So, we have to do this trek,

1113
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,962
probably a little over an hour,
and I-I led the way.

1114
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:16,767
And so, yeah, but that's not
the end of it. Um...

1115
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,070
There is this ship's wheel,
right?

1116
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,774
Xander and Danny both had
the same thing,

1117
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,844
and if one of us hits...
if one of us turns it

1118
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,047
and it says "risk your vote"

1119
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,650
and two people turn it
and say "protect your vote,"

1120
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,285
someone gets an extra vote.

1121
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,989
But if two people
risk their vote,

1122
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,758
then they lose their vote
at the next Tribal Council.

1123
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,760
If you lose a vote,
like, you're screwed.

1124
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,330
-SHAN: So, what did you do?
-I protected my vote.

1125
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,298
I didn't want to be the person

1126
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,001
to just screw everything up,
you know, for myself.

1127
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,869
I told them that
I protected my vote,

1128
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,572
<i>and I gave them so much</i>
<i>information that I don't think</i>

1129
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,543
I left room for them to believe
I was leaving anything out.

1130
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,779
And I feel like everybody's
still getting to know each other

1131
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,449
and, like, we kind of are...

1132
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,985
it's-it's in that blurry
gray area so far.

1133
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,186
I think they ate it up.

1134
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,954
<i>I really think I sold it</i>
<i>really well.</i>

1135

-SHAN: Okay.

1136

1137
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,827
<i>RICARD:</i>
<i>Yeah, so JD just came back</i>

1139
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,300
And I don't believe ...
he just said.

1140

<i>It just doesn't make sense.</i>

1141

<i>so let's get rid of JD.</i>

00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,906
That's crazy, right?

1144
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,058

All right.

1147
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,111
So let's check in.

1148
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,613
Ricard, how you feel?

1149
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,782
We're three days into
the biggest adventure

1150
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,150
of your life.

1151
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,018
-What's the vibe?
-(light laughter)

1152
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,388
So, when we saw you on day one,
you asked us a question.

1153
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,956
You asked us how we felt

1154
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,025
-about "Come on in, guys."
-PROBST: "Come on in, guys."

1155
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,127
-Right.
-RICARD: And the reality is

1156
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,562
there was so much going on--

1157
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,698
there's so much commotion,
cameras, my hair is messed up,

1158
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:29,266
I'm half crying--

1159
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,102
I don't have the capacity to do
what I'm really supposed to do,

1160
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,738
which I regret.

1161
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,007
I don't agree that we should
use the word "guys."

1162
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,309
-Huh.
-RICARD: I fully agree
that we should change it,

1163
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,811
whether it just be
dropping the "guys,"

1164
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,145
changing it to something else.

1165
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,214
I just don't really
agree with it.

1166
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:48,852
Reality is<i> Survivor</i> has changed
over the last 21 years,

1167
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,787
and those changes
have allowed all of us,

1168
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,390
all of these Brown people,
Black people, Asian people,

1169
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,692
so many queer people
to be here simultaneously.

1170
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,295
PROBST:
Yeah. It's a great point,
and I got to say,

1171
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,930
I love that you thought
about it more.

1172
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,499
I love that you had the courage
inside a million-dollar game

1173
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,702
in which standing up anytime
is risky

1174
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:08,338
to bring it up again,
because I'm with you.

1175
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,906
I want to change it.

1176
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,509
I'm glad that was the last time
I will ever say it.

1177
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,011
And realizing in this moment

1178
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,714
somebody right now
is on social media saying,

1179
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,116
"Oh, he caved,"

1180
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,118
it's @JeffProbst on Twitter.

1181
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,619
(laughter)

1182
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,087
I'll probably never
read it anyway.

1183
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,422
All right. I love that.

1184
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:29,025
We just made a change.
From now on, it is "Come on in."

1185
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,660
Okay.

1186
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,263
I want to tell you about
a new twist at Tribal Council.

1187
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,832
Gonna complicate the game
a little more.

1188
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:36,933
(sighing)

1189
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,869
If you go to Tribal Council

1190
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,804
and you fear you are in danger

1191
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,940
but you don't have an advantage,
you don't have an idol,

1192
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,410
this is
the Shot in the Dark die.

1193
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,145
Here's how
the Shot in the Dark works.

1194
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:52,416
<i>This die gives you the power</i>
<i>to decide not to vote</i>

1195
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,684
<i>but instead reach into a bag</i>

1196
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,521
<i>and draw for</i>
<i>a one-in-six shot at safety</i>

1197
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,689
<i>that night at Tribal Council.</i>

1198
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,126
Low odds. It's like 17%.

1199
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,896
But if you need a Hail Mary,
this will give it to you.

1200
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,764
Comes with a big invoice--
you can't vote--

1201
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,366
but if you think
you're in trouble,

1202
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,734
what does your vote matter
anyway?

1203
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,104
And this decision
will happen in private,

1204
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,705
in the voting booth,

1205
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,642
so nobody will know
what you've done

1206
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,345
until just before
I read the votes.

1207
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,215
Very new complication
to the strategy.

1208
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,850
There's one in here
for each of you.

1209
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,885
You can take these back
to your camp.

1210
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,520
Deal with that later.

1211
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,988
Sorry about that, JD.

1212
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,423
That's a bad toss, man.

1213
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:36,726
All right.

1214
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,196
Let's get to your first
immunity challenge.

1215
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,398
-(clapping, cheering)
-There's the immunity idol
right there.

1216
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,566
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

1217
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,700
-Yeah.
-(others whooping)

1218
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,101
In the tribe stage of the game,

1219
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,704
this is what you want,
because if this is at your camp,

1220
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,239
it means so are you.

1221
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,740
You're not going home.

1222
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,142
For today's challenge...

1223
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,779
<i>...you're gonna race over</i>
<i>and under a series of obstacles</i>

1224
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,747
<i>till you get to the sled.</i>

1225
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:01,151
<i>You're gonna load your sled</i>
<i>with very heavy puzzle pieces.</i>

1226
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,488
<i>Then two members at a time are</i>
<i>gonna move very heavy sandbags.</i>

1227
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:07,224
<i>Once you've cleared the track,</i>

1228
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,192
<i>you'll push the sled</i>
<i>down the track,</i>

1229
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,862
<i>transfer your puzzle pieces</i>
<i>to a crate,</i>

1230
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,298
<i>and then hoist them</i>
<i>to the top of a very tall tower</i>

1231
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,567
<i>where two players will solve</i>
<i>a</i> Survivor<i> puzzle.</i>

1232
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,941
The first and only
the first tribe to finish

1233
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,476
wins immunity.

1234

(all groaning, muttering)

1235
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,114
The two losing tribes
will go to Tribal Council.

Two people going home tonight.

1237

In addition,
the two losing tribes

1238
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,588
will have to forfeit
their flint.

1239
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,759
You will get a chance
to earn it back

1240
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,562
at the next immunity challenge.

1241
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,163
I hope it's starting to sink in

1242
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,200
this game is more difficult,
more dangerous.

1243
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,669
You have to perform
every single day,

1244
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,371
or you could be gone like that.

1245
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:58,708

strategize. We'll get started.

-PROBST: Exhausted bodies
everywhere.

This is<i> Survivor</i> 41.

1354
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,434
Just breathe.

1355
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,337
You are birthing a new era
of this game right now.

1356
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,339
-You guys got it.
-You got this, guys.
We are so in it.

1357
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,875
-RICARD: We're still in this.
-Just look. It's okay.

1358
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,044
We have time. You got this.

1359
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,913
They're double-sided.
They're double-sided.

1360
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:33,016
-Don't worry.
-Good. There you go.
There you go. Let's go!

1361
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,884
Yeah, Shan!

1362
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,253
PROBST: Shan and Sara getting
a lot of early momentum.

1363
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,522
Yeah, baby! Whoo!

1364
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,224
-Yes!
-PROBST: Right now it is Ua,

1365
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,461
and then Yase and Luvu
fighting for second.

1366
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:49,899
Unfortunately, today, second is
no different from third.

1367
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,434
You're both last.

1368
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,735
JD:
Yeah, get it in there!

1369
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,970
There you go!

1370
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,106
Wow, Ua continues to rip
through this puzzle.

1371
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,441
You got it, you got it!

1372
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,843
Luvu was in trouble early,

1373
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,812
and they're trying
to get back in it now.

1374
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,781
Erika trying to fit that piece,
and it's done!

1375
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,649
It's now Yase in last place.

1376
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,251
Turn that around flat.

1377
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,252
PROBST:
Again.

1378
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,353
-Yes!
-Nice.

1379
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,655
Another piece by Deshawn.

1380
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,725
Luvu is in this now.
We got a challenge.

1381
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,360
Another piece for Ua.

1382
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,262
They're trying
to hold on to that lead,

1383
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,731
-but Luvu is right
on their tail.
-NASEER: Yes, yes! Here we go!

1384
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,700
-On-on the long part.
-HEATHER: Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1385
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,436
PROBST:
Yase has made
very little progress.

1386
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:28,171
We're missing a piece.

1387
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,639
Keep working till you find that.

1388
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,074
You can do it. Yeah.

1389
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,375
It is now Luvu in the lead.

1390
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,810
-Yes!
-Yes!

1391
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:37,614
Luvu had to go all the way back
because of an error,

1392
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,383
and Luvu is now in first place.

1393
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,118
SARA:
Where's the...

1394
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,754
-BRAD: That's not it.
-GENIE: You got this.
You got this.

1395
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,589
PROBST:
What a comeback this would be.

1396
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:47,690
(whooping)

1397
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,629
PROBST:
And Ua just discovers

1398
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,098
they had not emptied
all of their pieces.

1399
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,966
They were still in the bag.

1400
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,868
An impossible way
to solve a puzzle.

1401
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,003
HEATHER:
Yes, yes, yes!

1402
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,137
PROBST:
Wow.

1403
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,072
That's that adrenaline
causing panic,

1404
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,774
causing a mistake,

1405
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,677
which leads to a visit
to Tribal Council

1406
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,313
as Luvu is closer and closer.

1407
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,782
Ua, now that they have
all their pieces,

1408
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,618
they're actually starting
to get back into this.

1409
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,253
It makes you wonder
what would've happened

1410
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,289
if they had 'em all
from the beginning.

1411
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,491
Deshawn with
the next to last piece.

1412
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:23,593
Erika for the win.

1413
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,495
(cheering, exclaiming)

1414
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:27,263
-And they've got it!
-(cheering)

1415
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:31,534
Luvu wins first immunity
challenge of<i> Survivor</i> 41...

1416
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,036
(excited chatter)

1417
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,205
...sending Ua and Yase
to Tribal Council.

1418
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,775
(excited chatter,
cheering continue)

1420
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,620
Luvu.

1421
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,388
Congratulations.

1422
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,792
Tribe immunity is yours.

1423
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,994
All six of you are safe.

1424
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,362
Nobody going home.

1425
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,730
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

1426
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,265
Enjoy the night off.

Ua, Yase, different story.

Tribal Council tonight,
somebody will be voted out.

1431

Before you go,
I need your flint.

1432
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:20,249
Sorry for you. Sorry for you.

Thank you.

1646

Who would you want?
Who would you want?

<i>SHAN:</i>
<i>If I can get the person</i>

1648
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,285
that I want out tonight,
that puts me in

1649
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,588
a really good spot
to keep controlling this game.

First Tribal Council,
here we go.

01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:52,254

1653

Behind each of you is a torch.

1654
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:59,295
Go ahead and grab a torch,
dip it in and get fire.

1655
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,700
This is part of the ritual
of Tribal Council because

1656
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:07,469
in this game,
fire represents your life,

1657
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,471
and when your fire is gone,
so are you.

1658
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,574
It's about to be the case
for one of you tonight.

1659
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,543
So let's just start big-picture.

1660
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,713
Tiffany, the first hours
the first day,

1661
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,849
you're trying to find our vibe.
What's our group?

1662
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,619
Do you feel that
this is a tribe?

1663
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,455
I do. I feel it's
a pretty cohesive tribe.

1664
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,458
You know, we don't just exist;
we exist in harmony.

1665
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,927
And you get to know somebody
from your heart.

1666
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,096
I think that that's what we're
doing going forward in this,

1667
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,731
even in this world right now.

1668
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,299
We're starting to love
each other

1669
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,602
and accept every one
of our differences,

1670
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:41,036
and we're doing
a really good job

1671
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:44,273
showing the rest of the world
that we did it in one day.

1672
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,309
PROBST:
Abraham, the other big thing

1673
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:49,011
that you guys
are dealing with is

1674
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,646
the tribe is only six people.

1675
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:52,615
-Yes.
-So when it comes to voting
somebody out,

1676
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,350
what's the criteria?

1677
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,987
We look at it as the strength
we have moving forward

1678
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,789
will compel us to be able to do
and select the right person.

1679
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,558
And it's not out of malice.

1680
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:06,028
I mean, we're living the
life experience on<i> Survivor,</i>

1681
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,563
but on the other side,

1682
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,565
who we have and what we
put together for strength

1683
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,166
is gonna be what we look at
and say, okay,

1684
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:12,801
this will get us further
in the game.

1685
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,004
PROBST:
Tiffany, Abraham's answer

1686
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,773
sounds to me like somebody who's
played this game many times

1687
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,508
because he said
absolutely nothing

1688
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,310
-while saying many, many words.
-(Tiffany chuckles)

1689
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,545
Right, that is very much
who Abraham is.

1690
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,148
He's very good
at speaking in circles,

1691
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:28,450
and you're not really sure
if you ever got an answer.

1692
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,185
It's-it's like a magic trick.

1693
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,920
Where I have the gift of being

1694
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,789
friendly and loving
with everybody,

1695
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,291
he has a gift of
being close with everybody

1696
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,093
yet not saying a single thing

1697
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,664
unless he absolutely feels
it's necessary for his game.

1698
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,233
You know, Jeff, I can't change
her mind about that,

1699
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:45,768
but at the end of the day,

1700
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,436
here's what I bring
to the table.

1701
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:49,171
I bring the stamina.
I bring the strength.

1702
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,873
You know,
I'm coming to get it done.

1703
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,374
PROBST:
Evvie, this is fascinating

1704
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,777
because Abraham
hears somebody say,

1705
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,779
"I don't think you make
any sense when you talk,"

1706
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,781
and he says, "Okay, that's fine.
I know what I bring."

1707
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,849
And the great thing
about this game is

1708
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,618
he might be reading it right.

1709
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:04,253
It's just irrelevant
what Tiffany thinks

1710
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:05,688
about "my communication."

1711
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:09,558
Or it could be Tiffany tonight
writing down Abraham.

1712
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,193
"I hope you understand this."

1713
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,661
(laughs)

1714
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:14,530
EVVIE:
Yeah, there are about
to only be five of us,

1715
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,865
and we definitely don't want
to get down to four.

1716
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,467
So, I mean,
I think challenge strength

1717
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,802
is extremely important.

1718
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,104
PROBST:
Voce, the Shot in the Dark.

1719
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,006
New twist.

1720
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,141
Walk up there to vote,
nobody knows if you're

1721
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,077
going to vote,
play your Shot in the Dark.

1722
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,012
They don't know
what you're gonna do.

1723
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,515
But it could mess everything up
if you draw that 17% shot

1724
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,184
and you're safe.

1725
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,952
16.7.

1726
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,287
Thank you.

1727
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:40,622
-(laughter)
-I love that.

1728
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,624
I'm just glad I got close at 17.

1729
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,126
I was guessing.

1730
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,363
So, Mr. Math Expert, at 16.7%,

1731
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,833
how does the Shot in the Dark
change the game?

1732
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,569
Yeah, I think the idea of it
is terrifying

1733
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:57,573
because if I'm in danger,
I'm gonna take that shot.

1734
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,542
But at the end of the day, if
you think through it logically,

1735
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:03,779
I don't think it's actually
as scary as what it is.

1736
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,614
Liana, that is
the kind of answer that,

1737
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,883
if somebody said it to me,
I would think,

1738
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,818
"I should probably take
my Shot in the Dark.

1739
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,155
That sounds like they're trying
to get me off the scent."

1740
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,924
Yeah, if you are somebody
that feels like you are

1741
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,494
on the minority,
you get this sliver of power,

1742
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,496
and so that can cause
a ton of chaos,

1743
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,731
you know, whether that be
a revote or somebody that's

1744
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:25,534
top dog in the majority alliance
is suddenly gone.

1745
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,936
Like, it can completely
stir up the game.

1746
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,705
PROBST:
Xander, how will tonight's vote,

1747
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:32,341
if it goes the way
you think it's gonna go,

1748
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:34,376
make this tribe better?

1749
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,379
I think that this tribe has
gotten a bitter taste of loss,

1750
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,715
and maybe the other tribes
see us as something less,

1751
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:42,751
but I want to be able
to show them

1752
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,653
that we're not a David tribe.

1753
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,155
This is a strong tribe

1754
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,056
that works together
really, really well.

1755
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:50,425
Somebody from the David tribe
won that season.

1756
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:52,694
-Right.
-That's true.

1757
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,797
-PROBST: Evvie,
how about for you?
-EVVIE: As everyone's saying,

1758
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,465
we're really cohesive as it is,

1759
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:59,668
and I really think that we'll
leave here even more cohesive.

1760
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,204
If we leave this Tribal
strong as a tribe,

1761
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,506
able to do everything
we got to do around camp,

1762
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,809
able to win in challenges,
we'll be so much better off

1763
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,845
for the later part of this game
when we, like, critically

1764
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:13,248
will need each other,
you know, just as we do now.

1765
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:15,250
How we feeling?
It's time to vote?

1766

Go ahead and grab a torch,

1801
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:50,272
approach the flame,
dip it in and get fire.

Straight out of the gate,
domination by Ua.

1805
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,993
So, Shan, what did you feel
with this group?

1806
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:13,795
SHAN:
I felt a great sense
of camaraderie

1807
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:15,330
and so much excitement and joy

1808
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,432
that we had just,
like, conquered

1809
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,434
the very first challenge
right out the gate.

1810
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,336
Like, that put us in
such a good headspace

1811
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:22,671
for the next couple days.

1812
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:25,107
I think we got fire in, like,
the first 30 minutes

1813
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,642
and, like, we built our shelter.

1814
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:29,144
It was a beautiful space,
honestly.

RICARD:
We have not fought.

1816
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,481
No one's had anger.
It's, like...

1817
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:33,849
-"Kumbaya."
-...really weird.

1818
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:35,917
And not like the fake "Kumbaya,"

1819
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,753
where everyone's in
a honeymoon phase.

-SHAN: Mm-hmm.

And yet you're gonna
vote somebody out.

1822
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,027
-Yeah.
-PROBST: Beautiful part
of the game.

1823
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,762
BRAD:
Jeff, we would trade you
a machete

1824
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,463
and our last pot if you'd just

1825
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,365
kind of let us stay
as a family tonight.

1826
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,067
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

1827
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,769
-(laughter)
-So, Shan,

1828
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,038
yesterday,
one person from your tribe

1829
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,839
had to leave the tribe,
get on a boat.

1830
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,542
What are you thinking when you
have to make that decision?

1831
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:04,546
Oh, well, like he said,
we are a very namaste tribe.

1832
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,581
And so we're like,
"Let's get democratic,"

1833
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,183
and we pulled rocks and...

1834
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,453
JD knew that if he came
back here without any rice,

1835
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,988
we're gonna know
you have an item,

1836
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,289
we're gonna vote you out.

1837
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,625
And that's why I said,
"Check my bag,"

1838
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:19,761
at the very start--
'cause I did tell them

1839
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,196
that I had a chance
to get an advantage,

1840
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,631
and I told them
exactly what it was.

1841
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:26,234
And to risk my vote
on the first vote?

1842
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,370
I didn't think
that was very smart.

1843
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:31,573
And so I told them my decision
to protect my vote, so...

1844
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,208
SARA:
You do have to be skeptical

1845
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,744
when someone shows back up
with nothing in their hands

1846
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,379
when typically
something like this,

1847
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,081
they have an opportunity
to get something.

1848
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,982
You're taking the word
of someone you don't know.

1849
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,185
-And I'm not saying
I don't believe him...
-JD: Yeah, yeah.

1850
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,786
...but I'm just saying
you have to have

1851
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:47,089
some skepticism in this game.

1852
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,824
PROBST:
Let's talk about
today's challenge.

1853
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,725
Looked to me, Sara,
that it came down

1854
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,627
to one piece that was missing,

1855
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,830
but it was a piece you needed
in order to continue.

1856
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,765
What happened?
How'd you discover it?

1857
01:18:56,832 --> 01:19:00,635
Yeah, so we got, like, a pretty
good start on that puzzle.

1858
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,371
Those pieces were
flying together at first and...

1859
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:05,040
-You were in the lead.
-Yeah, we were in the lead,

1860
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,609
and that one piece
connected the side

1861
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:08,910
to the rest of the puzzle.

1862
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:11,346
And, like, that's a mistake,

1863
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,281
and that could have
been avoided.

1864
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:15,383
In<i> Survivor</i> season 41,

1865
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,853
there is no room
for mistakes like that.

1866
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:19,387
You know, we just...
we're learning that this is

1867
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,456
-a new era for real.
-GENIE: And also the fact that,

1868
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,259
like, there's only one immunity,
uh, you know,

1869
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:26,027
like, to-to win? Like...

1870
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,230
-What is that, Jeff? I mean...
-GENIE: We. I mean...

1871
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:30,398
-(laughter)
-SARA: Namaste.

1872
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:33,535
PROBST:
That is why<i> Survivor</i> is
so compelling,

1873
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,971
and the stakes are high
when you're on a tribe of six.

1874
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,906
So regardless whether
it's Sara and Shan's fault

1875
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,708
or they get credit
for stepping up doesn't matter.

1876
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:41,009
Somebody's going home.

1877
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,711
JD, what kind of criteria

1878
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:44,746
starts kicking in for you,
in terms of...

1879
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:47,983
What do you want to be
after tonight's vote?

1880
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:50,986
Right, your-your mindset
fluctuates

1881
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,255
because if you feel as though
you're on the bottom,

1882
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,657
like, my criteria is very low,

1883
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,593
but if you are
kind of running things

1884
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,462
and you got
the best relationships,

1885
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,164
now you have a little leeway.

1886
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,166
You can choose
who you want to go home.

1887
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,668
And so I think...
I think everybody

1888
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,203
talked to everybody
at one point,

1889
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,238
and-and I also think that...

1890
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,673
-Does that concern you at all?
-JD: Yeah.

1891
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,209
Yeah, that's terrifying
right there.

1892
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:15,577
Maybe some plans are changing.

1893
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,179
And that's what
I was about to say,

1894
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,014
was that I think everybody's
name was thrown out

1895
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,482
at least one time.

1896
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:23,685
Okay, but mine was thrown out
to my face multiple times.

1897
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,388
So, out of everyone here,
Brad comes over

1898
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:30,025
and says, "Well, we think
it's got to be Sara or Shan."

1899
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,860
Like, you know, we got to stay
strong, and it's like...

1900
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,229
Are we about to make this
a live Tribal?

1901
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:35,697
-SARA: I mean...
-JD: I'm down.

1902
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,933
Like, we're already whispering
over here, and I thought...

1903
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,868
I've heard that I'm
on the block tonight, and I...

1904
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:41,603
BRAD: I just threw up
two names because,

1905
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,939
though that was the puzzle, what
Jeff was talking about earlier.

1906
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,407
I get it.

1907
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,375
"Okay, those two are on the
block." You know what I mean?

1908
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:49,978
And I-I try to...

1909
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:51,813
play that straight, but...

1910
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,383
GENIE:
I-I mean, it was...

1911
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,386
-No matter whose name...
-Yeah, this is, uh...

1912
01:20:58,453 --> 01:20:59,888
JD:
Let's get it started.

1913
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:04,993
RICARD: So the point I was
trying to make earlier, though,

1914
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,128
the puzzle piece,
that's old-school.

1915
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,397
We blame the people
who messed up, made one mistake.

1916
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:12,267
But we need to work
with people we can trust.

1917
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,470
RICARD: Maybe think about
future challenges.

1918
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,339
Maybe names you throw out

1919
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,541
and the paranoia you cause,
that's what I'm more

1920
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,409
-paying attention to.
-SHAN: I'm with you.

1921
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,212
Like, right now?

1922
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,148
(splutters)

1923
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,234
All right.

1924
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,040
(groans)

1925
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:55,010
JD: Jeff, it's funny because
when you see on TV,

1926
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,012
you hear the conversations,
right?

1927
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,481
But, like, once again,

1928
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,017
I'm hearing different things
than what I was back at camp.

1929
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,954
So either now or then,
people were feeding me bull.

1930
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:07,722
-Mm-hmm.
-JD: Now I have to decipher

1931
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:10,058
whether or not
what they said then was true

1932
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,559
or what they say now is true.

1933
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,695
I don't quite understand
the paranoia, man.

1934
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,297
-JD: From me?
-BRAD: Yeah.

1935
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:16,731
I thought we were tight.

1936
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,733
-I thought we were cool.
-(JD stammering)

1937
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,335
-I am.
-I am.

1938
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,003
-I am.
-All right.

1939
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:25,273
Wow.

1940
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,776
Jeff, can all of us put our die
in our pocket right now?

1941
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,277
Absolutely.

1942
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:36,217
-Do you have it close?
-I already put it in my pocket.

1943
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,653
JD:
Jeff, tonight's gonna be a...

1944
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,690
a Saturday night at Las Vegas,
maybe, up there.

1945
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,525
-We'll see what happens.
-Jeff, just take us
to the vote, please.
