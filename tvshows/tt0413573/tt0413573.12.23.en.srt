00:00:03,514 --> 00:00:06,849
<i>Infections have a nasty
way of sneaking up on you.</i>

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:16,225
<i>You're feeling pretty good,
you think the infection's gone,</i>

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,961
<i>and then it reappears...</i>

4
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:21,197
<i>out of nowhere...</i>

5
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:23,065
<i>when your body's still weak,</i>

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,867
when you've barely recovered...

7
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,485
- Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,040
- What's all this?
- Sold it. I'm done with it.

9
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:34,076
- With the trailer?
- Yep. Don't need it anymore.

10
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:35,498
Don't you need a place to sleep,

11
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,904
or are you moving into my
house, too, and no one told me?

12
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:40,416
(Chuckles) Better. I
just bought my own house.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,199
Closing it this morning. Amelia's
been giving me a hard time

14
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,595
about getting a grown-up house, so...

15
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:47,590
So, no more trailer.

16
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:49,776
<i>Bam. You're infected all over again.</i>

17
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,077
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,640
Wh... Sh... Is this...
Should I have asked you?

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,162
- I should've asked you.
- No, no.

20
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:58,442
You paid for it. It's yours
to do what you want with.

21
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:00,027
- You sure?
- Yes.

22
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,030
- Congratulations on the new house.
- Thanks.

23
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,498
(Engine starts)

24
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,408
And once the infection spreads,

25
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,469
<i>once it gets into your bloodstream,</i>

26
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:11,652
<i>well, then you really have to watch it.</i>

27
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:16,026
<i>'Cause that's the kind of infection...</i>

28
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:19,895
<i>that can kill you.</i>

29
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:25,749
- (Clears throat, sighs)
- (Sighs)

30
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:31,997
(Sighs)

31
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,094
Catherine's back in town next week.

32
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,363
Thought it'd be nice to
have some people over.

33
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,647
Well, nothing fancy... just dinner.

34
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,283
Who's in?

35
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:46,603
You know, that's a
fine idea, Dr. Webber.

36
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,408
- (Chuckles)
- Oh, sorry.

37
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,356
Yes, yes, yes. Thanks. Absolutely.

38
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,246
Mm-hmm, okay. Avery said yes.

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,947
- Uh, how about you?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

40
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,059
- Okay.
- I'm not sure

41
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:57,308
about Dr. Warren's schedule, though.

42
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,052
(Sighs)

43
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,789
Okay. Um, Warren?

44
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:04,329
- Uh, yeah, I'm in.
- All right.

45
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:06,009
Uh, what can I bring?

46
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,385
Um, I wouldn't say no
to that artichoke dip

47
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,807
- you brought to the resident mixer.
- (Chuckles)

48
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:13,664
Well, that's, uh... that's
Miranda's secret recipe.

49
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,495
(Clears throat)

50
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:17,433
Okay.

51
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,108
I see. (Clears throat)

52
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:24,346
- I'll bring it.
- (Elevator dings)

53
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,517
Should be a great party.

54
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:37,224
Hey, Maggie, did you hear
that Owen bought a house?

55
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,927
Oh, good, now you can
naked snuggle on his sofa.

56
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,396
Wait. Furniture. Right. I
need some of that. Suction.

57
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,948
No black recliners, I beg you.

58
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,615
And nothing you have
to assemble yourself.

59
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,636
You got a real house, get some real
furniture, keep the momentum going.

60
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,471
Hey, maybe you should
come shopping with me,

61
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,620
point me in the right direction.

62
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,008
Then you'll just wind up with a
house full of furniture I like.

63
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:59,079
I don't see that as a problem.
I want stuff we both can enjoy.

64
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,847
Wait. What? Why? Is she...

65
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,350
Are you moving in with him?

66
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,661
- Duval forceps, please.
- Oh, no.

67
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,272
I mean, that's not... I don't think...

68
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:10,217
Why not? Just think
about it. It's pretty big.

69
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,288
Nice yard. Good school district.

70
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:18,272
(Chuckles) I'm sorry. Did you just
go from moving in to having kids?

71
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,812
Boy, you guys move fast.

72
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,594
I couldn't even sleep in
the same bed as my fiancé.

73
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:24,623
- We were engaged for a year.
- Long engagements... bad idea.

74
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:28,449
I agree. Better to go straight to
the, uh, marriage part. It's better.

75
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,991
Would you get married again?

76
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,062
I'd consider it, with the right person.

77
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:34,872
- You would?
- I'd strongly consider it, yes.

78
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,884
Me too.

79
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:40,748
- With the right person.
- Okay, then.

80
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:46,573
Wait. What? Did you j... What
just happened? Are you engaged now?

81
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,921
- What? No.
- No.

82
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,965
- Hypotheticals.
- We were just... That was nothing.

83
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,912
We were just talking. We were just...

84
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:58,446
Maggie, we were just talking.

85
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:01,134
Oh, please. How long you
think till you move out?

86
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:04,004
- Who's moving out?
- Amelia, when she marries Owen Hunt

87
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,673
and moves into his big,
new, kid-friendly house.

88
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,409
No, no. Okay, hang on. It was a
hypothetical conversation. That is it.

89
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,975
In which you were picking
out hypothetical furniture

90
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,666
for your hypothetical
children's hypothetical playroom.

91
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,117
- Wow.
- It... it was nothing.

92
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,712
- Can we drop it, please?
- Why?

93
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:19,887
Gladly.

94
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:24,518
- Gladly? Why gladly? What's wrong?
- Do you see a dilation?

95
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,178
I'm worried about
medullary sponge kidney.

96
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:30,017
- You didn't answer my question.
- You didn't answer mine.

97
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:32,475
You think we're moving
too fast? Is that it?

98
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:33,949
Amelia, please.

99
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,969
You're the one who
pushed us back together.

100
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:38,872
You know, you practically yelled at me

101
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:41,341
to run back into his arms, and now...

102
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,943
Thanks for the consult.

103
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,792
I called the landlord,

104
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:58,267
and he agreed to swap
out our two-bedroom lease

105
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,327
for something smaller, since...

106
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:04,427
I mean, I figured that I could
save on rent while I'm at Preminger,

107
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,569
so I can afford to fly
back on weekends to Seattle

108
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,704
to, you know, visit you and Sofia.

109
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,931
- Okay.
- Okay?

110
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,415
Yeah, sounds good.

111
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:21,648
I don't want to leave
when we're like this.

112
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,150
We've barely talked since the trial.

113
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:27,054
- I really don't know what to say.
- Neither do I, but I am trying to...

114
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,590
say words and to be here and help.

115
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:31,658
You've helped enough.

116
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:35,395
Okay.

117
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,713
Okay.

118
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:48,824
(Sighs)

119
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:51,339
X-rays came back clear. No breaks.

120
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,602
We got lucky, Nash. So listen
to your grandma the next time

121
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:57,828
she tells you not to climb
the bookshelves, okay?

122
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,513
All right.

123
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:07,661
Thank you, Doctor. You have
been so good with him today,

124
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,349
so patient, and I can't help but notice

125
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,666
- I don't see a ring on your finger.
- (Chuckling) Excuse me?

126
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,106
You should meet my daughter...
Nash's mom. Not the sharpest tack,

127
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,564
but really sweet, really pretty.

128
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:21,423
Ma'am, I appreciate the offer,
but I'm with someone already.

129
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:23,313
- Oh, are you engaged?
- Uh, no...

130
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,070
- Are you getting engaged?
- Uh, well, I...

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,555
Her number's in that chart. I'll
tell her to expect your call.

132
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,258
Okay.

133
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:35,456
(Siren wails in distance)

134
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:37,937
- Hey.
- I think Grandma over there

135
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:39,967
just arranged my
marriage to her daughter.

136
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:41,389
(Laughs)

137
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,619
Well, there must be something in
the air, because Amelia and Owen

138
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,569
are talking about getting married, too.

139
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,302
Hey, maybe you guys could
have a double wedding.

140
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:50,161
Then I would only have
to live through it once.

141
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,175
Help! Please! Someone help!
It's okay, buddy. I got you.

142
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,441
Whoa. Okay, what happened?

143
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,334
He passed out, he came to,
and then he passed out again.

144
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,078
- Okay, let's get him down here.
- Is another kid outside.

145
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:00,812
- Is this your son, sir?
- Uh, no. I'm his driver's ed teacher.

146
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,348
Hey, I got it.

147
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,522
Hey, there. You okay?

148
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,953
Can I... can I park here?

149
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:17,303
Quit hovering and just go
in there and talk to him.

150
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:21,942
He has made it very clear he doesn't
want me anywhere near him. So, no.

151
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,538
Does she have him on
fluconazole in case it's fungal?

152
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,784
You do realize that Kyle can see you?

153
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,007
It's not one-way glass.

154
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:32,781
Thank you.

155
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,987
(Clatter)

156
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:45,192
- Kyle? Oh, God.
- I'm fine.

157
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,528
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

158
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:49,664
I'm fine.

159
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,666
Everything just...

160
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,303
started spinning.

161
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:57,201
The... the nausea's probably
because of the antibiotics.

162
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:01,401
Uh, I'll get Dr. Shepherd
to get you an antiemetic.

163
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:04,412
(Vomits)

164
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,316
(Coughs)

165
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:10,998
Why don't you just go?

166
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,053
Take that.

167
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,784
(Vomits)

168
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:23,030
(Panting)

169
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,923
I don't need any help.

170
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,858
And I definitely don't
want an audience for this.

171
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:33,708
Then, um, let's pretend
that you're puking

172
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:35,215
for some other reason, then.

173
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,945
Like, um, after a show or something.

174
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,930
Too many whiskey shots,
you know? Fun puking.

175
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,418
You're not hearing me. I
don't need any help from you.

176
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:47,409
Look, I understand if you
don't want to deal with me,

177
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,947
but you are gonna need
somebody. Does your friends,

178
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:51,547
do your family know that you're here?

179
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:54,368
(Scoffs) That's none of
your business, all right?

180
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:58,199
- I'm not your business anymore.
- Okay.

181
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,301
But you're gonna need someone.

182
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:04,705
Dr. Shepherd took out your implant.
Your tremor is gonna come back.

183
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,247
No kidding.

184
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:12,913
Kyle, I'm sorry.

185
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:16,717
(Voice breaking) I'm
gonna puke again... now.

186
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,031
How about you just go?

187
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,656
Go. Go!

188
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,732
I'm g... I'm going.

00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,822
Dad, Dad, I may have brushed
against the wall, but...

191
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:50,444
Good news, Arvin. I see no signs
of anything. You're doing just fine.

192
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:54,205
And the doctor says I'm
fine. Yeah. The doctor.

193
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,593
Well, it... it was the wall of
a hospital, but didn't I say that?

194
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:59,429
Tell him that Rhys had
a medical emergency.

195
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:00,815
It's strep throat.
That's not an emergency.

196
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:03,752
Strep throat shouldn't cause you
to faint. Are you on antibiotics?

197
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:05,937
Yeah, for two days. I'm fine.

198
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,781
But, still, open up.

199
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,435
You passed out in a car.

200
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,864
You know how dangerous
that is on the road?

201
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,274
I wasn't even driving! It was Arvin!

202
00:10:12,284 --> 00:10:13,704
- Has he passed out before?
- I don't know.

203
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,634
His mother would kill me if
I let something happen to him.

204
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:16,890
Aw, please don't talk about her.

205
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,689
It looks like Rhys has
a peritonsillar abscess.

206
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,243
I do need to drain it.

207
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,752
Oh, no, no, you're not sticking
that thing down my throat.

208
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,930
Hey, hey, Rhys, buddy, it's
okay. I'm here. All right?

209
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,723
It's like I told you, I want
you to think of me as a father.

210
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:29,903
Why? All my mom ever talks about is
when she's gonna break up with you.

211
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,188
- What?
- Hold on. Hold on.

212
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,707
Your mom's doing our
driver's ed teacher?

213
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,809
(Siren wails in distance)

214
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,578
I came as soon as I got the
message. Rhys, honey, are you okay?

215
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:40,432
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- No, he's not okay, and neither am I.

216
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:42,710
You told him that you want to
break up with me? Is that true?

217
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,357
- You told him?
- Uh, n... Ahh, ahh?

218
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,132
This is way better than
our last driver's ed class.

219
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,500
Ready? Here we go.

220
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,995
Oh.

221
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,425
(Elevator dings)

222
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,165
- Be nice.
- I know.

223
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,086
But, God, she put me through hell.

224
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:04,270
I know, and you won. You
can afford to be magnanimous.

225
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:07,841
Hey, guys. Well, I, uh,
was wondering if, um...

226
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,976
I've had a surgery
come up later this week,

227
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,078
and so I wanted to ask
if I could please have

228
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:15,081
Sofia Tuesday night instead of Thursday.

229
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:19,897
Um, so if I allow you
to have Sofia on Tuesday,

230
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:23,150
then in exchange, I
will have her Friday?

231
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:24,980
Yeah, sure, if that's what you want.

232
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,693
Great. Okay, then I will make that work.

233
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,261
Thank you.

234
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:30,997
- She's gone.
- Hmm?

235
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,134
I'd lose that crazed smile
before you start cramping.

236
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:36,427
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:39,706
I am concerned about Kyle.

238
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,969
You know, he's still septic. His
cultures are showing possible fungus.

239
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,540
He's also complaining of neck stiffness.

240
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,462
Why are you talking to me about this?

241
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,652
You operated three days ago.

242
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:49,212
- Why isn't he recovering?
- No. You are off this case.

243
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:50,779
You are not on my service today.

244
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,967
Why are you talking to me about this?

245
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,654
Are you sure the infection

246
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:57,257
isn't because of the
second lead you placed...

247
00:11:57,267 --> 00:11:58,767
The one you had to convince us to get?

248
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:01,316
Him... the one I convinced him to get

249
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,797
because he is my patient, not you.

250
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,566
- I am just concerned.
- And if you were the patient's family,

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,468
I would want to assuage those concerns,

252
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:10,804
but you are neither family
nor friend right now.

253
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:15,022
- He developed a complication.
- Complications happen, Edwards.

254
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:18,277
We deal with them every
day. Today is no different.

255
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,626
White count is trending
down, wound is clean,

256
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:24,417
but his temp is still a little high.

257
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,587
- Hey, Kyle, how you feeling?
- I was good until these two showed up.

258
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,090
It's been nag city
for the last half-hour.

259
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,092
Well, maybe you should think
about that the next time

260
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,859
you're in the hospital for
three days without calling us.

261
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,230
I went through 19 hours of
labor with you, without drugs.

262
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,265
You owe me at least a text or a "tweep."

263
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,129
Mom, it's a tweet, for the 10th time.

264
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,123
- Are you Dr. Shepherd?
- I am, yeah.

265
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,506
Dr. Shepherd recently
removed the infected device

266
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,241
from Kyle's brain,
but you should be aware

267
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:50,243
that both the surgery
and the antibiotics

268
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:51,571
aren't working as well as we expected.

269
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,613
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Edwards.

270
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,525
I'm one of the surgeons here.

271
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:56,973
This is her?

272
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,448
- This is her.
- You can go.

273
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,461
Kyle, if we could just talk...

274
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:01,955
- Why is she even here?
- I want her to go.

275
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,617
- Mm-hmm.
- My son is not good enough for her.

276
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:04,828
She's not good enough for us.

277
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:08,044
My brother's broken a lot of hearts,
but I've never seen anyone break his.

278
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,055
And I got to think he'd be
better off if he'd come in here

279
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,876
sooner instead of trying to avoid you.

280
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:15,315
So, please, do my family a favor
and get the hell out of here.

281
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,988
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.
That will be all.

282
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:26,946
So, it's a basic
decortication procedure,

283
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:28,815
except there is a slight abnormality.

284
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,039
Yeah, sorry, I can't take
your decortication procedure

285
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:33,753
'cause I already took
it. Just did the consult.

286
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,421
You just took my patient
without telling me?

287
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:37,770
You've been pawning decortications
off on me since I got here.

288
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,292
You hate them, so now I just take
them, and you don't have to pawn.

289
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:42,705
Thank you.

290
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:45,398
- Bacon?
- Is that a box of bacon?

291
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:48,168
- Bacon. Mm-hmm.
- A cardiothoracic hand grenade.

292
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,330
- You know you're a doctor, right?
- Mm.

293
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,188
- A heart doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,768
It is good.

295
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,344
- Told you.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,209
It's my job, isn't it?

297
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,186
You got the big, fancy job, and
you have no respect for mine.

298
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,843
Are you trying to tell me
that your life's ambitions

299
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:10,156
stopped after driver's ed teacher?

300
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,385
Do you know how many hours the average
American spends behind the wheel...

301
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,874
- Oh, here we go.
- Many accidents there are every day?

302
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:15,628
I am shaping the drivers of the future.

303
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:17,263
I'm saving lives! I'm a freaking hero!

304
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:20,015
Okay, Superman. We get it,
okay? Hands at 10 and 2.

305
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,969
Yeah, except the recommended
placement is 9 and 3 now.

306
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:24,003
- 9 and 3!
- See these two?

307
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,398
You and Wilson are doing it
right, not rushing into things.

308
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,775
Rushing into things? We've
been together a million years.

309
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,176
Dr. Karev? Dr. Grey?

310
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,706
Had to put the screws to the X-ray tech,

311
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:33,379
but I got him to rush Rhys' films.

312
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,412
- Is that air around the trachea?
- I hope not.

313
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:37,884
It could be artifact, but we need a CT.

314
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,316
You're really great.
You're... you're clean, but...

315
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:41,935
Who's interrupting the
happy couple to let Mom know?

316
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:43,389
I don't know. I was
thinking right about now.

317
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,650
- Yeah, well, maybe I am, too.
- Oh, great.

318
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,293
So now you're gonna break up
with me? This is fantastic.

319
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,495
(Indistinct arguing)

320
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,068
Have fun.

321
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,234
(Exhales sharply)

322
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,991
(Elevator dings)

323
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:00,607
Jo, look, I need to know what is
going on with Kyle. Just tell me.

324
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,709
Shepherd would kill me.
His family would kill me.

325
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,186
Jo, please. Come on.

326
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,717
You have, what, four floors
to tell me everything you know.

327
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:07,847
Please. What is going on?

328
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,024
Okay, his symptoms
aren't getting any better.

329
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,484
He's febrile with some
headaches, a bit lethargic,

330
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:17,914
and Shepherd ordered a
stat CT that showed evidence

331
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:20,574
of an abscess in the
periventricular area.

332
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:26,222
Okay. Uh, s... so what
is Shepherd's plan?

333
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:28,434
Drainage and ventricular washout.

334
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,504
No. Wh... No. What?

335
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,018
She wouldn't do that. She knows

not be involved in this case,

- What?
- Yeah, when I'm well

537
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,676
and I'm done with this place,
we should go away together.

538

All right, so she's pissed about
them getting married someday.

- Why's that?
- There's a kid on the table

alive right in front of us.

Young kid with advanced nec

Well, not necessarily. I...
feel pretty good about it.

Okay.

I do.

Well, you feel really good
about a lot of things, so...

- Nothing.

Is that... is that what
you're talking about?

Let's not. You have surgery.

599
00:27:58,418 --> 00:28:00,576
- I can handle it.
- Can you?

600
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:02,207
- Because it seems like...
- Like what?

601
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:03,436
like you don't even see it.

602
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:05,247
You think you're
making all these choices

603
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:08,035
and building this life when
none of this is actually yours.

604
00:28:08,045 --> 00:28:09,438
That doesn't even make sense.

605
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:12,421
It does make sense. You
are living in my house,

606
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:16,091
helping to take care of
my children with my sister.

607
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,488
You are marrying my best friend's ex.

608
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,174
You are trying to do my husband's job.

609
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:26,201
You know, you used to have
humility, even a little anxiety,

610
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:29,378
and now you even have his confidence.

611
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,813
But why not? Because you've
taken over everything else.

612
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:35,987
- What are you saying?
- Get your own life.

613
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:37,671
You have surgery.

614
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,135

have to stay here.

but it doesn't mean that I don't care,

616
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:56,399
- okay, about you and the kid.
- I didn't say it was nothing.

617
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:58,587
Oh, right. Sorry. Sex.

618
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:00,805
You were using me for my stick shift.

619
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:04,088
Noah, for God's sake,
that is not what I said.

620
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:06,061
- Excuse me.
- Hi. We have an update.

621
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:07,930
- Okay.
- The surgery went well.

622
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,666
We believe we were able to
resect all of the infected tissue.

623
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,350
Rhys was very lucky. If you
hadn't brought him in when you did,

624
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,304
we probably wouldn't
have been so successful.

625
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:16,605
Oh, wow.

626
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,340
Okay.

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,504
- Okay.
- It's okay.

628
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,510
- Thank you.
- He's gonna be okay.

629
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,950
He's here because of you.

630
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,084
(Scoffs) He would've died, and
he didn't because of you. Right?

631
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:31,754
Yeah, kind of. Um, yeah.

632
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,903
You are a hero.

633
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:36,563
I mean, I just did
what needed to be done.

634
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,521
Wow.

635
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:42,752
Okay.

636
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:44,833
Well, good luck.

640
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:57,822
That's like post-traumatic
stress romance.

641
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:59,379
You know what? Give it a rest.

642
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:01,908
Just because you choose to be unhappy
doesn't mean everybody else has to.

643
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:04,924
- Not true. Not always a choice.
- You have chances, you know?

644

You're hot, you're smart, you're funny.

645
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,192
Maybe Thorpe didn't work out, but that
doesn't mean you have to stop trying.

646
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:13,804
And it sure as hell doesn't mean
you get to crap on everyone else.

647
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,698
And, yeah, I'm gonna have a big wedding,

648
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,436
and you're gonna be there 'cause
you're gonna be my best man!

649
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:19,930
Deal with it!

650
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,502
Doctor.

651
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,205
(Heart monitor beeping)

652
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,377
Hi.

653
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:34,583
Um... is there any way that I
could also have Sofia tonight?

654
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:36,218
I know we already moved things around,

655
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,019
and thank you again so much, by the way.

656
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,488
It's just I really need to...

657
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:44,093
Could I have her tonight, please?

658
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:46,563
It's just... it's been a tough day.

659
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:49,438
You're right. We already
did move things around.

660
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,415
Or rather, I already moved
things around... for you.

661
00:30:52,425 --> 00:30:54,436
I know, and I thought that's why
you would be okay with letting...

662
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:57,146
With bending the rules
for your convenience?

663
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,240
The rules that only exist

664
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,989
because you put us and all
of our friends through hell?

665
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:06,799
- No. I'm sorry. I just...
- You know, you chose this.

666
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:09,518
You ruined everything.

667
00:31:09,552 --> 00:31:13,170
And yet you still expect me to
leap to fulfill your needs. But...

668
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,709
(Scoffs) I did that. I
did that this morning.

669
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:19,578
Okay, Arizona, I get it. You're angry.

670
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,630
I wasn't angry.

671
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:23,756
I was gracious.

672
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,301
I was nice and I was accommodating

673

- People have, yeah.
- Like who? Owen?

846
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,699
- All right, don't bring him up.
- You brought up my dead husband.

847
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:33,441
- Yeah, to be nice.
- Well, don't be nice.

848
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:35,069
- Well, don't be mean.
- I'll do whatever I want.

849
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,592
- Yeah? Well, so will I!
- Me too.

<i>You have to see how it feels.</i>

856
00:41:50,363 --> 00:41:51,873
Okay, this could make things a little...
