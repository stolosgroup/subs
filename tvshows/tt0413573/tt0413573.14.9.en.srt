1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:02,541
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy."

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:06,312
"Currently, we control your hospital."

3
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:09,001
They have changed the codes.

4
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:10,104
We are locked out of the blood bank.

5
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,603
This woman needs blood! Who's O-neg?

6
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:15,874
We're airlifting him
to Snohomish Medical Center.

7
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:19,971
Aah! Aah!

8
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:22,757
Don't give him
heparin now! He'll bleed out!

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,601
Hey, Brooke.

10
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:34,567
<i>There are moments in the O.R.</i>

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,008
<i>when everything goes to hell.</i>

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,372
- Oh, God.
- I mean, I'm so happy

13
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,827
- that you're okay.
<i>- And no matter how much</i>

14
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,292
you've seen, how ready you are,
<i>how much help you have,</i>

15
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:43,904
<i>nothing can truly prepare you.</i>

16
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:47,491
Jenny, Jenny. This is Jenny.

17
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:49,404
She is my fiancée.

18
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:54,081
- Hi.
- She has made me a new man.

19
00:00:54,114 --> 00:00:56,722
But hard to plan a wedding when,
legally, you're still married.

20
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,651
So, um, we were so relieved

21
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,180
when my lawyer received your papers.

22
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,281
Thank you.

23
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:08,342
<i>You have to keep going,
or your patient will die.</i>

24
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,920
It's nice to meet you.

25
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,233
You're nothing like I pictured.

26
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,496
I mean, you look so good, Brooke.

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,237
So much better, I mean.

28
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,888
It looks like you finally
got the help you needed.

29
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,561
<i>The trouble is... in these moments,</i>

30
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:24,956
<i>every instinct in your body
tells you to freeze.</i>

31
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,967
Are you... Is he... are you Paul Stadler?

32
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,280
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

33
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:31,907
Wow. I am... I am such a huge fan.

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,573
Your research on minimally invasive

35
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:36,616
surgery procedures
was life-changing for me.

36
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,666
Um, Dr. Arizona Robbins.

37
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,075
- Pleasure, Dr. Robbins.
- Fetal surgeon.

38
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,420
- Yes.
- Wow.

39
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:42,477
Are you fan-girling here?

40
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,425
Your paper on introducing
multi-mode step index fibers

41
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,795
for scopes was revolutionary.

42
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:48,724
Oh, well, she should know it.

43
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:51,063
I mean, she was my student
when I wrote it.

44
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,024
- What?
- Though I'm not sure

45
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:53,369
how much she remembers.

46
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,051
She was quite the partier back then.

47
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,886
Well, I would love
to pick your brain later,

48
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,165
you know, when it's not as crazy.

49
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,833
- Yeah.
- Um, Wilson, I can't believe

50
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:02,396
that you studied under Paul Stadler.

51
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:03,605
Way to keep a secret.

52
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,816
See ya.

53
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:09,925
So... you haven't been talking about me.

54
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:12,032
I guess I should be grateful for that.

55
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:18,193
Is there, uh, someplace
quiet we can talk,

56
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:20,628
sign those papers, catch up?

57
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,639
Wilson?

58
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:25,817
Uh, Karev's looking for you.

59
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,938
Oh, no.

60
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:29,949
Oh, we can talk later. I'll find you.

61
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,548
Uh, aren't you Paul Stadler?

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,861
I am.

63
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:46,830
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

64
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:49,233
Right angle.

65
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,681
How are you holding up?

66
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,916
Well, if you you estimate
2 units every 10 minutes,

67
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,414
that gives us about
an hour till I'm empty.

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,137
Of course, I'd be super-dead by then.

69
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,771
Don't worry. We won't let that happen.

70
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:03,340
Just keep telling me how you feel.

71
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,294
Honestly, right now, I'm hot as hell.

72
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:07,212
Is that just me?

73
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:10,035
No. It's not just you.

74
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:15,833
Why is it so hot in here?

75
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:18,780
Uh, can you ask facilities
to crank the A.C.?

76
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:20,477
Oh, no. We can't.

77
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:23,425
They have run the thermostats up to 90.

78
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:26,435
They... <i>They</i> can hack
into the thermostats?

79
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,909
Yeah. Easily.

80
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,574
W-Why? Why would they do that?

81
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:33,034
Well, like the cardiac monitors
and turning the power

82
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:33,803
on and off, they just want to show you

83
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:36,141
that they have control, so they

84
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,967
turned up the heat, literally.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,561
That is just dumb.

86
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,708
Such an obvious pun.

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,064
Oh.

88
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:48,666
Look, Jackson, I don't
know where the hell you are,

89
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:50,492
but pick up your damn phone.

90
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:55,424
Markham... M-A-R-K-H...

91
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:58,948
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

92
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,101
Did you stab him?

93
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:00,998
There was an accident.

94
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:01,703
Did the helicopter crash?

95
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:02,728
No. There was some turbulence,

96
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:04,873
and the tube that was
pumping his blood came loose.

97
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,050
But we're gonna take care of him.

98
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,138
It looks like <i>all</i> of his blood.

99
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,926
Is that all of his blood?

100
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:10,951
We will get him more blood.

101
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,937
We've got this now, okay?

102
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,443
Okay.

103
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:19,727
- Ow!
- His left arm is tingling,

104
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,457
and he's seeing stars.
His head is killing him.

105
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:23,283
- When did it start?
- 5 to 10 minutes.

106
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:24,956
It seems to be getting worse.

107
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,256
The Heparin should have helped by now.

108
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,248
I think I made the wrong call.

109
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,850
Wait. Heparin? No. I texted.

110
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,131
They didn't reverse him. Oh, my God.

111
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:33,309
Damn it. We can't access
the reversal agent.

112
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:34,590
Prep him to move.

113
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,160
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Frankie's AVM

114
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:36,993
might be bleeding.

115
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,082
We've got to get him to the O.R. now.

116
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,004
But the medicine you gave him...
it was supposed to help.

117
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,702
I'm sorry. We need to go.

118
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:44,520
Hey. I'm so sorry. I texted.
It didn't go through.

119
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,186
- And then...
- And then what?

120
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,358
Nothing. It can wait. Just help him.

121
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:54,290
We're back to paper charts
and trying to chase

122
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:55,187
our own tails.

123
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:56,757
I was at Alexandria when they got hacked.

124
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,447
- It was a nightmare, I can tell you.
- Yeah.

125
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,651
Okay, temperature
will drop soon... or not.

126
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:04,861
I mean, we could
all get dizzy and dehydrated

127
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:07,007
and succumb to heatstroke,
damage our brains, kidneys,

128
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,890
other internal organs.
We could all die today.

129
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:11,908
Uh, would you excuse me
for a second, please?

130
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,374
- Yeah.
- Uh, Dr. Bello?

131
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:16,392
Could I have a moment, please?

132
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,346
Please?

133
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,301
Yeah.

134
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,959
Um... do you hear yourself?

135
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:25,073
I'm sorry, sir.
I haven't slept in three days.

136
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,931
When I'm not here,
I'm thinking about being here.

137
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:27,956
And then the minute I do fall asleep,

138
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,750
I dreamed I've cut open
the wrong person's chest,

139
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,576
- and I wake up screaming.
- Uh, DeLuca?

140
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,765
She is making my blood pressure go up.

141
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,847
Can you take her somewhere,
away from the patients,

142
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,647
until she calms down?

143
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,281
Sir, I-I don't really...

144
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:42,787
Oh, drop it, DeLuca.

145
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,325
We all heard the two of you
through the walls.

146
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,861
Now step up.

147
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:51,916
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,870
Um, yeah, I was saying that...

149
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,023
Can I help?

150
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:57,586
I know how bad this can be,
so if I can lend an extra hand,

151
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:59,050
I'd be happy to.

152
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,067
Yeah, the minute you get to Seattle Pres,

153
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,989
check everything off
the paper charts, okay?

154
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:09,978
Okay.

155
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:16,645
Larry Keys, post-tracheostomy
two months ago

156
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,598
and now has worsening
blood-tinged secretions.

157
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:20,841
Uh, pulse ox... 98.
Needs a chest x-ray, okay?

158
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,407
Hang in there, Mr. Keys.

159
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,204
Oh, God.

160
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,934
Yeah, it takes you back to Jordan, right?

161
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,568
Yeah, only hotter.

162
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,329
Uh, Chief? We already transferred

163
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:30,259
six patients, but we have eight

164
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,340
ICU patients who are
stable enough to move.

165
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,038
And the blood banks are still locked,

166
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:35,351
so we're waiting on emergency shipments

167
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:36,280
from other area hospitals.

168
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,195
Good, great. You are
handling your situation.

169
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,597
Avery and I are...
handling our situation.

170
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,423
He called you from the medevac chopper?

171
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:45,474
Avery's on a medevac chopper?

172
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:48,709
I can't tell you how much I want to

173
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,950
stick my head under a faucet right now.

174
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,713
I'd just settle for
a fresh pair of scrubs.

175
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,602
- You don't have hair.
- True.

176
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:58,702
Oh, Claude, I think
that some of your blood

177
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,785
just soaked through to my underwear.

178
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,258
So we are in this together now.

179
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,924
Yeah, well, I got some in my mouth.

180
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,814
We're not gonna think
about that, all right?

181
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,063
And we're not gonna
think about the fact that

182
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,312
his blood and our sweat

183
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,106
are creating their own little ecosystem.

184
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,733
Ugh. Yeah, no, I'm not gonna
think about that at all.

185
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,833
Mnh-mnh.

186
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,562
Clips, please.

187
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,278
Front-row seats to the surgical Olympics.

188
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,168
Schmitt, quiet.

189
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,705
Another one.

190
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:27,889
Thanks for calling me Schmitt.

191
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:31,696
Because, sometimes,
you call me "Glasses."

192
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:36,501
I wish we could change it to "Specs."

193
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,935
Specs sounds way cooler than Glasses.

194
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:41,401
Or look at me now. What about Blood Bank?

195
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,131
Blood Bank is awesome!

196
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,149
Blood Bank needs to pipe down!
Sponge stick.

197
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,135
Oh, Blood Bank needs somewhere to barf.

198
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,256
Somebody get him a basin.

199
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,178
The blood loss is making him nauseous.

200
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:52,036
Oh, no. They're so busy. I got it. Whoa.

201
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:53,583
Hey, Schmitt, sit down.

202
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:54,631
Whoa.

203
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:55,976
Oh, where's that basin?

204
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,898
Schmitt... Ugh.

205
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:00,108
Damn it.

206
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,946
Bokhee, give me a sterile towel

207
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,549
over the area he contaminated.

208
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,636
And someone get him a liter of saline.

209
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,563
Would it be wrong of me to
take out his spleen, too?

210
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:16,716
No, tell Maintenance,
if they can't get into

211
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:18,463
the blood bank doors, to call the police

212
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:20,056
for some sort of battering ram.

213
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,089
They're still locked?

214
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,170
Did they even try to override
the security system?

215
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:25,355
Your background is cybersecurity.

216
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,268
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, if you have any ideas,

217
00:08:27,302 --> 00:08:28,297
- they're welcome.
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:29,928
- On it.
<i>- Dr. Cullen, NICU.</i>

219
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,073
<i>Dr. Cullen, NICU.</i>

220
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:33,899
Should I just stay down here
and see where I can jump in?

221
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:35,547
That'd be a godsend. Anything.

222
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:36,562
- You got it.
- Thanks.

223
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:39,661
Dr. Webber. Dr. Grey needs
an assistant in O.R.-3.

224
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:40,586
She lost hers.

225
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:41,807
What do you mean she lost hers?

226
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,024
Her intern passed out.

227
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,715
Was it Glasses?

228
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:47,810
I.J. looks good.

229
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:50,469
ECMO access re-established.

230
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:51,991
I hope wed didn't
traumatize his daughter.

231
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:53,360
Oh, we absolutely did.

232
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:55,154
We look like we stepped off
the set of "Carrie."

233
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:57,043
Being doused in blood

234
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:58,548
was about the only thing from that movie

235
00:08:58,582 --> 00:08:59,734
that didn't happen to me in high school.

236
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,720
Really? Oh, I was brainy and awkward

237
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:03,899
and four years younger
than everyone else.

238
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,300
But who didn't have
a rough time in high school?

239
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:13,089
Of course. The human superlative.

240
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,850
Varsity basketball?

241
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,004
Class president? Prom king?

242
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:20,191
Varsity baseball, I'll have you
know, but the rest is true.

243
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:22,106
Well, I was freshman age as a senior,

244
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,630
so I couldn't have been
prom queen even if I had gone.

245
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:28,321
What? Are freshmen
not supposed to be prom king?

246
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:29,762
You've got to be kidding me.

247
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,499
No, you don't have to follow me.

248
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:37,652
It was literally my instructions
from Dr. Webber.

249
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,086
Well, you're not a person
who can calm me down, so leave.

250
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,208
I'm not happy about this either.

251
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,937
Yeah? You're not hoping
that I drag you into a closet

252
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,250
and wrap myself around you?

253
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,226
I mean, if it'll help.

254
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,133
It won't help. It's the problem.

255
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,991
I defibrillated a sleeping person.

256
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:50,624
I told another one
that the world was gonna end.

257
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,762
And no one knows this, but the other day,

258
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:53,806
I didn't know where to empty a bedpan,

259
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,316
so I just set it on a cart in a hallway.

260
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:57,590
These are not the things that
a brilliant intern does.

261
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,904
I was top of my class.

262
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,473
Okay, but how is any of this my fault?

263
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:02,043
Because I haven't slept

264
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,644
because you penetrate me every 5 minutes.

265
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:04,734
Shh.

266
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,304
Look, don't put this on me, okay?

267
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,482
Every time I look at you, you...
you sex-pout at me.

268
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:10,758
That's just my face.

269
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:14,128
And... and this is about
my mind, so no more sex.

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,299
That's it. I am not gonna
fail here because of you.

271
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:22,296
Don't talk to any patients until
you get some rest, all right?

272
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:38,088
What are you doing here?

273
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,467
Hi.

274
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,780
Paul Stadler, Orlando Medical.

275
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:43,710
Yeah, I know who you are.

276
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,072
I'm sorry. Have we met before?

277
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:48,673
You know, your face
looks kind of familiar.

278
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:54,042
Dr. Karev, Dr. Shepherd said
Frankie's angio shows a bleed.

279
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:55,803
Yikes.

280
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,724
Don't let me keep you.

281
00:10:58,495 --> 00:10:59,391
Intern, what's your name?

282
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:01,313
Helm. Like "Hellmouth"
without the "outh."

283
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:03,074
- Don't scrub.
- I need you to find Dr. Wilson

284
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:04,228
and bring her here.

285
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,416
- You want me to call her?
- No.

286
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,239
I want you to find her
and bring her here.

287
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:08,786
- And don't leave her side.
- Why?

288
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,528
Just do it.

289
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,367
What's going on?

290
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:47,488
Heat getting to you?

291
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,339
Yeah.

292
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:52,884
How is it I never knew you
studied under Paul Stadler?

293
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,836
Uh, it's a... long story.

294
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,252
Well, he couldn't have picked
a better time to come and visit.

295
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,718
He's pitching in in the O.R.

296
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:01,840
What?!

297
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:03,537
No. He can't.

298
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,523
He's a world-class surgeon,
and we're in a bit

299
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:06,593
of a quagmire. Why not?

300
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:08,117
Whatever he said to you, it isn't true.

301
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,784
You can't trust him. He lies.

302
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,602
He lies about everything.

303
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,718
Lap pads.

304
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:19,864
Dr. Grey? Heard you could use some help.

305
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,594
How are you? And please
tell me you have blood.

306
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:23,548
No. Sorry. But I do have 20 years

307
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,830
experience as a general surgeon.

308
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:25,951
Then get in here.

309
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,345
Whoa, she's losing everywhere.

310
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:31,267
Yeah, she burned through
all her clotting factors,

311
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:33,158
and I couldn't get any FFP
from the blood bank.

312
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,400
Let's get started. 3-0 silk for Dr. Grey.

313
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:38,219
Okay. There. I'm getting control.

314
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,260
Another tie.

315
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,429
Right there.

316
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,430
Good.

317
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,256
Scissor.

318
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:49,215
Whew!

319
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:50,426
Thanks for the assist.

320
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,123
- I almost lost her.
- I try.

321
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:53,364
I'm Meredith Grey.

322
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,687
What did you say your name was?

323
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:56,033
Paul Stadler.

324
00:12:58,468 --> 00:12:59,492
Paul Stadler?

325
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,055
Honor to meet you, Dr. Grey.

326
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,494
All right, we need to do
a distal pancreatectomy.

327
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,696
Do you prefer harmonic stapler
or oversewn closure?

328
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,079
Well, oversew doesn't
require electricity, so...

329
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:15,193
3-0 silk, please.

330
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,739
I can ligate this one. I'm right here.

331
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:21,385
Well, I guess we should talk
about the elephant in the room.

332
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,497
Congrats on your Harper Avery.

333
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:28,666
Kelly clamp.

334
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,212
I didn't even make it past
the submission round.

335
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,389
I study fiber-optics for
minimally invasive surgeries.

336
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,248
I know who you are.

337
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,137
I'm friends with Jo Wilson.

338
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,393
Clamp.

339
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:50,629
Get an eye on the EEG,
tell me if there's any slowing.

340
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,590
Got it.

341
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:53,942
I'll prep the shunt,
and then we can embolize.

342
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,631
What the hell is taking Helm so long?

343
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,317
Hi. I'm here to replace Helm.

344
00:13:58,351 --> 00:13:59,567
No, you're not. You're here to find her.

345
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,041
Turn around and go.

346
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,290
Y-you want me to find Dr. Helm?

347
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:05,556
Yes! And Dr. Wilson and bring them here.

348
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,966
Stat!

349
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,387
Is there any point
to this intern treasure hunt,

350
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:12,956
or is it just for fun?

351
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,473
We ligated the blood vessel in his neck.

352
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:18,882
He's back on ECMO, and he's stable.

353
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,485
You will be able to see him as soon as

354
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:21,605
he's settled in the ICU.

355
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,648
Thank you so much.

356
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,539
Oh, I really want to hug you, but...

357
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:28,460
- No, no. Please.
- Totally understand.

358
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,632
- Thank you.
- Okay.

359
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,215
Sorry about your blouse.

360
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:32,619
Is it bad that I'm the same amount happy

361
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,450
that he's alive as I am
that we can shower now?

362
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:38,134
Is it bad that I'm happier
about the shower?

363
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:42,234
Clip.

364
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,797
So, Jo Wilson.

365
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,203
Has she said some things about me?

366
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:49,762
I can only imagine.

367
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:51,620
Was she drunk when she told you?

368
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,406
Suction and laps, please.

369
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:58,140
I think what Brooke craved
from me was stability.

370
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:00,052
I mean, the way she was raised.

371
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,734
Her mother abandoned her.

372
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,704
She lived in her car in high school.

373
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,701
And I thought I could
help her... save her.

374
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:12,063
And for a few years, I mean,
she was... she was great.

375
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,219
But it didn't last
because she's not stable,

376
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:16,869
and she wasn't able to hear that... ever.

377
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:18,735
She would get...

378
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,490
just awful if you tried to
mention that she needed help.

379
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,659
I wish...

380
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:32,660
But she vanished...
with a lot of my money.

381
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:35,575
Hey, I mean, if she's got it figured out,

382
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,593
then that's all that matters.

383
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:40,732
If she's happy, I'm happy, too.

384
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:41,789
Clamp.

385
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:56,524
- Finally.
- Shh.

386
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:57,549
What do you want?

387
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,638
I...

388
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:02,194
Dr. Karev said I had to find you
and bring you to him.

389
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:04,002
And I'm not allowed to leave you alone.

390
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:17,152
Shunt's in.

391
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,818
Nice work, Karev.

392
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,090
Somebody read that.

393
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,071
It's from Dr. Wilson.

394
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:26,634
"I'm safe, in Grey's gallery.
Helm is with me.

395
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,069
Can't come right now but will soon."

396
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,364
Hey.

397
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:40,421
Hey.

398
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,822
Um, I thought you would
want to know that Ms. Knox

399
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:45,290
is doing fine,
and she's hopelessly in love

400
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:46,344
with her baby daughter.

401
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:48,173
Oh, yes, I did. I wanted to know that.

402
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,863
Find anyone promising?

403
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,778
Huh? Oh. Um, no, no.

404
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:54,918
I was just... I was killing time

405
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:56,501
while I'm in line to give blood.

406
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,614
Look at this hospital.

407
00:16:57,647 --> 00:16:59,832
All this chaos because of the Internet,

408
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,850
and you trust it with your heart?

409
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,035
Well, it saves a lot of time.

410
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,445
It wastes time.

411
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,239
All the slapping the screen for hours.

412
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,416
And... and how do you know
if you have a connection

413
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,136
if you can't look in that woman's eyes?

414
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,823
Online is like dating one of those, um,

415
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:15,328
window dolls with no faces.

416
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:17,954
Mannequins.

417
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,043
Yeah.

418
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:21,766
A photo might be sexy,
but until you're face-to-face

419
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:26,443
to talk, listen, share your passions...

420
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:28,044
only then do you know

421
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:29,678
if there is electricity, you know?

422
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:30,960
Clear!

423
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,748
We have blood.

424
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:42,619
Jo's ex is here.

425
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:44,573
I know. I just operated with him.

426
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,975
- What? He's a psychopath.
- Yeah.

427
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:49,216
He had a lot to say about her.

428
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:50,268
Like what?

429
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,396
It's not true.

430
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,323
It's not true.

431
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,116
He takes the truth,
but he... he twists it

432
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,390
and changes it to fit his own story.

433
00:17:57,424 --> 00:18:00,017
It's not... it's not true.

434
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:06,765
You are Jo Wilson.
I know exactly who you are.

435
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:14,068
It's okay.

436
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,734
It's okay.

437
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:21,762
Okay, loaded up the last rig.

438
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,249
I think we're good for now.

439
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,951
No. We're forgetting something.

440
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,731
We're not forgetting anything, Kepner.

441
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,358
It's like a sandstorm.

442
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:31,793
We got slammed,
it was blinding, and then,

443
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,489
when the dust settles,
you can't switch your brain

444
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:34,484
back to normal.

445
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:35,637
You can't shake the feeling like

446
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,854
something slipped through the cracks.

447
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:39,001
Wrong. Stop! Stop!

448
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:43,581
"Larry Keys, status post..."

449
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:45,119
I can't read the rest of this.

450
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:46,201
- It's your handwriting.
- No, I know.

451
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:50,722
It's all smudged.
Uh, "Chest x-ray, 14:09."

452
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,198
That was two hours ago.

453
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:58,060
Oh, found him, found him, found him!

454
00:18:58,092 --> 00:18:59,821
Okay.

455
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,519
Okay, gross bleeding through his trach.

456
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:02,801
- All right.
- Let's get him up to the O.R.

457
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:03,890
and control this bleeding.

458
00:19:03,924 --> 00:19:05,748
He's losing his airway.
He's not gonna make it that far.

459
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:07,702
- Let's get a crash cart.
- All right.

460
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:08,855
Okay, hang tight, Mr. Keys.

461
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:11,194
I need to remove your trach
and put in a breathing tube.

462
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,276
I'm gonna need an 8-0 ET tube.

463
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,721
I'm not gonna be able to see.
There's too much blood.

464
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:19,810
We got to control the bleeding.

465
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:21,892
Here. I can compress the vessel
right through the trach.

466
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,208
What's wrong?

467
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:26,505
- I still can't see.
- Okay. Hang on, hang on.

468
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:28,484
All right. Look for the light.

469
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:30,573
- You see it?
- I see it. Yeah, okay.

470
00:19:30,606 --> 00:19:31,691
- I got it.
- Yep, yep. Okay.

471
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,104
Okay.

472
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,249
- All right.
- All right.

473
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:38,228
Okay. All right.

474
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,571
Sandstorm.

475
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,465
I think we can call them off.

476
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,093
Helm hasn't let me out of her sight.

477
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,695
She was just following instructions.

478
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,584
She followed me into the bathroom.

479
00:19:57,618 --> 00:19:59,954
The actual stall.

480
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:01,845
Hey. You guys can leave.

481
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:03,019
Thank you.

482
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,507
Look, I would have come myself,
but I was stuck in surgery.

483
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,397
- How's Frankie?
- He's okay.

484
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,440
We were able to stop the
bleeding from his AVM in time.

485
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,202
How do you want to handle this?

486
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:19,046
I want to be divorced.

487
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,737
I want to never see his face ever again.

488
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:22,716
I'm coming with you for that.

489
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,292
No, you are not going anywhere near him.

490
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,830
I should have killed him
when I had the chance.

491
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:29,264
Which is exactly why.

492
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,022
Alex, we've got this.

493
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,713
She is not going to be alone with him.

494
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:45,019
Parker?

495
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:48,415
I was told you used a defibrillator

496
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,016
to fry the keypad on the blood bank.

497
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,746
- People needed blood...
- Hey, I don't want excuses.

498
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,053
I want to know what else you can do.

499
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,829
Um, what's happening?

500
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,783
Did you know that
cellphones have 10 times

501
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:11,602
more bacteria than an average
public toilet seat?

502
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:13,236
- Cool story.
- Where are the scrubs, Maggie?

503
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:16,727
Oh, we don't have the code
for their machine, so...

504
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:22,466
So, I called down, and somebody
should be up any minute.

505
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,875
All right, we got to
get back to the hospital.

506
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:24,708
I mean, I don't have my phone.

507
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,701
I don't know what the hell's happening.

508
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:27,463
Well, if you want to
walk around this hospital

509
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,609
in your towel, you can be my guest.

510
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:31,339
So, what? We wait?

511
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,734
We wait.

512
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,083
You have the divorce papers?

513
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:50,911
Uh, if you wouldn't mind, Dr. Grey,

514
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,159
I'd like to have a moment alone with...

515
00:21:52,193 --> 00:21:54,690
Actually, I do mind. I'm gonna stay here.

516
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:57,606
Okay then.

517
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,513
Let's get this done, shall we?

518
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:30,484
We've got it. It's faster this way.

519
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,555
I'm really happy for you, Jo.

520
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:40,925
I hope this brings you...

521
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,559
some real peace.

522
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:44,000
You deserve it.

523
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,238
We both do.

524
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:49,313
You don't deserve anything good.

525
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:54,599
You're a monster.

526
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,041
You did great, and it's over.

527
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:12,633
No. No, it's not. I need Robbins.

528
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,587
Where's Robbins?

529
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:18,097
I'm sure the feds are focusing
on common attack vectors

530
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,603
because that's protocol.

531
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:21,781
But if it were me, I'd do
offline forensic analysis

532
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:22,742
on our servers.

533
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:24,183
Fantastic. Yes.

534
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:26,201
Uh, now go tell them that.

535
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,294
Uh, what's the problem?

536
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,305
Let's just say that, hypothetically,

537
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:37,660
I was convicted
of hacking a federal server,

538
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:40,520
as part of my hypothetical sentence,

539
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,553
I'm not allowed to manipulate computers

540
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,073
in that manner ever again...

541
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:48,244
or advise or enable anyone else to.

542
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:51,362
I would say, hypothetically,
that wasn't on your application.

543
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,470
Fair. But records like that are sealed.

544
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:55,815
Hypothetically.

545
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:59,531
Did any of these
hypothetical crimes involve

546
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:03,022
literal children or sex or drugs

547
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:03,919
or children and sex and drugs?

548
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:04,816
They did not.

549
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,898
Or robbing old people of their last $2?

550
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:08,514
Also no.

551
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:11,210
- Or...
- Chief, do you want me to help you?

552
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,476
I do.

553
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:14,586
Hmm.

554
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,981
Write down what you want me
to tell the FBI.

555
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:23,363
Nigerian prince?

556
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:24,964
DMV.

557
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,330
My new license was taking too long.

558
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:30,437
And now you're an accessory
to whatever I do moving forward.

559
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,295
I did not want to know that.

560
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:33,789
I think you did.

561
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:38,541
What happened in there, babe?

562
00:24:38,574 --> 00:24:40,047
Let's just get the hell out of here.

563
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,161
Hey. Dr. Stadler, where are you going?

564
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:42,994
Actually, we're on our way out.

565
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:44,947
Oh, no. No, you can't. You can't leave.

566
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:46,517
I have a problem with a new fetoscope,

567
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,580
and it's got me banging
my head against the wall.

568
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:50,998
And I know that there's an answer,

569
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,944
but I-I'm just...
It's way out of my reach.

570
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:56,026
It would be great if I could
just get some manpower,

571
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,357
you know, which... I need you.

572
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,055
10 minutes.

573
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,533
Fantastic. This way.

574
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,028
Wait here.

575
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,866
Hi.

576
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:11,778
We need to talk and we don't
have enough time.

577
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:15,666
Anything you have to say to me

578
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:17,350
you can say in front of Paul.
I don't need help.

579
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,994
I said the same thing when
I was with him, but I was lying.

580
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:21,085
I was lying to myself.

581
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:22,685
I was lying to everyone around me.

582
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:24,706
Oh, my God. He told me you were crazy,

583
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,915
and I thought
that's just something people say

584
00:25:25,948 --> 00:25:27,100
about their exes.

585
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,766
In your case, he was clearly right.

586
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,803
You know, Jenny,

587
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:31,937
it's okay if you don't
want to talk to me.

588
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,026
You don't have to say a word.

589
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,850
Just please listen.

590
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,863
There was a dinner party
with his colleagues.

591
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,266
I talked too much to the man
sitting next to me.

592
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:41,579
Paul said that I made a fool out of him.

593
00:25:41,612 --> 00:25:44,110
I laughed because it seemed so...

594
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,775
I laughed.

595
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:48,345
And his eyes went dark,
and that's the last thing

596
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,556
that I remember before
waking up the next morning

597
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,158
with my eye swollen shut.

598
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,079
I thought it would be the only time.

599
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:55,874
I'm sure that you did
the first time, too.

600
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:58,019
But he just got smarter after that.

601
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:00,037
He made sure that no one
could see the bruises.

602
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:02,696
He would apologize
and then tell me it was my fault

603
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,882
all in one breath,
and he was so persuasive.

604
00:26:07,213 --> 00:26:08,942
He told me I was wrong so many times

605
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,736
that I believed I was wrong.

606
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,204
He told me I was crazy so many times

607
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,664
that I believed that
I actually was crazy.

608
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:18,840
The last time,
I woke up to him kicking me

609
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:20,730
in the back because he'd read my e-mail

610
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:22,940
and saw the name of a man
that he didn't recognize.

611
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:25,342
He kicked me so hard, he broke my ribs

612
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,232
and almost ruptured my kidney.

613
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,987
So, you're saying that,
with your technique,

614
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,948
I can repair a spina bifida

615
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:34,663
or cleft palate
or I mean, anything, right?

616
00:26:34,697 --> 00:26:36,425
I mean, that's incredible, Dr. Stadler.

617
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:37,579
It's just...

618
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:40,109
That's incredible.

619
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,543
So you've said several times.

620
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:44,941
Well, you know, I do have
another question, which is...

621
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:46,836
Dr. Robbins, it's been a pleasure,

622
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:49,175
and I'd be happy to consult
with you on any future cases,

623
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,224
but my fiancée has been way more patient

624
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:52,636
than I'd be at this point.

625
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,311
I... Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you so much for your time.

626
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:02,604
If I hadn't have escaped that night...

627
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:04,550
He's coming back.

628
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,304
Say the word, and I will help you.

629
00:27:07,337 --> 00:27:08,874
I will get you out of this right now.

630
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:10,091
You really should go.

631
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:11,917
You shouldn't be here when he comes back.

632
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:22,708
You know what?

633
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,670
This is my cellphone number.

634
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:28,867
You call me day or night,
and I will get you out of this.

635
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:48,953
How about we get out of here?

636
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:50,361
Please.

637
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:07,330
And you've combed through
the admin server logs

638
00:28:07,363 --> 00:28:11,782
for any suspicious activity
on TCP ports 21 through 23?

639
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,352
Of course.

640
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:15,081
But reading them all will
take days at least.

641
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:16,428
Oh.

642
00:28:19,182 --> 00:28:21,071
And what about scanning the log dumps,

643
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:25,107
uh, specifically for
unwanted guest Wi-Fi traffic?

644
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:26,791
You've been doing your homework.

645
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:28,073
Yeah, I know how to Google.

646
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,387
Well, we've done that, as well.

647
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:31,084
That's how we found their I.P. address.

648
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:33,102
Great!

649
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,182
You found the I.P. address.

650
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,168
That means that you can hack them back,

651
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:54,047
uh, ping them, storm the computer castle.

652
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:56,442
No. We still need to
physically locate them.

653
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,139
What you're suggesting would alert them,

654
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:59,132
and they'd pull up stakes.

655
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,445
We'd never catch them.

656
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,952
Um, hold on.

657
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:05,026
Are we trying to save
my patients or make arrests?

658
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:12,041
Have a seat here.

659
00:29:12,074 --> 00:29:14,668
This is my laptop.

660
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:17,583
And this is my password.

661
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:20,338
No one will ever know you touched it.

662
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:25,608
How many times do you think that we were

663
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:28,844
in the same place in Boston
and didn't even know it?

664
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:30,446
Hmm.

665
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,816
The aquarium or Fenway Park?

666
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,353
Uh...

667
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,204
The Ugly Duckling?

668
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:37,837
The Swan Boats?

669
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,183
- Uh...
- No?

670
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:40,496
N-no.

671
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,449
Um... I was in Mallorca a lot.

672
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:43,731
Would you ever...

673
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:45,685
- No? That's...
- Wow. Uh...

674
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,127
All right.

675
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,816
Why would... why did
you become a surgeon?

676
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,476
I mean, what we do is really hard.

677
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:54,860
Where did you learn to work?

678
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:58,280
I guess, for a long time, I didn't.

679
00:29:58,818 --> 00:30:00,708
I think, uh, I spent
a lot of my childhood

680
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,438
avoiding the inevitable, you know?

681
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,982
Pretending that I had a say in my future,

682
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,889
with my mom being
who she is and my grandfather.

683
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:10,500
I...

684
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,586
Yeah.

685
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,796
Wow.

686
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:17,174
Thank you.

687
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,140
For what?

688
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,105
That's the first time
all day I've felt good

689
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:22,321
about my childhood.

690
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,325
Yeah, well, I said thank God

691
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,639
we are from different families.

692
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:29,478
Oh, is that what you meant by that?

693
00:30:30,074 --> 00:30:31,707
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

694
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,308
I mean, that and, um...

695
00:30:33,342 --> 00:30:35,025
And what?

696
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:39,555
Uh, you know, just that's
good... It's a good thing.

697
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,778
It doesn't define us.

698
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:44,576
We're not actually related, so...

699
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:49,665
we can be whatever
we want to be, I guess.

700
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,021
Hey. There he is.

701
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,238
Oh.

702
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:56,385
Oh. Here, your phone.

703
00:30:56,418 --> 00:30:58,382
They got it from the medevac.

704
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,923
Oh, crap.

705
00:31:01,956 --> 00:31:02,863
What happened?

706
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,446
27 missed calls from Bailey.

707
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:08,490
You don't have to stay with me.

708
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:09,418
I'm okay.

709
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:10,727
I know.

710
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:19,403
Hey.

711
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,103
Really happy you and Jenny
had the chance to talk.

712
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:24,505
She told me all about it.

713
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,271
She didn't say anything.

714
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,391
It was me. It was all me.

715
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,049
Yeah, it was always you.

716
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:35,491
Okay, walk away, Dr. Stadler.

717
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:36,795
No, no. She is a liar.

718
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:37,861
She is pathological.

719
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:39,654
I mean, w-what kind of woman
changes her name

720
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:41,768
and disappears on her husband
without a word?

721
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:44,876
Do you know what that did to me?

722
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,990
What that did to my reputation,
to my career?

723
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:50,239
You are... torture.

724
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:51,705
You are hell.

725
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:53,339
You walk around and you ruin lives,

726
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:54,555
and no one ever stops you.

727
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:55,805
They... they just believe you.

728
00:31:55,837 --> 00:31:58,527
'Cause why? 'Cause you're pretty?

729
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,065
'Cause you're sweet?

730
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:02,884
Your looks will fade one day, Brooke.

731
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:05,959
Your looks will fade, and you'll
be left with the truth.

732
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,810
And you point fingers at
everyone else around you,

733
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,732
but <i>you're</i> the monster.

734
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,667
Security to the residents's
lounge on 3, stat.

735
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,250
You know what?

736
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:18,311
Jenny won't be needing this,

737
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:21,579
seeing as how we're actually happy.

738
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,789
That said...

739
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:26,480
I think I'll hang on to it.

740
00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:30,099
So I know where to find you.

741
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,255
It's okay.

742
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,144
The phones are working?

743
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:49,659
No, but he doesn't know that.

744
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:58,276
Again? Oh, come on!

745
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,982
- No, that was me.
- Why?

746
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:01,543
I had to make sure I could.

747
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:02,792
And I could.

748
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:04,346
It worked.

749
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:05,283
Are you sure?

750
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,754
On!

751
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:23,700
On. Oh, oh. Is that what I think it is?

752
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:26,424
If what you think it is is
air-conditioning, then yes.

753
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:27,608
Yay!

754
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,855
Okay, now, did you
really hack into the DMV?

755
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,969
Why would you do that?

756
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:39,428
Because my old license
referred to me as female,

757
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:41,702
and the DMV where
I was living wouldn't change it,

758
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:43,144
so I did.

759
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:49,612
I'm a proud trans man, Dr. Bailey,

760
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:51,336
but I like for people to
get to know me before

761
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:54,475
they find out my private medical history.

762
00:33:54,508 --> 00:33:56,589
Of course.

763
00:33:59,377 --> 00:34:02,232
Thank you for your service, Dr. Parker.

764
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:17,410
I heard you wanted to talk to me?

765
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:18,941
Yes, I do.

766
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:25,667
Hey, I'm not sure if I should
have a lawyer present,

767
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,093
but I, uh, wanted
to tell you how sorry I am.

768
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:32,874
It was just so hot,

769
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:35,757
and I really didn't
want to throw up in you.

770
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,476
Why the hell would you apologize?

771
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:41,730
You're a damn hero.

772
00:34:42,773 --> 00:34:43,991
I am?

773
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:48,026
You saved my life.

774
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:49,284
Of course, no one would know,

775
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:51,869
to see you creeping in here
like a sick mouse.

776
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:53,068
Stand up straight.

777
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:01,412
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

778
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:02,854
Thirsty.

779
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:05,192
- That's good, right?
- It is very good.

780
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:07,594
He came through with flying colors.

781
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,581
Because he's a fighter.

782
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:12,175
Dr. Alex, I know I didn't die,

783
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,777
but will you still marry my mom?

784
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:17,460
Frankie! He's still loopy from surgery.

785
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:19,510
Yeah, well, we see that all the time.

786
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:21,935
We'll keep a close eye on him tonight.

787
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:36,899
What's wrong?

788
00:35:36,932 --> 00:35:37,860
He came back.

789
00:35:37,893 --> 00:35:40,577
He's gone now, but I did
have to call security.

790
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:41,690
That son of a bitch.

791
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,940
He knows where to find me.

792
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:43,901
He knows where to find us.

793
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,085
You're safe, you hear me?

794
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:46,206
- You're not gonna be alone.
- What?

795
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:46,975
So that's just my life now?

796
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:48,705
I have to be guarded every second?

797
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:51,268
No. Because we will get
a restraining order,

798
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,446
and he will never set foot
in this hospital again.

799
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,111
God.

800
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:56,905
I wish he was dead.

801
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:01,719
Come on. Let's go home.

802
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,012
DeLuca.

803
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:09,934
Are you interested in helping me
out with this big contest?

804
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,271
I need a new Edwards,
and you've got potential.

805
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:14,789
Yeah. Really? Yes. Yes.

806
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:15,850
All right.

807
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,130
Oh, and, um, one of our new interns

808
00:36:18,164 --> 00:36:20,950
wrote a paper on pupillary
response in comatose patients.

809
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:22,583
They were in med school,
it was a little raw,

810
00:36:22,616 --> 00:36:24,056
- but I was impressed.
- Could you find them and then...

811
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:25,370
It was me!

812
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:27,932
S-sorry. Sam Bello. It was me.

813
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,182
Oh.

814
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,631
Hello, Dr. Sam Bello.

815
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:34,134
Welcome aboard Team Shepherd.

816
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,303
She read my paper.

817
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:39,736
Yeah. Congrats.

818
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:44,028
All is right with the world.

819
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,558
What's going on here?
Why does everything look normal?

820
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:48,320
- It is normal.
- You paid the ransom?

821
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:50,690
I didn't have to, and I'm not at liberty

822
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:53,156
to discuss why, so let's
just leave it at...

823
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,047
You're welcome. Those aren't our colors.

824
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,614
Go change.

825
00:36:57,802 --> 00:37:00,908
<i>Nurse Laskey to pharmacology.</i>

826
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:06,207
Kepner.

827
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,724
Did I hear that you plugged a man's

828
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:12,023
tracheo-innominate fistula
with your finger?

829
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:15,424
Well, we didn't have
much of a choice, so...

830
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:17,546
I've got to tell you...
the dam could have broken today,

831
00:37:17,578 --> 00:37:20,268
but thanks to work like that, it didn't.

832
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:21,998
Wow. Thank you, Dr. Webber.

833
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:29,205
Everything okay?

834
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:33,401
Uh, Bailey wants me
to oversee her big contest.

835
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:36,847
And... and I am flattered, honestly.

836
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,082
But, uh, at this age, I'm...
I'm not sure I can handle it.

837
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:45,734
I guess I'm just feeling
my seasons, you know?

838
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,892
Um, you... you know,
if you need some help, I...

839
00:37:49,925 --> 00:37:51,429
Oh, well, it's not a matter of help.

840
00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:53,671
I mean, someone needs to do everything.

841
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,112
I mean, you name it.

842
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:57,847
They have to handpick
the judges and set deadlines,

843
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:01,888
schedule presentations,
and the whole kit and caboodle.

844
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,228
Wait. Um...

845
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:07,704
I could do it?

846
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:09,306
- Oh, no. No.
- No?

847
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:12,413
- No, no.
- I couldn't possibly ask you.

848
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:14,014
You... you really mean it?

849
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:17,186
Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes, sir. Yeah.

850
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,371
I-I won't let you down, sir.

851
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,357
Well, thank you.

852
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:33,650
This day.

853
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:35,636
Insane, right?

854
00:38:35,669 --> 00:38:37,879
I feel like I can still
feel blood on my face.

855
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:43,358
That's just psychological, right?

856
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,511
I don't actually have any.

857
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:46,209
No, you're good.

858
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:49,540
Then what?

859
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:51,078
You want to get a drink?

860
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:53,536
I know I need one,
and it's on me, actually,

861
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:55,930
because I just got an extra
$20 mill I wasn't counting on.

862
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,895
- We work together.
- Yeah.

863
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:02,593
We work with your ex-wife.

864
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:05,667
And our parents are married
to each other.

865
00:39:05,701 --> 00:39:07,558
That's a lot of complicating factors.

866
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,306
So if it went bad,
we couldn't just walk away.

867
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:13,452
On the other hand, it's just a drink.

868
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,085
Jackson...

869
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:17,007
no, it's not.

870
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:20,583
I'm not saying "no."

871
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:23,607
I'm just saying it's complicated.

872
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,805
Mm-hmm.

873
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:26,343
Maggie Pierce?

874
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:30,763
Clive Johnson, from the... Tinder?

875
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:33,230
Oh, oh, oh! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

876
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:35,376
I'm so sorry. This day has
been absolutely insane.

877
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:39,092
It feels like months ago
since we scheduled dinner.

878
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:41,718
Did... did you want to take a rain check?

879
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:46,138
<i>So, what do we do when
instinct tells us to freeze?</i>

880
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,219
No, no, no.

881
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,747
No, you're here. You're here. Let's go.

882
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,216
- Okay.
- You kids have fun.

883
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:58,886
<i>When we can't see the right answer.</i>

884
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,715
<i>In those moments,
it's usually a good idea</i>

885
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:07,575
<i>to trust the instinct and take pause.</i>

886
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:08,681
Okay.

887
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,229
<i>Because decisions made
in the heat of the moment...</i>

888
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,707
What's happening?

889
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,501
Hit-and-run.

890
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:25,928
ABCs are intact, but he's
hypertensive and tachycardic.

891
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:31,111
<i>...can ruin a whole lot of lives.</i>

892
00:40:31,143 --> 00:40:33,256
What did you do?
