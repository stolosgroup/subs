1
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:03,413
If you're in an O.R.

2
00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:05,728
- and it feels like the sky is falling...
- Hey.

3
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:07,164
...that's because sometimes,

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,929
- unfortunately, it is.
- Hey.

5
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,204
Why don't you call in sick today
and I will, too?

6
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:14,725
Bailey's probably gonna
fire me soon anyways.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,626
I've missed so much already.

8
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:21,161
I could go in late, though.

9
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:23,735
I was once doing
a laparoscopic appendectomy,

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,004
perfectly routine...

11
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:28,079
Meredith! Open up!

12
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:29,401
...when out of nowhere,

13
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:31,627
my patient developed an air embolus.

14
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:32,884
Carbon dioxide that was

15
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,680
filling his abdomen
leached into his circulation.

16
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,415
- What?
- Were you gonna tell us?

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,624
Tell you what?

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,353
It just keeps going on.

19
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:43,743
What keeps going on?

20
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:44,927
Your article.

21
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:46,630
You wrote your article? No!

22
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:47,762
His blood pressure plummeted

23
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:51,067
as the air bubble went to
his heart, causing utter chaos.

24
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,363
This is savage.
You went after everybody...

25
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,311
Big Pharma, insurance,

26
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:56,817
institutionalized discrimination.

27
00:00:56,842 --> 00:00:58,439
Wait. I-I didn't write an article.

28
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:02,591
I-I sent them, like, some ideas
that I could write about

29
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:04,724
with, like, headline and description,

30
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,299
and they could choose one.

31
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:09,291
I started CPR, trying to keep
blood flowing to his brain.

32
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:11,191
Well, they chose.

33
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:13,637
We placed a central line
as quickly as we could,

34
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:16,650
but before we knew it, his
lungs were filling with fluid.

35
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:17,706
No.

36
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:19,386
This is every idea I gave them

37
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,786
but without the context and explanation.

38
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:25,474
I mean, this is gonna terrify people.

39
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,849
Yeah. I think that's the point,
judging by the headline.

40
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:31,528
"Hospital Hell at Grey-Sloan Memorial...

41
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:33,511
Fired Surgeon Speaks Out"?

42
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:35,738
I didn't say that.
I would never say that!

43
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,164
They just made that up.

44
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,591
Yeah, they make the headlines up.

45
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,595
90,000 likes so far.

46
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,688
You're a hit.

47
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:42,940
My routine lap appy

48
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,047
was now a case of multi-organ failure.

49
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:46,206
Bailey's gonna kill me.

50
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,737
No, Bailey's gonna kill me.

51
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:50,093
And there wasn't a damn thing
I could do to stop it.

52
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,913
"In the eyes of the hospital,
you are your insurance."

53
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,432
What? It's funny.
You don't think it's funny?

54
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:01,375
"Hospital Hell at Grey-Sloan Memorial"?

55
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,976
This is about the place that I work.

56
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,838
I offered you a job with me.
You shoulda taken it.

57
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:07,776
Ow!

58
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,291
You know, walking and texting

59
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:16,414
is one of the leading causes
of head injury.

60
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,274
- Hey.
- Hi.

61
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:19,426
My, uh, colleague...

62
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,076
- former colleague...
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:25,043
My friend, uh, published this list today.

64
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:27,035
"In America,

65
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:29,933
the rich live 10 to 15 years
longer than the poor.

66
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,672

67
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:32,693
to whoever can afford it."

68
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:33,640
Mm.

69
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:35,569
Damn. Is that true?

70
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:36,752
Unfortunately, yeah.

71
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:37,831
Hmm.

72
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:39,396
You know, when a house is on fire,

73
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:42,318
we just put it out,
no questions, no charge.

74
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:43,448
Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:47,120
But I guess that's why everyone
loves firefighters, huh?

76
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:49,242
I think I understand why.

77
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,362
- See you later.
- Stop it.

78
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,920
Hey, man.

79
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,021
Bailey.

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,443
Why aren't you in scrubs?

81
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:06,870
The rig's less than a minute out.

82
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,757
Uh, Allison's at my mom's,
and I'm just dropping off Leo.

83
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:12,208
- And?
- And I'm on paternity leave.

84
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,366
For how long?

85
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,941
For as long as Koracick's
restraining order lasts.

86
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,852
Koracick!

87
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,683
Yan Huang, 35, dialysis center patient.

88
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,187
His left A.V. fistula ruptured
while getting access.

89
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,847
Okay, let's get him a fluid bolus

90
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,145
and another unit on standby.

91
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,536
Where's the... Where am I?

92
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,555
Uh, Grey-Sloan Memorial. We're
gonna take good care of you.

93
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,703
Whoa, whoa. Don't... S-Stop. Stop.

94
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:37,129
Don't take me out of this ambulance.

95
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:39,251
But, sir, we have to repair
your fistula before you...

96
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,757
- You take me inside, and I'll sue!
- No, no, no, no! Don't do that!

97
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:43,530
Sir, go easy. You need some help, sir.

98
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,618
Not here! I've seen that list!

99
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:46,906
What...

100
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,426
Uh, Pac-North is closest, okay?

101
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:49,689
- Let's go.
- What?! What are you...

102
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:51,255
Let's go. Let's move.

103
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,561
What list?!

104
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,152
No.

105
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:07,204
No. No.

106
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,945
No. No!

Yeah, no one's gonna
look past that headline.

123

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,041
I-I'm, uh, late for rounds.
I... I'm gonna...

Yeah.

Don't sweat it, man.

131
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:06,811
Being liked is overrated.

132
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:13,851
When the scans come in, page peds

133
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:16,322
and call that hospital in
Portland for a family history.

134

Oh, make sure you dictate the H&Ps

136

And, uh... Oh, don't forget to check...

137
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:24,068
Whoa, okay, it's just...
this is kind of a lot.

138
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,044
Maybe I should write this down.

139
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,942
Have you seen this... list?

140
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:29,985
Yeah.

141
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,065
For once, it's a lot of horrible press

142
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,421
about someplace that isn't here.

143
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:33,848
Bailey must be losing her mind.

144
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:36,353

pull it all down in her wake.

The patient who escaped psych
last night, we found him.

149
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:44,829
Someone escaped psych?

150
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:46,014
Yeah. He's fine.

151
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,449
Security got him
before he changed into scrubs.

152
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:52,892

for good news around here.

"There's a nationwide epidemic
of physician burnout,

164
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,037
increasing the risk of medical error,

165
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:30,945
lowering your quality of care,

166
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,817
and costing patients and doctors
their lives."

167
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:34,184
Wow.

168
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,724
Yeah, she was as confused
as the rest of us, all right?

169
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:37,885
Oh, really?

170
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,769
Uh, well, she didn't write,
"We doctors are the sick ones.

171
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:42,952
We have the disease.

172
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:45,144
The call is coming
from inside the house"?

173
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,953
L-Link was supposed to be with Qadri,

174
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:48,658
and Simms was supposed to have Hunt.

175
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,154
They're all just a little lost, so...

176
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,823
That sounds like
a chief resident problem.

177
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,419
There is no chief resident.

178
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,413
Dr. Kang quit this morning.

179
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:57,752
Because of this list?

180
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:58,946
I'm guessing.

181
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,390
Well, congratulations.

182
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:04,269
You are my new chief resident.

183
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:06,148
Maybe you can fix
what your girlfriend broke.

184
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:07,957
Dr. Bailey, with all
due respect, this is not...

185
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:10,601
Don't "all due respect" me, DeLuca.

186
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,619
You had to know this was coming!

187
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:14,219
Hey, you work here.

188
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,968
Your career, your future
prospects are all right...

189
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:19,096
You think I can control
what Meredith Grey writes?

190
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:20,810
Well, I-I-I think
you could have warned us.

191
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:22,237
I think you could have sent up a flare.

192
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,951
I think you could have
had some type of loyalty

193
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,770
to the institution that's
raising you and training you...

194
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,370
Why is it 100 degrees in here?!

195
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,619
Is it your heart?
Do you need to sit down?

196
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:37,532
D-Dr. DeLuca, uh...

197
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,043
do you feel this article

198
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,982
is an accurate representation
of our hospital?

199
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:43,164
No, I do not.

200
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:45,079
Good. Go. Lead. Bye!

201
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:46,714
Okay.

202
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:49,705
Just keep breathing. Just keep breathing.

203
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,383
You want to film my surgery?

204
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,670
No, absolutely not.

205
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:59,035
Not sure if you heard, but
a disgruntled former employee

206
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,984
wrote a slash-and-burn exposé
of this place.

207
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,480
It wasn't about this place.

208
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:03,663
Headline says otherwise.

209
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:04,846
Okay, so, what, your idea

210
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:06,379
is to throw a camera
in my patient's face?

211
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,632
For Catherine Fox's kid,

212
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:09,614
it sure takes a long time
for that oven to preheat.

213
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,832
We're in damage-control mode.

214
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,980
You should be thanking me

215
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,234
for setting all this up
on such short notice.

216
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,592
And yet I'm not, Tom.

217
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,794
This kid's parents
are already blaming themselves

218
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,091
for letting her condition
get this bad, okay?

219
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,220
A little kid is not a spectacle.

220
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,038
I know. She's a beautiful little miracle,

221
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,484
and you are the angelic,
camera-ready plastic surgeon

222
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,120
who's gonna make her all better.

223
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:27,233
It's a win-win.

224
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,639
Mr. and Mrs. Martin.

225
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:33,839
And you must be Clervie.

226
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:35,845
Come on in, Dr. Avery.

227
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,313
There.

228
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,210
Excuse me. Hi. Dr. Avery.

229
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:44,228
Hi. Nice to meet you. How are you?

230
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,217
Hello. How you doing?

231
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:47,956
- Good.
- Yeah?

232
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,463
- They just shaved my head.
- All right.

233
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,598
We're gonna take
really good care of you, okay?

234
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,509
Our patient fell from a plane?

235
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,049
No. A person fell from a plane
and hit another person.

236
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,664
Oof. Sounds like
what Dr. Grey did to Big Pharma.

237
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,543
Oh, my God. How is he alive?

238
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,491
Alicia Chen, 19, GCS 8,

239
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:05,474
with bilateral
lower-extremity deformities,

240
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:06,657
possible pelvic fracture.

241
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,779
Saw some ST elevation on her EKG.

242
00:09:08,804 --> 00:09:10,693
We were just hanging out outside my dorm,

243
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,836
and he f-fell from the sky.

244
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,329
All right, page cardio and ortho.

245
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,662
Let's get her in trauma one.

246
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,297
Is Alicia... Is she dead?

247
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:18,480
Sir, what's your name?

248
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:20,290
- It's Josh. I'm Josh.
- Hey, Josh.

249
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:21,751
All right, you know what?
You need to stay here.

250
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:23,456
We're gonna assess your friend
and take good care of her.

251
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,175
Why isn't he on a gurney?
He's obviously bleeding.

252
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:26,716
It's not his.
It belongs to the guy who fell.

253
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,595
He just exploded all over us.

254
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,987
Okay, look, why don't you...

255
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:31,934
All right, on my count... 1, 2, 3.

256
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,001
Go.

257
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:41,589
Well, change the headline at least!

258
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,885
I love Grey-Sloan. I own Grey-Sloan.

259
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,869
I wouldn't write anything
to tear it down.

260
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:47,435
I don't really care

261
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,522
if it's the most shared piece
of the month.

262
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,876
The headline is so misleading!

263
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:58,570
Well, run it up the flagpole
quickly, please!

264
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,161
In cases of craniosyno... stosis,

265
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:14,596
the... the structures
of the skull fuse too early,

266
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:18,278
resulting in abnormal growth
and... development.

267
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,825
Well, what we'll be doing today

268
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:23,529
is carefully removing
the top of Clervie's skull,

269
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:24,777
break apart the bone,

270
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:27,317
and use those pieces
to re-shape her skull,

271
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:28,952
allowing everything to fit perfectly

272
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:31,700
and have plenty of room to grow
just the right way.

273
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:34,066
Our pediatrician said
it was just a mild case

274
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,284
and she would outgrow it.

275
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,244
It just kept growing and getting worse,

276
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:38,358
and now it's...

277
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:41,759
It's more dangerous, right,
now that she's older?

278
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,648
Well, it's slightly more complicated,

279
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:46,066
but, honestly, it's absolutely
nothing we can't handle.

280
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,240
What's important is that you're here now.

281
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:50,954
We're gonna take great care
of your little girl, I promise.

282
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,442
When Dr. Koracick called this morning

283
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:55,790
and said you could do
the surgery for free...

284
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:56,952
I mean...

285
00:10:56,953 --> 00:11:00,163
you hate to have to think
about money with your child,

286
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,771
but we were gonna have to
take out a second mortgage.

287
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,370
Thank you.

288
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:09,544
Yeah, th... it's our...
it's our pleasure.

289
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:15,744
You were born for the camera, Avery.

290
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,588
Schmitt, baby steps.

291
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,183
You bribed desperate parents

292
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,533
so you can use their fear
and pain for cheap publicity?

293
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,020
Finally, Wonder Boy gets it.

294
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,260
Wow.

295
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,845
Just when I thought I couldn't
possibly like you less,

296
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,245
you surprise me.

297
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,934
Hey, now, give them some space
but not too much.

298
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,813
And remember, anyone prays,
get that on camera.

299
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:34,857
That is gold.

300
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:36,845
And you did it again. Impressive.

301
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,184
Wha...

302
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,905
Uh, you...

303
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:46,149
Hey. You.

304
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:48,259
We need to skip the E.R.
Page your head of vascular.

305
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:49,407
We don't have one.

306
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:50,625
Well, then page Karev or Webber.

307
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,190
I'm gonna hand him off in the O.R.

308
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:54,022
Right. Okay.

309
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,197
Hey, I don't know where your O.R. is!

310
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,759
Let's go.

311
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,932
Hey, hey! It's good
to see a friendly face.

312
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,219
Webber. Great.

313
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:08,693
Dialysis patient, 35, uh,
ruptured left A.V. fistula,

314
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,050
lost a good amount of blood

315
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:12,242
and refused treatment at Grey-Sloan.

316
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:13,286
- Refused treatment?
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:14,434
Did you read this list?

318
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,860
I'm glad nobody wrote about us.

319
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,739
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come here.

320
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,304
Get this man to O.R. 4,

321
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:21,491
and if you can keep your mouth
shut, you can scrub in with me.

322
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:22,917
- Thanks for the business, Hunt.
- Sure.

323
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,605
Okay.

324
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,788
Hey, man.

325
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,911
- Hey.
- Bailey send you to spy on me?

326
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:32,043
No, no. I'm just dropping off a patient.

327
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:34,014
I'm, uh, taking some time off.

328
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,773
Koracick is driving me insane,

329
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,698
so Teddy's taking over the E.R.,

330
00:12:40,723 --> 00:12:42,576
and I'm staying home
with the kids for a while.

331
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:43,864
Well, if you don't have to rush home,

332
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,464
I'd love to... to give you a tour.

333
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:46,682
Sure.

334
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,769
Well, you have to use
your imagination, you know?

335
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:52,105
Try to picture it with, uh,
new lighting, paint job,

336
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,191
a few new walls,
qualified medical personnel.

337
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,996
Pelvis X-ray shows a type II
A.P. compression fracture.

338
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:59,098
Where did she fall from?

339
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:00,396
The guy fell on her.

340
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:02,958
Cops think he was a stowaway
on an international flight.

341
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:04,933
Helm, get the ultrasound.

342
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,986
Reminds me of a guy in Germany

343
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:10,221
who snuck into the wheel well of a 757.

344
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,889
All was fine and good until
they hit cruising altitude.

345
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,454
What happened at cruising altitude?

346
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,030
It's colder than Everest,
and there's less O2.

347
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:19,370
Brody, let's order some,
uh, bilateral leg films.

348
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:21,075
And when the landing gear opens,

349
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,032
it's like dropping an ice pack
on the ground from a mile high.

350
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,050
But the ice pack is made of
blood and muscle tissue,

351
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,928
so... pbht! splat.

352
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:30,576
Hughes. Hello. What do we got?

353
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,498
19-year-old, bilateral tib-fib fractures,

354
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:34,856
unstable pelvic fracture.

355
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,525
And the X-rays show that...

356
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,926
Widened mediastinum, sternal fracture.

357
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,611
What's the ultrasound?

358
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:41,606
Uh...

359
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:42,951
Turn on the color flow.

360
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,324
Looks like severe aortic insufficiency.

361
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:50,096
EKG showed ST elevations
in leads II, III, and AVF.

362
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,458
Could be ischemic changes
secondary to aortic root injury.

363
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:54,789
All right, her pressure looks stable.

364
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,320
Let's get a CTA to get a better look.

365
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,199
Yeah, seems like
you guys got this covered.

366
00:13:58,224 --> 00:13:59,550
All right, as soon as I
finish getting this binder on,

367
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:00,669
you can move her.

368
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:02,582
I think that's her
boyfriend out there panicking.

369
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,748
There you go. She's good.
I'll go check on him.

370
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,114
Pierce is kind of a genius, isn't she?

371
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,175
Not kind of. Is.

372
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,006
Hey, um, we got a few minutes?

373
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:13,199
I need to go talk to my wife.

374
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:14,555
Oh, is it about that list?

375
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,842
Avery told me.

376
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,371
Yeah. It's about that list.

377
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:20,742
Now, what's your name, bud?

378
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:23,404
Josh. All right.

379
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,387
All right, that accident must have
been tough to see, huh?

380
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,605
Yeah.

381
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,576
I'm gonna do a little exam, okay?

382
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,813
All right, Josh, hey,
those two doctors in there,

383
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,239
they don't make them any better.

384
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,491
Your girlfriend...

385
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:36,167
- Ali... Alicia.
- Alicia.

386
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,711
They're gonna do everything
they can to help Alicia.

387
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,798
All right, you hear me, Josh?

388
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,468
Can you take a deep breath for me?

389
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:51,804
Okay. Good.

390
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:53,440
All right, we're gonna clean you up

391
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,736
and, uh, get you something
to help you calm down.

392
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,917
Are you currently taking any prescrip...

393
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:03,376
Where did you get that?

394
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:06,555
My hood.

395
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,773
I tell you what, um,

396
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:10,730
I'm gonna get you some
clean scrubs to change into,

397
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:13,327
and while I'm at it, I'm just gonna...

398
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,363
Hi. Lisa, is it?

399
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:26,156
Hi. So, I did, um, both sides
of the street up to 1st Avenue

400
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,860
and then the parking lot.

401
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,321
I don't give out gold stars.

402
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,992
Head back over across the street.

403
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,356
There's a lot of empties over there.

404
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,652
Actually, so, I have an emergency,

405
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:36,391
and I-I really need to go.

406
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,188
Grey, I know all about you
and your emergencies.

407
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,971
I wrote something, and... and
it's been taken out of context.

408
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,789
The headline has actually
nothing to do with what I said,

409
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:47,678
- and I need to go take care of it.
- You have five more hours for today.

410
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:48,973
Lisa.

411
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:52,066
Human to human.

412
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:56,894
It's a real emergency for me.

413
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,775
I really need to go take care of this.

414
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,099
You walk away before your time's up,

415
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:03,813
I'm calling the judge about
all your extracurriculars.

416
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,857
You decide.

417
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,453
_

418
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,110
Please don't call the judge.
I will make up my hours.

419
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:15,249
I have to go.

420
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,397
Please don't call him.

421
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,336
I promise I'll make up the hours.

422
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,005
Grey!

423
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,490
Grey?!

424
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,457
Well, Mer's list
really freed up my morning.

425
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:29,370
I've had two surgeries cancel.

426
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:30,414
Are you mad?

427
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:32,293
Mm. A little.

428
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:34,972
But I never win fights with her,
even inside my head,

429
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:36,744
so I'm just shoving it down.

430
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:37,824
Mm.

431
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:38,903
Have you seen Link?

432
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:40,990
I'm craving some gravity blanket.

433
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:42,242
What?

434
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,669
Oh, we used to do this thing

435
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:46,000
where he would just put all
of his body weight on top of me,

436
00:16:46,025 --> 00:16:47,949
and it was like a thunder jacket
for a dog.

437
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,698
But now I've got the little
peanut, so he just bear-hugs me.

438
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,994
I'm claustrophobic. I can't
think of anything less soothing.

439
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,524
But sounds like you two are a match.

440
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,229
We kind of are, aren't we?

441
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:57,527
I mean, I get all spinny-outy,

442
00:16:57,552 --> 00:17:01,657
and he's just like a big, calm mountain.

443
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,508
Well, uh, right now your mountain

444
00:17:03,508 --> 00:17:05,640
is trying to calm down
my patient's boyfriend.

445
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,624
What happened to your patient?

446
00:17:07,649 --> 00:17:08,702
Just imagine...

447
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,094
Never mind. Don't imagine.

448
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,265
Pierce! I need a word.

449
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,895
Okay. Uh, if this is about Mer's list,

450
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,044
I don't want to hear it.

451
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,088
I stand by her as a surgeon
and as a sister.

452
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:20,183
I don't care. Follow me, please.

453
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:26,981
And just need one last sample
to confirm blood type

454
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,163
in case there's any bleeding in the O.R.

455
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:29,381
Otherwise, we'll be fine.

456
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:30,482
Thank you so much.

457
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:36,558
She really is just
such a happy little girl.

458
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,471
We've learned so much from her,

459
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:41,289
and we feel so blessed to have...

460
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:43,447
to have met the doctors here
so she can...

461
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:47,604
...so she can get
the help that she needs.

462
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,796
This is no good. Too much backlight.

463
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,535
Oh, uh...

464
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,622
Uh, Peter, uh, sorry.

465
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:54,849
Uh, technical stuff.

466
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:55,893
You okay?

467
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,180
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

468
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:59,268
Uh, we're gonna get you to,
uh, say that again,

469
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:00,799
I mean, just... just like you did

470
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:04,695
but just a little bit more,
uh, over here.

471
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,983
- Yeah.
- All right.

472
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:07,374
- Okay.
- Actually, you know what, Peter?

473
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,054
I think it was perfect. There's no need.

474
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,363
Take a break.

475
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:14,541
You know what?

476
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,246
Dr. Avery is right

477
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,508
'cause we need to talk
to Mrs. Martin anyway.

478
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,281
So... yeah.

479
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:21,778
Yeah.

480
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:23,088
Thank you, guys.

481
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,398
This man is in fear, right, real fear.

482
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:31,898
His daughter's 3 years old.

483
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:34,333
This surgery's gonna be traumatic,
painful, and life-threatening,

484
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,334
and you need him to say it all
again with better lighting?

485
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,804
Dr. Avery, I don't think
you need to be reminded,

486
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,518
but just in case, I am your boss.

487
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:46,023
If you need more clarification
on the matter, lemme know,

488
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:49,920
and I can have your mom call
and explain it to you.

489
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,416
Oh.

490
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:53,191
Well, while you have her,
ask her how much longer

491
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,348
she's gonna be punishing us with you.

492
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,036
Ah, funny.

493
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,913
No chest pain, no shortness of breath.

494
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,591
Your EKG shows no changes.

495
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:06,488
I see no arrhythmias or abnormal flow.

496
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,123
So Grey didn't give me a heart attack.

497
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,271
No.

498
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:10,489
You're just warm.

499
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,377
War... I'm in a sauna.

500
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,603
How long has it been like this?

501
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:18,073
A few days? I don't know, Pierce.

502
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:22,040
Uh, you know, I got a lot on my mind,

503
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,763
and this list isn't making it any better.

504
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,328
Well, it's not your heart.

505
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:27,720
Well, what is it?

506
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,918
It could be hor... It could be hormonal.

507
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:36,800
I have to be in surgery in 15 minutes,

508
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,783
but I could do a quick blood draw

509
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,314
and, uh, check your levels?

510
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,367
Okay, well, do it right quick,
then, if you have to go.

511
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:45,254
I-I need a full blood panel,
CBC, thyroid...

512
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,887
Yeah, I know how to do a blood panel.

513
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,958
Schmitt, uh,
where are we with, uh, cran...

514
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,280
Mom, no.

515
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,506
Tell Aunt Carol she doesn't need

516
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:57,211
to reschedule her carpal tunnel surgery.

517
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:58,882
We're still a good hospital.

518
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:03,646
I-I-I'm at work right now. I have to go.

519
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:05,037
Sorry.

520
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:07,994
My mom sent Grey's article
to everyone in our family,

521
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:10,464
and they gave me the money
for med school,

522
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,100
so they're very invested.

523
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,874
You're on the phone,
and you're not doing your job.

524
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:15,510
You're basically a bullet point
on Grey's list.

525
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:16,832
Get back to work.

526
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,886
I sent a proposal to the board to
see if they'll expand the NICU.

527
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,173
I swear, this place must be backed

528
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:23,318
by Russian Mafia or something

529
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:24,568
because they are not afraid
to write checks.

530
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:25,728
That doesn't hurt.

531
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:27,383
Over here, I want to, uh, put in

532
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,246
the new innovative pediatric
surgery unit by spring.

533
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,817
You know, this place
is really shaping up.

534
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,698
Oh, my God! Somebody, help!

535
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:35,985
Miller, what happened?

536
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,895
Patient just had colon
surgery due to a perforation.

537
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,401
His wound vac started filling
with blood and... I don't know.

538
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:42,511
Did you send blood for a coag panel? Hmm?

539
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:45,019
Ma'am, I need you
to stand back now, please.

540
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:48,046
I feel warm.

541
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,228
Why won't it stop?!

542
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:50,586
Karev, is it okay if I jump in?

543
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:51,872
Yeah, please. What do you need?

544
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,090
Okay.

545
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:54,725
You, get me a crash cart,

546
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,462
two units of blood, gauze,
and suction, okay?

547
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,606
Now!

548
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:01,450
See what I have to put up with?

549
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,557
Ohh! I've had a really crazy
day, and I can't really talk.

550
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,748
I thought you might be in the E.R.,

551
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:15,122
seeing as how a body just fell
from the sky.

552
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,001
I mean, I've never seen anything like it,

553
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,463
I mean, I've seen some things.

554
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:22,928
Okay, Miranda, look,

555
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,848
if... if you're still upset
about Grey's list...

556
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:26,693
But, hey, it'll blow over, all right?

557
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,684
Try not to make yourself more
angry by staring at it all day.

558
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:31,597
That's not why I'm angry.

559
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:32,885
It's... It's not?

560
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,564
I'm angry because
it's 1,000 degrees in here,

561
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:36,920
and I can't stop crying

562
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,556
because my hormones are
hitting me like a tidal wave

563
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:42,444
because I am in menopause!

564
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,835
- Miranda, we don't...
- No!

565
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,126
Don't bother telling me
that that's not what it is,

566
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:49,128
because I saw it happen
to my mom at a young age,

567
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:51,077
and now it's happening to me.

568
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,148
And I know it's
the natural order of things.

569
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:55,893
I am woman. Hear me roar.

570
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:58,008
I knew it was coming...

571
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:00,566
someday!

572
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,751
I'm sorry, Ben.

573
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:10,371
No one really warns you
about all the feelings.

574
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,217
Just tell me what you need.

575
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:21,539
Just... Here.

576
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:24,845
Just sit here with me
for like five minutes

577
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,748
and let me have all the feelings.

578
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:35,291
Oh, God! Stupid.

579
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:38,882
- Okay, okay.
- It's hot!

580
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:47,025
Hey!

581
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:50,630
How bad is it?

582
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:53,717
Okay. Well, um, residents are panicking.

583
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:55,143
Everyone else seems split.

584
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,022
Some are pissed.
Some are calling you a hero.

585
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:58,727
Alex couldn't stop laughing all morning.

586
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,258
Where do you land?

587
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:01,962
Well, I wish you hadn't
name-checked the hospital

588
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:03,493
that just made me an attending,

589
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:05,958
but I think it'll start
some much-needed conversation

590
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,917
once tempers calm.

591
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:09,169
Like Bailey's temper?

592
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:11,153
Okay, her rage level is so high,

593
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:12,544
I'm worried for her physical health.

594
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:15,502
Well, I would like to explain
how this happened.

595
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,241
Especially to Bailey. I owe it to her.

596
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,806
I mean, I named my kid after her.

597
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,511
She might ask you to take that back.

598
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:22,077
- Um...
- Good luck.

599
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,992
There. You see that?
That's the source of the bleed.

600
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,426
- The aorta.
- The aorta?

601
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,479
No. What year are you? Second.

602
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:34,192
Superior epigastric artery.

603
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:35,966
One of the cardinal rules in trauma

604
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:37,810
is to find the source
of the bleeding and...?

605
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:40,941
- Uh...
- Get proximal and distal control.

606
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,238
Okay, looks like poor hemostasis
after surgery.

607
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:46,195
Let's get him in the O.R. and do
a repair and a quick washout.

608
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,109
All right. Miller,
book the next available O.R.

609
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,152
for Dr. Hunt right now.

610
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,683
Right. Um, who's Dr. Hunt?

611
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,144
- Him.
- Me.

612
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:53,223
Okay.

613
00:23:56,622 --> 00:23:58,669
All right, page me when Clervie's ready.

614
00:23:58,694 --> 00:24:01,279
Try not to trip on any camera wires.

615
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:02,601
Cameras?

616
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,384
Yeah, doing a craniosynostosis
on a 3-year-old,

617
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:07,438
which Koracick is
turning into a feel-good video

618
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:09,700
so he could fight the bad
attention around Mer's list.

619
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:12,552
Also, he bribed the family
with a pro bono surgery.

620
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,770
Ew. Gross.

621
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,893
And yet totally on brand.

622
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:18,224
Meredith's kind of
lucky, when you think about it.

623
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,764
Uh, losing her job
and possibly losing her license?

624
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:22,156
Well, I mean, yeah, obviously,

625
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,171
but she doesn't have to
worry about all this crap,

626
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,389
you know, how things look.

627
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:28,473
She can just... do the right thing.

628
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:31,800
I love a good dare.

629
00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:33,052
- That wasn't a dare.
- Thank you.

630
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:35,023
Wait. No. I don't really think
that she's lucky!

631
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:41,701
Good to be back?

632
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:44,345
You have no idea.

633
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,745
But I love being a mom, too.

634
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,277
No judgment here.

635
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:50,643
Meredith calls bowel resections
her "me time."

636
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,290
Would you be willing to tell
her how much I loved her article?

637
00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:57,246
Um, yeah... Helm, sure.

638
00:24:57,271 --> 00:25:01,177
How amazing and important
and just perfect it is?

639
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,360
And that she's still my mentor,

640
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:03,787
even if she doesn't work here anymore?

641
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:05,195
I will pass it along.

642
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:08,046
All right, clamping the aorta.

643
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:09,299
All right.

644
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:12,290
We are gonna stop the heart
with cardioplegia

645
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:14,447
so we can replace the aortic root.

646
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,165
That's... weird.

647
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,496
The heart's not stopping.

648
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:20,653
How is she? Finally got
her boyfriend calmed down.

649
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:21,836
Well, it looks like the blunt injury

650
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:24,481
also caused a coronary artery dissection,

651
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:26,812
so we're gonna have to
pass the cardioplegia

652
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:29,501
through the coronary sinus so
we can get this heart to stop.

653
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:31,834
- She cannot catch a break.
- How can I help?

654
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:33,223
All right, well,
we're gonna have to do a bypass,

655
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:36,006
so you can harvest a vein from her leg

656
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:37,885
while Pierce and I...

657
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,242
- No! Start pressors!
- Crap.

658
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,704
The root is rupturing!

659
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:41,832
- I'm gonna go scrub.
- Yep.

660
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:44,024
Get that suction in there.
Get that suction in there.

661
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,277
Hey. You busy?

662
00:25:49,302 --> 00:25:51,190
I just did a cervical decompression.

663
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,800
Now I'm gonna grab enough lunch
for multiple humans.

664
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:56,080
I can buy you something from
the vending machine on the way.

665
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,140
On the way to where?

666
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:01,748
Don't worry.
We'll remain right on schedule.

667
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:03,926
You don't want Dr. Koracick to operate?

668
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:07,162
My sister texted us an article
about this hospital.

669
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:09,531
Is that what this is about?
Is he part of the problem?

670
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:10,714
No, absolutely not.

671
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:13,267
No. Tom Koracick is
a brilliant neurosurgeon.

672
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:14,902
Then why make a change?

673
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:17,408
Well, for starters, I'm better.

674
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:19,912
Dana, Peter, I know that you only agreed

675
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:22,104
to let Tom film the surgery
so it would be free,

676
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,704
but I can... see now

677
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,442
that you're both a little uncomfortable.

678
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:28,577
And I can't blame you.
This is a very big decision.

679
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,039
It's your family's privacy.

680
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:32,953
You shouldn't have to think about
that under these conditions.

681
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:35,330
So, I want you to know that
no matter what happens today,

682
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:37,035
no matter what you decide,

683
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,041
your surgery's not gonna
cost you a thing.

684
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:41,314
Yeah.

685
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,402
W-Why... Why would you do this?

686
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,027
Well, I have a little girl of my own,

687
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:46,864
and if she needed a surgery,
I'd want to make sure

688
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:49,142
that her doctors
aren't thinking about anything

689
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,429
except for her.

690
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:51,903
Your little girl means more to me

691
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:54,326
than some... some good press.

692
00:26:59,736 --> 00:27:00,812
Yes.

693
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:03,428
Yes. And thank you.

694
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,759
All right. Let's get going, then.

695
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:06,400
All right, guys, let's come on in.

696
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:08,262
Thank you so much.

697
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,784
You know Tom is gonna blow a gasket

698
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:13,897
when he hears about this.

699
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:15,255
Oh, I know.

700
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,495
Added bonus.

701
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,440
No.

702
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:27,069
Time of death 16:04.

703
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:28,810
Injury was just...

704
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:30,932
It caused too much damage.

705
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:32,428
Damn it.

706
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,376
It's not just the medical system
that's broken.

707
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:35,838
It's the whole world.

708
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,725
Why'd the stowaway have to
fall out of a plane?

709
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,013
And how bad was his life

710
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:41,786
that he had to climb
in the plane to begin with?

711
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:44,396
And why did this girl, who could
have been anywhere in the world,

712
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:48,154
been in the just worst place possible?

713
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:49,660
The whole world is broken.

714
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:50,843
Now I have a baby,

715
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:53,974
and it just makes it so much scarier.

716
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,261
I can close.

717
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:56,746
Thank you.

718
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:06,973
Get the drill ready.

719
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:09,326
Stencil's almost complete.

720
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:10,613
You kidnapped my surgery?

721
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:13,187
Oh, it was never your surgery,
was it, Tom?

722
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:15,066
Tap out, Shepherd. I'm scrubbing in.

723
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:16,647
Shepherd's actually
got it all under control.

724
00:28:16,672 --> 00:28:18,178
Uh, the family, on the other hand,

725
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:20,544
has had a change of heart about
you filming this whole thing.

726
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,735
So if you get your camera crew
within... I don't know...

727
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,588
one foot of my O.R.,
security will be called.

728
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:26,702
The foundation put me...

729
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:27,988
I am the foundation.

730
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:29,693
And I own more shares
than anyone on the board,

731
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:31,955
so if you want to get technical,
I am your boss.

732
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,555
Not to mention,
the people that come to me

733
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,773
for cosmetic procedures

734
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,861
make up a huge percentage
of hospital profits.

735
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:39,518
So maybe you want to, um,
stay the hell out of my way.

736
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,859
Wow.

737
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:43,156
You just threw away millions
in fast, free publicity

738
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,521
and took arrogance to a level
even I've never reached.

739
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:47,366
This thing Grey started?

740
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:48,722
You should know better than anyone

741
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:50,636
how fires like that spread.

742
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:54,208
And if it does, it'll burn down
a lot more than this hospital.

743
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:59,017
Hey, Tom, great rage
in that reaction, really.

744
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:00,826
But you were a little backlit, though.

745
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:03,401
I'd love it if you could
give it to me from the top,

746
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:04,757
a little closer to the door.

747
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,750
Yeah.

748
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:10,658
I was kinda hoping my part would be done

749
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:12,606
by the time he found out.

750
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,311
Yeah. Sorry about that.

751
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,387
Osteotome, please, Schmitt.

752
00:29:16,782 --> 00:29:17,801
Schmitt, come on.

753
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:19,435
Yeah. Sorry.

754
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,775
Thank you.

755
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,881
500 feet? That's ridiculous.

756
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:28,421
Bet it was worth it just to zap
the guy in the nads, though.

757
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:31,378
It was an accident. A happy accident.

758
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,127
Bailey must be homicidal,
having Koracick as her boss.

759
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:35,553
You a little bit happy about that?

760
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:37,675
Well, I mean, I'm mad that she fired me,

761
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,101
but Bailey's still Bailey.

762
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:41,189
She shouldn't have to
take orders from him.

763
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:42,998
That's exactly why I left.

764
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:44,224
Suction.

765
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,874
So, you sick of it yet? Staying home?

766
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:50,981
I'm happy to do it for Teddy.

767
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,859
It's way harder than I expected.

768
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,366
Come work for me. Take head of trauma.

769
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:59,219
You know, structure the department
however you want, ground up.

770
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:01,759
I mean, Webber and I are
helping, but we can't do it all.

771
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:04,035
I mean, look at this place.
It's really messed up.

772
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,450
Way to sell it, Karev.

773
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,373
Today was kinda fun.

774
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:09,869
If there's one thing I can promise you,

775
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:11,540
it's that there'll be more days like it.

776
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:13,349
Kind of reminding me of the Army.

777
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:15,111
With worse food.

778
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,530

Everything fit. It's perfect.

798
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:38,377
Yeah. Minimal blood loss.

799
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:41,442
All right, why don't you
get Clervie down to the PICU,

800
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,764
and then we'll update the family.

801
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:45,670
I mean, it's perfect. It's miraculous.

802
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,375
And if you'd have let
Dr. Koracick film it,

803
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,906
it might have really helped this place.

804
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:51,236
♪ I'll stand by you ♪

805
00:31:51,261 --> 00:31:53,048
I don't concern myself
with headlines, Schmitt.

806
00:31:53,073 --> 00:31:54,649
I suggest you don't, either.

807
00:31:54,674 --> 00:31:56,109
You don't have to.

808
00:31:56,134 --> 00:31:57,362
You already have a career.

809
00:31:57,387 --> 00:31:58,928
Your future is safe no matter what.

810
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:01,224
Not all of us have that luxury.

811
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:02,824
All right, you're so disappointed,

812
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:05,503
why don't you get her bandaged
up and settled in the PICU,

813
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:07,659
and I'll go update the family myself.

I remember telling security
to deactivate your keycard.

817
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:19,104
I-I'm sure this is a bad time.

818
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:21,157
Uh, no. A great time, in fact.

819
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:22,966
I'm having a red-letter day.

820
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,775
There'll be cake any minute.

821
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,384
I would like to explain
how this happened.

822
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,333
It was never meant to be published.

823
00:32:29,358 --> 00:32:31,142
I only pitched them a few ideas.

824
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,326
- From "Hospital Hell"?
- That, I never even said.

825
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,552
And I would never say that.

826
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,455
Anything that I actually wrote

827
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,708
wasn't even directed at this hospital.

828
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:41,587
Then have them change it.
Have them take it down.

829
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:43,709
I tried. They won't.

830
00:32:44,147 --> 00:32:46,923
I can write a retraction, an explanation.

831
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,219
A retraction won't help, Grey.

832
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:51,515
Nobody reads the retractions.

833
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,597
Bailey, you know me.

834
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:56,937
You know I love this place.
I grew up here.

835
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,967
Any good I've ever done,
any awards I've ever received

836
00:32:59,992 --> 00:33:01,776
have been from things I learned here,

837
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:05,150
in this program,
from you and Richard Webber.

838
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:06,735
I...

839
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,179
I'm sorry if... if any of this
has hurt you.

840
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:12,359
I really am truly sorry.

841
00:33:13,746 --> 00:33:15,390
I know what you learned, Grey.

842
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:18,487
I spent years of my life
teaching it to you.

843
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:21,131
Remember, I stayed late
almost every night

844
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:23,108
explaining procedures and technique

845
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:25,295
when I could have been home
with my family, right?

846
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,006
I made you study. I made you practice.

847
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:29,919
I was your friend, your mentor,

848
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:32,320
and every time you needed me,
I was there.

849
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,894
So you can sit there and apologize to me

850
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,957
and say all the... the moving words,

851
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,975
but the damage has been done.

852
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:45,198
Bailey, I...

853
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,147
You can close the door on your way out.

854
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,167
A resident thought
that that was the aorta?

855
00:34:01,192 --> 00:34:02,734
- What is wrong with people?
- Yeah.

856
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,986
If Karev hadn't been giving me a tour,

857
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,760
then the guy might have died.

858
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,117
W... Y-You got a tour?

859
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:08,077
Yeah.

860
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:09,295
Evening, Altman.

861
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,488
- Hey.
- Leo!

862
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,925
I'm not turning around, Tom,

863
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,735
so if you need to call the cops,
then go ahead.

864
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,126
I'm dropping the restraining order.

865
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:17,518
We need every good doctor we can get,

866
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:19,292
so I'm taking the high road.

867
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:20,846
You can have your job back.

868
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,982
Yeah, well, thanks, but, um...
you didn't fire me.

869
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:25,990
I quit.

870
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:27,939
And I have already taken a job

871
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:30,061
at a very up-and-coming area hospital.

872
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:31,697
- You did?
- W-What hospital?

873
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:34,654
One that will be excellent
when I'm done with it, so...

874
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,010
It's Pac-North, isn't it?

875
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:37,124
It's not a dirty word, Tom.

876
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:38,724
Yeah, but it's a dirty place.

877
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:41,646
You call me when you realize
the error of your ways.

878
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:44,391
Same to you.

879
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:47,475
Wow. Wow. I hate that guy.

880
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,623
I know.

881
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:50,745
- Pac-North?
- Mm-hmm.

882
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,928
Really?

883
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:53,777
Wait. Did you not read
Meredith's article?

884
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:56,386
Your high horse has no legs to stand on.

885
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:58,532
That is not the saying.

886
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,209
We did everything we could do,

887
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:06,171
but there was just too much damage.

888
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,327
I'm so sorry.

889
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,123
Do you have any contact info

890
00:35:13,148 --> 00:35:15,639
for Alicia's folks
or any family we could call?

891
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:22,437
We just met a month ago, in biochem.

892
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:26,661
I don't even know her parents' names.

893
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,413
Well...

894
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:37,066
It's okay.

895
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:38,622
We'll find them.

896
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:46,575
We were just sitting in the grass

897
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,421
under that tree.

898
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,047
She liked that.

899
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:55,426
She said it reminded her of a Y.A. novel

900
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:57,973
about teenagers who had cancer

901
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,835
enjoying life and grass and the air

902
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,123
while they still could,

903
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:05,512
except we didn't have to have cancer.

904
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:10,625
We would just lie in the grass

905
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,538
and look at each other.

906
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:19,138
It felt cheesy at first, but then...

907
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,974
...it was all I wanted to do forever.

908
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,422
I should have protected her.

909
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:35,470
But how do you protect someone
from something like this?

910
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:42,640
Hey. Hey. Hey.

911
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,117
- Hey!
- Hey.

912
00:36:58,142 --> 00:37:00,483
You, uh, lost? You looking for the E.R.?

913
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:01,945
No, I just dropped off a guy

914
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,962
whose bowling ball pulled him
all the way down the alley.

915
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:05,737
So, this one of yours?

916
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:07,059
Okay.

917
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,311
Uh, yeah.

918
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,433
Yeah, I just rebuilt
this little girl's skull

919
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,047
from scratch, actually.

920
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:13,881
Took all day.

921
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:17,278
That's it?

922
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:18,947
Usually you're all,

923
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:20,756
"I was the only surgeon in
the whole world who could do it

924
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,067
'cause I'm so skilled."

925
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,840
I mean, I wouldn't say the whole
world, first of all.

926
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:24,999
Uh-huh.

927
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,992
The state of Washington is an argument.

928
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:30,139
I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't impressed.

929
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,082
I'm suddenly starving.
You got 10 minutes?

930
00:37:34,107 --> 00:37:35,228
Can I interest you

931
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,162
in some particularly disgusting
hospital food?

932
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:38,660
Oh, my God, that's my favorite.

933
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:41,754
After multiple
transfusions, emergent dialysis,

934
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:44,245
and the fastest central line
I've done to this day,

935
00:37:44,945 --> 00:37:46,591
my patient pulled through.

936
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:48,121
You're sure you want to do this?

937
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:49,513
But it taught an important lesson.

938
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:50,696
Let me have it.

939
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:54,063
Okay. But I'm warning you,
it is habit-forming.

940
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:56,186
There is no such thing

966
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:24,997
I'm ready for the worst.

967
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:27,849
- Hey.
- Hey.

968
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:29,200
What... What are you doing here?

969
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:30,789
I tried to talk to Bailey.

970
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:33,965
She thinks I attacked her publicly.

971
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,147
It's... I don't know.

972
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,752
I don't... I don't know how to fix this.

973
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:38,839
I mean, what... what were you expecting?

974
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:40,177
We're friends.

975
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:43,378
I thought our history would earn
me some benefit of the doubt.

976
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:44,943
And I walked off work crew,

977
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,031
so I got a summons to go back to court.

978
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:48,214
Wait a minute. You walked out?

979
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,292
Well, I had no choice.

980
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:50,857
Mer, yeah, you did have a choice.

981
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:52,477
And... And you chose the thing
that could put you in jail.

982
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:53,544
Why would you do that?

983
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:55,939
That headline hurt a lot of people.

984
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,190
You once told me I needed to develop

985
00:39:57,225 --> 00:39:58,488
an instinct for self-preservation.

986
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,367
- Remember that?
- That was entirely different.

987
00:40:00,392 --> 00:40:02,142
You were claiming a crime
you didn't commit.

988
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:03,951
Yeah, a-a crime that you committed.

989
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:06,115
A crime that's now threatening
your medical license.

990
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,607
And this is just adding to that threat.

991
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:09,490
You think the medical board
just doesn't read the news?

992
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:11,983
There isn't anything that I said
that wasn't the truth.

993
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:15,907
It isn't my fault that they
packaged it up like a bomb.

994
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:17,854
Okay, but don't you think
that there was a world

995
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,493
where you just finish
the community-service

996
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:20,777
hours and came back to work?

997
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:24,535
I should just shut up and sit
on my mountain of privilege?

998
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,691
And leave everyone else
to fight their own battles?

999
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,580
Or you work within
the broken system to change it

1000
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:31,458
instead of bringing
the whole thing down with you.

1001
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,956
It's self-destructive, Mer.

1002
00:40:33,158 --> 00:40:34,977
You really don't need enemies right now.

1003
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:36,668
No. I don't.

1004
00:40:37,822 --> 00:40:39,451
And I don't need this, either.

1005
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:40,843
And if you think there's a world

1006
00:40:40,868 --> 00:40:43,232
in which I just sit back
while something's broken

1007
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:45,093
and hurting people and killing people...

1008
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:47,989
you don't really know me.

1009
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,158
At all.

1010

against bad outcomes,

1011
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:56,380
