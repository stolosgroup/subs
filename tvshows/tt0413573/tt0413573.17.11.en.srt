1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,550
During our
ER rotation in med school,

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,720
my roommate fell in love
with emergency medicine.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,120
Avery.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,550
Care to tell me
why you've pulled

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,420
all of my residents from the ER?

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,250
Yeah, I just wanted to speed up
our free COVID testing.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,910
But, I mean, hey, if you want,
I guess we could...

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,000
we could start
turning them away.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,390
It's a great program.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,000
Forget I asked, okay?

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,220
She loved being
on the frontline.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,610
She felt that's where she had
the most impact.

13
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,220
But I knew, three days in,

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,880
emergency medicine
was not for me.

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,320
Most treatments were meant
to just tide patients over

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,100
until they could see
their own physician,

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,750
a specialist, or a surgeon.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,100
And how is her base deficit?

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,670
Same as I told you
five minutes ago.

20
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,500
And her inflammatory markers?

21
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,280
Altman, we would not be
here without your tireless effort.

22
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,370
But you still have two days off.

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,810
Enjoy them,

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,046
because you're gonna
miss them when you're back.

25
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,430
Okay. Thanks.
Uh, one more thing...

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,990
Goodbye, Altman.

27
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,250
And I thought, "What's the point

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,210
of starting something
you won't get to finish?"

29
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,886
...closer, I saw it didn't
have a ball in its mouth,

30
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,820
it had an avocado.

31
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,610
No idea where he got it from.

32
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,610
You're gonna love dogs.

33
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,896
Oh, you're gonna love
everythingabout the outside. Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,140
The trees, grass, rainbows.

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,360
Isn't that right, Luna?

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,570
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait.

37
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,970
Say her name again.
Why?

38
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,076
Because I think
she understood it.

39
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,320
Her face changed.

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,620
Yeah, Luna...
Luna.

41
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,540
Luuuna...
Luna!

42
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,946
For what it's worth,
she doesn't respond

43
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,036
when Isay her name, either.

44
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,280
Yes, she does.
She's a genius.

45
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,150
All right if I complete
my rounds now?

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,590
Or is she such a genius that
she can look after herself?

47
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,640
No. Go ahead.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,460
Wilson, Chief,

49
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,070
while I think these visits
do Luna the world of good,

50
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,600
I have about 15 other patients
and their very worried parents

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
waiting for me,
so if you don't mind...

52
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,120
Nyah nyah nyah
nyah nyah. Mm-hmm.

53
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,340
Thank you.

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,870
♪ Used to have a lover
that was mine, all mine ♪

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,870
No. Go back
where you came from.

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,090
I already have all the clothes
in the house.

57
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,920
Ellis thought her laundry went
under her bed,

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,310
not in the hamper.

59
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,750
He just ate.

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,190
Well, I ate a lot
when I was a kid.

61
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,320
Still do.

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,930
Okay.

63
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,150
Baby or laundry?

64
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,280
Neither.

65
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,646
I... I just want
everything to stop.

66
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,590
The whole planet,
it can just stop turning,

67
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,980
and we can all just melt.

68
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,200
Is it for us?

69
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,250
Is it for us?

70
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,640
Is it for us?

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,860
Is what for us, buddy?

72
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,210

Hey, kiddos!

77
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

COVID! And stranger.

80
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,206
Aw, we've talked on the computer
screen lots of times.

81
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,140
We're old friends. Where are your masks?!

82
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,800
Where's my grandson?
That's what I want to know.

83
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,800
Oh, don't worry, honey,
we have been totally safe.

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,370
Two-week quarantine
from Colorado

85
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,800
while we took in the scenery.

86
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,330
Dad packed for everything.
We didn't even have to shop.

87
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,720
Haven't spoken face-to-face
with another soul

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,720
since we left.

89
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,550
Mm. So romantic.

90
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,990
I guess I'll...
go get Scout?

91
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,990
Okay. Alright, I'll do you
one better.

92
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,600
We thought we could take
all the kids

93
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,120
to check out
Mt. Rainier.

94
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,470
Fun!
Can we go, please?

95
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,260
Uh, I'm sorry.

96
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,830
You're say... you want to take
everyone from here?

97
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,000
Those first few months
with a newborn...

98
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,220
impossible without help.

99
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,220
Only if it's okay.

100
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,310
Okay.

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,320
Yes! Yay! Come on!

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,320
Have I told you two
how much I love you?

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,970
Because I definitely love you.

104
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,760
And we love you, too, hon.

105
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,840
We couldn't have asked for
a better daughter-in-law.

106
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,020
She is the mother
of my grandson,

107
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,150
and even if you haven't
gotten around to proposing,

108
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,900
I am gonna call her
what I want to call her.

109
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,860
I don't get why they're not
married, either.

110
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,420
Okay. Time to hit the road.Zola.

111
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,080
I'll go get Scout.

112
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,470
I can't wait
to meet my grandson!

113
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,390
That's it?

114
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,040
I can go again if you want.

115
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,530
You'll get a text in 30 minutes
with the results.

116
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,140
Thank you.
All right.

117
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,270
I've almost used all my kits.
I'm so sorry.

118
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,156
It's just that the... the...
the turnout's so high.

119
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,140
Relax, Schmitt.
We have more in the van.

120
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,750
If we run low, we can go over

121
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,336
to the drive-through site
at Station 19.

122
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,540
They've got extras.

123
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,540
Oh.
Wow. That's amazing.

124
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,930
How did we get more kits?

125
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,240
20 hours of virtual meetings
with the Fox Foundation,

126
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,916
convincing them it's the right
thing to do... that's how.

127
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,290
You don't just ask your mom?

128
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,460
Ready for you, sir.

129
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,966
Thank you. Why don't you go ahead
and have a seat?

130
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,250
How you doing?
Good.

131
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,300
One of our cashiers tested
positive at the store.

132
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,356
I feel fine, but, you know,
I figured I should make sure.

133
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,040
Good. Smart.
Okay.

134
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Can you take your mask down
a little bit for me?

135
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,870
All right, one more.

136
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,440
Great. All set.
Yeah.

137
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,660
How many days till I know?

138
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,806
Uh, well, it's a rapid test,

139
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,270
so about 30 minutes
for your results.

140
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,766
Oh, wow. I won't be late
for my shift, then.

141
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,750
Thank you so much.

142
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,660
You're very welcome.
Thank you.

143
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,970
I wouldn't be the surgeon I am
without you, Meredith.

144
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,590
You taught me to push myself,
to innovate,

145
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,940
to see what's possible,
and to trust my instinct.

146
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,770
And right now, that's telling me
to change to OB.

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,730
Go with God?

148
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,210
Meredith wouldn't say that.

149
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,730
I have literally never known
what Dr. Grey is gonna say.

150
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,340
Ooh! Why don't you be me
and I be her?

151
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,950
Oh, how about you be you andher

152
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,106
so that I can get back
to the testing tent?

153
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,820
She's my mentor!

154
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,716
I don't want to disappoint her
or Bailey or Dr. Webber.

155
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,780
This is stressful.

156
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,180
Well, so is
pissing off Dr. Avery.

157
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,180
Oh, crap... trauma.

158
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,960
I gotta go.

159
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,220
I had to go first!

160
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,400
- Dr. Goldberg to the ICU.
- Dr. Goldberg to the ICU.

161
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,530
Arthur Beaton, 14 months...

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,970
Hold up, Khan.

163
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,970
Chris, did you want
to wait for Hollie?

164
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,150
Or I can set you up with
a video-chat on a tablet?

165
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,150
No. Thank you.

166
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,890
It's... not a good time.

167
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,460
She has work, so...

168
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,630
go ahead.

169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,850
Arthur Beaton, 14 months,

170
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,510
diagnosed with multiple VSDs,

171
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,160
cardiomyopathy,
and heart failure.

172
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,340
He's currently on
day 12 of ECMO,

173
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,730
waiting for a transplant,
status 1A.

174
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,950
We thought this would only be
for a few days.

175
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,690
Do a lot of kids with his
condition stay on it this long?

176
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,430
It's unusual.

177
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,430
It means he's strong.

178
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,570
He's already held his own
through several procedures.

179
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,490
None of which have fixed
the holes in his heart.

180
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,090
We're hoping he can hang on
a little bit longer,

181
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,140
until a donor heart
comes through.

182
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,060
I'll be back to you
in a couple of hours, okay?

183
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,450
Chief.
Welcome back.

184
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,150
Mm.

185
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,996
So, uh, this is the car
that got stuck in a truck?

186
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,590
Yep, ran right up
the loading ramp.

187
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,006
They had to cut openthe side of the van.Mm.

188
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,590
Newlyweds, I heard.

189
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,420
Hell of a honeymoon.

190
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,640
Huh.

191
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,210
Shayne Riley, 45.

192
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,170
Unstable pelvis
and lower abdominal pains

193
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,250
after sustaining crush injuries
in an MVC.

194
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,560
Initially unresponsive,
but now alert and orientated

195
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,220
after saline boluses.

196
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,830
Shayne, you are
in good hands now,

197
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,976
and I'm not just saying that

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,740
because Dr. Bailey here
is my wife.

199
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,480
But you are looking
really good, Chief.

200
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,050
All right, this is
Karissa Skolaski, 42.

201
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,840
Vital signs stable,
A and O times three.

202
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,010
Minor lacerations to the face,
arms, and legs.

203
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,010
Patient complains of headache.

204
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,750
Let's take her to trauma one.

205
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,540
Shayne?!
W-Where's my husband?!

206
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,686
He's right over there, ma'am.
He's being taken care of.

207
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,500
Oh, Shayne, I'm sorry, babe!

208
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,800
I didn't mean it!

209
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,940
Wait, can he hear me?

210
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,550
Uh, he's heavily sedated, ma'am.

211
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,900
I can hear her just fine.
I'm just not talking to her.

212
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,550
Ever again.

213
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,290
Improving ground glass
opacities,

214
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,690
no pleural effusion
or pneumothorax,

215
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,430
and no signs of stroke
on head CT.

216
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,040
This is great news.

217
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,260
It's not great news?

218
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,480
Great news doesn't matter

219
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,870
if she's too weak to stay awake.

220

221
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,020
Karissa, you can't get up. We're
waiting on neuro to see you.

222
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,020
Okay? Just squeeze. I'm fine, I'm fine.

223
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,980
But my boyfriend... husband...

224
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,680
uh, he... he hates needles.

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,070
He really hates needles.

226
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,266
He's being worked on
by excellent doctors.

227
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,380
Can you follow my finger?

228
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,566
But can't you put us
in the same room?

229
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,706
I really need to talk to him.

230
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,990
When we were in the accident,

231
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,860
I kinda said a thing,
and I feel terrible.

232
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,836
Well, you're in luck. They pay
me to help people who feel terrible.

233
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,226
Any loss of consciousness?
Dizziness?

234
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,210
I don't think so.

235
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,040
So, what?
You cheated on him?

236
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,040
You stole all his money?
You ran over grandma?

237
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,846
Okay, CT's calling for her.
Do you want to come?

238
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,196
Please and thank you.
Squeeze my hands, please.

239
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,570
I told the paramedics
to save me first.

240
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,180
Over him, my husband.

241
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,700
Yikes. Well, maybe you can
blame that on a brain bleed.

242
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,620
Can you please tell him
I'm okay?

243
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,840
Yeah.
Let's go.

244
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,580
You know what else she said?

245
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,670
That except for her, no one
would miss me if I died.

246
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,500
She thinks I'm a loner
and no one cares about me.

247
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,280
A lot of people panic
on their wedding day.

248
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,630
I know I did.

249
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,110
Dr. Hunt knows that...

250
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,940
Does this hurt?

251
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,460
Ow! Yeah.

252
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,120
Don't people normally panic
beforesaying "I do"?

253
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,950
We'd already been married
four hours.

254
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,210
I'm not sure,
but your scan does show

255
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,796
that you have an open-book
pelvic fracture.

256
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,390
We're gonna have to do a CT
to make sure

257
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,000
there's no other
abdominal injuries,

258
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,690
but you willneeda surgery, okay?

259
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,870
Shayne, we're takingKarissa to CT,

260
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,960
but she is stableand she's feeling okay.

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,270
Let me guess...
she asked to go first.

262
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,270
No, she's very worriedabout you.

263
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,050
Good.
Don't tell her how I am.

264
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,336
She doesn't get to know
anything.

265
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,400
Let's go.

266
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,190
I'm just gonna
not tell her anything?

267
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,410
She's terrified.

268
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,450
You know the rules.

269
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,070
It's not just me, right?

270
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,550
This is weird.

271
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,370
Super weird.

272
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,600
It's like we won
the lottery of silence.

273
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,250
Where do we even start?

274
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,340
By getting naked?

275
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,950
Okay.

276
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,730
Loving that.

277
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,090
Whoa, Amelia.

278
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,650
I don't think you're grasping

279
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,520
the extentof our freedom here.

280
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,350
There are no baby monitors.

281
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,716
There are nohomework assignments,

282
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,350
no one's... no one's hungry.

283
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,750
I'm a little hungry.

284
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,840
Then let's have sex
in the kitchen.

285
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,230
We can do whatever we want.

286
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,450
You realize that?

287
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,020
We can... We can be loud.

288
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, do you rememberbeing able to be loud?

289
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,280
What's wrong?

290
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,470
Okay.

291
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,290
All right. Amelia...

292
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,470
look at me.

293
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,520
Oh, my, God. No, no!

294
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,130
No?
Get up, get up!

295
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,700
I-I-I thought you were
cryingbecause my mom and Zola...

296
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,700
No, I'm not!

297
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,050
I'm... I'm not, just...

298
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,090
I just really need
to be crying right now!

299
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,270
Okay.

300
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,580
Marcel tested positive.

301
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,150
He needs to be home, isolating.

302
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,086
I told him that, but apparently,
he lives with his family...

303
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,150
six people ina two-bedroom apartment,

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,770
including his grandpa.

305
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,550
He doesn't want
to get them sick.

306
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,940
Can't we just admit him?

307
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,860
Get him some care and a place...

308
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,046
This is not a hotel, Schmitt.

309
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,820
He can't afford to stay
anywhere else.

310
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,820
Okay.
Book him a hotel room.

311
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,220
On you?
Are you sure?

312
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,260
It's a matter
of public health, okay?

313
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,790
Anybody needs a room...
just book them a hotel.

314
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,010
No questions.

315
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,620
We got you a hotel.

316
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,280
Dr. Feldman
to the Step Down Unit.

317
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,190
Dr. Feldman
to the Step Down Unit.

318
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,590
Chris?

319
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,150
I had to
get out of there for a minute.

320
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,590
I understand.

321
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,176
You want to get outside,
get some fresh air?

322
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,590
Or there's a chapel.

323
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,460
So I can pray for
someone else's kid to die?

324
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,080
I lied earlier.

325
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,520
Hollie wasn't on a work call.

326
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,000
She hasn't signed on to work
in weeks.

327
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,780
I don't know if
it's postpartum depression

328
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,180
or Arthur or the world...

329
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,960
Listen, it's...

330
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,180
it's been a terrible
ordealfor the pair of you.

331
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,530
She's so depressed,
she can't get out of bed.

332
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,710
When COVID hit,

333
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,060
seeing people lose
whole families in a week...

334
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,710
we knew we had to be careful

335
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,060
'cause of Arthur's
heart condition.

336
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,890
And we were.

337
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,290
And in the end,
it didn't matter.

338
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,380
I'm still losing them.

339
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,070
The only thing keeping me goingright now

340
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,470
is the hope for a miracle.

341
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,730
Arthur gets a heart,

342
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,690
Hollie comes back to life...

343
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,780
and we a family again.

344
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,000
And I know we can't have
our miracle

345
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
unless someone else
loses theirs.

346
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,000
Lives what I'm living right now.

347
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,130
Gets shattered.

348
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,750
And I pray for it anyway.

349
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,360
'Cause Arthur...

350
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,620
He's your son.

351
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,800
I can't lose him,
Dr. Hayes.

352
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,060
We can't lose him.

353
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,280
Please.

354
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,340
How's she looking?

355
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,510
Squirmy.

356
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,470
Karissa... Did I hear Dr. Wilson?

357
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,690
Is Shayne okay?

358
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,260
Uh...

359
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,040
Sorry, Karissa. Um,
patient confidentiality.

360
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,650
Confidentiality?

361
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,650
From his wife?

362
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,440
Wait.

363
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,220
Did he ask you not to tell me?

364
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,620
That is also confidential.

365
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,400
He's still mad.

366
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,840
My sisters said we were crazy
for moving so quickly.

367
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,410
They said three months is not
enough time to get to know

368
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,800
someone you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

369
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,540
Well, neither issix years.

370
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,150
Scans are up.

371
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,330
Karissa, you have a very small
contusion on your brain.

372
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,940
It's benign
with a very minor bleed,

373
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,836
so minor I don't think we can
blame it for anything.

374
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,510
Sorry.

375
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,680
But we do have to keep you
overnight for observation.

376
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,510
I was wrong.

377
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,690
I was wrong that
no one would miss him.

378
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,910
Because
it's only been a few hours,

379
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,870
and I miss him so much
I could burst.

380
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,790
Hi.

381
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,140
Got your page.
What's up?

382
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,010
Can you think of
a salvage procedure we can do

383
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,970
on a 14-month-old
with multiple VSDs?

384
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,410
Another one?

385
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,190
We just did one two weeks ago.

386
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,410
It's the same boy.
Arthur Beaton.

387
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,410
The one we put on ECMO?

388
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,810
He's hanging on.

389
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,850
What about a double pump EXCOR?

390
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,070
You know, an artificial heart

391
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,226
that can take over
for the ventricles...

392
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,860
No, I know what it is.
Uh...

393
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,160
Arthur's chest cavity
is too small.

394
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,560
The cannulas would push up
against his vital organs.

395
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,950
We'd have to leave him open

396
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,390
and leave him on a vent.

397
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,780
He's been on ECMO for 12 days.

398
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,560
I don't think
he has the strength

399
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,960
to withstand a transplant,

400
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,830
and that's even if
we could find a donor.

401
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,050
So, then, what do you suggest?

402
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,750
I think you should have
a very difficult conversation

403
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,790
with his parents.
It's time.

404
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,986
Aren't you supposed to be some
sort of genius or something?

405
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,800
Youngest cardio chief
in the country?

406
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,970
More innovative and published
than any of her peers?

407
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,450
So what?
You're just gonna give up?

408
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,280
We have been at this for months.

409
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,460
We have done everything we canfor that boy.

410
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,460
At this point,
we're just prolonging his pain,

411
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,240
and his family's.

412
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,850
It's not giving up.

413
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,640
It's letting them go on.

414
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,830
I think it just hit me
that it's been months

415
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,416
since I've been able to feel
whatever I want

416
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,190
without worrying that I will
permanently scar a child.

417
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,010
I mean, the constant pressure

418
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,630
of not ruining a life
is exhausting.

419
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,280
Are you mad

420
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,890
that I shouted no
and made you get up?

421
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,500
No, I'm not mad at you.

422
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,510
I'm mad at my mom
for bringing it up.

423
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,200
Are you... wanting
to get married?

424
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,340
After you shouted no
and made me get up?

425
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,160
No, not so much.

426
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,430
I meant, "No,
you're misreading the moment,"

427
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,390
not, "No, I don't want
to marry you."

428
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,040
So you do want to marry me?

429
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,830
I wasn't saying
I want to marry you, or...

430
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,090
or I don't want to marry you.

431
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,310
I, um... haven't
thought about it.

432
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,920
I haven't had time.
Yeah.

433
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,530
I haven't had time either,

434
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,710
but I've still thought about it.

435
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,100
What have you thought?

436
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,540
I love you, and I love Scout,

437
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,110
and I love us together, and...

438
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,980
you know, marriage
is, uh, I guess

439
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,200
kinda how society
locks it all in...

440
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,720
Eh, but it doesn't lock it in.

441
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,940
It doesn't lock it in!
Mnh.

442
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,266
And your parents' divorce
was hell.

443
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,860
It was hell!

444
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,446
And I-I swore that I'd never
put a kid through that.

445
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,430
Mm-hmm.

446
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,910
So...

447
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,780
I know that your mom
has big ideas,

448
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,090
and Zola has big
wedding-dress dreams,

449
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,390
but, um...

450
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,660
have you really
changed your mind?

451
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,140
I was a terrible wife.

452
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,140
You had a brain tumor.
I did.

453
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,580
But I'm not sure that

454
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,336
the sexy brain tumor
can take all the credit.

455
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,710
I still think I'm wired
for self-destruction.

456
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,070
Why do you think that?

457
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,330
Because, every day,

458
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,940
for a lot of days now,

459
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,550
I go to sleep thinking about
getting high,

460
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,510
and I wake up thinking about
getting high,

461
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,860
and sometimes, in the middle
of feeding Scout,

462
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,080
I zone out...

463
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,170
and think about getting high.

464
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,880
...and he won't let me
tell his wife anything.

465
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,840
It's their wedding day,
and he's already over her,

466
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,630
which is just...
it's just sad and messy and...

467
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,410
And it's not that
I am sick of adults.

468
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,240
Okay, I'm a little...
I'm a little sick of adults.

469
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,810
Adults are always here
on the worst day of their lives,

470
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,210
and I am so sick of worst days.

471
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,170
And people being terrified of me
because I'm cutting them open.

472
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,730
But with moms,
they want you here,

473
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,520
even though it's scary
sometimes,

474
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,170
because you being there

475
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,350
means that they're getting
to meet their baby,

476
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,740
their dream,

477
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,400
and they can't do it
without my help.

478
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,360
And since, uh...

479
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,970
Since Alex left, um...

480
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,760
my house hasn't been
my happiest place.

481
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,450
So...

482
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,940
I want work to be.

483
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,890
And I think that you get that.

484
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,810
And I am so grateful to you,

485
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,770
because you believed in me
before I believed in myself.

486
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,170
And I will tell you
all of this again

487
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,820
when you're awake.

488
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,350
Please, please be awake soon.

489
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,790
Please be well soon.

490
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,740
We can't take any more
worst days around here.

491
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,970
I've booked 18 hotel rooms.

492
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,856
The manager wondered if
you'd rather book a whole floor.

493
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,410
Well, we got a lot of positives.

494
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,206
Tell him we'll take
all the rooms we can get. Thank you.

495
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,036
I think I've memorized
your credit-card number.

496
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,150
When did hotel stays become
part of the plan?

497
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,940
Well, people need
more than a test,

498
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,890
and quarantining isn't easy
for everybody.

499
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,590
And you realized that today?

500
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,590
Excuse me? You know he's your boss,
right?

501
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,966
I'm sorry. And, technically,
so am I.

502
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,266
I'm sorry. Schmitt,
give us a minute.

503
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,080
Well, don't fire her. Schmitt!

504
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,040
Come here, please.

505
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,820
I assume that wasn't
your real question.

506
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,000
So would you like to tell me
what is going on?

507
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,390
You're booking up hotel rooms.

508
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,390
So is Seattle Partners.

509
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.
I've heard of them.

510
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,140
A group of, uh,
community organizations, right?

511
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,140
Longstanding
community organizations

512
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,320
that have been providing housing
and wrap-around services

513
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,750
for people who test positive
for COVID

514
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,320
in low-income neighborhoods.

515
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,540
Okay. So, the more the better,
so what's the...

516
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,330
Yeah, maybe in theory, but they
can't book their hotel rooms

517
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,980
at their discounted rates

518
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,550
because a local doctor
is booking them at full price!

519
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,330
And hotels are
kicking people out

520
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,900
to make room
for your new arrivals.

521
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,730
I got it.

522
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,486
I apologize.
I didn't... I didn't know that.

523
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,160
Great.

524
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,300
We'll just tell everyone
it wasn't on purpose.

525
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,470
That should keep them
real warm tonight.

526
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,880
Oh, I fell asleep?

527
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,410
I think
it's a defense mechanism.

528
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,230
Noticed you do that.

529
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,630
Do what?

530
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,800
Fall asleep when you are
emotionally overwhelmed.

531
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,240
Some people cry.
Some people talk.

532
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,590
Some people yell.

533
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,030
You... fall asleep.

534
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,330
All right, well, I'm not
avoiding my feelings,

535
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,730
if that's what you're implying.

536
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,340
I just...
I-I process them better

537
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,430
while I'm unconscious.
Mm.

538
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,740
Okay.
Let's figure this out.

539
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,350
There's not much to figure out.

540
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,910
I'm an addict.

541
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,740
You're an addict in recovery.

542
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,740
So, what?
You need to hit up a meeting?

543
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,180
I've talked about it
in meetings.

544
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,790
A lot of us have.

545
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,920
This pandemic feels like
Satan has designed

546
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,360
the perfect set of circumstances

547
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,970
to make sobriety seem
impossible.

548
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,970
Isolation, fear, futility,

549
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,370
anger, hopelessness.

550
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,110
I mean, name a trigger,

551
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,980
it is stronger.

552
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,566
For the record,
I don't believe in Satan.

553
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm just saying
it feels like that.

554
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,160
Also, what's weird is
I'm not even craving pills.

555
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,420
I'm just...

556
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,056
I just want to, like,
drive to a dispensary

557
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,600
and buy some weed and smoke it.

558
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,040
Well, is that allowed?

559
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,470
To, um... To smoke weed

560
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,496
if that wasn't the thing
that you were addicted to?

561
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,610
Well, there's no such thing as
"allowed" in my program.

562
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,390
There are just suggestions.

563
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,790
And, no, it is not suggested.

564
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,230
Why not?
Because...

565
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,840
if I smoked weed,

566
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,670
it is very likely that I would
forget to not do heroin.

567
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,670
Well...

568
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,930
for the record...

569
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,630
I would marry you
in a hot minute.

570
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,110
Why?

571
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,290
Because most drug addicts
who crave drugs

572
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,250
just do drugs.

573
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,900
But you don't.

574
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,690
That makes you stronger
than most people.

575
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,910
And cooler.

576
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,090
And the opposite
of self-destructive.

577
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,480
So...

578
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,260
All right, Amelia...

579
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,750
Oh, my God. No, no.

580
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,750
Oh, my God!
Get up!

581
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,180
Got it.

582
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,100
Like, not ever or not today?

583
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,450
Just...

584
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,320
not when I'm confessing
my darkest secrets

585
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,320
and I have snot
rolling down my face.

586
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,460
Okay.

587
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,980
Is Luna okay?

588
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,370
Yeah, she's fine.

589
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,070
I just needed to see
a friendly face.

590
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,900
I'm about to ask a father

591
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,070
about taking his baby
off life support.

592
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,290
Oh, my God.

593
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,470
She's the best.

594
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,860
Doesn't judge.

595
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,690
Isn't selfish.

596
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,650
Isn't bitter or resentful about
the cards she's been dealt.

597
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,480
Oh, I hope she doesn't.

598
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,700
Become bitter or resentful.

599
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,490
I mean, I wouldn't blame her
if she did.

600
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,880
I spent a lot of my life
being angry

601
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,270
about the way that
I came into the world.

602
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,270
Took me a long time to realize

603
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,100
that that anger didn't serve me.

604
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,450
And the more I let it go,
the better off I'd be.

605
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,370
Letting it go was like...

606
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,500
breaking off the crusty
black pieces of my heart.

607
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,850
It hurt at first,
but with time, it just...

608
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,030
Oh, wow.
Wilson...

609
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,290
What?

610
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,640
Thank you!

611
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,130
The Cooper ligament is
completely destroyed.

612
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,690
Yeah, I think Stoppa
technique'sour best bet. Agreed.

613
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,520
Uh, pick-ups?

614
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,260
What a wedding day.

615
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,660
Started with his bride
calling him a loser.

616
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,360
Can't imagine much worse.

617
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,920
Not... that I...

618
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,750
How are the kids?

619
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,140
If you ask me, he's lucky.

620
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,540
How so?

621
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,736
Well, he found out the truth
on day one

622
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,540
instead of 20 years from now.

623
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,930
No house, no kids.
Lucky.

624
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,370
Mayo scissors, please.

625
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,150
And how is Altman?

626
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,550
She'll be back in a couple days.

627
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,160
That's not why I'm asking.

628
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,380
Respectfully, Chief,

629
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,810
the OR has heard enough
about my personal life, okay?

630
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,210
Mesh.

631
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,470
Thank you.

632
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,250
Hayes, you paged again?

633
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,730
You said there's
not enough space

634
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,560
for a total artificial heart.

635
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,910
You paged me 911 after
I told you it was impossible?

636
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,090
His chest cavity
is too small. I know.

637
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,090
Too small because his heart's
taking up space.

638
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,700
But what if we made space?

639
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,490
Sure, let's just
take out his heart.

640
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,530
Don't be ridiculous.

641
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,320
We'll leave some of it behind.

642
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,030
You want to cut out
part of his heart?

643
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,460
The lower part, the ventricles,

644
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,030
which are not functioning
properly.

645
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,250
So the answer is yes...

646
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,600
you want to cut out
part of his heart.

647
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,860
To create space for
a total artificial heart pump

648
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,430
to act in place of
what we removed.

649
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,040
Have you done this before?

650
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,650
'Cause it sounds like
you haven't done it before.

651
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,050
We have used the device
on older children.

652
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,480
But in those cases,

653
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,660
we did not have to remove
both ventricles.

654
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,700
So you could do this
and it doesn't... work?

655
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,620
Why would you even suggest...

656
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,686
'Cause Arthur's chances of
survival are exactly the same

657
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,760
as if we did absolutely nothing.

658
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,890
I know this sounds insane.

659
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,280
But we are running out
of options,

660
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,670
and Arthur is almost
out of time.

661
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,680
You asked me
to save your son, yes?

662
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,030
I am telling you,
this is his best chance.

663
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,550
I need to call Hollie.

664
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,120
She'll want to see him before...

665
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,690
Just in case.

666
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,080
Of course.

667
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,976
Your surgery went better
than we could have hoped.

668
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,220
Yep.

669
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,466
You may have
a couple months' rehab,

670
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,620
but everything looks good.

671
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,880
Months of rehab,
alone in an apartment

672
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,320
during a pandemic.

673
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,890
Oh, so that's it?

674
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,500
It's been, what, 12 hours,

675
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,890
and you're jumping ship?

676
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,346
Bailey, maybe we should
just let them...

677
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,680
Shayne, my parents were together
for over 60 years.

678
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,550
Look, after my mom passed,

679
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,070
my dad and I were going through
their old photos,

680
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,510
I-looking for something
that we could post

681
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,510
with her obituary.

682
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,950
60 years...

683
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,740
is a lot of hairstyles
and fashion trends.

684
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,690
And finally, my dad told me
that I should just pick,

685
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,220
because when he looked at them,

686
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,830
all he saw was the woman
he fell in love with.

687
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,100
She was still
the same caring, nurturing,

688
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,660
kind-hearted person
she was the day they met.

689
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,320
Look, people are who they are.

690
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,150
Karissa said some things

691
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,720
while you were trapped in a car
and she was terrified.

692
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,550
My guess is...

693
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,770
she's still the same person
she was when you met.

694
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,420
You might want to give her
a chance to prove that

695
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,690
before you just
throw it all away.

696
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,130
Is there any way I can see her?

697
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,260
I'll get you a tablet.

698
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,020
I just got off
with Kelly Bernard,

699
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,530
who runs Seattle Partners.

700
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,050
No one is losing their bed,
nobody's losing a room.

701
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,856
She's gonna point me
in the direction of hotels

702
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,060
so I can sponsor patient rooms

703
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,840
without getting
in anybody's way.

704
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh, come on.

705
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,916
Do you have a problem with
all your attendings or just me?

706
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,850
'Cause I'm trying
to make this right.

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,200
I know you are.

708
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,160
It's just, this whole situation
pisses me off.

709
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,770
And, what, that's my fault? No.

710
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,770
No.
It's the whole system.

711
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,600
It's not designed to help the
people that actually need it.

712
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,170
Especially when
they look like us.

713
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,780
Right.
That's why I'm trying to help.

714
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,170
When I was a social worker,
I saw a lot of temporary fixes

715
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,000
that came from a good place.

716
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,790
But they never get to the root
of the problems.

717
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,960
Hotel rooms are great
for quarantine.

718
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,790
But then people have to go back

719
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,140
to risky jobs
and overcrowded homes.

720

I know you're trying to help.

721

830
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,420
I... I just have a huge problem
keeping my opinions to myself,

especially when it comes to
underserved communities, so...

832
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,130
Well, sounds like
that makes two of us.

833
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,870
I want to help people...

834
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,130
especially those
who've been ignored

835
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,090
and shut out of the system
for far too long.

ideas from your last career.

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,270
I'd like to hear them.
All of them.

838

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,490
You have a deep understanding.

840
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,880
I have deep pockets
and a desire to help.

841
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,710
So, Dr. Ortiz,

842
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,710
if you had the power
to effect real change...

843
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,200
...where would you start?

844
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,940
Okay.

845
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,250
Well, access
to affordable healthy food

846
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,990
is a huge problem
in low-income neighborhoods.

847
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,600
Okay.

848
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,430
The car was closing in.

849
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,430
I had no idea what I was saying.

850
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,950
I just... I, uh...

851
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,456
I was so worried about
you the whole way here

852
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,090
and then once we got here.

853
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,870
Do you know what that was like for me?

854
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,350
I'm sure it was, um...

855
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,246
They wouldn't even tell
me if you were dead or alive.

856
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,660
Please, promise me

857
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,986
you will never put me through that again.

858
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,750
I won't.

859
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,580
Thank God,
because that was hell.

860
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,800
I want an annulment.

861
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,150
I'm sorry.
What's happening? What?

862
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,450
You were right.

863
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,166
I-I didn't say anything
about an annulment.

864
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,760
Shayne, what the hell?

865
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,940
You said people don't change,
and you were right.

866
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,330
She hasn't changed.

867
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,980
Today wasn't any different
than any other day.

868
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,900
I just found her self-absorption
charming on every other day,

869
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,680
like I was drunk on
her sense of humor.

870
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,120
'Cause she's funny, too.

871
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,510
And I was lonely.

872
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,730
And then I was laughing,
and I wasn't lonely,

873
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,690
and so I thought I could
overlook, basically,

874
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,300
the rest of her personality.

875
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,480
Okay, then maybe we should
do this later. The...

876
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,090
No, I want to do it now,

877
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,830
and then I want to be
done with it.

878
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,400
You're selfish, Karissa.

879
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,050
And you were
the same person today

880
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,400
that you were the day we met,
the same person who ate

881
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,490
all the trail mix
I'd packed for our hike

882
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,360
without offering me
so much as a peanut.

883
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,320
You're dumping me over a peanut?

884
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,540
It's an example.
One of many.

885
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,850
You're the center
of your own universe,

886
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,200
and I'd rather be alone
than with someone

887
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,590
who isn't capable of
considering anyone but herself.

888
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,510
Well, now I feel terrible.

889
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,290
I'm sure it won't last long.

890
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,900
Thank you.
Mnh.

891

892

And he's... bionic.

903

Just for a little while, Hollie.

904

we'll remove the machine.
