00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,232

94
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,234

That's a fake video background

95

That's not the point. Look.

96
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:42,351
You want her
to change the background?

97
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:45,053
I want you to get your wife
to wear a damn mask, okay?

98
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,598
She's in a germ-collecting car
with her driver with no mask.

99
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:48,975
She wears masks.

100
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,478
On her chin, okay,

101
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,273
or dangling from her ear
like a weird piece of jewelry.

102
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,027
She is living with cancer.
She is immunocompromised.

103
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,600
I got to get to surgery.

104
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,515
Just get her to wear the stupid
mask correctly, please.

105
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,850
Well, you know
what it's like

106
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:02,311
to get your mother

107
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,940

Val Ashton,
status post right hepatectomy

109
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:12,263
with segments 5 through 8

110
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:14,266
due to bleeding
from hepatic pregnancy.

111
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,564
Her drains were pulled
two days ago,

112
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,389
but this morning
she's tachy to 120,

113
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:18,577
her BP has decreased,

114
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,936
and transaminases and bili
are both trending upwards.

115
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:23,020
She's kind, giving, successful,

116
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,085
enjoys

117

Without shame.

118
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:29,053
I need compliments,
too, guys.

119
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:31,085
I'm glad that you're
in good spirits, Val,

120
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,589
but, um, your labs
are concerning.

121
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,050
I'm ordering a CT.

122
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:38,319
I carried a baby
in my liver.

123
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:42,366
Can't you make an exception for
moms and babies who defy odds?

124
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:45,006
I-I'm sick of video chats.

125
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:48,302
Luna's gonna think
her mom's a pixelated blob.

126
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,807
Technically, that's what
you'd look like even in person.

127
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,633
Babies can only see
about six inches in front...

128
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,593
Schmitt! Not the point.

129
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,539
Val, I know that it's not
what you wanted to hear,

130
00:04:57,624 --> 00:05:00,812
but Luna's on a vent, and
moving her is very precarious.

131
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:03,165
Plus, we... we need to make sure
that you're taken care of

132
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,453
before you meet her.

133
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,748
For Luna's sake
and for yours.

134
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,202
Okay?

135
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,506
Do we know if he's okay?

136
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,273
Not sure. This is him.

137
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:17,234
You're not listening...

138
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,954
I have to be at home.
I don't want to miss it...

139
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:20,085
Oh, my God.

140
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,524
Okay, we have a COVID-positive male,

141
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,804
heart rate 123, BP 90 over 60.

142
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,093
Pulse ox of 92 on 100%,
high flow.

143
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:28,023
He's incoherent
and disoriented.

144
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,046
I just saw him
two days ago. He was fine.

145
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,085
Is this a stroke?

146
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,281
Could be. Or encephalitis
brought on by COVID.

147
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,493
I have tickets to Opening Day,

148
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,062
and David's dying
to catch a fly ball.

149
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,565
- Who's David?
- His son.

150
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,693
Let's get him
to a COVID room now.

151
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,789
Hang on. He's seizing.

152
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,455
Let's get him on his side.

158
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,828
No signs of head trauma,
but, Helm, call up to CT,

159
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:56,158
let them know we'll be
upas soon as possible.

160
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:57,805
We'll do it. Helm, out.

161
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,194
But I've already had COVID...

162
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:00,445
Doesn't matter.
You're a resident,

163
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,489
and he's positive.
Out. Now.

164
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,085
Get off me. Stay back.

165
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,718
Tom. Tom, it's me.
It's Teddy. Try to stay calm.

166
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,266
I... Don't...
Don't touch me.

167
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:09,939
Tom? - Take it easy. We're just trying
to take care of you.

168
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:11,681
- Push two of Ativan.
- No, I don't... I don't know you.

169
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,399
- I don't know you!
- He's post-ictal.

170
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:16,764
- No, I don't... I don't know you. - Just
wait a minute, and the meds will kick in.

171
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:19,715
Teddy, I got this, okay?

172
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,425
Please, call up to CT.

173
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,630
Okay.

174
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,851
Hey, Angel.

175
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,797
I'd be there with you,
but the mean doctors say no.

176
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,564
Can you say "mean"?

177
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:39,500
Can you hold the phone
closeenough for me to smell her head?

178
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,431
How about I bring you
one of her blankets?

179
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:44,250
Ah! I will literally
marry you.

180
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,804
Val.

181
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:49,032
Crap.
That is your bad-news face.

182
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,305
Your CT showed
that you have an abscess

183
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,632
that's eroding into an artery
in your liver,

184
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,352
causing what's called
a pseudoaneurysm.

185
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:58,563
Okay.

186
00:06:58,648 --> 00:06:59,955
It's a weakening
of the blood vessel,

187
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,368
which is causing it
to leak.

188
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,533
We need to take you to surgery
right away to repair it.

189
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:06,546
I am so sorry
that it's not better news.

190
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,307
Leave.

191
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,445
Eight years.

192
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,640
I've wanted to be a mom
for eight years.

193
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,490
I've known my baby's name.

194
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:29,201
I've known the color
I would paint the nursery.

195
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:33,288
I've known the made-up lullaby
I would sing at night.

196
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:36,208
And now that I finally
have the chance...

197
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:38,210
being a mom
is just some weird TV show

198
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,671
I'm watching on my phone,

199
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,548
and I don't know
if it will ever be real.

200
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:49,585
Please make it real.

201
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:53,672
Have you heard about Koracick?

202
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:56,290
Yes. He's
gettingthe world's best care,

203
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,768
and I'm trying
not to think about it.

204
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,979
So, can you wait that
longfor the converted rooms?

205
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,882
Is sooner an option?

206
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,858
See, even with the lockdown,
we are getting slammed.

207
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,361
We got six cases today from
assisted-living facilities,

208
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,154
- three from the same one.
- <i>I'll go check.</i>

209
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,907
- Oh, which one?
- Silver Villas in Ballard.

210
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,159
COVID spreads through
those places like wildfire.

211
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,382
Where are you going?!

212
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:16,850
Uh, that's where
my parents are.

213
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,210
<i>Next.</i>

214
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,960
- A rescue mission?
- Yes.

215
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,251
Just stop what you're doing
and get to Silver Villas.

216
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,627
To grab your mom and dad?

217
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,962
I've been trying
to call the front office,

218
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,213
but they're not answering.

219
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,256
Well, where do you want me
to take them?

220
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,715
Uh, to my hotel.

221
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,717
Y... Uh, I don't care.
Just get them out.

222
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,484
Yeah, I'm on it.
I love you.

223
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,570
- JOkay, lap pads...
- Here you go.

224
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:44,328
Khan was an attending
in Pakistan.

225
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,940
We could probably
be assisting him.

226
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,351
Not gonna happen.

227
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:49,657
No, I know. I just...
Making a point.

228
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:50,737
Suction.

229
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,344
You were a vascular
surgeon, right?

230
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:53,226
Yes, Dr. Schmitt,

231
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,017
one of the first to be certified
in my country.

232
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,285
Why would you leave?

233
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,578
Okay, Kelly clamp.

234
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,343
Uh, it wasn't exactly
a choice.

235
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,281
I love my home,
it shaped me.

236
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:03,540
Still nice not to worry
about religious persecution

237
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,281
or bombings.

238
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,432
- So I just started over.
- Clamp.

239
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,991
Just?
It's a five-year residency.

240
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:10,843
If I finished this
and had to start over...

241
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:13,301
Ugh. Pass.
Can you imagine?

242
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,970
Can you imagine payingmore
attention to the field

243
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,304
so the patient
doesn't die?

244
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,681
Damn it.
Her tissue's so friable

245
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,515
it's just disintegrating
into my hands.

246
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,269
- We got to get control of...
- I know what we need to do!

247
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,671
Everyone shift. We're doing
a modified pringle maneuver.

248
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:25,882
Clamp.

249
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,932
Okay, thank you.

250
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:34,757
Hey. Your phone has been
ringinglike crazy.

251
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:35,926
Oh.

252
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:41,324
Oh, wow. Okay.

253
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,188
Uh, okay.
Let's just, uh...

254
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,774
- tried to call you.
- Ben, how did it...

255
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,874
I picked up your mom,
and she's sick. - Wait, slow down. I ca...

256
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,531
- We're at the hospital.
- Now?!

257
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,701
Right now.

258
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,601
Mom!

259
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,414
Mom?

260
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,875
Hey, it's me.

261
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,570
I'm here.

262
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:08,976
- William?
- Alright, okay.

263
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,250
Where...
Where... Where's William?

264
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,978
Mom, you're in
the hospital.

265
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:14,064
We're gonna
take care of you.

266
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,607
He's gonna
be here soon, right?

267
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:18,109
Okay. Yes, yes.
He's coming soon.

268
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,969
Okay?
Just lay back and relax.

269
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,806
I can't wear this.
I got to get my clothes.

270
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,164
Where my clothes?

271
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:26,284
Okay.
She seems really agitated.

272
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:27,815
Are there any meds
we can give her to calm her?

273
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,246
I can order some meds?

274
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:35,665

What do you see, Shepherd?

287
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,694
Uh, I see a lesion
on his thalamus,

288
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,701
but it's small,
so that's something.

289
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,829
Have you been able to talk
to him since the seizure?

290
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,889
He was post-ictal,
and they gave him lorazepam,

291
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:31,600
so he wasn't really coherent.

292
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:34,248
Okay. I'm coming in.

293
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,730
Are... Are you sure? I mean, do
you want me to call Dr. Mehta?

294
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:38,481
It's Tom. I'm coming.

295
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,803
Thank you.

296
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:43,819
Uh, Ellis decided she didn't
want her mac and cheese

297
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,532
after begging me to make it,
so if you're hungry...

298
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,334
What's going on?

299
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,088
It looks like Tom is having some
neuro complications from COVID.

300
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,841
I thought he was asymptomatic. Yeah,
so did I.

301
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,513
I just pumped, so there is milk
in the fridge for Scout.

302
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:59,058
Uh, Bailey and Ellis
need a nap.

303
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:01,725
Make sure you check in with Zola
about her homework.

304
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,084
If Scout starts to fuss,
just try the yoga ball.

305
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,717
What am I forgetting?

306
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,303
To breathe.

307
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:09,763
We'll be fine here, okay?

308
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,723
Go. Save your friend.

309
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:14,928
He was my teacher.

310
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,427
And he saved my brain.

311
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:18,764
And, uh, he was my first sex
after Owen,

312
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:20,732
which shouldn't matter,
but it kind of saved me, too,

313
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,045
so I don't want him to die.

314
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:27,796
And I don't want to leave Scout,
and I'm scared of the pandemic.

315
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,740
You had sex with Koracick?

316
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:31,069
What?

317
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:41,251
Hey. Oh, um,
Mr. Anderson's trach in 4722

318
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:42,837
needs to be suctioned, please. I'm on it.

319
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,727
Hey, got your page.
Did you hear anything from Mom?

320
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,813
She's just texting me back
hearts and "Love you, baby"s

321
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,164
like that's gonna
shut me up.

322
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,387
No, I haven't had the time. Richard,
this is not something

323
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,102
that can wait till your schedule
frees up, right?

324
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,021
It's my mom. She's gonna give me
a damn rage stroke.

325
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:57,400
Bailey's mother was just
admitted, COVID-positive.

326
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,992
It's bad.

327
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:01,149
Look, can you fill in for her
at the board meeting today,

328
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,820
take a few of her patients?

329
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:04,740
We'll all pitch in.

330
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:07,184
Yeah, of course.
Whatever she needs.

331
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,797
We took a lot more of
her liver than I was hoping to.

332
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:15,157
Keep an eye
on her liver panel.

333
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,827
The next few hours
will be crucial.

334
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:18,078
You think
she'll need a transplant?

335
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,492
Knowing her luck, probably.

336
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:23,961
But if she needs it,
we can try liver dialysis first.

337
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:26,798
Khan, finish the op notes.
Keep an eye on her.

338
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,516
Dr. Wilson, thank you

339
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,955
for allowing me
to observe your process.

340
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,466
That was amazing.

341
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,070
She could still
need a transplant.

342
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,860
Yes, I understand, but
you resected most of her liver,

343
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,138
and she's still alive.

344
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,682
I mean, do you know
how rare that is?

345
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,289
That... That's unheard of
in so many parts of the world.

346
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:45,265
I know. Op notes.
I'm going.

347
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,940
Was I really amazing,

348
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,547
or is he just
some weird happy person?

349
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:54,164
If you impressed him,
I think amazing's a safe bet.

350
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,758
Glad you got
to operate again.

351
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,767
Her ferritin is 2087.

352
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:08,203
600 is severe in COVID.

353
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,547
Her CRP is 87.

354
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,300
Creatinine's 2.3.

355
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:16,123
W-What about
her oxygen requirements?

356
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,836
<i>♪ Caught swimming in your new sundress

40 liters.

358
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,393
She went into A-fib
an hour ago.

359
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:27,922
We pushed dig,
but so far, no response.

360
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:29,040
<i>♪ Keep living
like the sun don't set ♪</i>

361
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:31,712
Her systolic was in the 80s,
but we pushed a fluid bolus

362
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,781
and got it back up
into the 90s.

363
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:38,679
So she's starting to have
multi-system organ failure

364
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:41,266
in addition
to her cytokine storm.

365
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:43,444
I'm sorry, Bailey.

366
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,438
There is still
more we can do.

367
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:50,133
We can take her to the ICU,
intubate...

368
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:52,594
She didn't want
to be on machines.

369
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,039
Or be kept alive
with medication.

370
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:04,000
I got to call my dad.
Um...

371
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:08,617
I'm here if you need me.

372
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,567
H-How...
How do I tell my dad

373
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:16,070
that the love of his life

374
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,218
won't make it
through the night?

Neuro exam's intact.
No deficits.

377
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,304
He asked for his son.

378
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:41,559
I think the seizure and delirium
are secondary to hypoxemia

379
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:44,841
and inflammation from COVID...
Possible early sepsis.

380
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:46,145
Let's just watch him

381
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,940
and, uh, see how he responds
to treatment.

382
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,151
Okay. Oh, hey, Shepherd.
Didn't realize you were back.

383
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,013
Welcome to... hell.

384
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,755
Just consulting
on Koracick.

385
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,782
Oh, right, 'cause he needs
somebody to cover his service.

386
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,990
On him,
not... uh, not for him.

387
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,035
Sats dropped,
he's got a fever of 103,

388
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,810
and he seized
when they brought him in.

389
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,537
Well, I hate everything.

390
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,674
<i>Dr. Cade to
the ICU. Emma Cade to the ICU.</i>

391
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,379
I was wondering
if you get used to this,

392
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,200
but I'm guessing
that's my answer.

393
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,091
How's the baby?

394
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:15,677
Uh, yeah, uh, well,
he won't let me sleep,

395
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:18,430
but other than that, um, yeah,
I can't wait to get back to him.

396
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:20,390
Leo and Allison
are with Owen's mom.

397
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:21,850
I'm just...
I miss them like crazy,

398
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,240
but with both parents
treating COVID patients,

399
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,243
it just...
It doesn't seem safe.

400
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:27,763
Uh-huh.

401
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,755
So, um, guess you heard
what happened.

402
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,872
Yeah.
And I have feelings.

403
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,905
But I've also done

404
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:38,324
more hurtful and complicated
things in my life

405
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,919
than anyone I've met
outside an NA meeting, so...

406
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:42,466
Some of them to Owen.

407
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:44,646
Owen won't say a word to me

408
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:45,765
that doesn't have to do
with the kids,

409
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:48,668
and everyone
is ignoring me

410
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:51,588
or treating me like
I'm wearing a scarlet letter.

411
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,075
What about Tom?

412
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:55,325
He's hurt, too.

413
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:59,333
Well, um,
I'll keep checking on him.

414
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,935
And, uh, thank you
for getting Mer into the trial.

415
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,187
Oh, yeah, uh, of course.

416
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,935
Hi, Grey.

417
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:13,365
It's me.

418
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,919
I'm gonna say it.

419
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:18,115
I miss you.

420
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,865
When I was a kid,
I had big thoughts.

421
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:33,724
Big feelings.

422
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,561
And I never knew
where to put them.

423
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:41,669
Physically, they ran through
my body like a high-speed train.

424
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,700
And anytime
I felt the train coming,

425
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,997
my mom could see it.

426
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,021
So she took me around the corner
to the park

427
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:55,786
with this strange,
twisted tree.

428
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:58,011
Said it was mytree.

429
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:01,763
And I could scream at it,
hit it, hold it...

430
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:03,942
And it would make
the feelings small enough

431
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:07,903
that they would fit back
inside of my own body again.

432
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,567
So I did.

433
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,751
And it worked.

434
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:18,356
But now I'm an adult,
and tree-hitting is...

435
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,094
frowned upon.

436
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,770
I can be your tree.

437
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,254
My mother has Alzheimer's.

438
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:30,737
I never told you

439
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:34,371
because she's older,

440
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,294
and I didn't want to bring up
any old pain

441
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:40,731
for your or Richard.

442
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,332
But it would be a lie

443
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:46,817
to say
that it hasn't been hard.

444
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,637
Or painful.

445
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:54,301
Even as a doctor
who knows about the disease,

446
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:57,293
I feel like...

447
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,307
I didn't know crap.

448
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:01,879
...like I don't
know anything.

449
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:05,354
It's difficult
to talk about it

450
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,232
with someone
who hasn't been there,

451
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,285
been through it.

452
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:15,543
No one understands
that you are

453
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:19,006
watching
your own mother die...

454
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,676
twice.

455
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:24,723
I'm so sorry, Bailey.

456
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:28,184
I wish you were awake.

457
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,723
Val's still not awake.
LFTs are up slightly.

458
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay. Do another panel
in a few hours.

459
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,450
Absolutely, Dr. Wilson.

460
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:47,145
Okay, has your attitude
always been this good?

461
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,358
My mom used to say every day
above ground is a good day.

462
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,310
Did she get that
from "Scarface"?

463
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:54,575
She did. Still, it's true.

464
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,332
You! You're a doctor, right?

465
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,654
Yeah. Great, follow me.

466
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:05,457
- We're delivering a baby.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

467
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,251
I'm not an OB,
I'm a general surgeon. I don't care.

468
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,128
We have an imminent delivery,

she's been healthy.

to do the most basic
of human reflexes... breathing.

she's not ready to go...

that she wouldn't want to live

but maybe I'm wrong, yeah?

00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:25,105
Maybe she's happy in the world
her mind takes her to.

600
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,888
Now I'm questioning
every choice I made.

00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:29,473
I mean,
s-should I be doing more?

602
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:33,012
Should I move her to the ICU?
Intubate her?

603
00:26:33,097 --> 00:26:35,355
Am I just thinking about
how I feel

604
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,167
instead of what's going on
with her... inside of her mind?

- Do you want my opinion?
- Please.

606
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:46,487

against death at all costs.

608
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:55,434
But truthfully,
with my mom,

609
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,370
it didn't give me
more peace of mind in the end.

610
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,714
It might have done
the opposite.

611
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:07,675
I didn't think so at the time,
but it was the easier choice.

612
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,707
To fall back on
acting like a surgeon

613
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,851
and searching
for all the answers.

614
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:20,331
Bailey, you've given your mom
so much.

615
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,082

616
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,996
and watch you turn into
this incredible surgeon

617

and chief of a hospital.

618
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,878

fall in love.

619
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:32,386

- Twice!

620
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:35,526
And raise a family.

621
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:43,296
Of course you're never going

624
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:53,206
I brought my parents
to Seattle kicking and fighting.

625
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,105

to do

last year.

785
00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:05,670
Yeah, when systemic racism
is the root

786
00:36:05,755 --> 00:36:07,423
of the whole damn thing.
Forget the pre-,

787
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:09,301
it's the existing condition.

788
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:10,821

'Cause it's about sex,
isn't it?

00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,772

Please say yes.

810

all day?

814
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:12,179
What do you mean
you delivered a secret baby?

815
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,710
Happened very quick.
I went to check on Luna,

816
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:17,077
and this nurse said that there
was an imminent delivery,

817
00:37:17,162 --> 00:37:21,358
and the next second,
I was catching a baby.

818
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:26,475
I was literally the first person
in the universe to hold him.

819
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,392
And then I handed him
to his parents,

820
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:31,249
and their faces
were just...

821
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:33,705
No wonder
Val's so depressed.

822
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,343
It's the happiest thing
I've ever seen.

823
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:41,093
It was just so pure and simple
and perfect.

824
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,637
I was buzzing.

825
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,554
But it was a total
random fluke,

826
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,421
and tomorrow, I'll be back
to the same depressing crap.

827
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:50,452
I mean, you did
save Val's life today.

828
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:53,047
You think that's why
Carina DeLuca

829
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:54,734
is always in such a good mood?

830
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:56,546
She's just, you know,
handing out babies,

831
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:58,602
and it shoots her serotonin
level through the roof.

832
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:02,593
Well, yeah, but doesn't she also
have, like, an orgasm hobby?

833
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:05,272
What if I changed?

834
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:06,840
Changed what?

835
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:08,635
Careers. Programs.

836
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,819
Is that insane?

837
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:13,085
Khan did it, and what he did

838
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,006
is so much harder
than switching specialties.

839
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:18,529
He started over
with nothing.

840
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:21,045
And I know... I know
I've put years into surgery,

841
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,404
but if it's not
bringing me any joy,

842
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:28,154
then wouldn't it be insane
to notchange?

843
00:38:28,345 --> 00:38:32,873
I think you eat and then sleep
before you make any major li...

844
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:35,068
Oh, my God.
I sound like my mother.

845
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:37,217
I want to be happy.

846
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:39,631
Everyone's dying.

Meredith's...

848
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:45,359
Tomorrow is not promised.

849
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:46,974
Not in marriage.

850
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,592

00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,740

852
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,756
She's decompensating.

853
00:39:00,364 --> 00:39:01,779
You should go in.

854
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:06,435
She barely knows
who I am.

855
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,623
And I want
to be there for her.

856
00:39:09,774 --> 00:39:13,402
I-I want her husband
to be there for her.

857
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:18,084
She deserves to be surrounded
by love and family.

858
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,037
But Dad's in quarantine.

859
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:25,405
He's high-risk, and I don't
want him to expose anyone.

860
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,511
I don't want him
to be exposed.

861
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:30,545
I know this is not what
you imagined for your mother.

862
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,193
And I'm sorry about that.

863
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:36,185
But she needs you now.

864
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:40,027
It's time.

865
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,042
And if you don't go in,

866

I promise
you will never forgive yourself.
