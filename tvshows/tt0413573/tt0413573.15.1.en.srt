Bailey woke up, and I gave him some milk,

21
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,470
but he undid the cap on the sippie cup,

22

What happened? Is he up again?

No, I'm sorry. You can go back to sleep.

It's nothing.

Can you make coffee?

00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,630
Yeah.

00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,933
Oh, whoa. Mess.

00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,363
Not a dream.

52
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:41,902
Definitely not a dream.

53

April and Matthew

54
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,409
And the rest of us got painfully drunk.

55
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,680
Why do we do that?

56
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,881
Huh?

57

Mm, that's too deep a question

61
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,226
for before I've had my coffee.

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,127
All yours.

63
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:08,929

DeLuca's not asleep.

66
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:14,268
He's just staring like an idiot.

67
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,803
He must be as hungover as I am.

68
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,571
Yeah, I have to call in sick, guys.

69
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:19,073
No. Nobody's calling in sick.

70

It's a beautiful day.
You're gonna get dressed.

71

We're all gonna walk to work.

72
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:23,244

00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,991
Ooh. Yes. Don't mind if I do.

76
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,260
Uh, orange, please.

77
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:42,129
No, no, wait. Pineapple.

78
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:44,465
And extra ice.

79
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,940
Nice. Thank you.

80
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,749
Good morning.

81
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,150
Oh.

82
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:04,852
Thank you, dear.

83
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,854
You were up and out early.

84
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,289
Did you make your AA meeting?

85
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:10,090
Oh, no, um, I... I wanted to...

86
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,159
try and make a dent on these charts,

87
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,367
so I... I'll go tonight.

88
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:15,362
Did you get any sleep at all last night?

89
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:18,032
Thanks to you...

90
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,833
I slept...

91
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,035
...quite...

92
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:22,937
...well.

93
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,106
And I hope to sleep quite well
again tonight, too.

94
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,641
Uh, you get back to your charting.

95
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:30,778
Oh, I'm too distracted now.

96
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,180
Mwah!

97
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:34,915
Mm.

98
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:42,022
Good morning, Dr. Altman!

99
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,892
Oh, and what a gorgeous morning it is.

100
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:46,126
Dr. Bailey, I have to talk to you

101
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,661
about the interim chief position.

102
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:49,396
I... I just... I wanted to see you

103
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,032
and... and... and...
and thank you for the offer.

104
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,168
Oh, you're welcome. It's exciting.

105
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:59,206
Oh! Plus, I just hired a new ortho god.

106
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,343
He was the personal surgeon
to the Seattle Mariners.

107
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:07,548
And... And we are putting
the finishing touches

108
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:11,752
on a state-of-the-art
hyperbaric therapy center.

109
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,088
Oh, we are state-of-the-art.

110
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:16,357
We are a place you want to work.

111
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,325
I know. I know.

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,062
Th... This is not personal, Dr. Bailey.

113
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:25,165
Just... I thought that I was
coming back to town to stay.

114
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,334
I... I thought that I wanted...
but I... I don't.

115
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,037
I... I... I don't want
what I thought I wanted,

116
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:32,539
so I'm... I'm <i>not coming back to town.</i>

117
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:34,775
I can't be your interim chief.

118
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,377
I'm going.

119
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:39,447
Far, far away.

120
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,600
So, you know, just...

121
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,183
Good luck with your...
the stress sabbatical, and...

122
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,285
I hope that I haven't added to it.

123
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,287
The... The stress.

124
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,926
Yeah, I mean, I was just saying
April got married, right?

125
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,429
And I stood there, and I watched,

126
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,231
and it was good.

127
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:59,466
I was good. I was truly happy for her,

128
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,301
and that's a big deal in my life.

129
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:03,137
It's like a turning point, actually.

130
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,739
So, I just... I don't know...
want to pay attention to that.

131
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:07,241
To what?

132
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,542
To whatever's next.

133
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,310
You know? I don't... I don't know.

134
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,913
It's not like I believe in a big sign

135
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:15,249
or a message from above
or something like that.

136
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,985
It's just...

137
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,446
I don't know.

138
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,089
Oh, my God.

139
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:23,757
I kissed Meredith Grey last night.

140
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,292
Oh. Oh, my God.

141
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:26,994
I mean, I just don't get how she was able

142
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:29,630
to make a decision that big that fast.

143
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:31,265
I mean, it takes me
three weeks of research

144
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,267
just to choose a toothbrush.

145
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:34,835
Yeah, well, that's April for you.

146
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,171
I mean, you know,
she did the same thing with me.

147
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,302
Honestly, I don't know.

148
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,507
I feel like maybe that's how faith works.

149
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,843
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's the appeal.

150
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:45,312
You just follow your gut...

151
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:46,954
...and you trust that

152
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,148
there's some hand there

153
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,322
to catch you if you fall

154
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,185
or... or to help you if you get it wrong.

155
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,896
Hey. Hey!

156
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,103

Obviously an open femur fracture.

00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,055
- You saved our lives, man.
- I just grabbed your jacket.

167
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,425
DeLuca, my life almost ended,
and you saved it.

168
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,428
All right? You were gonna
call in sick, for God's sake.

169
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:53,996
If you'd done that, I'd be dead.

170
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,433
<i>Dr. Browning to the CAT lab.</i>

171
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,902
<i>Dr. Browning to the CAT lab.</i>

172
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,340
Ah. Anything good?

173
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:05,712
What?

174
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:07,510
No.

175
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:09,011
Stop smirking at me.

176
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,246
I don't smirk... I smile.

177
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,747
And if you interpret my smile as a smirk,

178
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,416
well, that's just because
you find me mischievous,

179
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,452
and, dare I say, charming.

180
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:18,454
I don't find you anything.

181
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:19,455
I saved your sister's brain,

182
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,490
so at the very least,
you find me talented.

183
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,996
- Let's just leave it at that.
- Ah.

184
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,698
- Hey. Got the elevator.
- Oh. Oh.

185
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:29,765
Oh, hey. Morning.

186
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,468
- Hey.
- Hey, Leo!

187
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:34,003
Don't you look cute in that hat?

188
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,974
Those two back in the saddle?

189
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,098
Unclear.

190
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:42,611
You think they can sense
our sexual tension?

191
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:43,946
Wouldn't I sense it?

192
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,648
Oh, ouch. Delightful.

193
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,118
Oh, crap.

194
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,352
- Teddy.
- Teddy.

195
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,468
- Hi.
- Wait, why are you...

196
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:53,556
- What are you doing here?
- Excuse me. Oh, hi.

197
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,557
- Hi.
- Hey.

198
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:55,758
Bailey offered me a job,

199
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:59,228
- and I was considering it, but...
- We have a head of cardio.

200
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:02,398
Uh, interim chief. She... She
offered me the interim chief job.

201
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:04,633
Oh. There's an interim
chief job? I didn't...

202
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:07,470
Uh, she's wanting a...
a stress sabbatical.

203
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,671
- Oh.
- Who's the blonde?

204
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:09,839
Get your breath out of my ear.

205
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,373
So, are you gonna take it, or...?

206
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:13,542
I am not.

207
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,845
I'm... I'm... I'm leaving, actually.

208
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:20,583
Nice to see you, Amelia,
and, uh, whoever you are.

209
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:22,818
Oh, this is, um, this is Leo.

210
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,487
Yeah.

211
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,554
Goodbye, Owen.

212
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:28,724
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm...

213
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,359
I'm gonna go.

214
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,328
Wow.

215
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,230
She's in Seattle, and she doesn't call?

216
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,332
That's... Wow.

217
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,768
Are you still... hung up on her?

218
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,102
You know what? Don't answer that.

219
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:43,439
I am gonna drop off Leo.
You have a good day.

220
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:44,774
Amelia...

221
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:47,943
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

222
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:50,613
Incoming trauma!

223
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:56,705
- First!
- First!

224
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:59,221
Uh, wrong. <i>I</i> was first.

225
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:00,990
- Second!
- Easy!

226
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:02,525
I don't want you to die out here.

227
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,626
Uh, what's the matter here?

228
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,729
Uh, he was on the floor
in the bathroom screaming.

229
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,063
I think it might be a heart attack.

230
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,932
It's my stomach. It's just my stomach.

231
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,433
Uh, one of you get them checked in.

232
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:12,516
- But the trauma!
- There's a trauma.

233
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,969
Roy, now.

234
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,404
<i>Dr. Pallas to Pediatrics.</i>

235
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,475
- That's not our trauma?
- Oh, just some stomach pain.

236
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,245
Uh, you got this, Hunt?

237
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:26,782
First.

238
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,321
<i>Dr. Lee to the ER. Dr. Lee to the ER.</i>

239
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:34,490
Ow. Ohh.

240
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:35,958
Damn it, ow!

241
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,226
Oh.

242
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,501
Uh, hey, hey. Come here.

243
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:46,769
Who's your head of cardio?

244
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,798
Dr. Maggie Pierce, ma'am.

245
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,673
Are you military?

246
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,341
Yes, ma'am. Air Force.

247
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,011
MVC. Altered at the scene.

248
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,146
Pulse 130.

249
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,314
- BP's holding in the 90s.
- Okay.

250
00:10:58,348 --> 00:10:59,515
There's also an open femur fracture.

251
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:00,950
- Easy.
- Got it.

252
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,284
She's a human bike rack.

253
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:04,620
Bike frame seems to be tamponading
a pretty serious thigh bleed,

254
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:05,688
so we wanted to make sure to get her

255
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:07,656
into a controlled environment
for the extraction.

256
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:08,724
- Yeah.
- We're gonna need ortho.

257
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,860
There's some new hotshot
ortho guy. Let's get him.

258
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,161
Pierce?

259
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:13,362
I got this.

260
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:14,830
She lost consciousness behind the wheel.

261
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:18,300
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

262
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,305
What?

263
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,140
I hear you're looking
for an interim chief,

264
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,509
and I am here to tell you
your search is over.

265
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:30,512
I know what you're thinking...
I'm chief of neuro,

266
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:32,281
and I have my research with Koracick,

267
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,516
and a teenage addict I'm trying to
keep on the straight and narrow.

268
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:35,551
And I have Owen.

269
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,119
Well, I don't <i>have</i> Owen.

270
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:38,621
Owen has Leo, and I have Betty,

271
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,690
and we most certainly
don't have each other.

272
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,843
So, there are questions. And feelings.

273
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:45,928
And the two of us together

274
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:48,163
is like one, big, swirling
confusion tornado

275
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:50,065
that could upend four lives, so, yeah.

276
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,468
Yeah, my life is
a bit of a mess at the moment.

277
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:55,037
And this is the reason
why I <i>should</i> pick you?

278
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,548
Because everyone knows

279
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,708
that people with the most disastrous
lives are brilliant at work.

280
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,510
Also, I am incredibly bossy by nature.

281
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,247
Okay, seriously,

282
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:06,882
what does Teddy Altman have that I don't?

283
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,085
- Ciao.
- Hey.

284
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,656
Uh, you look like a... <i>come</i>...
a... a sea... a sea rat.

285
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,758
Oh, wow. Sleeping alone really
brings out your friendly side.

286
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:18,827
I'm saying it must be
a pretty bad hang-under.

287
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,529
<i>Hangover, and, yeah, it was.</i>

288
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:21,864
But you know what?
I'm not feeling it anymore

289
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,599
because I just saved Pierce and Avery

290
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,434
from being splattered across Pine Street.

291
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,479
You what?

292
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,837
I'm a lifesaver, Carina.
I saved their lives.

293
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:31,240
It's like I was God's personal
right-hand man or something.

294
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:32,775
Okay, you seem pretty proud of that.

295
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,196
Yeah. You're saying it
like it's a bad thing.

296
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:37,680
- You paged me, Dr. Webber?
- You paged me, Dr. Webber?

297
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:39,882
You didn't say which DeLuca.

298
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,517
I meant Carina,

299
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,118
but her brother may as well
enjoy this, too.

300
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:44,620
I just came in with a major
trauma, Dr. Webber, so...

301
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,256
You'll want to see this, DeLuca. Roy?

302
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,358
Male, 42, severe abdominal pain.

303
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:50,459
He didn't allude to why,

304
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:52,728
but we think it may have
something to do with this.

305
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:56,765
- Oh.
- Oh.

306
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,768
Are we taking bets on what this is?

307
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:02,738
- I'm going with a candle.
- My money's on a shampoo bottle.

308
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,226
Flashlight.

309
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:06,976
You know, that one's strangely popular.

310
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,711
- Mm-hmm.
- DeLuca?

311
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,112
Why would anybody
want to do this to himself?

312
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:12,247
Because they're afraid to ask their wives

313
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:13,882
to touch them inside there.

314
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,318
They think their wives will
think they're homosexuals.

315
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:17,553
This does seem that way to me.

316
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:20,990
Don't be stupid. Gay men know
how to use proper sex toys

317
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,825
that don't get lost up there.

318
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:25,627
No. No, t-this is straight-man stupidity.

319
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:29,131
The pleasure center resides
just inside the anal canal

320
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:30,425
for all men, gay or straight.

321
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,467
All right, then.

322
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:32,801
Wait, wait, wait. I want to hear this.

323
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:34,903
The prostate is the male G-spot.

324
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,438
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

325
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:37,840
Why do you think
we're always pulling stuff

326
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,375
out of men's butts?

327
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:42,611
Why, indeed.

328
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,680
<i>Dr. Graham...</i>

329
00:13:44,714 --> 00:13:45,681
Dr. Pierce, a word?

330
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:46,749
Yeah?

331
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,603
A private word?

332
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,234
Okay.

333
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:57,115
Um...

334
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:59,428
Cece, I'll be right back.

335
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:00,549
I'm gonna let her finish your EKG.

336
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:01,497
You sit tight.

337
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:02,798
- Thank you.
- Okay.

338
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,366
<i>Dr. Rainey to Peds ICU.</i>

339
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,835
<i>Dr. Rainey to Peds ICU.</i>

340
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,104
- My trauma room ready yet?
- Somebody page Ortho again.

341
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,839
I'm gonna need a portable scan.

342
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:12,841
Did I die? Am I dead?

343
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:14,810
Nisha, you are very much alive, okay?

344
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,311
But I'm in Heaven.

345
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,882
I never believed in Heaven
before, but here I am.

346
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,482
In Heaven.

347
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:21,984
Nisha, this isn't Heaven.

348
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,453
I don't think.

349
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:27,389
I guess... I guess I don't
really know, actually.

350
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,491
You know, I mean, there are
so many things we don't know.

351
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:32,795
But you are both so pretty.

352
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,964
Like angels in yellow.

353
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,399
How is she? Is she gonna be all right?

354
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,201
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you back in a bed.

355
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,403
Oh, I'm fine. I need to know how she is.

356
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:42,485
Are her parents coming?

357
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,139
They're far, far away.

358
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,641
I am so sorry, love.

359
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,810
My mom calls me "love."

360
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:49,578
But I've never been in love.

361
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:52,481
I didn't want to die
before being in love,

362
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:56,151
but I guess I had to die to find love.

363
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,853
In Heaven.

364
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,688
Child, are you kidding me?

365
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,324
I'm a matchmaker. That's what I do.

366
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,726
And not by hobby... by trade.

367
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,662
You just stay alive,

368
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:09,731
and I will dedicate my life
to finding love for you.

369
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:10,866
Excuse me, ma'am, seriously,

370
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,102
we need you back in your bed
while we review your EKG.

371
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,603
I've had two heart transplants.

372
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:16,338
If I drop dead right here,

373
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,840
I would've already had a longer life

374
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:20,138
than I probably should've.
So, thank you, Doctor,

375
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,743
but I am not leaving this girl alone.

376
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,879
Okay, ma'am, we have
an ortho team coming in,

377
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,914
so we're gonna have to move you
to make room for...

378
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:28,884
Oh, my God.

379
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:43,799
Someone ask for an Ortho God?

380
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,403
It <i>is</i> Heaven!

381
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:55,063
She's got a nasty
open-femur fracture for sure,

382
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,908
but I do not want
to take it off the metal.

383
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:58,348
Tourniquet to control the bleeding

384
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,772
before we take the metal bars off, right?

385
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,310
Bingo. How you feeling, Nisha?

386
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:03,446
Oh, God, see?

387
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,826
No one's ever asked me that,
like really asked me.

388
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:10,185
Is that what it's like being in love,

389
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,887
like, in <i>love,</i> love?

390
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,389
Like, where I'd wake up next to you

391
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:15,491
and you'd ask me, "How did you sleep?"

392
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,993
And that's... that's crazy. Who cares?

393
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:18,927
I mean, I do it every night,

394
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:21,830
but you actually
want to know how it went.

395
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:24,366
You want to know,
"How I'm feeling, Nisha."

396
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,834
I do want to know that.

397
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,665
All right, I think she's
feeling all right.

398
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:30,067
- Mm.
- I am feeling everything right now.

399
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:31,206
Pain?

400
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,041
Everything but that.

401
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,676
All right, we're gonna
take this step by step.

402
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:37,045
Forks, stem, headset, cut the top tube...

403
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,313
I don't follow that.

404
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:40,883
Oh. You didn't work in a bike shop, bud.

405
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,518
Four years, Venice Beach.

406
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:43,919
Can I get a socket wrench?

407
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:45,087
Okay, I'm gonna need these
carpenters out of there

408
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,655
so I can ultrasound the belly.

409
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,157
No, you're right. Let's pick up
the pace, guys, all right?

410
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:49,057
Okay, this could have been me,

411
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,427
so I'd really like it if she... lived.

412
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:53,695
Slow and steady wins the race.

413
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,763
Bud.

414
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:56,231
All right, I'm gonna twist this, Nisha,

415
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,900
and you're gonna feel
some pressure, okay?

416
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,491
But if it starts to hurt,
you tell me, okay?

417
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,004
I love you.

418
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,632
I love all of you.

419
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,076
I love all of you the most.

420
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,515
Okay.

421
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,059
Dr. Altman?

422
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:17,019
You're Dr. Pierce?

423
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:18,540
Head of cardio?

424
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,654
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

425
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,109
What are you... 19?

426
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:24,760
No, I was 19 when I graduated
from medical school,

427
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,296
but I was 27 when they made me
head of cardio.

428
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,132
Are we both sharing our ages, or just me?

429
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,633
Damn it.

430
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:33,769
You're Grey's sister, aren't you?

431
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,572
Why should that matter?

432
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:37,973
All right.

433
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,641
What I'm about to tell you,

434
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:42,778
it falls under the category of
doctor-patient confidentiality.

435
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,779
Are we clear?

436
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,248
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm clear
on how the job works.

437
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,116
Okay.

438
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:53,455
Dr. Pierce, I'm 11 weeks pregnant.

439
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,990
Yesterday, I flew 12 hours,

440
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:57,826
and then participated
in an eight-hour surgery,

441
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,228
then slept for only three hours.

442
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:01,129
Now I'm 95% sure

443
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,799
that I've got a blood clot
in my femoral vein,

444
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,101
so I'm afraid I could throw
a pulmonary embolism.

445
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,070
So, I'm hoping...

446
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,472
I'm hoping that you can
confirm my diagnosis,

447
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,840
write me a prescription for Heparin

448
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,976
so that I can get back on a plane

449
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,645
and get out of here
without anyone else knowing.

450
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:18,913
Can you help me?

451
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:19,982
Uh...

452
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,187
Check on my patient in the pit.

453
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:27,823
If her EKG is normal,
hand her off to Dr. Grey.

454
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,258
Okay.

455
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,293
Hey, did you read that article

456
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,096
on how they're introducing
antigens on cancer cells

457
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,864
to make the body attack them?

458
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,367
Uh, no, I was reading <i>Wrestler's Week.</i>

459
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,769
Mm. It got me thinking.

460
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,205
About?

461
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,840
Just about how much

462
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,009
I liked working on mini-livers
with Meredith.

463
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,510
It just felt new.

464
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,813
Boston doesn't feel new... it feels old.

465
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:53,315
It's normal to have doubts.

466
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:54,516
I have doubts.

467
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,286
I don't want to be freezing
all the time with no friends.

468
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,288
But if I'm with you, I'm good.

469
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,990
You don't think it's a mistake
to leave Seattle?

470
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,091
No, the only mistake

471
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,253
is talking about work on our honeymoon.

472
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,463
Enjoy your sand castles

473
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:10,399
'cause they're gonna be
snow castles soon.

474
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,067
That is not a thing.

475
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,703
There are snow angels and snow men.

476
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,005
Snow castles is not a thing.

477
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,225
Well, if it's not a thing, it should be.

478
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,146
You know, I wouldn't mind
our kids growing up in Boston.

479
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,282
I think kids should grow up
where it snows.

480
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:27,349
You got sledding.

481
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,152
You got snowball fights, you know?

482
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,988
If we have two kids, then we
each get one on our own team.

483
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,724
If it's not a thing, it should be.

484
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,202
I mean, three's okay, too.
The more the merrier, right?

485
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,663
You know, I-I just...

486
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:42,998
I'm sorry.

487
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:48,462
All right, then.

488
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,741
It's a major obstruction,

489
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,010
and it's dangerous... we know that.

490
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:57,579
You're gonna need surgery
for us to remove that,

491
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,548
whatever it is.

492
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,083
Great. Do it. I consent.

493
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,684
Okay, with that said,

494
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:05,146
if you had any idea what it could be,

495
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,288
you should tell us.

496
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,399
It's a growth.

497
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:11,259
Must have grown there.

498
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,335
It's a growth.

499
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,823
So, cut me open and take out the growth.

500
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:18,967
Roy, let's prep him for E.U.A.
and possible ex lap.

501
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:20,402
<i>Dr. Warner, dial the operator.</i>

502
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:23,772
<i>Dr. Warner, dial the operator.</i>

503
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,309
Hey, what you got?

504
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:29,711
I have some free time,
want to have some fun.

505
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,814
I got an unknown foreign body
in the rectum.

506
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,716
How unknown and how big?

507
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,284
Very unknown...

508
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,486
and very big.

509
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,322
That sounds like fun.

510
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:41,757
I can give it to you

511
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,126
<i>if</i> you make me interim chief.

512
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,594
Int... What?

513
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,928
Did Teddy post a flier?

514
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:47,963
She didn't have to.

515
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,965
I know everything.

516
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,634
Which is why I was able
to teach you everything.

517
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,503
You know, and I could use
a change of pace.

518
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,605
You know, something
I could sink my teeth into.

519
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:59,508
And I need the office, of course.

520
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,011
- Where are you going?
- It's not fun anymore.

521
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:03,979
Wait... Wait... Wait a minute.

522
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,014
Hold on.

523
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:07,215
You want to slow down there, cowboy?

524
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,118
Bailey's an idiot if she doesn't
pick me to be interim chief.

525
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:12,988
I am brilliant. I am capable.

526
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,589
I'm hot.

527
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:16,324
I am first-choice material.

528
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,135
For interim chief...?

529
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:19,728
Yes, for interim chief.

530
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:23,165
Hmm. Who was the, uh,
blonde this morning?

531
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:27,202
She is the woman
that my ex-husband kissed

532
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,704
before he was my ex-husband,

533
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:30,105
and I think he is still hung up on her,

534
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,541
and Bailey offered her
interim chief, which is...

535
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:34,676
- Pathetic.
- Agreed.

536
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,112
She has plenty
of perfectly viable candidates

537
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,214
- for that job right here...
- No, no, this display is pathetic.

538
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:40,315
This alternate reality

539
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,983
where you were some kind of
a victim in your marriage.

540
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:43,285
You're a lot of things, Amelia Shepherd,

541
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,653
but a victim is not one of the them.

542
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,009
An ass, yes.

543
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,055
Excuse me?

544
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,323
You were a giant ass to your husband.

545
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,348
You treated him terribly.

546
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,059
When I came to cut into your brain,

547
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,260
I didn't realize you were even married.

548
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:54,830
- That's how little you seemed to care.
- I had a tumor.

549
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:57,199
You and I had sex
the day after you separated.

550
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,468
It was dirty, filthy, hot sex.

551
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,502
I was excellent.

552
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,170
But it was not tumor sex.
The tumor was gone.

553
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:03,171
It was gratitude sex.

554
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:05,307
It was "thanks so much
for not killing me" sex.

555
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,976
It was "thank God I'm not married
to that ginger anymore" sex,

556
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,144
and you know it.

557
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,214
Oh.

558
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,918
So, you have had two
transplants, Ms. Colvin?

559
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:18,487
You can call me Cece, please.

560
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,088
And, yes, I have had two

561
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:21,890
and am probably due for my third.

562
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,558
Your EKG looks perfectly normal,

563
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,360
but something did cause you
to pass out at the wheel,

564
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,929
so I would like to run
more tests, if that's okay.

565
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,198
Dr. Parker, get a prograf and a CMP

566
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,100
- and keep Dr. Pierce updated.
- Yes, ma'am.

567
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,435
Uh, Dr. Parker?

568
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:35,003
I know it's a military thing,
but, you know,

569
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,138
when you call me ma'am,

570
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:38,240
it really does make me feel like
I'm a hundred years old.

571
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,442
Yes, ma'am. Uh, sorry, ma'am.
Sorry, Doctor.

572
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,010
Just go.

573
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,929
Dr. Grey?

574
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,380
- Ah.
- Hi.

575
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,449
Uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

576
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:49,251
I never should have kissed you like that.

577
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,020
I mean, you're incredible.

578
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,455
- It's fine.
- I-It's not fine.

579
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:56,625
I respect so much as a surgeon,
and I just... I would nev...

580
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:59,194
I would never do that to you
under normal circumstances.

581
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:01,675
But you were just very, very
kind to me, and I was drunk,

582
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,098
and the dress was, I mean...

583
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,533
Anyway, it never should've happened,

584
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:07,469
and it never will happen again.

585
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:08,937
I'm gonna go now.

586
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,207
Well, that's a shame.

587
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:13,278
You like him?

588
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm his teacher.

589
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,912
You don't want to kiss him again?

590
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:19,447
- He's my student.
- Well, all right.

591
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:22,717
But you want <i>somebody to kiss you.</i>

592
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:23,952
I can tell.

593
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,154
It's my superpower.

594
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:27,389
You can talk to me... I'm safe.

595
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:30,225
I'm like the opposite of a priest.

596
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,295
People confess things to me,
but I don't make them feel bad.

597
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,691
Well, I don't need anyone...

598
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,231
It's not about need, honey.

599
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,266
It's about desire.

600
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:40,302
And you are not a hundred years old.

601
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,926
You are beautiful and vibrant.

602
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:44,005
Oh, excuse me.

603
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,141
Dr. Bailey, do you have a moment?

604
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,642
Mm. What do you have, Grey?

605
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,778
I have a desire...

606
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:50,925
to be interim chief.

607
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,914
Oh, for the love of...
Specifically right now.

608
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:55,626
I need it. I really... I need it.

609
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:00,297
I'm having dreams.

610
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,490
Inappropriate.

611
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:06,695
To a degree that I'm having
difficulty putting into words.

612
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:08,972
I could use the extra work.

613
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:15,203
You do have a clot,
but your D-dimer's negative.

614
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:17,372
I want to admit you
and monitor you for a few days.

615
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,176
- Dr. Pierce?
- Yes.

616
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,812
This is so not me.

617
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,347
I don't cry.

618
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,658
The hormones are in control now.

619
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:30,619
And I don't get pregnant by accident.

620
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:32,204
I'm careful!

621
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,190
But a man I loved came to Germany,

622
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,158
and it was so hard to resist,

623
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:39,027
and I wasn't careful.

624
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,529
Oh, my God. Owen went to Germany.

625
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,531
Who's Owen?

626
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,306
What exactly is your
relationship to Owen?

627
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,308
He's kind of living with my sister.

628
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,645
Your sister?

629
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,188
Amelia Shepherd.

630
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,537
I'm sorry I talked about kids
on our honeymoon.

631
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:16,806
It was stupid. It was just...

632
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,209
you were talking about
the future and snow stuff,

633
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:21,644
and it just popped into my head.

634
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,466
Like, I could see our kids
playing in the snow, having fun,

635
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:26,487
which is...

636
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:29,423
You know, kids, snow. It makes sense.

637
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:30,825
Alex, shut up, please.

638
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,294
I-I have an idea, a big idea,
and I love you,

639
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:34,628
and I will love all of our children,

640
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,063
or at least one child eventually.

641
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:37,798
But for now, just...

642
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,217
Shh!

643
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,434
I had an idea.

644
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:41,535
What idea?

645
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:44,638
On the house.

646
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:53,581
The desire for a prostate
massage is absolutely normal,

647
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:56,317
and if you have a simple
conversation with your wife

648
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:59,253
- and explain to her your desire...
- Please stop.

649
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,423
All she needs is a manicure
and a little bit of...

650
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,757
Ugh, can you please make her stop?

651
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:06,256
Not until you tell me
what you put in there.

652
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:08,162
My wife's...

653
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:09,468
Ow!

654
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:11,699
...hair stuff.

655
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,667
Shampoo! Yes!

656
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,237
- Thank you, Dr. DeLuca.
- Any time.

657
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:20,374
I think I'm in love with your sister.

658
00:26:22,143 --> 00:26:23,058
So, wait.

659
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:25,012
If Meredith is your half-sister...

660
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:26,154
Who you just met...

661
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,616
...and Amelia is
Meredith's sister-in-law...

662
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,550
...from her dead husband...

663
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,819
...then you aren't
actually really sisters.

664
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,220
Yeah, I know, but it's...

665
00:26:33,255 --> 00:26:34,855
it's more like metaphorical sisters.

666
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,624
Like, we're all sisters.

667
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:39,059
There's a sister house. It's a thing.

668
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:41,028
But you aren't <i>really</i> sisters.

669
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:42,196
Does that matter?

670
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,865
Well, yeah, kind of.

671
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,911
I mean, blood, water.

672
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:47,368
Oh, I don't believe in that stuff.

673
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:49,036
But you do believe in HIPAA.

674
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,472
I'm not going to tell her.

675
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,744
I heard nothing, Major Altman.

676
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,280
Thank you, Lieutenant. Dismissed.

677
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:02,449
Okay.

678
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:04,518
You're leaving against medical advice.

679
00:27:04,552 --> 00:27:06,320
I've got my compression socks,

680
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:08,923
and I will elevate my leg somewhere else.

681
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:11,825
You can't travel.
You certainly can't fly.

682
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,448
I'm clear on that.

683
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:15,829
Dr. Altman? Teddy?

684
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:16,830
Can I call you Teddy

685
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:19,066
now that I'm carrying
your life-altering secret?

686
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,167
No.

687
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:23,959
Dr. Pierce...

688
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,241
Thank you for the consult.

689
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:32,880
She is right, honey...
that's not your sister.

690
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:37,785
So, my broken-down heart
is costing me my kidneys now?

691
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:39,288
It's not your heart.

692
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,555
It's the anti-rejection meds
you take for your heart.

693
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,057
They had a toxic effect on your kidneys.

694
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:44,959
So I need a kidney transplant.

695
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:48,729
We've already called UNOS,
but until they can find you one,

696
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,931
you're gonna need peritoneal dialysis

697
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,866
every night for 12 hours.

698
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,902
I'll do a small surgery
and insert a catheter

699
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,818
to make that possible, okay?

700
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:59,773
Can you put me in a recovery
room beside Nisha,

701
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,108
the girl I hurt?

702
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:03,043
I-I want to be with her
till her parents arrive.

703
00:28:03,078 --> 00:28:04,645
Well, I can certainly check.

704
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,381
Then I consent to the surgery.

705
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,283
Now let's talk about you.

706
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:10,818
You've been single for how long now?

707
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,753
Cece.

708
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,822
I am happy just as I am.

709
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:15,998
Well, of course you are.

710
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,124
How could you not be...

711
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:20,094
a beautiful, accomplished doctor
like yourself?

712
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:22,496
But is there a cap on happiness?

713
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,898
And who couldn't use a little more?

714
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:27,481
And who couldn't enjoy
sharing it a little?

715
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,904
I could help you
if you'd let me, Dr. Grey.

716
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:33,774
I'm the UNOS of love.

717
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,614
So, you just moved to Seattle?

718
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,246
- No, I've been here a while.
- Oh.

719
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,814
He was the team doc for the Mariners.

720
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,017
- Do you get tickets, or...?
- Lot of tickets.

721
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,418
- Owen Hunt. Head of trauma.
- I'm Jackson Avery.

722
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:45,779
- Love the Mariners.
- I don't know if we were

723
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:47,254
properly introduced ever.

724
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:49,590
Hey, afternoon, gentlemen.
I heard you have a trauma.

725
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:51,191
Need an extra set of hands?

726
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:52,593
Sure. Scrub in.

727
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:57,931
And how's your first day
going, Dr. Lincoln?

728
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,533
Going great.

729
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,969
Be going even better
if you called me Link.

730
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:04,171
Oh. Okay, I'll try.

731
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:05,305
Mm.

732
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,342
You know, you may have forgotten
that I was once chief.

733
00:29:08,376 --> 00:29:10,611
Everybody seems to just,
you know, forget that.

734
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:13,447
I wouldn't touch that job
with a 10-foot pole.

735
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,722
That job comes with stress.

736
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:18,452
Bones break under stress.

737
00:29:18,486 --> 00:29:20,621
So do souls.

738
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,656
Simple... that's the key to life.

739
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,427
Wha...

740
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:30,731
Since we couldn't
get it out with the E.U.A.,

741
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:34,131
<i>we need to open the sigmoid
to access it from above.</i>

742
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:38,138
All right, we are going to
<i>make an opening</i>

743
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:39,907
in the sigmoid colon.

744
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:41,475
Okay, scalpel.

745
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,878
Okay, right there. Yeah.

746
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,713
All right, let's pull it back
just a little bit. Yeah.

747
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:47,881
- Mm-hmm.
- That's good.

748
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:56,824
Okay. I have this.

749
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,659
Hold on.

750
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,030
Something feels hard.

751
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:06,900
There's a small bleeder here.

752
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,035
Stop. Wait, okay? I got it.

753
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,791
Let me get a clamp.

754
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,774
Roy, back away!

755
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:14,842
- Aaah!
- Watch out!

756
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:17,111
Get down! Look out!

757
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:21,548
<i>Get more lap pads! He's crashing!</i>

758
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,550
I need some water over here!

759
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:26,520
Let's get some laps here.

760
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:27,888
What the hell happened?

761
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:29,756
It was aerosol hair spray...
not shampoo...

762
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,178
and it exploded. Is he all right?

763
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:32,251
Yeah.

764
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,261
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

765
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,964
Thanks, man. You saved my life.

766
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,100
More laps. Hurry.

767
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:47,663
Got this bleeding under control.

768
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:50,323
Get me two units of blood.

769
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,283
I need two vascular clamps.

770
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,333
More laps here. Okay.

771
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:55,486
I need to divert with a colostomy.

772
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,654
Okay, more suction in here.

773
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,156
Talk to me, Roy.

774
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,291
He... He exploded.

775
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,893
Not until after I told you
to back away and you didn't.

776
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:03,994
Get him out of here.

777
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,296
DeLuca, you were very brave,

778
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,765
but I need you to scrub back in and
help me try and stop this bleeding.

779
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,392
Yes, sir.

780
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,969
More suction.

781
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,904
Let's try some, Bokie.

782
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,473
Son a bitch.

783
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,442
Okay, well, that's just great.

784
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,277
That's great. All right, all right.

785
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,480
All right, let's... let's talk about it.

786
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,750
You were awful to him...
we've established that.

787
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,420
So, if you really want him back now,

788
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,288
you're actually gonna
have to fight for him.

789
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,023
Knock the other player out of the game.

790
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,428
Your advice is that I should
fight another woman for a man?

791
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,146
What thing that's worth having

792
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:40,781
has anyone ever gotten without a fight?

793
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,850
You didn't become a neurosurgeon
without fighting for it.

794
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,785
You didn't come back from a brain tumor

795
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,687
without fighting for it...
you fought like hell.

796
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:47,688
And if some woman had been standing

797
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,824
between you and your ability
to get out of bed,

798
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:51,859
you would've fought her, Shepherd.

799
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,627
There might have been Jell-O.

800
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:54,762
Or mud.

801
00:31:54,796 --> 00:31:56,330
Maybe costumes.

802
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,666
I am not gonna take personal
life advice from you, Tom,

803
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,001
because, in that area,
I have no respect for you.

804
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:02,352
Very smart. I have my flaws.

805
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,473
But I only have one regret in this life,

806
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,786
and that is that I watched my wife

807
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,943
walk out the door of our marriage

808
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:11,413
