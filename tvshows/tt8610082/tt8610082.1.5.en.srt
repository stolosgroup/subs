1
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,927
Did you come alone?

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,011
Yes.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,638
What's the password?

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,849
Okay. What's the password?
What's the password?

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,767
Okay. I have no idea.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,935
Psst.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,898
Capital one, two, three,
lowercase four, five, six.

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,150
Thank you.

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,318
One, two,
three, four, five, six!

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,238
Enter, friend.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,243
Welcome to Needleman and Smitty's
vacation door emporium.

12
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,786
I love vacation doors.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,871
That's right.

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,499
Each of these doors was personally rescued
by us from the shredder,

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:47,255
and guaranteed to deliver you to
an isolated, human-free destination.

16
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,632
Okay. Oh, please. I can't wait.
Tell me, what do you got?

17
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:55,263
Who wouldn't wanna chill out on a cruise
to an abandoned ship in the Arctic Circle?

18
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,807
This vacation sounds cool.

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,894
Shut up! I give the sales pitch,
you're the glamour model.

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:06,191
Transyl-Romania is known
for blood-sucking vampires.

21
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:11,154
But what doesn't suck are the deluxe
amenities of this musty, deserted castle.

22
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,035
You'll have a rotten time
in this decaying cabin in the woods.

23
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,080
Nah, too fishy. What else you got?

24
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,876
Soak up the sun at this condemned
Caribbean beach resort.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,879
Beach vacation!
Yes, yes, yes! That's the one!

26
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,672
Excellent choice, my good man.

27
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,509
This vacated vacation paradise is yours.

28
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,593
Hold it.

29
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,513
You're so sure that using a door
that was supposed to be shredded

30
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,389
isn't against company policy?

31
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,518
Oh, we don't say "against company policy."

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,563
That's right. We say "debit or credit."

Okay, everybody, are you ready?

35
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,137
'Cause it's time to play...

36
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,224
Wheel of Temporary Supervisor!

37
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,851
Today's my lucky day, Roto.

38
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:26,563
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Yes!

39
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,647
Why is my name on there?

40
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,567
When Fritz goes on vacation,
the wheel picks a temporary supervisor.

41
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,944
I see the ambition
in your eyes, College Boy.

42
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,612
You'd love to have me under your thumb,

43
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,923
squishing me with your little
temporary supervisor thumb.

44
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:38,408
Thumb? What are you...

45
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,369
I've told you, Duncan.
I have no interest in Fritz's job, okay?

46
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,371
- Uh-huh.
- I signed your ridiculous contract.

47
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,708
Right. Like a two-faced charlatan like you
would honor a contract.

48
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,711
- Two-face... What are you talking about?
- Come on. Let's go, wheel!

49
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,880
Mama needs a temporary promotion!

50
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,339
Yes, yes, yes!

51
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,508
- Come on, come on!
- Yes, no, no, no!

52
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,344
- Yes!
- Glad it's not me.

53
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,306
Congratulations, Temporary Supervisor Val.

54
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,933
Oh, I have so many fun things
planned for my employees.

55
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,144
Mindfulness Mondays, Tamale Tuesdays,

56
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,855
Waffle Wednesdays,
Friendly French Fry Fridays.

57
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,356
What next, yoga? Uh-uh.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,233
Neither me nor my schedule is flexible.

59
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,611
Yeah, yeah, let's hear it for Val.

60
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,240
So much for my humble dream
of being temporary supervisor.

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,078
I'll just throw away the only thing
I've ever wanted in my insignificant life.

62
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,873
Ah, great.

63
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,626
- I can't even throw away my dreams right.
- Huh.

64
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,589
Kinda goes against my better judgment,
but I feel a little sorry for him.

65
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:39,094
Yeah. Yeah, Mom, you know how you always
told me, "Dreams can come true"?

66
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,388
Yeah, well, uh,
I learned today that they can't.

67
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,642
No, don't cry. Don't cry, Mom.

68
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,561
I tried my best. I did. I did.

69
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,438
I'll cry for the both of us.

70
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,024
- Uh, Fritz?
- Huh?

71
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,901
Looks like I made an oopsie.

72
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,279
The temporary supervisor is Duncan.

73
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,073
Me? <i>Moi?</i>

74
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,449
The fates have chosen.

75
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,243
Well, uh, Mr. Fritz, sir,

76
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,412
there's no way I can match your
robust managerial skills, blah-blah-blah,

77
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,456
but I will do my best
to make you proud, sir,

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,875
and, uh, supervise the team.

79
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,431
<i>So I'm waving goodbye</i>

80
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,890
<i>And while I'm gone</i>

81
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:30,186
I expect you all to maintain
the get-along, MIFTer spirit.

82
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,022
Get Along's my middle name, sir.
Duncan P. "Get Along" Anderson.

83
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,609
Now, you go get yourself a creepy colada
and make some memories!

84
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,529
<i>I'm getting sand in my toes</i>

85
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,697
- Have a great time.
- Enjoy.

86
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,158
<i>And I'll see ya in two weeks</i>

87
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,203
<i>Bon voyage-e!</i>

88
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,414
Hmm...

89
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,710
Well, well, well.
Looks like I'm now the supervisor.

90
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,211
- "Temporary."
- Supervisor.

91
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,921
- For a limited time.
- Supervisor!

92
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,217
And that means that everybody
has to do whatever I say.

93
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,514
Now, who's under whose thumb, College Boy?
Squishy-squish-squish.

94
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,141
I hope you did the right thing.

95
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,479
<i><i>Ahem.</i>

96
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,570
Hear ye, hear ye.

97
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:25,074
<i>Now presenting his Supervisorship,
Duncan P. Anderson.</i>

98
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,159
<i>Huzzah.</i>

99
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,831
"Dearest Mother,
I have clawed my way to the middle,

100
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,459
"and I now command a capable workforce."

101
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,503
- Read that last bit back to me.
- I got it.

102
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,505
- Read it back.
- "Dearest Mother..."

103
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,216
- With enthusiasm.
- "Dearest Mother..."

104
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,593
To my supervisory chambers,
and be quick about it.

105
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,678
Chop-chop.

106
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,598
Chop-chop, chop-chop, chop-chop.

107
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,391
Ah.

108
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,645
Hmm. Not good enough, Roto.
It's not good enough.

109
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,024
Well, maybe the fifth time
will be the charm, College Boy.

110
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,651
Up here, College Boy.

111
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,903
Down there, College Boy.
Open your eyes, College Boy.

112
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,739
Here, College Boy.
Over there, College Boy.

113
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,909
College Boy!

114
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,331
Pick up the pace, College Boy.

115
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,292
Mr. Sullivan wants these old canisters
emptied by Friday.

116
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,046
Too bad for you scream power's
a thing of the past, huh?

117
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,423
Boombox!

118
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,720
Back on canister duty, huh?
Glad I'm not you.

119
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,556
That job's monotonous.

120
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,141
Drive a monster crazy.

121
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:35,604
I'll tell you who's crazy. Duncan.
Crazy with temporary supervisor power.

122
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,730
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Careful.

123
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,733
You damage the valve of one of these,
even ones with barely any juice,

124
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,445
it'll knock a monster your size
halfway across the room.

125
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,363
Or if you're Duncan-size...

126
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,367
...all the way across the room.

127
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,327
Just sayin'.

128
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,082
Oh!

129
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,250
Whoops.

130
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,421
You think that's funny, huh,
Mr. Jokester?

131
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,048
Did I do that?
I guess I need better supervising.

132
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,134
Oh, I'll supervise you.

133
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,969
- No. Duncan. No, no.
- What are you doing?

134
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,804
No, that's... Let go of that.

135
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,848
Okay, that's a bad idea, Duncan.

136
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,100
Duncan, let go!

137
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,269
Okay.

138
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,022
No!

139
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,402
Run, run!

140
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,031
- This is your fault!
- My fault?

141
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,832
Mama!

142
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,794
Whoa! Whoa!

143
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,343
Oh.

144
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,095
- Huh?
- High score!

145
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,263
Aw.

146
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,349
- Uh-oh.
- Whoa.

147
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,433
What caused that?

148
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,394
Relax, Sulley, relax.
I'm sure it's nothing.

149
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,647
See? Emergency power. Everything's A-okay.

150
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,108
Mike, Sulley,
power's out in the entire city.

151
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,692
- M.E.R.C.'s on the phone.
- M.E.R.C.?

152
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,778
- M.E.R.C.
- Murray's Eye and Retina Center?

153
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,905
Has it been six months
since my last appointment?

154
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,282
No. M.E.R.C.-M.E.R.C., not Murray M.E.R.C.

155
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,535
Monstropolis Energy Regulatory Commission.

156
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,662
They're sending an investigator.

157
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,914
So, not Murray?

158
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,957
I'm just being clear.

159
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,183
Oh, no, not him.

160
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:41,187
That's Argus Blinks.
He hasn't taken a day off in 20 years.

161
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,983
If he finds a problem, he'll shut us down.
This could be the end of laugh power.

162
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,405
Argus Blinks, M.E.R.C. Investigator.

163
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,158
James P. Sullivan,
CEO, Monsters, Incorporated.

164
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,453
Yes, "Mr. Laugh Energy,"
I know who you are.

165
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,954
Is that good or bad?

166
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,248
I am here to determine
the cause of today's blackout,

167
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:04,294
and whether or not a shutdown
or a change in management is in order.

168
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,087
You'll have our full cooperation, sir.

169
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,590
Full cooperation!
Now, if you could please sign in.

170
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,509
What is this?

171
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,386
That? Oh!

172
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,846
That's my lunch money.

173
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,682
Or it could be your lunch money.

174
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,767
Mike.

175
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,435
Are you trying to bribe me?

176
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,812
- No, no, of course he's not.
- Put that away.

177
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,897
That's so silly.

178
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,065
By chance,
did you drop these box seat tickets

179
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,734
to the Monstropolis Creepees game, uh,

180
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,069
row double-A,
seats one through three, free food?

181
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,155
Was that possibly yours, by any chance?

182
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,992
- Are those my tickets?
- Your office, if you please.

183
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,452
Right this way, sir.

184
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,456
Welcome, sir. Mr. Wazowski wants us
to bribe you with a brand-new...

185
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
Not now, boys. Not now.

186
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,625
Excuse the car, sir.

187
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,752
It's "Park Anywhere You Want" Day today.

188
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,920
Hmm...

189
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,130
Here's a 50. Get rid of the car.

190
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,091
Wait, a 20. Here's a 20,
get rid of the car.

191
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,343
You know what? Forget it.
Just get rid of the car.

192
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,556
Almost.

193
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,226
You got one more up there, kiddo.

194
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,526
Forget that last canister.
It's not goin' anywhere.

195
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,486
Tylor! You're not gonna believe this.

196
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,279
Power's out all over Monstropolis.

197
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,574
A M.E.R.C. investigator is on his way.
Heads are gonna roll...

198
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,285
Whoa. What happened?

199
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,829
- Duncan did it.
- College Boy did it.

200
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,580
- You're in charge.
- It's not about me.

201
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,665
I say you both did it.

202
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,625
- It was your idea.
- Yeah. It's your fault.

203
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,043
- You acted on it.
- Not about me.

204
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,795
- You're all accountable.
- Not about me.

205
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,506
So are you. If it wasn't for you,
Duncan wouldn't be supervisor.

206
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,926
- I can't lose my pension over this.
- I can't lose my shot at the Laugh Floor.

207
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,010
Okay, okay. All right.

208
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,013
The only way to save our jobs
is to hide all the evidence

209
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,224
and make sure
nobody ever finds out the truth.

210
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,726
I don't know.
Sounds like you're suggesting a cover-up.

211
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,228
No! Not a cover-up.

212
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,731
Just a thing where we all conspire
to avoid accountability for our actions.

213
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,024
- So, a cover-up.
- No!

214
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:54,238
Why is this concept so difficult to grasp?
Not a cover-up.

215
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,825
Mr. Blinks, you sure you don't want us
to take you to the control room?

216
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,871
Not necessary, Mr. Sullivan.
My eyes can see everything from here.

217
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,962
Ugh, that's disturbing.

218
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,214
That's comin' from a guy
who's nearly 100% eye.

219
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,593
My highly-trained inspection orbs
will seek out the malfunction

220
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,928
and report back to me what happened,

221
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,057
- and who is responsible.
- Ugh!

222
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,256
It's not a cover-up, okay?

223
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,551
As your supervisor, you're hiding it
from view with a large tarp.

224
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,762
And you, as my subordinate, do as I say!

225
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,348
Why is this supervisor thing
so important to you anyway?

226
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,643
If you think that bein' supervisor
someday is all I've ever wanted,

227
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:10,438
and that messin' this up is somehow
gonna crush my hopes and dreams,

228
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,232
then that's, uh, you know...

229
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,152
Oh, Duncan, I, uh... I didn't mean to...

230
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,362
It's none of your business.

231
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,072
- Now, get to work.
- Okay, fine.

232
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,866
But once I'm done covering it up,
this cover-up is complete.

233
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,243
Stop saying, "cover-up!"

234
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,036
Okay, as supervisor, I say we call it,

235
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,456
"Operation Hide All the Evidence and Make
Sure Nobody Ever Finds Out the Truth."

236
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,960
- Yeah, that's much more covert.
- Yep, covert and secretive.

237
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,091
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

238
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,926
Mmm-hmm? Mmm-hmm?

239
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,971
Hmm.

240
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:47,392
It appears the cause for the power outage
is inconclusive.

241
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,018
I guess you won't shut us down today.

242
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,105
If you pack up your creepy-eye suitcase,
I'll gladly show you the way out.

243
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,192
Just one moment.

244
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,070
Hmm. Mmm-hmm?

245
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,405
Yes.

246
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,240
Well, I stand corrected.

247
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:05,285
I seem to have found those responsible.

248
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,873
As the Facilities Team here
at Monsters, Incorporated,

249
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,001
all of you are in violation
of numerous M.E.R.C. codes,

250
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,420
as eye-witnessed by my eyes.

251
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,130
- And as supervisor, M...
- "Temporary."

252
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,133
Temporary supervisor,
Mr. Duncan P. Anderson,

253
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,677
you are responsible
for the actions of your team.

254
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,098
You should be fired,
or, better yet, banished!

255
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:27,683
Banished?

256
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,810
- Me?
- Hey, wait.

257
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,605
Come on, it's his first day as supervisor.
Give him a break.

258
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,148
Give him a break?

259
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,443
I've been working non-stop
as a M.E.R.C. official for 20 years,

260
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,028
and no one's ever given me a brea...

261
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,242
Is he...

262
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,412
Oh.

263
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,832
Oh, well.
I'll log him in my accident journal.

264
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,875
- We gotta get rid of the body.
- What?

265
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,460
I mean, check his pulse, obviously.

266
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,129
- He's alive.
- Oh, hurray.

267
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,506
Aw.

268
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,424
Looks like he finally got his break.

269
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,801
Break. Give him a break.

270
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,302
Good idea, me!

271
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,304
We can hide him in the vacation door!

272
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,724
Oh, of course, yes, vacation door.
Perfect. Right.

273
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,809
- Come on.
- Oh. Okay, this is gross.

274
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,936
Everything's wet. Why is everything wet?

275
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,729
- I'll tie the tentacles in a knot.
- Gross.

276
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,356
Is this the right thing to do?

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,650
I'm gonna remain neutral
until I see what happens.

278
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,319
- This is so gross.
- The eye is looking at me.

279
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,613
- The eye is looking at me.
- Whoa, oh. Yep, yep, yep.

280
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,281
Almost there, almost there.

281
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,366
And in he go...

282
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,834
Ouch. I felt that. But he didn't.

283
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,878
Come on, let's send him on his holiday.

284
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,507
Oh, one of his thingies...

285
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,925
- Goodbye.
- Yeah, there you go.

286
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,055
Guys? I am pretty sure disposing of a body
may be another banishable offense.

287
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,974
That was the only thing we could do.

288
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,768
His work-life balance
was totally out of whack, all right?

289
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,728
- Duncan?
- Right. College Boy is right.

290
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,106
We'll make a pact.
None of us will speak of this again.

291
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,108
We take this to our graves.
Nobody saw nothin'.

292
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,359
- Well...
- Nobody saw nothin'!

293
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,820
Mmm-hmm?

294
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,074
Shh!

295
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:12,746
We need to close the case.

296
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,545
Close it!

297
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,464
- Ugh!
- Get those eyes!

298
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,674
Get it, get it!

299
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,969
- Smash it! Yeah!
- No, no, no, no.

300
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,639
Aha!

301
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,974
No, there it goes.

302
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,372
- Aha!
- Yes!

303
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,505
Incoming.

304
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,182
Yah! Bleh!

305
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,020
And problem solved.

306
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,562
Done and done.

307
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,397
Not quite. Fritz is still in there.

308
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,900
Whatever. Fritz ain't coming back
for two weeks.

309
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,444
I'll figure somethin' out.

310
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,244
All right, kiddos, it's been two weeks.
What do you got?

311
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,578
- I got nothin'.
- I got nothin'.

312
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,997
Well, here goes nothin'.

313
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,550
That was, without a doubt...

314
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,137
the best vacation of my life!

315
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,221
Wow!

316
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,765
I believe it, Argus.
'Cause you really needed to unwind.

317
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,308
- Mmm-hmm. Hmm.
- You're very wound.

318
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,727
So, uh, you're doing okay?

319
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,354
I'm more than okay.

320
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,233
Sipping creepy coladas,
napping beneath the palms,

321
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,235
cha-chaing the night away.

322
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,319
<i>Cha-cha-cha-cha...</i>

323
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,280
Argus? You're still here?

324
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,073
Yeah, I thought you left two weeks ago.

325
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, no. I took a little time off.

326
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,411
I have your MIFT crew to thank.

327
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,289
You are welcome.
And that is the last we will speak of it.

328
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,167
Well, of course,
I will be writing all of you up,

329
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,794
but just a warning this time.

330
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,838
Goodbye, Mr. Laugh Energy.

331
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,256
<i>Cha-cha-cha-cha-uh-uh...</i>

332
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,217
That was too close.
We were nearly shut down.

333
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,053
You caused a major power outage,
conspired to cover it up,

334
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,015
and if that weren't enough,
attempted to bribe a M.E.R.C. official.

335
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,101
- Mike, that was you.
- Stay on point, Sulley, stay on point.

336
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,687
Is all this true?

337
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,605
Duncan?

338
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,525
Yes, sir.

339
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,487
Oh, this is all my fault.

340
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,908
I tipped the wheel so that Duncan
could be temporary supervisor.

341
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,744
Well, regardless of how
he became temporary supervisor,

342
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,746
it all happened on your watch, Duncan.

343
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,791
And any of these accusations
is grounds for dismissal.

344
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,586
Dismissal?

345
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,672
Um...

346
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,467
Temporary supervisor's, uh...

347
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,762
Well, he's gotta go down
with his temporary ship...

348
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,472
I guess.

349
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,519
So, uh, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Wazowski...

350
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,812
I'm sorry, I...

351
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,856
I'm the one that caused the outage, okay?

352
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,528
Duncan, he was just trying
to be a good supervisor.

353
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,533
So if anyone deserves
to be dismissed, it's me.

354
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,370
- The truth is...
- Yeah, well...

355
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,496
No, no, no.

356
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,749
The power outage
and, you know, all the other stuff,

357
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,209
that was my fault, too.

358
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,712
Though I am significantly
less at fault than him.

359
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,883
Hmm. I am so proud of you two.

360
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,261
Not only have you displayed
that get-along, MIFTer spirit,

361
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,721
you've shown that
you're willing to sacrifice one another.

362
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,557
"Sacrifice for one another"?

363
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,017
That, too. So, Mr. W, Mr. S,

364
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:07,814
what do you say we forget all the
dismissal jumbo-mumbo-bumbo-bimble?

365
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,233
Speaking of dismissal mumbo jumbo,

366
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,695
what about that "against company policy"
vacation door?

367
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,822
Taken care of, Sulley.
I'm having it shredded.

368
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,159
Mr. Wazowski, we're here
to take the vacation door to your office.

369
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,912
Our office?

370
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,014
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"

371
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,599
"I." "I, who?"

372
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,143
"I am here to teach you
about knock-knock jokes."

373
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,562
You see how easy that is?

374
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,898
A simple knock and response
leads to laughter.

375
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,025
Yes, Chuck, question?

376
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,319
Uh, yeah, shouldn't there be a door?

377
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,821
No. That's the beauty of it.
No door is required.

378
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,823
Well, then what do you knock on?

379
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,116
You don't knock on anything.

380
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,327
- I'm confused.
- It doesn't make sense.

381
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,661
It's simple.

382
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,372
I say, "Knock-knock."
And you respond, "Who's there?"

383
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,875
Why would I ask who's there?
I can see you.

384
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,585
You're standing right in front of us.

385
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,670
- That's why you need a door.
- Or a barrier.

386
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,089
Yes, yes! You need a door.

387
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,466
You don't need a door, okay?
You don't need a door.

388
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,468
I say, "Knock-knock."
You say, "Who's there?"

389
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,887
I say something like, "orange."
You say, "Orange, who?"

390
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,847
But you're not orange,
you're clearly green.

391
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,182
That doesn't seem like a joke.

392
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,102
This is a classic setup.
It's "Knock-knock." "Who's there?"

393
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,229
- You're asking me to lie to kids.
- He's right.

394
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,815
Knocking on a fake door,
misrepresenting yourself.

395
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,067
- It's all very suspect.
- I don't like lying to kids.

396
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,778
- Yeah, that's against company policy.
- Don't make me lie.

397
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:37,862
It's okay, Chuck.

398
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,322
We just won't answer the door,

399
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,283
no matter how much he fake knocks
and lies about who he is.

400
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,285
I can't take it anymore.

401
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,578
It's just a simple thing.

402
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,372
"Knock-knock." "Who's there?"

403
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,626
That's how it works. It's called humor.

404
