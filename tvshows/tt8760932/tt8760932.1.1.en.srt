00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using PureVPN
From 1.99 USD/Month -> bit.ly/getpvpn

2
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,448
I'm actually
really looking forward to this.

3
00:01:55,157 --> 00:02:00,454
This place has won
two global wellness awards,

4
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,873
mental wellness and social impact.

5
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,585
Though, the latter might have been,
uh, an honorable mention.

6
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,962
The fact is, this woman is giving us

7
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,380
a massive price break.

8
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,551
What a‐‐ what a socially
progressive thing to do.

9
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,554
To put healing people ahead
of the profit motive.

10
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,807
I mean, to‐‐ I think some
of these other folks here

11
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,560
are paying‐‐ paying thousands of dollars.

12
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,484
I actually feel myself
getting lighter as I get nearer.

13
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,654
It's going to be a good thing.
Don't you think so, honey?

14
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,783
‐ I do.
‐ Yeah. How you doing, Zoe? Zoe!

15
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,202
‐ Yeah.

16
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,578
How you doing back there?

17
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,748
‐ Oh, never better, Dad.
Just looking forward.

18
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,458
‐ It's going to be great.

19
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,257
Hey guys, it's Jess.

20
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,216
So, we're headed

21
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,177
to a transformation retreat
called Tranquillum.

22
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,596
I would tag them for you,
but they're not on social.

23
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,765
It's like super mysterious.

24
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,601
Anyway, we're gonna spend 10 days

25
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,814
doing meditation,
yoga, healthy eating,

26
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,816
and spending some quality time
with my man‐‐

27
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,027
Damn it, Ben, did you do that on purpose?

28
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,321
‐ It's this road. It's beating
the shit out of my car.

29
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,615
‐ Now I have to record
the whole thing again.

30
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,536
‐ You don't have to.
‐ Yes, I do.

31
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,204
‐ Look, if you ask me,
I feel like we're taking

32
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,290
this whole self‐improvement thing
a little too far.

33
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,083
‐ I didn't ask, but what's
that supposed to mean?

34
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,252
‐ It means that‐‐ Whoa, God!

35
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,089
Look, if we keep getting better,
eventually we'll be perfect,

36
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,632
right? Then what?

37
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,218
‐ Maybe you'll be
a perfect little asshole.

38
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,469
‐ I'm not being an asshole.

39
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,054
I just don't understand
why I'm going to this place.

40
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,599
‐ We're going 'cause we have issues,
Benjamin...

41
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,852
with us.

42
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,645
That should mean more to you
than your fucking car.

43
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,190
We need something dramatic.

44
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,109
Yeah, this is definitely dramatic.

45
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,236
Yo, if I fuck up my suspension‐‐

46
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:19,259
‐ Wellness here I come.
Frances 2.0.

47
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,053
Get ready.

48
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,139
Yeah, get ready.

49
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,438
‐ Little shit. Not even a phone call, huh?

50
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,149
Why not? Would it be too courteous?

51
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,361
Ah‐ha. Oh.

52
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,074
Hello?

53
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,785
Hey. So have we achieved nirvana yet?

54
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,413
‐  Still a ways off
from infinite serenity.

55
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,541
Okay. Well, you need to give
this a real chance, honey.

56
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,959
‐ I am giving this a real cha‐‐

57
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,211
I'm literally going there right now.

58
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,712
That's giving it a chance.

59
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,881
And do not even think about him.

60
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,132
He's an asshole.

61
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,968
‐ I wasn't. If I could just get my friends

62
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,886
to stop calling and bringing him up.

63
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,430
Any ideas how I could do that?
Oh.

64
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,599
Have you heard from your agent?

65
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,810
‐ I have not, but now
you've brought up him

66
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,145
and work, so you got anything else

67
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,566
you wanna throw at me?
Just that I love you.

68
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,277
The new book is fantastic.
You are fantastic,

69
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,697
and you're going to have a fabulous
10 days at Tranquillum.

70
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,658
‐ Yes. I know. I feel the same way.

71
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,202
Come back a whole new me.

72
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,872
I'm sure everyone will like
that one better.

73
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,916
Well, I like this one.

74
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,211
‐ Thanks. Oh, Erin, it's my agent,

75
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,921
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Love you.

76
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,423
Call me back!
I love you!

77
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,884
‐ Hey there.
Frances?

78
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,386
‐ So, how's the book biz going today?

79
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,512
Whoa! You just‐‐

80
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,805
you just sound so upbeat!

81
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,183
‐ I'm on my way to that health retreat
I told you about.

82
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,269
I'm just trying to put myself
in a positive state of mind.

83
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,229
Yeah, well, remember
those people who died

84
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,355
in that sweat lodge?

85
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,982
They thought they were being enlightened

86
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,817
when in reality they were being cooked.

87
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,195
‐ This is nothing like that.
This place looks amazing.

88
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,322
I'm just going there for some healing.

89
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,991
You know, massage.
Maybe some gentle fasting.

90
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,160
Great, well,

91
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,162
I'm not the bearer of good news, Franny.

92
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,080
‐ What is that supposed to mean?

93
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,751
I think it is beautifully written,

94
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,754
I really, really do.

95
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,175
‐ W‐‐ wait a minute. Are‐‐ are you s‐‐

96
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,345
are you saying they don't‐‐
they don't want the book?

97
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,223
There's no easy way
to say this, Franny,

98
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,849
so I'm just gonna tell you.

99
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,393
They want to buy you
out of your contract.

100
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,773
I'm so sorry about this, Franny,

101
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,399
especially after everything that happened

102
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,109
with that horrendous grifter man.

103
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,736
I mean, I just feel so awful for you.

104
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,405
‐ I do not wanna talk about this with you.

105
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,287
That's it.

106
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,250
I'm done. This is how it ends.

107
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,835
Dead to the fucking world!

108
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,254
Fucking dead!

109
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,842
You're dead
to the fucking world!

110
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,970
Oh, my God.

111
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,263
Hello?

112
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,766
You okay?

113
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,061
You‐‐ do you need some help, Miss?

114
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,313
‐ No. I'm‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm good. I'm good.

115
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,731
‐ You don't seem good.

116
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,944
‐ Well, I was just having
a quiet moment of despair.

117
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,030
‐ Okay. Well, that's your idea
of a quiet moment?

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,365
'Cause you seemed...

119
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,449
You're screaming like a banshee.

120
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,742
That's why I pulled over.

121
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,328
‐ Well, I'm sorry. I apologize.
‐ It's okay.

122
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,790
‐ I thought I was in the middle
of nowhere, completely alone.

123
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,834
Clearly, that is not the case.
‐ Are you sick?

124
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,546
‐ I beg your pardon?
‐ You seem to be having

125
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,924
some kind of a mental breakdown
episode sort of thing.

126
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,135
I'm not judging, you know, I got, uh‐‐

127
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,970
I got mental illness in my own family.

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,055
‐ Is that right? I'm fine, thank you.

129
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,099
‐ You know, it's not normal
to be screaming...

130
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,435
"dead to the fuckin' world"

131
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,103
at the top of your lungs, you know?

132
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,188
‐ You know what it is?

133
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,064
I was having a hot flash.

134
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,442
‐ Oh.

135
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,320
‐ So I'm good. Thank you so much.

136
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,238
‐ Do you take supplements?

137
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,575
‐  I'm sorry. W‐‐

138
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,785
‐ Proges‐‐ Progesterone? Progesterone.

139
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,331
I heard that helps.
‐ Are we actually
having this conversation right now?

140
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,333
‐ What's with the tone, lady?
‐ I don't have a tone.

141
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,045
I am just not used
to complete strangers prescribing

142
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,422
hormone replacement therapy...

143
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,466
curbside!
‐ Apologies.

144
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,010
I can see now that you're a tragic person.

145
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,011
Have a good day.

146
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,820
Good morning.
‐ Hey.

147
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,364
Okay.

148
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,870
Headed to Tranquillum, I see.

149
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,540
‐ Why would you say that?

150
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,000
‐ You're loading up
on all the forbidden food items.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,127
‐ Oh, I'm going there, too.

152
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,839
‐ Excellent.

153
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,674
You'd be lucky
if you get past the front door

154
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,092
with this stuff.

155
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,013
They'll be taking that, too.

156
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,015
They don't allow...

157
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,017
‐ Excuse me?
‐ ... phones at Tranquillum.

158
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,061
What have you heard about the place?

159
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,438
‐ Mm, not much. Uh, the guests
go in looking one way.

160
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,606
Come out looking another.

161
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,358
So she must be doing something to them.

162
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,111
‐ And, uh, have you met her?
The woman that runs it?

163
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,238
‐ No, no, but...

164
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,116
from what I've heard, I'd like to.

165
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,660
‐ Supposedly she completely
changes people.

166
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,998
I mean, that's why I'm going.
To be transformed.

167
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,959
‐ Good luck with that.

168
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,300
Hi.

169
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,486
It's the market, you know.

170
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,323
Romance has taken the worst hit.
It won't be forever.

171
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,408
This tension
is not good for my back, Marty.

172
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,784
Franny, come on, stop it.

173
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,579
Don't‐‐ don't waste your energy
on this nonsense.

174
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,331
Just try to forget about it.
Have a great time.

175
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,458
I'm a blight
on feminism because I described

176
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,544
the eye color of‐‐ of my‐‐ my hero?

177
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,421
Oh.

178
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,134
‐ Namaste. Welcome to Tranquillum.

179
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,887
‐ Ooh, um, so excited to hear about it.

180
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,014
Give me one second. Just one second.

181
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,933
They said I should have killed off Jane.

182
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,476
Who kills their main character? Who?

183
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,645
‐ You must be Frances? Come.

184
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,356
One journey ends and another begins.

185
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,777
Oh, how can they say
I hate women?

186
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,530
I can't hate women.
I am a woman.

187
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,031
And I'm crazy about myself.

188
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,285
Look. It's not too late
to call this whole thing off.

189
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,286
Ben, please, we're here.

190
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,830
‐ I just feel like this is something
we can work on ourselves.

191
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,499
‐ We've been working on it.

192
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,794
We're not in a good place obviously,

193
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,338
and either we try or...

194
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,425
...we don't.

195
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,973
‐ What the fuck is your problem, man?

196
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,976
‐ No problem.

197
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,770
I just need you to nudge it up
a little so I can pull in.

198
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,438
‐ So you're gonna just keep
blowing your horn like that?

199
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,983
‐ Like what? It's a horn,

200
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,109
it's not a musical instrument.

201
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,152
You just, you know, push.

202
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,406
See? It's only got the one note.

203
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,575
Namaste! Welcome to Tranquillum.

204
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,536
‐ Oh, my God, your skin is amazing.

205
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,746
Ben, look at her skin!
I'm Lulu,

206
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,039
one of the Wellness Consultants here.

207
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,291
‐ Cool skin.
‐ Hi.

208
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,542
You guys ready for the tour?

209
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,918
‐ Yes.
‐ Guess so.

210
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,253
Great!

211
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,046
Uh, we'll have to unburden you
from that soon.

212
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,339
Oh, shit.
What?

213
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,674
It hurts, but it's so worth it.

214
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,386
‐ But I'm‐‐ Do you mean like‐‐
like the whole time?

215
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,347
But it's my phone.

216
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,266
Hello?
‐ Can we‐‐ can we

217
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,018
eject him, evict him, get him out of here?

218
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,477
You know‐‐ You know what that is?

219
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,562
I know exactly what‐‐

220
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,564
That's‐‐ because it's just so in vogue now

221
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,983
to kill your characters.
Well, they're my babies.

222
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,568
Okay, I'm sorry if I'm not a baby‐killer.

223
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,236
I don't even wound my characters.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,743
After we get
you checked in, I would suggest

225
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,413
a little forest bathing
to lower your cortisol.

226
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,790
‐ Oh, wow. That sounds nice.

227
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,710
‐ We have an award‐winning arboretum.

228
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,086
And I'll tell you, what‐‐

229
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,713
what I've never been called is dangerous.

230
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:35,881
How would I even be dangerous?

231
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:36,882
Wait‐‐ With‐‐ I'm‐‐

232
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:37,841
Oh, no.
‐ I'm sorry.

233
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,134
‐ No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No worries.

234
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,969
‐  I'm sorry.
‐ Uh, I'm Carmel.

235
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,804
‐ Yeah. It's, uh...
‐ No, get it. I get it.

236
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,015
I was just on the phone with my kids, too.

237
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,975
I miss them so much.
‐ Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

238
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,727
‐ This is Bella. This is‐‐
‐ That's not‐‐ No, that's not‐‐

239
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,105
I'm not doing‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm‐‐
It's a work call.

240
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,274
Oh.
‐ I‐‐ I do something
for a living.

241
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:54,983
So I don't do ki‐‐
Oh, well I...

242
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,235
‐ I‐‐ Not meaning‐‐ I don't mean...

243
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,486
Yeah.
‐ ...to diminish.

244
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,862
I just‐‐ I have to...
‐ No. No, no.

245
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,821
‐ ...take this.
‐ I‐‐ Yeah.

246
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,907
‐ I appreciate what you do. I was‐‐ God.

247
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,492
‐ I get‐‐ No, I‐‐ I understand.

248
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,036
‐ Carmel. It'll be fine, I promise.

249
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,621
They aren't in there.

250
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:09,998
They're in here.

251
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,084
And in here.

252
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,387
‐ You're so pretty.

253
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:26,682
May I ask, is everybody
here beautiful?

254
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,559
‐ As a matter of fact, yes.

255
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,603
‐ Oh, wow.
‐ Including you, Carmel.

256
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,110
‐ Thank you.
‐ Yeah.

257
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,153
‐ It's okay. All right?
‐ No.

258
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,572
I‐‐ I just need to pull something.

259
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,156
‐ Okay. No‐‐
‐ I need to pull something up.

260
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,783
‐ Frances. Frances. Frances.
‐ And then‐‐ I just need to‐‐

261
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:45,659
‐ Frances.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

262
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,203
‐ Imagine you didn't, because you don't.

263
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,915
You actually don't... need to.

264
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,879
‐ Okay. Here's the thing,
something's come up.

265
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,007
So I'm gonna have to leave.
‐ Something always does.

266
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,009
But you're here.

267
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,304
Be here, Frances.

268
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,896
‐ You're very good at this.
Sign here, please.

269
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,609
‐ Hi. S‐‐ um, sorry about before.
I'm Frances Welty.

270
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,360
I didn't mean anything by it.
‐ No, no. I‐‐ No. No, Frances.

271
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,613
I'm sorry, Fran‐‐ Fran‐‐ Frances Welty,

272
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,739
the‐‐ the writer Frances Welty?

273
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,825
‐ Well, that depends on who you ask.

274
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,577
‐ Well, ask me. I have read everything.

275
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,912
I'm a‐‐ I‐‐ I‐‐
‐ Oh, I think we're going.

276
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,788
I'll see you soon or‐‐ or never again.

277
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,415
Chatty. Very chatty.

278
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,834
Here. This is our pool area.

279
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,753
This is nice.
‐ And the, uh‐‐

280
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,171
‐ Oh, God. You?

281
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,381
‐ Crap.

282
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,259
‐ You must be Tony.
Yeah.

283
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,469
I gotta take a piss.

284
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,471
‐ Your personal wellness
consultant will be back

285
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,431
momentarily to assist you.
‐ Swell.

286
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,023
‐ You know, for what it's worth,
I'm not a tragic person.

287
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,401
‐ I‐‐ I'm not gonna...

288
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,948
‐ I mean, don't you vet your clientèle?

289
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,534
He just seems like a criminal.
I don't think he's right.

290
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,745
‐ I 100 percent understand

291
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,997
why they want me to give up my phone.

292
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,875
‐ So no problem, then.
‐ I'm just thinking
in logical terms.

293
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,293
What if there's an emergency?

294
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,753
Like, what
if there's a murderer or a bear?

295
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,880
Okay, logically,
if there's a bear or a murderer,

296
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,173
what are you gonna do?

297
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,726
Breakfast, 7:00.
Lunch, noon. Dinner, 7:30.

298
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,895
And all of our guests eat together.

299
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,188
And how many guests are there?

300
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:42,025
‐ Nine total. It's very intimate.

301
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,611
‐ It all looks so fabulous.
I mean, I already feel better,

302
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,864
I really do. Is this not fantastic?

303
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,157
‐ Yeah.
And this is our spa.

304
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,576
Wow.

305
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,286
I mean, you rarely see engineering

306
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,704
like this in a resort.

307
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,707
The‐‐ the‐‐ the craftsmanship,
the attention to detail.

308
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,749
Incredible.

309
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,295
Hey! Napoleon.

310
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,089
‐ Genghis Khan... Patton?

311
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,383
‐ Oh, I get it. No, uh, Napoleon Marconi,

312
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,218
that's my name.
Oh, Frances.

313
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,928
I thought we were doing a military thing.

314
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,555
I think I lost my guide.

315
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,807
‐ Yeah, it's super to meet you.
You here for the, uh,

316
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,226
10‐day retreat? Us 2.0?

317
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,688
‐ I certainly am.
Ah, there you are.

318
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,273
Thought we had a runner for a second.

319
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,025
‐ Oh. What is this?

320
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,277
‐ Ah, tailored specifically
to your metabolic needs,

321
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,778
so please do not share.

322
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,739
Also it has been precisely constructed,

323
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,157
so please be sure to drink it all.

324
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,200
That is just the best.

325
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,202
‐ Meet my beautiful, beautiful girls.

326
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,454
Wife Heather. Daughter Zoe.

327
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,206
‐ Hi.
‐ Pleasure to meet you.

328
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,374
‐ Likewise. So what brings you here?

329
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,543
Because I have to say,
you look pretty perfect.

330
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,836
‐ Why would you say something like that?

331
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,383
‐ I meant it as a compliment.
I... S‐‐ sorry if‐‐

332
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,678
‐ Uh, I think we're gonna explore
the hot springs, maybe get a quick soak,

333
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,015
do a few laps in the pool,
maybe even visit the sacred spa.

334
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,475
Should I show you
the hot springs?

335
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,977
‐ Please do. Ciao, Frances.
‐ Ciao.

336
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,188
C'mon, ladies.
Jump start on bliss.

337
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,357
‐ Nice to meet you.

338
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,737
Heather's a bitch.

339
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,157
‐ Okay. Uh, your room is this way.

340
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,207
Wow. You have an MRI machine?

341
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,709
‐ Oh yeah, we've got all
the toys here at Tranquillum.

342
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,671
‐ How much does an MRI machine cost?

343
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,673
I wouldn't know, I'm afraid.

344
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,132
‐ I hear tell that Bill Gates

345
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,051
funded all of this,
or at least put up a lot

346
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,971
of the initial seed money. Is it true?

347
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,472
‐ I wouldn't know.

348
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,432
‐ Awful lot of not knowing going on.

349
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,434
What's this?

350
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,061
It's just our legal disclaimer.

351
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,689
Does anyone come all
the way here and not sign it?

352
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,649
‐ You would be the first not to sign.

353
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,318
Hmm.

354
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:55,826
"Clients are prohibited
from posting about Tranquillum

355
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,953
on social media platforms."
Hmm.

356
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,580
‐ Hmm. So,

357
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,457
how do you attract new guests?
‐ Word of mouth.

358
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,671
‐ That's an impressive smile.
I like to think so.

359
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,053
‐ What's that?

360
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,931
‐ Oh. Blood draw. Standard practice.

361
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,975
‐ That's standard? I've already submitted

362
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,019
my medical records, um,

363
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,812
which I found to be a tad bit bizarre‐‐

364
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,898
‐ We do a blood intake every few days.

365
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,317
It was outlined
in the document you just signed.

366
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,111
It's part of how we tailor
your wellness journey.

367
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,323
‐ All right. Fine.

368
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:36,950
Which arm?

369
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:40,996
‐ This won't hurt a bit.

370
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:51,548
You are brave. You are powerful.

371
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,592
You shall be new again.

372
00:18:56,053 --> 00:19:01,350
You shall be
who you came here to be.

373
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:04,645
Yes.

374
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,732
Get a grip, Carmel.

375
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,337
‐ Oh. Come on.
‐ Oh, oh, oh!

376
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,089
‐ I'm‐‐ I'm sorry,
‐  Sorry!

377
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:36,134
‐ No, I'm so sorry.
I was‐‐ I was forest bathing

378
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,345
and‐‐ and I mistook you for a creek.

379
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,055
My bad. I shouldn't have done that.

380
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,057
I just‐‐ You know, I‐‐ I had
to go and, uh...

381
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,475
‐ Yeah.

382
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,185
‐ ...my‐‐ my wellness consultant
was nowhere to be found.

383
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,228
Hmm.

384
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,438
Just don't rat me out
to the warden, okay?

385
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,692
‐ No. The‐‐ Wait, the warden?
‐ Uh, you know.

386
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,069
The Russian lady.
‐ Oh, have you met her?

387
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,405
‐ Uh, no. Not yet. You?

388
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:59,116
‐ No, I haven't. But I can't wait.

389
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,993
I mean, I've heard so much about her.

390
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,705
‐ Sorry, I just be...

391
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,916
God, you look so familiar.

392
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,293
I don't‐‐ I‐‐
‐ No. I'm not.

393
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,465
‐ Yeah. I'm Carmel.

394
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,303
‐ Tony. What are you in for?

395
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,015
‐ Weight loss. Esteem building,

396
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,058
mind and body transformation.
And what about you?

397
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,769
‐ Yeah, no, same thing.

398
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,355
‐ Are you married?
‐ Am I married?

399
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,483
Uh, fuck, this isn't one
of those places, is it?

400
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,027
‐ Wait, what? What do you‐‐
‐ Uh...

401
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,195
‐ What do you mean by that?

402
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,780
‐ Lifelong bachelor.
Rest of my life, anyway.

403
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,200
So, I gotta go finish here, okay?

404
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,203
I‐‐ I didn't even get to the shake.
Nice to meet you, Chanelle.

405
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,080
‐ Yeah.

406
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,250
Right this way.

407
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,420
‐ Oh...

408
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,465
wow.

409
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:58,717
This, um...

410
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,136
this is Heaven.

411
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,391
Welcome to Tranquillum.

412
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,393
Your wellness journey
has begun, Frances.

413
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,564
‐ You know, I have been feeling
rather unwell lately.

414
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:16,777
‐ Hmm. Yes, I know you have.

415
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,365
‐ This is going to be the best thing.

416
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,325
I just know it.

417
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,412
It has to be.

418
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,750
We'll get you well, Frances.

419
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,505
We'll get you feeling
as well as you've ever felt

420
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,507
in your whole life.

421
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,259
‐ Yeah.

422
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,263
God...

423
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:29,600
How did you get in here?

424
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,686
I came in through the door.

425
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,357
I'm Masha.

426
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,323
‐ You're her.

427
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,368
‐ Why are you crying, Frances?

428
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:51,580
‐ Oh, you know.
Just a little bit of...

429
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,791
..."my career
is over" kind of thing,

430
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:59,087
bit of menopause, you know,
mix in a little bad relationship

431
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,924
and a dash of crippling shame.

432
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,383
‐ We're gonna get you well.

433
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,974
‐ You know, uh, I almost didn't come.

434
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,896
And then, when I did get here...

435
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,899
I really thought about leaving.

436
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,986
Nearly everyone here
almost didn't come.

437
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,405
They sense it's going to take courage.

438
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:27,658
And it'll be...

439
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,786
sometimes unpleasant.

440
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,997
And I'll tell you something else.

441
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,415
The people who come here, most of them,

442
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,584
they have fairly good lives.
Comfortable, even.

443
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,420
They come for the suffering.

444
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,510
‐ I don't want to suffer.

445
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:49,221
‐ You're already suffering.

446
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:10,117
‐ No. What the hell? Yup, all right.

447
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:12,744
What?

448
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:15,914
‐ Nothing.

449
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,667
‐ Why is Zoe in another room?

450
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,630
‐ Because the rooms
are double occupancy, darling.

451
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,507
She loves having her own room,
you kidding?

452
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,508
‐ Did she tell you that?

453
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,719
‐ Well, what 20‐year‐old
doesn't want to get away

454
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,387
from her parents?
‐ Perhaps, our...

455
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,015
20‐year‐old.

456
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:36,810
Perhaps, on this weekend...
of all weekends.

457
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:53,660
Just ride it out, sweetheart.
Yeah. Hmm.

458
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,626
Hey.

459
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,424
I thought I might hit the hot springs

460
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,718
before orientation. Join me?

461
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,639
‐ You go, honey.
I think I'll go for a run.

462
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,730
No, I haven't met her yet.

463
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,690
The official orientation is this evening.

464
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,401
But it's fucked up...

465
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,154
that I can already tell.

466
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:32,366
Mm‐hmm. I'll ring you again tomorrow.

467
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:38,705
Hello?
‐ Hey.

468
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,333
Lars?

469
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,961
‐ Forget my voice already?
Where are you?

470
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:47,005
I'm at some fucked‐up spa thing.

471
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:49,258
Again?

472
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,177
Cool.

473
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,555
It's for work.
‐ Yeah, okay.

474
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,182
I'm just gonna
be off‐grid for 10 days,

475
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,017
I wanted you to know. Just in case...

476
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:02,980
I don't know...
‐ Lars, where you go,

477
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,481
that's no longer

478
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,233
any of my business. Is it?

479
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,360
‐ All right.

480
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,656
Well, uh‐‐
‐ Oh, enjoy your 10 days.

481
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:13,824
‐ Ray.

482
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,048
So many rules here,

483
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,011
I would've thought eavesdropping
must be on the list.

484
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,679
‐ Wait, how do you still have a phone?

485
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,016
‐ I don't have a phone.
‐ Right, right.

486
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,017
You just have a‐‐

487
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,519
you just have a watch
and an earpiece and...

488
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,149
‐ Lars Lee.

489
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,233
‐ Zoe Marconi.

490
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,778
‐ And what brings
a Zoe Marconi to Tranquillum?

491
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,616
‐ Um... my pare‐‐ My parents.

492
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:57,993
‐ Hmm.

493
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,538
‐ Yeah, what brings a Lars Lee?

494
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,457
And why do you think
this place is fucked up?

495
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,419
‐ Well, they all are, aren't they?

496
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:09,505
"Wellness retreats,"

497
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,673
just another construct
to separate rich people

498
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,674
from their money.

499
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,302
Get them to feel good
about themselves in the process.

500
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,721
It's such utter crap.

501
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,848
‐ And yet here you are,
spending your money.

502
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,433
Feeling good about yourself.

503
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,686
‐ Wow. You and I could actually
be friends.

504
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:29,441
‐ And how would, uh, Ray feel about that?

505
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:35,322
Hey, honey, hi. Uh, it's me again.

506
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,574
Just leaving you another message. Um...

507
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,118
Look, I'm going to be off
the grid for a few days.

508
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,703
I'm at a wellness retreat.

509
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,874
Anyway,
I'm gonna be unreachable.

510
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,000
Not that you care.

511
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,337
Sorry, uh...

512
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,219
I love you. It's, you know, I'll, uh...

513
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,723
Yeah, love you. Okay.

514
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,728
‐ Tony. I'll need to take your phone now.

515
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,981
‐ Yeah, I was just leaving
a message for my daughter.

516
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,441
‐ Got it. But we have rules, so...

517
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,820
the phone, please?
‐ Uh, yeah, look.

518
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,365
I don't think
I'm really supposed to be here.

519
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,578
I mean, the whole thing
was kind of random.

520
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,246
I was having a terrible fucking day,

521
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:28,250
and I Googled "spa."
And then to save a little time,

522
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,961
I typed in "most expensive"
and your place popped up,

523
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:32,462
but now that I'm here...

524
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,756
‐ We don't really believe
in "random" here.

525
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,595
The phone, please.

526
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,523
Thank you, Tony.

527
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,627
This is going
to be really good for us.

528
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:16,590
I can feel it.

529
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,010
What do you think?

530
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,095
‐ Yeah, this definitely
feels real good right now.

531
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,516
‐  I think
these mineral baths are, uh,

532
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,144
"aphrodisia‐cal"?
"Aphrodisiacal," is that a word?

533
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:31,188
‐ Aphrodis‐‐ I don't know,
I think you just made

534
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:32,898
that one up.
‐ It should be a word.

535
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,149
‐ It definitely should.

536
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,861
‐ You remember right after?

537
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,821
When we went to celebrate at Two Bunch,

538
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,366
and they had to ask us
to leave 'cause we were fucking

539
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,368
so much in the hot springs?

540
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,453
‐ I do, that was crazy.

541
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:50,874
‐ So crazy...

542
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:55,712
‐ Oh, dear.

543
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,756
‐ What's up, man?
‐ Hi.

544
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,008
‐ Am I intruding?
I‐‐ I'd be the last person

545
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,970
to interrupt a romantic interlude.

546
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,805
‐ Come on in.
‐ The more the merrier.

547
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,057
It's just I've been
in a car all day, you know?

548
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,476
All right.

549
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,187
Whoo‐hoo! Wonderful.

550
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,654
Oh, I'm sorry, uh, Napoleon Marconi.

551
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,781
‐ Hi.
‐ Ben Chandler.

552
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,825
This is my wife, Jessica.
‐ Lovely to meet you both.

553
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,207
Oh, wait a minute.
You're not the fella

554
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,334
that‐‐ that drives
the Lamborghini, are you?

555
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,588
‐ I am.
‐ Ho, holy moly!

556
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,883
Oh, boy! I'd like
a ride in one of those things.

557
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,260
Before this is all said and done.

558
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,971
Okay.
‐ Yeah. You see,

559
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:50,642
I'm just a high school teacher.
We got in here on a discount.

560
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,103
‐ You know what?
I'd be happy to give you a ride.

561
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,396
Maybe even let you take it for a spin.

562
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,900
‐ Oh, my God! You‐‐ you're not kidding?

563
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,109
Nah.
‐ Wow.

564
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,945
Thank you.
Yeah, don't mention it.

565
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,031
High school teacher's an admirable job.

566
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,786
The offer is only limited to my car.

567
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,205
‐ Benjamin, stop.
Uh, beg your pardon?

568
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,957
‐ I don't think he was‐‐
‐ You looking at my wife
like you want to take her for a spin.

569
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,250
No.
‐ Oh, my heavens.

570
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,170
Uh, that's not what I‐‐ I mean
I‐‐ You're obviously‐‐

571
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,589
No. I‐‐ Look, I give you my word.

572
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,925
"Thou shalt not covet."

573
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,968
I'm a‐‐ I'm a happily married man.

574
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:28,764
And one of my‐‐ my solemn word.
Sounds good.

575
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,725
‐ I might have to watch out for you.

576
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:33,644
‐ Nah.
Yeah.

577
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,646
Because my wife's a humdinger, too.

578
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:36,939
Oh, yeah?
‐ Yeah.

579
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,191
Yeah, she's pretty attractive.

580
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,778
So much so that my nickname
is pretty much "That guy?

581
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:45,531
Really?"

582
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:47,366
People look at her
and look at me, and think,

583
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,784
"That guy? Really?"

584
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,203
‐ Oh, I get it. That's funny.

585
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:52,996
‐ Yeah, you probably don't get
that because, uh,

586
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,457
you're comparably attractive,
you drive a Lamborghini.

587
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,459
‐ Thank you.
I'll shut up.

588
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,378
I am perfectly willing to shut up.

589
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:01,213
I'm a chronically loquacious person

590
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,631
and if you let me talk long enough,

591
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:06,218
I always seem to find the poop
and step right in it.

592
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,307
All right, so, I'm going to...

593
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,854
adjourn... to here.

594
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:21,608
And, uh, wonderful to meet you both.

595
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,901
You too.

596
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,448
‐ Whoo! What an extraordinary place.

597
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:57,019
‐ Are you kidding me?

598
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:00,564
‐ It's just one.
Tradition, one before every session.

599
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,153
‐ But seriously. We are a health resort.

600
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,614
‐  One cigarette
is not going to kill me.

601
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,993
And if it helps me cope,
better for the guests, right?

602
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:17,539
Something tells me with this group... hmm.

603
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,125
What? What about this group?

604
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,963
‐ Just... the vibe seems
a little charged, right?

605
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,300
Too many cases in the basket.

606
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,721
‐ Masha knows what she's doing.

607
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,696
What do you mean she curates?

608
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:53,367
That's the rumor, she mixes
and matches her guests.

609
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,285
Like a cocktail.
‐ Oh.

610
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:57,412
Not sure how I made the cut.

611
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,164
‐ Well, I guess you must
be really fucked up.

612
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,208
‐ Oh, just your run‐of‐the‐mill asshole.

613
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,210
Oh, hello again.

614
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:04,628
‐ Hello.

615
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,923
Feeling any better?
‐ I am, thank you.

616
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,216
I'm so glad to hear it.

617
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,051
‐ I'm so glad to be able
to share that with you.

618
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:12,928
Have a wonderful life now.

619
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:14,555
‐ You too.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

620
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,017
‐ I bring it out of people. It's a gift.

621
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,564
Namaste.
Where are they?

622
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:24,773
Does anybody know?

623
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:27,818
Or are we expected to self‐orientate?

624
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,696
‐ Hmm. I think they leave us
alone on purpose.

625
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,072
Why?

626
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,949
‐ Like in Law & Order,
they always put the suspects

627
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,535
in a room alone at first
to soften them up.

628
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:39,037
‐ Wait. So, you met her?
I did. Yeah.

629
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:42,374
‐ And did she give you any idea
what to expect?

630
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,251
‐ Suffering.
‐ Uh‐huh.

631
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,795
I have a very low pain threshold.

632
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:47,796
What else did she say?

633
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,923
‐ Uh, that was really
about the gist of it.

634
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:52,593
Really, just that, uh,
we'd all come here to suffer.

635
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,637
And I get the feeling she aims to deliver.

636
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,389
Wait till you see her. She's kind

637
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:00,267
of an amazing mystical
Eastern Bloc unicorn.

638
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,272
See what I mean?
‐ Namaste.

639
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:07,733
Welcome to Tranquillum House.

640
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:16,283
Right now,
you're at the foot of a mountain.

641
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:19,828
And the summit,
it seems impossibly far away,

642
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:22,247
and I'm gonna help you reach that summit.

643
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,542
In 10 days, you will leave here,

644
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,212
you will not be the person
that you are now.

645
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:32,341
You will leave Tranquillum House
and you will feel happier...

646
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,176
healthier...

647
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,970
lighter...

648
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:38,680
freer.

649
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:41,642
And on the last day of your stay,
you will come to me

650
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,977
and you will say,
"Yes, Masha. Masha,

651
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,563
"you were right!
I am not the same person.

652
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,065
"I'm not the same person that I was.

653
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:48,857
"I'm healed.

654
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,318
"I am free.

655
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:54,154
"Free of the negative habits

656
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:57,574
"and chemicals and toxins and thoughts

657
00:35:57,574 --> 00:36:02,579
"that were holding me back.
My mind and my body are clear.

658
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:09,294
And I am changed in ways
I could never have imagined."

659
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,505
‐ Um, did you go through our bags?

660
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:13,757
Because I seem to be missing a few things.

661
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,052
‐ Yes. You are missing chocolate
and wine. As is Frances.

662
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:21,181
‐ Well. And they're both antioxidants,

663
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,432
so...

664
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,185
Yeah, I'm missing stuff, too.

665
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,937
You don't get to just steal our shit.

666
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:34,695
‐ But you're mine now, Tony.
And you want to be mine.

667
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:40,200
You want me to see you.
Peel you. Fix what I see.

668
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:45,247
Tell me... does any
of this feel random to you?

669
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,460
Answer me. Does it feel random?

670
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,507
‐ No.

671
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,513
‐ Oh.

672
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,057
What is it, huh?

673
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,475
‐ I'm so happy.

674
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,563
You are everything I hoped for.

675
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,107
Oh, I'm sorry. But, um,

676
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,193
you want us to just put ourselves

677
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:15,736
in your hands, but...
...we don't know

678
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:18,363
the first thing about you.
I mean, what's your story?

679
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:24,703
‐ My story is I died.

680
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,585
I came here from Russia,
and I worked.

681
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,756
And I worked
and I worked and I worked.

682
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:36,882
I consumed.

683
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,467
I climbed, I worked.

684
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,968
I built a company.

685
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,386
I worked. I consumed...

686
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,013
I went over people.

687
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,306
I went through people.

688
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,016
And then...

689
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:51,146
I was shot dead!

690
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:52,856
In a parking garage.

691
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,400
I was clinically dead.

692
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:04,451
And that man, he brought me back to life.

693
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:09,164
He cut into my chest,
he reached inside me.

694
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:11,333
Just as I will reach inside all of you!

695
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:14,837
Metaphorically.

696
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:20,217
You have all come here to die.

697
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:22,970
And I will bring you back.

698
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,851
There can be birth in death.

699
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,353
Tragedy...

700
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,439
can be a blessing.

701
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,610
I know, I was a corporate CEO

702
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,945
and then boom!

703
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,536
I was a little girl.

704
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,788
And I was riding my bicycle.

705
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:53,834
Reconnecting with joy

706
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,086
and innocence.
‐ Excuse me!

707
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,714
This is not appropriate.

708
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,841
‐ I will decide what is appropriate.

709
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,926
‐ You know our story.

710
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,264
‐ Death will not be your story.

711
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,808
Zoe.
‐  I'm sorry.

712
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:10,934
‐ Oh, honey.

713
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,398
She's okay.
No, she's not okay.

714
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,525
What is wrong with you?

715
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,402
‐ Step to the center, please, Heather.

716
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:23,697
Step to the center.

717
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,457
I prefer you not upset the group.

718
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,669
‐ You prefer I not upset the group?

719
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,922
‐ I prefer you not upset the group.

720
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,965
‐ We came here for a retreat.

721
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:43,258
To escape.

722
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:46,053
‐ None of you shall retreat.
You will not escape.

723
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:48,305
‐ You know why we're here.

724
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,224
Do you really mean
to fuck with us like this?

725
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:51,850
‐ Lapochka.

726
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,103
This is Tranquillum.

727
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,275
I mean to fuck with all of you.

728
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,586
‐ Part of the healing
is finding the wound.

729
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,422
‐ That's why you picked us. Right?

730
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,300
We complement each other's demons.

731
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,930
‐ This is... a particularly
volatile group.

732
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:55,766
‐ Who do you think you're kidding?

733
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,893
I've become a punchline.

734
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:01,688
‐ Tell me, why doesn't
he love you anymore?

735
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,357
‐ I don't know.

736
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:07,611
‐ Although I can get violent,
I am not violent.

737
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,614
‐ Biggest threat to the planet
is overpopulation,

738
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:13,116
and these bloody breeders
keep pumping them out.

739
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:14,826
‐ It's incredible you're still single.

740
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,871
‐ I should have never come to this place.

741
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,081
‐ I'm worried about you.

742
00:42:19,081 --> 00:42:20,249
‐ You don't need to be worried about me.

743
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,251
‐ I don't need to, I...

744
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,586
I want to.

745
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,341
‐ Think of lies we have told.

746
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:30,717
People we have hurt.

747
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,262
What do you want?

748
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:34,763
‐ I just want my son back.

749
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:36,390
‐ This is what you do, right?

750
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,726
You get people to talk about their shit
and then you use it against them.

751
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:44,273
‐ They're on their hands and knees.
They're begging...

752
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,859
begging to be saved.

753
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,235
Let's start the protocol.

754
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:51,822
They're blossoming.

755
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,908
I've been feeling unlike myself.

756
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,619
‐ I don't know what Lars is,
but he's not just a guest.

757
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,163
‐ It seems like
you might be getting worse.

758
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:02,666
‐ There is nothing to fear.

759
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,210
You will all die here.

760
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,341
‐ Is Masha batshit
or is she the real deal?

760
00:43:12,305 --> 00:44:12,282
