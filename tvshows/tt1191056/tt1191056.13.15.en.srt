2
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,164
Well,
thanks for getting a hold of me.

3
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:06,118
- I'm really excited about this.
- Oh, I was so excited

4
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:08,196
to find you,
because I don't know,

5
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:11,351
hardly anything
about my family tree.

6
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,667
This is a part
of me that's excited.

7
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:15,496
You have
good matches, so possibly,

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,194
you could have
some half siblings.

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,761
Right. But, this is,
like a shot in the dark.

10
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,372
You just get
very angry recently.

11
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:22,492
That's what
we don't understand.

12
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:24,810
I'm not a ****ing doormat.
Your reactions are just,

13
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,247
like, over the top,
and that's what concerns us.

14
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,597
So, I'm gonna
do an event next week.

15
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,773
It's actually
called Black <i>Shabbat</i>.

16
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,514
- A Jewish <i>Shabbat</i> dinner?
- Correct.

17
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:35,690
- That's for Black people?
- Correct.

18
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,940
I hope she's not gonna
get on a soap box

19
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:40,608
- and start preaching to us.
<i>- I-I don't know what to expect.</i>

20
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:43,220
- Where's Leah?
- Okay, Leah, sadly,

21
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:45,222
was exposed,
potentially, to COVID.

22
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:46,527
Oh, no.

23
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,790
So excited
to have all of you here.

24
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:51,315
We are having
a "Jew Belong" <i>Shabbat</i> tonight.

25
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,230
When I went to college,
the Jewish people hated me.

26
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,580
- We're not talking about that.
- I'm just saying.

27
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,582
Right now, we're talking
about the Black race,

28
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,886
- and our Jewish friends.
- I wished I was born Jewish.

29
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:08,284
- Ramona!
- Sit down, <i>shiksa</i>!

30
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:13,059
We're not gonna make it about
you and your white isolation.

31
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:14,793
Are we getting our first course?

32
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:18,167
- We're not done with <i>Shabbat</i>.
- This is nuts, Leah.

33
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,170
Like this is why
I needed you here.

34
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,433
I need food.
What did they tell you to do?

35
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,870
I don't even understand
what happened to Ramona.

36
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,551
I kinda regret doing
this whole thing, by the way.

37

<font color=#FFc30f>"Bitching and Ramoaning"</font>

39
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,833
Like,
why does Sonja get it,

40
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,793
Luann gets it,
Ramona doesn't ****ing get it.

41
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,490
Well, I'm just gonna
have a little something,

42
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,449
because I'm getting
a little hangry.

43
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,858
Can I have this?
This is my plate?

44
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:42,627
I'll eat it now. Okay, great.
It's just, I need food.

45
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:45,499
You know, I was running all day.
I went with my accountant,

46
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,022
I did business with real estate.

47
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,241
I didn't have time to eat.
I really didn't eat.

48
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:51,505
And, we've been
here now for two hours,

49
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:53,280
and I know we're doing
all these prayers and stuff,

50
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,901
and you know, it was delicious,
but I need food.

51
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:58,382
What can I say?
Sometimes, when there's no food

52
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,999
to put in my mouth,
my foot goes in my mouth.

53
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:03,210
Like, I feel like
I'm being so diplomatic.

54
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,499
You know what I think?

55
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:12,831
I think we're flustering
the host, the hostess.

56
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,225
Is it host or hostess?
You know, they say,

57
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:16,965
it used to
be waiter and waitress,

58
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,663
and now,
it's just waiter, you know?

59
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,491
It's supposed to be,
like, singular sex,

60
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,970
I mean,
it's so confusing.

61
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:24,843
Her, she,
uh, them.

62
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,889
You know, seriously, things
have changed in this world.

63
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,979
I'm a little older,
and I'm learning the new world.

64
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,675
But right now, I'm starving.

65
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:39,289
I'm not gonna expose you
to this, this is a sh... show.

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,382
Yeah,
I'll call you after.

67
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,817
Thank you, I love you,
I'll talk to you later.

68
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:47,993
Thank you.
Love you.

69
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:52,420
Listen, I bring you to
a beautiful home, with beautiful

70
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,569
people, there's beautiful food,
and beautiful drinks.

71
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,876
All you gotta
do is shut the hell up

72
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,311
and enjoy,
and Ramona can't even do that.

73
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:04,056
I think I left my purse in here.

74
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,710
So,
it's like a feta, but better?

75
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,494
I left it in
the other room, I think.

76
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:09,017
Oh, those look good.
Oh, here it is.

77
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,758
But you didn't
add too much of it?

78
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,630
And then the roasted red peppers
are great.

79
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,458
- What are you doing?
- I'm starving,

80
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,068
- I haven't eaten all day long.
- You're kidding me.

81
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,765
They want to bless
the bread yet.

82
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,289
- Oh.
- We have another hour to go.

83
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,768
Ramona's in
the kitchen, eating.

84
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,944
Lu, let her eat.
That's fine.

85
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,033
What does that mean,
she's in the kitchen eating?

86
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,861
- She's eating in the kitchen.
- She's that hungry?

87
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,602
- Yeah.
- She's a grown-up, like...

88
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,256
Thank you
for making the effort.

89
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,519
Oh, effort!
I'm having a great time.

90
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:34,521
- Are you having fun?
- This is better than a show.

91
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:35,954
Good.

92
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:38,960
I'm giggling, because it's
shocking, and embarrassing.

93
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:42,007
I just feel very misunderstood.
Tonight wasn't even about,

94
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,009
actually,
it wasn't about Black people.

95
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:47,795
This is supposed to be about
human values that we all have.

96
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,710
Well, everybody
doesn't have them.

97
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:53,801
When Ramona's hungry, the human
values go out the window.

98
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,847
Shocking and embarrassing
leads to me giggling.

99
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,889
What can I tell you,
that's how I cope.

100
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,070
- Are you okay, baby?
- I don't know.

101
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:04,074
I think, I had a, I had a
meltdown. I had a meltdown.

102
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,162
I don't...
Listen, I didn't eat all day.

103
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,947
You haven't eaten a morsel,
so you're starving?

104
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,992
- You're hungry...
- No, it's hangry. Hangry.

105
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,777
I understand, you were hangry.

106
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,692
- We're ready to serve, right?
- Okay, fine. Yeah.

107
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,520
I'm just gonna
make the blessing over the wine.

108
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,565
- Perfect.
- On page five.

109
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,959
- Where's Leah?
- She said **** us.

110
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:24,528
I don't blame her.
I'd like to bless with tequila.

111
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,574
- Here's tequila.
- I don't think the Jews do that.

112
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,489
- Yes, they do.
- Do they?

113
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,970
- Jew Belong, are you kidding me?
- I'll Jew Belong!

114
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,798
Let her do the toast, please.

115
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,974
You should worry
about what you're saying.

116
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,932
Shh. Can I, can
I have a little bit of...

117
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:43,155
Shh, wait. Wait, just wait.

118
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,375
Everybody stay with me:

119
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,683
Sonja's been drinking non-stop
since we got on the bus,

120
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,859
like, three hours ago,
and with no food.

121
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:53,470
So, this is not
going to be pretty.

122
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,428
Yes.
Here's our entrees.

123
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,996
I'm gonna run
off to the restroom.

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,737
- Okay, baby.
- Thank you.

125
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,739
Thank you. This looks beautiful.

126
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,436
<i>Challah!</i>

127
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,829
<i>- Challah!
- Challah!</i>

128
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:07,658
Eboni,
I feel, were you happy?

129
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,573
- You feeling okay?
- I'm good.

130
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,662
I just want my
friends to see what we do.

131
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:14,142
We do this routinely.
I mean, it's hard.

132
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,883
You know,
in many ways, maybe Ramona's

133
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,016
outburst was accurate because everybody...

134
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,018
Everybody doesn't get what we do, Archie?

135
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,150
No, no,
I do this with my friends.

136
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:24,544
A lot of my friends are Jewish,
and I've gone to temple,

137
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:26,154
and I almost converted...

138
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,505
I would never think
you were anti-Semitic,

139
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,550
but what I do want you
to understand though,

140
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,900
Ramona, is the reason
this is Black <i>Shabbat</i>

141
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,120
- is because there's a special...
- Bond...

142
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:37,644
...between Blacks and Jews.

143
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,777
- Yeah, between Blacks and Jews.
- Yeah, I think it's fabulous.

144
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,083
- It's not meant to alienate...
- Right.

145
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:45,173
...Italians or Scottish
people or anyone else.

146
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,611
It's just to say
that in this country,

147
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,917
we kind of share
a unique experience.

148
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,702
I understand. I get it.

149
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,138
Thank you,
Ramona, for being open

150
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,575
to revisit it,
because that's important.

151
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,882
Guys, I hate to do this,
but I'm going to pull us

152
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,840
- back to the <i>Shabbat</i>.
- Don't hate to do it.

153
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:02,408
Don't hate to do it at all.
This is a <i>Shabbat</i> dinner.

154
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,236
Okay,
as I said at the beginning,

155
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,934
<i>Shabbat</i> is the perfect
time to do soul searching.

156
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:09,850
For so many people, it's so
hard to show their heart.

157
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,548
- So, show me your heart...
- I am.

158
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,593
Hold on, I have to think
about my questions.

159
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,421
I don't wanna read anymore.
I want talking now.

160
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:18,729
Wait, so I wanted to share
Ramona, you're not running sh...

161
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,035
You're running, alright?
It's not yours.

162
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:24,125
So, the questions
about the week are on page 20.

163
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:30,044
- So, everyone can pick one.
- Okay, what makes my heart beat?

164
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:33,091
- Whoa.
- More one-on-one relationships.

165
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,572
- Yeah.
- More of the one-on-one.

166
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:38,488
I need that, and I'm not talking
about with my girlfriends.

167
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:41,578
I'm talking about my
philanthropy, and my message.

168
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:45,122
I'm talking about now more on a
one-to-one basis for soul food.

169
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:45,818
You know what I mean?

170
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:48,146
Like I won't do the
$1200 ticket bull****

171
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:53,067
We raise real
money for real causes that

172
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,939
a lot of
people don't care about.

173
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,984
Sonja, a lot of times just
has one drink too many,

174
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,290
she has diarrhea of the mouth,

175
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,466
she's like
a broken record,

176
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,642
and she doesn't let anybody
else have a chance to talk.

177
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,470
- It's annoying.
- The dinners I do...

178
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,864
- Oh my God.
- ...don't even cover the wine.

179
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:09,606
So the wine that's donated
is like, I don't know, $1200.

180
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,216
Alright, who has
the next question?

181
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,870
- I don't, we don't have...
- Next.

182
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,567
Excuse me, jealous bitch.

183
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,177
- I'm not jealous.
- Well, why'd you cut me off?

184
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:17,962
Because she
took over the questions...

185
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:21,792
The charities I do
have step and repeats.

186
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:24,185
- That's great. Are you next?
- What you do you?

187
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,884
Why don't you tell us what
you're doing on a daily basis?

188
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:30,670
Because this woman is on the
ground, she is helping people

189
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,325
to come out of prison
and get a home, and a job.

190
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,676
What are you doing on
a daily basis to help somebody?

191
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,635
So don't shut me up.

192
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,027
- It's okay, Sonja, it's okay.
- Alright.

193
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:43,248
So, don't you ever shush me

194
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:47,208
for my works of faith,
and giving back compassion.

195
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:50,690
Never shush me.
Please, have some boundaries

196
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,911
and do something for others,
and stop social climbing,

197
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:56,043
social ****ing
climbing for yourself.

198
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,176
For what?
Another yacht?

199
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,874
Another plane?
Another dress?

200
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,660
- Another Gucci?
- Okay, Sonja, that's enough.

201
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,183
Wow. She's lost
her mind. This is scary.

202
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,793
Oh yeah, I lost my mind.

203
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,578
- Why don't you find one?
- No, no, no, no.

204
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,231
Find a purpose.

205
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,317
Find a ****ing purpose.

206
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:21,025
Oh, yeah. I lost my mind.
Why don't you find one?

207
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,983
Find a purpose.

208
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,812
Find a ****ing purpose.

209
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,902
Here's the thing.
She needs to cool off.

210
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:32,079
Archie, don't worry about it.
She's upset.

211
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:35,735
I feel nuts, but I feel like
we need to continue <i>Shabbat</i>.

212
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,913
Luann, I raised money
with Michael for AIDS awareness.

213
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,439
- I know, but don't, don't...
- These are not just

214
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:43,431
****ing people
to social climb.

215
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:45,179
- I know.
- She's not doing the hard work,

216
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,138
she's not
doing the heavy lifting.

217
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,183
- She needs to do more.
- But you know what? Now's not...

218
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,750
And then she sits
at dinner being disruptive

219
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,622
and she needs to get real

220
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,928
and do the
work and feel the other people,

221
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,756
- feel other people's pain.
- I know, but for some reason,

222
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,889
I don't think we're going
to change her mind tonight.

223
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,978
I'm gonna say
this, and I mean it with love.

224
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,762
Time out on the
white people for tonight.

225
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,461
- We're gonna go with...
- Oh, we're segregated now?

226
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,637
- That is so funny.
- We've been segregated.

227
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,727
Well, I'm both.
I'm white and Black.

228
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,772
Ramona just said she's
white and Black.

229
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,165
Ramona is pulling
a Michael Jackson tonight.

230
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,775
I go both ways.

231
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,124
We're gonna hear
from the culture.

232
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,778
And, we're gonna go to Linara.

233
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,650
What question
would you like to answer?

234
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,303
Yeah, Linara.

235
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:24,828
When did I feel that my
life was most meaningful?

236
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,439
Last year, at
this time, I gave birth

237
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:30,790
to a 29-weeker,
and I was in the NICU for...

238
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,923
Wait, excuse me, time out.

239
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,273
- Mm-hm.
- You gave birth early?

240
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,057
Because normal is what?
40?

241
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,103
- It's 40 weeks.
- Wow.

242
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,279
So me and my son almost died.

243
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,847
- Oh my God, are you serious?
- Shh.

244
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:49,505
I had some poor medical service,
as most Black women experience.

245
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,245
Do you think that
the treatment that you got

246
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,899
was because you were Black?

247
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,422
I know the treatment
that I got because...

248
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,337
Because why?

249
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:59,340
I have fibroids, and I had
a fibroid that was degenerating.

250
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,995
They just didn't believe
that I was actually in

251
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,171
as much pain
as I was communicating.

252
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,870
So, instead they thought
that I was addicted to drugs.

253
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:09,394
- What? Oh, come on.
- And they treated me,

254
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,527
as I was
asking for pain medicine

255
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,096
for five days that I was trying
to hurt myself and my baby.

256
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,316
And so because
I was in pain for so long,

257
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,753
- it induced my labor.
- So, how would a white woman

258
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,538
be treated
differently than you?

259
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,366
- That's a good question.
- Medically, medically.

260
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,151
How would I have
been treated, may I ask?

261
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,849
Should that have been
you, and there is a study

262
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:32,765
that just came out
last week that a white woman,

263
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,376
you would have
gotten the pain medicine

264
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,117
during the time frame

265
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,119
in which you needed to
in order to manage it,

266
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:41,034
and get ahead of it.
So, that, that would have

267
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,558
- never happened.
- Let me tell you something.

268
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,255
I gave birth
to my daughter,

269
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,474
and I was in
major pain and I had a nurse,

270
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:49,303
and she was Black,
and I said I am having

271
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,479
so much pain
and she wouldn't believe me.

272
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,786
She goes, "You're not
having pain." I was screaming

273
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,397
and I'm like, "**** you,
I need painkillers."

274
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,399
I mean, I didn't have a
second baby because of the

275
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,750
pain I had from my first,
and I was a white woman.

276
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,969
My doctor didn't take care
of my pain, my nurses didn't.

277
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,928
That's not how it usually
goes, is what she's saying.

278
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,321
I'm just saying I was in ****ing
pain and no one paid attention

279
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,019
- to my pain.
- Well, you're very special.

280
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,890
She's saying that's
not how it goes normally.

281
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,239
I'm just saying.

282
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:14,241
I mean it happens
to white people too.

283
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,896
Some white people,
not most white people.

284
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,421
- Did you hear what she said?
- This is a runaway train.

285
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,206
You jump out
the window, you're doomed.

286
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,121
If you stay in the
train, you're doomed.

287
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,862
I mean, either way,
you're gonna crash.

288
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,559
I feel like
you are the most graceful.

289
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,213
Thank you.

290
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,475
Like everything
you say is with grace.

291
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,433
She is.

292
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,435
Most people would have
cursed Ramona the **** out

293
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,089
- when you ask them that.
- Like me.

294
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,917
Well, I like
to ask questions, I'm sorry.

295
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,876
I know, but it comes
across, wait a minute,

296
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,921
Archie,
Archie, wait, one second.

297
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,444
I need to speak on this.

298
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,795
What Ramona
doesn't realize, and I think

299
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,842
I also have a high tolerance
for Ramona's inquisition,

300
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:54,630
at some point, the questioning
feels... adversarial.

301
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,457
- That's my personality.
- I understand,

302
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,808
but I want you to know,
because I do care about you.

303
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,548
- I question like a lawyer.
- We talked about it.

304
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,942
- I question things.
- Because I don't want you,

305
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:06,250
Ramona, looking unlike your
spirit, so therefore you have to

306
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,209
make space for the fact that
when you question this woman

307
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:11,516
about her experience
giving birth, surely...

308
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,952
No,
I'm in shock that a doctor...

309
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,824
So, then say "I'm in shock."

310
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,956
- I'm in shock. I am in shock.
- Thank you. Say that.

311
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,436
Okay.

312
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,394
I believe in Ramona Singer.
God help me,

313
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:23,049
I believe in Ramona Singer.
And I really want Ramona to

314
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,572
understand that what she's saying

315
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,618
is not becoming,
and I don't even think

316
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:29,490
it's really her on a visceral
level, but I'm really about to

317
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,275
run out of patience with
Ramona's ass.

318
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,103
That wasn't Linara's answer.
Now, Lu's going to pick

319
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,887
- a number.
- I just have one more question.

320
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,323
Did you,
she was a different doctor?

321
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,674
- Yes.
- Are we closing this up soon?

322
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,632
We're not closing it up.
You can get an Uber.

323
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,547
- You need to go?
- It's like nine o'clock.

324
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,549
I've been here for four hours.
I'm tired.

325
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,943
- I want to go home and sleep.
- Yeah, go home.

326
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:49,336
Things are happening
here tonight.

327
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,338
Nobody that doesn't
want to be here should be here.

328
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,166
- No, I'm just tired.
- I understand.

329
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,646
You should go home, Ramona.
Go ahead.

330
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,387
- I get it.
- I'm not holding anybody hostage

331
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,345
- at god damned Black <i>Shabbat</i>.
- No.

332
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,565
If you don't want to be
here and listen to the spiritual

333
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,306
work being done,
get the **** out.

334
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,177
Nathan, I'm tired.

335
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,310
I've been studying, working,
so call me an Uber.

336
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:08,222
I'm gonna say
goodnight, okay?

337
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,314
Sorry, Archie,
this is too much.

338
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,098
No, it's not.

339
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,100
- You have went out of your way.
- I am so sorry.

340
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,015
I've been as patient as
I know how to be

341
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,930
with your
...ing friend, Ramona.

342
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,019
You don't want to do the work,
get the **** out.

343
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,065
- Don't blame her on me.
- I don't know what's going on.

344
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,067
Do you really want to leave?

345
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,938
Is this you trying
to undermine this evening?

346
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,418
And what it's about?

347
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:29,463
Or are you
just too damned selfish

348
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:33,119
to appreciate what is
in front of you? Bitch, bye.

349
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,208
I mean, if I wasn't tired,
I'd stay for another hour,

350
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,208
but I'm tired and you know what,
I have to listen to my body.

351
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:41,562
I appreciate that.

352
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:44,130
It was already an hour and
a half drive to get there.

353
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,393
I've been there for over
three hours. Even weddings don't

354
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,569
last more than three or four
hours, and this isn't a wedding.

355
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,397
Well, I'm leaving in
a couple of minutes, so.

356
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,703
Oh, you're gonna
take an Uber home?

357
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,705
Yeah. I'm tired.

358
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,620
You came, and you participated,
which is what I appreciate.

359
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,491
Yeah, I was going
to answer the question.

360
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,363
What would I like
to change about myself?

361
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,452
- To be more filtered.
- More what?

362
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,671
- More filtered.
- Oh, more filtered.

363
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,108
Because sometimes,
I say things...

364
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,023
Okay, before,
okay guys, guys,

365
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,547
Ramona's gonna leave
us probably a few minutes early.

366
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:12,332
But, she wants to
offer her answer first.

367
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,335
If I could change one thing
about myself, what would it be?

368
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,641
Oh, I love that.

369
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:19,209
- To be less unfiltered.
- Okay.

370
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,777
I sometimes
speak without thinking.

371
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,954
I didn't mean to insult
anybody tonight. I know I did.

372
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:27,086
I'm sometimes like
a two year old,

373
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,348
- I'm trying to get better.
- Yeah.

374
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,089
I know I'm not perfect.

375
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,048
No, that's what I'd like
to change, and I want

376
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:34,398
to still be
honest and say how I feel.

377
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,661
But sometimes, I don't think
about other people's feelings

378
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:39,577
and I don't take in
what they're saying, before

379
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,580
I jump on what I'm feeling
and thinking so.

380
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:45,148
- Oh, wow, well said.
- Have you always been like that?

381
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,106
- Even when you were a kid?
- I was worse.

382
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,108
- I've gotten better.
- No, you're much better.

383
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,154
- You don't understand.
- They say she's better.

384
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,504
- She's much better.
- That's embarrassing.

385
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:57,160
But I still gotta get better.
I gotta get better.

386
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:00,554
Ramona's come such a long way
and I thought we exhausted all

387
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:04,341
- that bad behavior.
- So I don't get why he's here.

388
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,256
I heard that you
never go out without him.

389
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,779
Is that really true?
That's like so strange.

390
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:09,694
At least I have friends,
you have no friends.

391
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,783
You have nobody in your life.
Right now, you have Jason.

392
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,263
You'll probably
mess that up too.

393
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,743
143 something?

394
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:18,224
114. Don't you think
you should have written it down?

395
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,618
So you remember? So you
don't have to ask me again?

396
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,446
You knew that if Avery
was coming down here,

397
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,274
it was because I have
a huge anxiety problem.

398
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,102
It would
be to get me on the plane.

399
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:27,538
Aviva, you're missing the point!

400
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,105
- Don't yell at me.
- Take a Xanax!

401
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,758
- Call my husband.
- Calm down!

402
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:34,023
You're in the press now,
being naked and doing soft porn.

403
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,286
Has anybody approached
your daughter?

404
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,809
Have you explained
to her the situation?

405
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:40,594
- At six? Yeah, she got a...
- No, I'm asking.

406
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,509
You look old
for your age and I look

407
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,860
young for my age,
and that's how it stands.

408
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,513
You are a bitch.

409
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,211
What did
I say that was so mean?

410
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,603
I'm just amazed that she still

411
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,170
had this
kind of behavior in her.

412
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,780
We want to
acknowledge that you had

413
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,044
the self-awareness to say that.

414
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:57,524
I'm construing that as a
bit of an apology to Linara.

415
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,398
- Absolutely, I apologize.
- About her experience,

416
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:00,467
-Yeah
-and that's good.

417
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:03,404
I apologize for losing
it on you, because, you know,

418
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:05,663
I love you like
family, and family does that.

419
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:07,578
- Y'all go ahead and do that.
- They just do that.

420
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,275
- You know, family does that.
- No, I'm serious.

421
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,668
They need to do that.
I'm not sorry

422
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,539
for a god damned
thing I said.

423
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,454
You have come so far.

424
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,805
- I mean every word.
- You really have come so far.

425
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,418
I love you, but you
have so far to go, still.

426
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,376
I'm grossed out.
I am so grossed out right now.

427
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,726
I'm always there
for Ramona, no matter what,

428
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,512
she has a soft place to fall
and maybe, she learned something

429
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,776
tonight, but I'm not
happy about what's transpired.

430
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,734
She eats, and she's done.

431
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,737
Yeah, she was hungry.
She was a ****ing...

432
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:40,303
She ate, then she was less
of..., but still a...

433
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,094
Coming up...

434
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,573
Ramona and I are night and day,

435
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:49,185
and yet, we're very aligned.
It's very weird.

436
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,230
And I never met someone
that I bonded with so fast.

437
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,710
I wouldn't say that
you are like Ramona

438
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,665
- but okay.
- No, we are.

439
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

440
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,984
No Avery, no cocoa.

441
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,726
I'm home alone.
Good thing I like myself.

442
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,991
- Hey, good morning.
- It's me, hi.

443
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,775
I'm just talking
about you, to myself.

444
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,386
You were talking to yourself?

445
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,257
- Yeah.
- How's that going?

446
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,607
It's going,
I mean, usually I talk to...

447
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,696
- It's hot here.
- Really? I'll open the window.

448
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,611
Because I'm always
hot, now I feel fine.

449
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:26,744
But, I'll open a window for you?

450
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:28,572
- Yeah. It's warm in here.
- Okay.

451
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:30,269
How you doing? Oh my gosh!

452
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:32,880
This view, you can never
get enough of this view.

453
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:34,578
I don't think Ramona even
has a clue

454
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:36,188
that she was like over the top,

455
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,147
rude to so
many people last night.

456
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,584
And uh,
you know, I'm not here to

457
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,889
pour gasoline on the fire.

458
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,022
I'm here to, you know,

459
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,242
help her figure out how she's
going to stand back up.

460
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,331
That was quite the night.

461
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,811
As soon as Sonja went nuts on
me, I just like blocked it out.

462
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,423
I know, but it's not the
first time she went nuts on you.

463
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,946
She started saying
really disgusting things,

464
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,774
and I think she's
just talking about herself.

465
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,689
I think she's projecting.

466
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,344
I do think it's sometimes
a reflection of what's going on

467
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:02,867
the inside, when people do that.

468
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,608
I feel like
I'm watching a train wreck.

469
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,653
I feel like, I feel like

470
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,352
she's on a train
and I know she's gonna crash.

471
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,963
- I know. I feel helpless.
- And there's nothing we can do.

472
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,531
Sonja, at this point,
has no regard for people's

473
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,490
feelings, people's
property and most importantly,

474
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:20,189
no regard for herself,
the way she's acting.

475
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:23,583
I love Ramona. Deflect. Let's
keep the focus on somebody else

476
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:27,022
like Sonja, and not myself.
Have you spoken to Eboni?

477
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,328
Yeah, I did.
Um, I mean I did.

478
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:30,982
First of all,
let me just give you

479
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,898
my opinion, before
I hear even what Eboni said.

480
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:36,335
First of all, it was so rude,

481
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,685
and I'm being
totally honest with you.

482
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,948
- I was starving. I'm sorry.
- I understand that, but you have

483
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,560
to reel it in and go,
"Oh my God, am I being rude?

484
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,431
"And I should probably
get back to the table."

485
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,303
I said, "Can I please
get something to eat, because

486
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:48,782
"I'm really hungry. I haven't
eaten all day."

487
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,480
They brought
out all those appetizers.

488
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,395
It wasn't enough for me.
I was still starving.

489
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,701
- If I don't get my sleep...
- Listen, then you go and sneak

490
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,877
a snack in the kitchen and
you get back to the table.

491
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:58,705
I mean, you actually,
you had a whole meal.

492
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,446
No, I didn't.
I just had the corn, the...

493
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,361
I went past the
kitchen to get a diet coke,

494
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,798
and I saw you had a full
plate of food. So, come on.

495
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,931
I had too much to drink.
I admit it.

496
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,759
You've done things on drinking.
So you know what?

497
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,543
-Don't throw it out on me now
-I'm... fine.

498
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:13,590
And attack me for my mistakes
that I've made,

499
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,809
because that's, that's ****ing
tone deaf, period.

500
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,376
I don't
need to apologize to you.

501
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,074
You don't need
to apologize to me.

502
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,988
- I apologized to Eboni.
- I'm not looking for an apology.

503
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:22,773
I'm looking for you to be aware.

504
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,557
Of course, I'm aware.
I called Eboni first thing

505
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,081
in the morning,
and I said, "I'm sorry

506
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,387
"about what I did.
I had too much to drink.

507
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,737
- "I'm tired..."
- It was nine o'clock, Ramona.

508
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,565
- I was exhausted.
- You go out dancing...

509
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,045
Not anymore,
not in the past week.

510
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:35,655
No, but still.
Not in the past week?

511
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,396
No.

512
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,006
The past week,
I've been in bed every night

513
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,704
at nine o'clock, 9:30.

514
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,662
When she's
not dizzy, she's hungry,

515
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,925
and if she's
hungry, she has to pee.

516
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,276
I mean, there's one
excuse after the other, why she

517
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,583
excuses herself from,
typically, Eboni's parties.

518
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,977
And my lesson
I've learned now, I'm never,

519
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:55,327
ever, ever, mark
my words, I'm never gonna

520
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:56,630
drink on an empty stomach.

521
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:01,464
You're funny.

522
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,602
Can you please bring
the cheese and wine out

523
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,952
- for Eboni, so we're ready?
- Okay. Yeah.

524
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,864
Are you,
do you have any clothes on?

525
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,436
What?
You know me, I hate pants.

526
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,438
- You have no pants on!
- No pants.

527
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,961
Is that part
of the fashion forecast

528
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,395
for next year?

529
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,490
I just started to wear proper,

530
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:29,970
grown woman dresses
that come to the knee.

531
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:32,103
Now, you're telling me we're not
wearing pants at all?

532
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,627
- Just the top?
- Millennial, OK?

533
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,629
Oh, millennial. Not boomers.

534
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,502
- Lady Morgan!
- Hi, Eboni.

535
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,634
I'm dying to meet you!
I'm Christie!

536
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,941
- Christie? You're lovely. Eboni.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

537
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:47,466
You have no idea.
Everyone heard you were coming.

538
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,773
Hey baby.
Well, I met beautiful Miss Emma.

539
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:52,428
You finally met Emma.
She's been dying to meet you.

540
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,821
I don't think
last night went the way

541
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,649
Archie and Eboni planned.

542
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,696
But, the thing about
Eboni is she has this quality

543
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,002
where she can discuss
something with you in a very

544
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,657
calm manner
without being accusatory.

545
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,485
At this dinner last
night, I want to apologize

546
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,400
really, for losing it.

547
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,010
Because I was going through
this emotional thing.

548
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,404
That's not you. I think you
and Ramona need to talk.

549
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,581
You two have such a deep 30 year
sisterhood, and I know you both

550
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,627
love each other dearly, but
it's a little tense. You know?

551
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,151
But I don't want her walking all
over me in front of people in

552
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,935
- front of people I don't know.
- I know, baby.

553
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:23,763
And that's why you need
to go to her...

554
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,200
She's putting
out the wrong narrative.

555
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,071
And you controlled it.

556
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:29,421
I think that going back
to Martin, you know, he struck a

557
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,554
chord in you and I've seen
a difference that I love.

558
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,425
Which is you are not
letting people run over you.

559
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,774
What does Luann call you?

560
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,386
A slut!
A one night stand.

561
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,039
If I call
you a stupid slut,

562
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:42,521
that's
how hard you're gonna throw?

563
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:48,701
Show him he's a piece of sh...!

564
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,834
You are not letting
other people tell your story.

565
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,662
So, when Ramona started
doing that sh... last night,

566
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:55,142
you were like, "No!" And you
corrected the narrative.

567
00:21:55,226 --> 00:22:00,191
But I want you two to do that,
maybe over lunch, or dinner.

568
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:03,716
Intimate, loving, but say
what you need to say to her.

569
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,545
You know? So that you don't
snap like you did last night.

570
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,982
Well, I need that
because, you don't act like

571
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,941
- that in front of mixed company.
- That's why... right, no.

572
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:14,466
And you know better, Sonja.
I'm proud that "Mission: Sonja

573
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,947
"stand up for yourself"
has been successful.

574
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:21,560
I really am. But sis, there's a
measure to these things, right?

575
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:24,781
Cheers to controlling
the narrative, and self-control.

576
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,827
So, we're gonna try to work to
find where that sweet spot is,

577
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,829
where Sonja does
stand up for herself, she makes

578
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:32,832
it very clear what she will
and will not take and stand for.

579
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,095
But also has like, some basic...

580
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,184
"social graces",
we'll call them.

581
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:40,100
- Now, you, my love.
- Yeah, and now about me.

582
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:42,146
I have to curse you out
because why did Archie call

583
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,235
me this morning, and tell me...
You might not even remember

584
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,498
this, do you know you peed
in Archie's driveway last night?

585
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,195
Yes, I did.
At the back of the bus.

586
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,154
How you been? I'm just gonna
pee behind the bus.

587
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,156
I'll be over...

588
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,811
Sonja, come on!
Sonja!

589
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:57,944
Holy sh...,
I'm peeing like a race horse!

590
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,120
- Sonja. The ****?
- I had to pee so bad...

591
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,166
- You were all in there.
- But we peed before we left,

592
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,560
'cause I know I can't hold
it 'til New York either, baby.

593
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:06,301
- I gotta tell you...
- I want you to...

594
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,694
I have done things like
that before, peed wherever.

595
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:10,653
This is horrible!

596
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,481
They don't
want pee on their corn!

597
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,917
Wait, Sonja, be careful!

598
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,875
You couldn't hold
it until we got out?

599
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,616
It's not
my proudest moment,

600
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,531
peeing behind the
van, but if I had gone

601
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:22,534
into the restroom, Luann
would've left without me.

602
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,710
Sonja, you are a woman
of such elegance, and class.

603
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,190
Stop it, Marley,
I'm mad at you!

604
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,974
Marley, you've ate the whole
damn board!

605
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,889
You ate more than me,
we didn't eat anything!

606
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:31,282
No, Marley at it all.

607
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:32,718
Marley,
get the hell out of here.

608
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,198
Yeah, we're talking to you!

609
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,026
And by the way,
I'm gonna talk to Ramona.

610
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,854
She did call me
today to apologize

611
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,725
because she knew she
was a ****ing hot ass mess.

612
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,640
Everything was designed to make all

613
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,338
of y'all comfortable
and she was a sh... show.

614
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,948
And you were great,
and Lu was great,

615
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,732
and it was fun...
Well, you were half great.

616
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,954
I was 85% good, until I got

617
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,086
to the van and I was
like, "Okay, I'm gonna pee."

618
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,001
Hey, baby.

619
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,090
I feel bad because
I know Leah likes to see us.

620
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,744
- I know.
- I missed her at <i>Shabbat.</i>

621
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,093
Oh, God.
I missed her at Shabbat.

622
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,791
It was like
I was missing my finger.

623
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,183
Having her at <i>
Shabbat</i> is so important.

624
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:04,968
- Marley, are you serious.
- Oh, Jesus.

625
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:06,752
- Is he humping your arm?
- Marley's humping my arm.

626
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:08,363
You're like any other guy.
You have your stomach

627
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,973
full, and now you're ready
to have sex.

628
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,670
- Right!
- Isn't that funny how men are?

629
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,280
As soon as they eat dinner,
they want sex.

630
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:14,804
Marley, you're
just full and humping.

631
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,196
You'd
be humping Ramona's dog,

632
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,720
but you didn't bring your dog.

633
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,199
I can't wait
for these two to meet.

634
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:21,027
Thank god I got her fixed.

635
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,073
Coming up...

636
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:26,206
So, I'm sitting there the
first six months, no court date.

637
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,252
- But to make a very...
- Which is unconstitutional.

638
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,993
- Whoa, no, no, no, no.
- 17 years old.

639
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,169
- Ramona.
- No, hello... no!

640
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:34,037
Oh sh...

641
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,881
- <i>Hello.
- Darling, I'm in a Hutte.</i>

642
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,456
I know right? It's like,
it could be Colorado,

643
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,371
it could be Switzerland.

644
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:04,764
Look at this. Isn't it cool?
Isn't it great? We miss you!

645
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:10,163
Aw, babe. Don't fall apart.

646
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,470
You're almost through it.
You're almost there.

647
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,254
<i>Who are you having dinner with?</i>

648
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:16,779
I'm meeting up with
the Fortune Society ladies.

649
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,737
Eboni and Ramona are coming,

650
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,826
Sonja, I don't
know where Sonja is.

651
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,698
After the
poop settled, and I started

652
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:24,874
plunging it,
it turned into poop soup.

653
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,876
When you get
the poop soup, and you

654
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,183
plunge it and it goes
on the floor, that's really bad.

655
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,794
Hi, my love.

656
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:35,101
- Oh, look who's here!
- Oh, Lele!

657
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:36,755
- <i>Hi!
- Hey baby,</i>

658
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,757
look how naked you are.

659
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,456
Look how naked?
She's so naked.

660
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,285
And we're in like turtlenecks in
the middle of this alpine lodge.

661
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:46,678
It's really cute, though.

662
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,201
- Isn't it sweet?
- It smells good.

663
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:49,812
I love it,
it's like in our neighborhood.

664
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,422
It's like our go-to.

665
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:53,816
I thought maybe it would
be nice to be isolated

666
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,166
for two weeks, but I'm
actually having a little bit

667
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,079
of FOMO,
and miss the ladies.

668
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,958
Oh, well, I mean...

669
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,178
How are they, Lu?

670
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:10,180
Well, I mean,
Ramona's coming tonight,

671
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,008
so we'll soon
find out how Ramona is.

672
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:15,838
And Sonja, couldn't come.
So, I don't know why.

673
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:21,017
If you leave the
water, the poop disintegrates.

674
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,541
I talked to Sonja over
the weekend. She was doing well.

675
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,454
Why would I pay
for someone to...

676
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:31,328
Oh my god,
when I poop, I feel so good.

677
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:36,815
- Hey baby!
- Okay.

678
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,208
Look who just
walked in the door.

679
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,992
Beautiful!

680
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:41,907
Wow, you're very elegant
for our little chalet over here.

681
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,866
Well, you know, you did such,
I have to say,

682
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,432
I had so
much fun doing that video.

683
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,826
I know last time,
I didn't want to do it when you

684
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,567
did it years ago,
but had I known I'd have

685
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:51,743
that much fun, I should've
done it. Your hair looks pretty.

686
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,397
Thank you, you too.
You look lovely.

687
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,051
It's typical Ramona,
you know. After she's burned

688
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:57,227
down the house,
it's like, "Let's be nice.

689
00:26:57,311 --> 00:27:01,100
"Let's make a grand entrance.
Grand gestures, compliments."

690
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:03,799
There, she's very good.
You look great.

691
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,366
So, okay, we're talking
about Sonja and how we feel

692
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,586
like there was so
much venom and bad stuff.

693
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,415
- Oh, I sent her a text.
- You sent her a text?

694
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:14,331
So I wrote,
"Sonja, do you remember

695
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,246
"all the very
nasty comments you made to me

696
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,248
"at the Black <i>Shabbat</i>?

697
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,425
"You really hurt
my feelings terribly."

698
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,993
- And she didn't get back to you?
- Well, I only sent it

699
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,343
an hour ago. It'll probably take
her three days to look at it.

700
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,214
- No, I know.
- <i>Oh, my food just got here,</i>

701
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,086
<i>- I gotta go, guys.
- Okay.</i>

702
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,566
- <i>Bye guys.
- Bye baby.</i>

703
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,829
The last thing
I wanna hear about is like

704
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:35,439
Ramona gaslighting Sonja.

705
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:37,006
So, I'm out.

706
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,530
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, ladies.

707
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,097
Hi!

708
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:43,447
- Hi, my loves!
- Hi ladies.

709
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,971
- You look lovely.
- Oh, I love your mask.

710
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:49,235
I just got out of work,
just now. Thanks for having us.

711
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,933
The ladies from
Fortune and I have known

712
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:52,499
each other for the last
couple of years.

713
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,937
We have 80 beds in here
for people transitioning,

714
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,503
men and woman.

715
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:58,157
Been in prison,
coming out of prison,

716
00:27:58,241 --> 00:27:59,361
getting their life together.

717
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:06,122
Look at this team of
people waiting for your girls.

718
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:09,473
I love you!
Mwah! Thank you.

719
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:12,868
It always brightens my day
when I see their faces because

720
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:16,001
they're such wonderful
people and such good women.

721
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,482
How many people are living
in the facility right now?

722
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:22,225
Well, I came home
in 2007, and I lived at

723
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,444
the castle when I was there.

724
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,577
There were
56 men and three women.

725
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:28,971
So, I was one of the women.
That was...

726
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:31,622
Are those good odds or bad odds?
I'm not sure.

727
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:35,978
Yeah, Ramona.

728
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:39,329
But, you know,
now I know there's maybe

729
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:42,114
more than
100 beds in there, now.

730
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,116
It's grown over the years.

731
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,376
How old were
you when you went in?

732
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,513
Distribution?

733
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:51,428
I was at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

734
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:54,039
Someone got shot.
And I was there.

735
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:55,562
I didn't go
inside of the building,

736
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,521
but I was outside
of the building.

737
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,436
So, what were they
convicting you of?

738
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,959
- Conspiracy.
- Oh my god.

739
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:02,613
So, somebody was harmed...

740
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:05,094
Okay, conspiracy from
a legal point of view...

741
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,313
- Go ahead.
- Is when you are aware.

742
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,098
And you weren't aware.

743
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:11,056
So, conspiracy is when you
have knowledge of it.

744
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,971
- It was two weeks later.
- And you're not participating.

745
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,147
Two weeks later,
I never reported anything.

746
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,975
- News articles.
- At some point,

747
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,542
- she did know that someone died.
- Yes.

748
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,979
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It is, girl, a hot mess.

749
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:24,374
Just shut the hell up.
We've seen this movie before.

750
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,419
So, now I'm sitting
in Rikers Island.

751
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:28,378
There's always a glitch
in the Rikers Island system.

752
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,293
So, it said
my next court date was

753
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:34,384
December 31st, 20-9999999.

754
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:37,213
So, I'm sitting there the
first six months, no court date.

755
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:39,432
Which is unconstitutional.

756
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,217
No, no, no.

757
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:43,042
- Ramona.
- No. No!

758
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:48,050
Where is the radar
that Ramona was not born with

759
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,574
which says "Do not speak now."

760
00:29:57,534 --> 00:30:00,192
So, I'm sitting there the first
six months, no court date.

761
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:03,195
Which is unconstitutional.

762
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,110
- You're sitting in Rikers?
- Oh yeah, I'm sitting in Rikers.

763
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:07,199
- No, no!
- 17 years old.

764
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:08,766
Ramona.
Yeah.

765
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,464
No, I really have to
pay attention to this.

766
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:14,641
So, they had no court date,
and they're allowing you

767
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,687
they make you
stay there for like, forever?

768
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,471
I believe they have 90 days...

769
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,648
- Did they give you bail?
- No. It's a murder charge.

770
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:23,563
- Multiple co-defendants.
- But you didn't murder anybody.

771
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:25,696
You just heard about it down
the road. You were only 17!

772
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,263
That's not
how the law works, Ramona.

773
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:29,526
Well,
okay, so ****ing change the law.

774
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,354
This is not good.
I don't like this.

775
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:33,530
These questions
Ramona's asking,

776
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,619
it's just her lack of awareness
and knowledge on the issue

777
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:38,622
is a little,
like, why would she know?

778
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:41,712
We don't talk about this
stuff enough, so I think Ramona

779
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:45,020
in this moment is indicative
of a lot of Americans.

780
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:47,544
So, I didn't
have too many options.

781
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:49,851
A lot of people see murders
and they don't talk about it.

782
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,678
Or know about it, they think
hearsay or whatever,

783
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,680
So, I don't... I think.

784
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:56,858
Unfortunately, the system sucks.
It often does.

785
00:30:56,942 --> 00:31:02,341
And I had to settle with three
and a half years prison time.

786
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,343
- You plead guilty.
- I plead guilty.

787
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:06,606
It's important to
hear all of these stories

788
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,826
to make sure that more
people have the knowledge

789
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,046
and can have, you know, more
empathy and understanding

790
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,699
when it comes to these issues.

791
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:16,225
My first prison sentence,
I went up, I wasn't ready.

792
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,053
I know,
I had reservations,

793
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,272
I came back down, I relapsed,
I went back up again.

794
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:23,145
When I came
home, I knew everything

795
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,712
was gonna
be different, you know.

796
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:29,151
What my downfall was, was
that you know,

797
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,153
I used to have
blackouts all the time.

798
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,068
- I know those.
- I used to be able to call

799
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:34,765
somebody and tell me what I did.
They'd say,

800
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:37,463
"Oh, Vilma, this is what you
did." And I'd say,

801
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,291
"I don't wanna hear.
I don't wanna hear."

802
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,554
This time, the last thing
I remember was nine o'clock,

803
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:43,730
I woke up the next day, there
was drugs, there was money,

804
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:45,907
and I still don't know to this
day what happened to me.

805
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,909
- That was it.
- That was your wake up call.

806
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,519
You gotta get to bottom.

807
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,347
I did five
and a half years in prison.

808
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,915
And still,
it took that moment to

809
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,440
realize this can't be my life.
This can't be.

810
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:59,181
Can I ask you girlfriends
something?

811
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,183
Let's say you have
a friend that you really love,

812
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,837
- and you see her...
- Oh, sh...

813
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,100
...down the rabbit hole.
How do you like try to help?

814
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,102
- Oh gosh.
- I'm not naming names.

815
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,625
- I'm asking a question.
- I know.

816
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,627
The thing
is you can try your best,

817
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,759
but it has to come from them.

818
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:15,414
You can be there,
you can support them.

819
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,852
Yeah, just let them know
that the door's always open,

820
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,463
but you have to let them
go through their own process.

821
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:22,944
Like, I said,
it wasn't 'til the rock bottom.

822
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,424
That's the problem,
even if you say to her,

823
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,600
you know, "Oh,
you did this, you did that.

824
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,733
You left with a guy,
you forgot the caviar."

825
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:33,432
I would be mortified,
and Sonja is not mortified.

826
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,913
Sonja's like,
"I know, ha ha ha!"

827
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,610
In order for her
to do something about it,

828
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:40,175
she has to realize what's really
happening.

829
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,398
- Gotta hit bottom.
- I don't want her to go to

830
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,182
rock bottom,
that's the problem.

831
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,576
Yes, she beats up on me,
yes, she verbally abuses me,

832
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,361
yes, she makes up lies about me.
But I'm not giving up on her.

833
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,233
I don't want her
to hit rock bottom.

834
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:52,582
I just don't want her to.

835
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,453
There might
be something that's

836
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:57,456
just there that maybe she
hasn't spoken to you guys about.

837
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,719
She might be fighting
a bigger battle within herself.

838
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:04,159
And she's numbing. Sonja's
numbing. She's numbing hurt.

839
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,378
She's been doing this
for 10 years. It's nothing new.

840
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:09,468
And that's the part
that you two - no!

841
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:11,601
I can't.
No, you can't save her!

842
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:13,603
Listen, I don't like the way you
acted at Shabbat

843
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,953
but I like you Ramona,
and I don't want...

844
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,650
That is unfair to put on
yourself.

845
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,519
No, I agree.

846
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,917
Sonja is accountable to herself,
and all we can do as friends,

847
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,136
and all Ramona
can do as a best friend

848
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,269
is love and support
her friend, that's it.

849
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:29,140
I was supposed
to be gone two hours ago,

850
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,402
but I can't leave
these women.

851
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,274
Aren't they the best.

852
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,232
- I'm so glad.
- I'm supposed to be at

853
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:37,279
an interview with somebody right
now. Oh well, **** them!

854
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:42,501
To be honest,
I just love this.

855
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,503
I'm actually having a really
good conversation with Ramona.

856
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,679
- Oh, good.
- We always do.

857
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:49,900
We do, we do.
Ramona and I are night and day,

858
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,424
and yet we're very aligned.
It's very weird.

859
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:54,861
Yeah, and I never met someone
that I bonded with so fast.

860
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:56,733
I wouldn't say that you
were like Ramona, but OK.

861
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,343
No we are.

862
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,519
But you see
some things that are like

863
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:04,393
- uncannily similar, don't you?
- Well, like your body types.

864
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,003
No, beyond
that superficial though.

865
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,354
- Your shoe size.
- No, meeting of the mind.

866
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,878
You're not that
mind depth as we are.

867
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,968
Because I'm not mind depth?
What does that mean?

868
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,535
What does that even mean?
What's mind depth.

869
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,322
Ramona! Flag on the play!
Flag on the play!

870
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:22,802
Abort! Abort!

871
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:24,891
I don't
know what mind depth is.

872
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:26,937
We have this
brain thing going on.

873
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,766
It's very peculiar.
Yeah. It's surprising to me.

874
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,855
I want to be
mad at you, but I can't.

875
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,553
- Thank you for Black Sabbath.
- Thank you, Ramona.

876
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:36,599
Thank you
for coming and looking pretty.

877
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:39,384
And being a hot mess. Love you
anyway, though. Love you anyway.

878
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,221
Coming!

879
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,270
Kiki!

880
00:34:55,354 --> 00:35:00,318
Hi!
Oh my god, my baby!

881
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:03,013
Hi.
I missed you.

882
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:09,806
No, you look so cute.
Is this a new jacket?

883
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,635
- I got it with Skylar.
- This is nice too.

884
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,767
You guys got all
dressed up for me, I see.

885
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:17,422
I quarantined
for two weeks, I'm all good.

886
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm very excited to see Kiki.

887
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:21,513
- I'm going to my room.
- OK, you go to your room.

888
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:24,386
As much as I love Rob,
I've probably

889
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,341
never been
this happy to see him.

890
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:31,523
I want to make sure
that we're on the same page

891
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,830
- with the school stuff.
- Okay.

892
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:35,571
Like, all the schools
that we're looking at

893
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:37,442
are like, she'll
have a good experience,

894
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,488
you know, she'll have
a lot of opportunities.

895
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:43,402
She's have a whole different
experience than she did.

896
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:46,709
You know?
Isn't that exciting?

897
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:52,849
Real talk, like, $60,000.
You know.

898
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,634
I think, like,
the money is a bit crazy

899
00:35:55,718 --> 00:36:01,466
for a kid to go to
high school at college prices.

900
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,860
Honestly, like, this is
why I work my ****ing ass off.

901
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,775
This is why we work
our ****ing ass off.

902
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:08,082
To give her opportunities.
And yes, some of this sh...

903
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,475
Is very elitist, and I'm not
completely comfortable with it,

904
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,522
but at the same time, we have
to separate that and think about

905
00:36:13,606 --> 00:36:16,046
the education that
Kier is going to be getting.

906
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,657
The private
school application process,

907
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:21,617
when you hear and read things
about it being so competitive,

908
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,662
it's not an over-exaggeration.

909
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:26,752
If I did not hire someone
to help me with this process,

910
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:29,146
there's no way that
I could do this on my own.

911
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,062
She's a smart kid. I don't
really worry about her at all.

912
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,673
It's crazy. I don't know
how she ended up like this.

913
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,675
They want to
know what boards I'm on.

914
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,155
I'm not on
the board of anything.

915
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,027
There's no hospital wings
named after me.

916
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:44,509
I'm a little in over my head.
I'm exhausted.

917
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:45,902
Yeah, I'm tired too.

918
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,640
- I'm gonna get going.
- Okay.

919
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,733
Alright,
well, 'til the next time.

920
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,039
Do you mind if I just sit
here and not see you out?

921
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,867
- No.
- Are you gonna be,

922
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:57,000
- don't be offended.
- I'll be fine.

923
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:59,086
- Okay.
- I'm gonna say goodbye to Kier.

924
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,480
Goodbye, miss.

925
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,570
- Love you!
- Love you.

926
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,400
Make sure your mother behaves.

927
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:14,191
- Coming up...
- Ultimately, your DNA results

928
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,583
were enough
for me to then determine...

929
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:30,076
You're so ridiculous.

930
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,041
Hey, sis!

931
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,086
Girl, you know
Carey's gonna do her lap.

932
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,438
Come on in.
Thank you.

933
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:46,223
- How you doing?
- Good! Oh, hey, Carey!

934
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:49,702
She's so crazy.
Did you see Katie?

935
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:53,187
- No!
- Yeah, Grandma arrived.

936
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,927
Get out of here.

937
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,842
Like, I never seen an urn
in person.

938
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:58,583
- Me neither.
- She was a small lady

939
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,106
but she
filled this whole thing up.

940
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,280
Oh my goodness.
She'll be with me always.

941
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,850
- Wow. It's really nice.
- Only the best for Katie.

942
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,505
Today feels like a combination

943
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:11,596
of the first day of school,
Christmas, and the SATs.

944
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,643
Cheers!
I'm a bundle of nerves today

945
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:16,688
with Linda
coming to give me her news.

946
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,864
You said a gene... what?
So, yes.

947
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:22,128
Her name is Linda, she came
to the house a few weeks ago.

948
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:24,957
If I could find out
who my father is, great.

949
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,307
If I could
find out who some...

950
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:28,570
Even half-siblings are,
great.

951
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:31,137
- Yeah.
- Just anything that gives me

952
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:34,315
a broader sense of who I am.

953
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,621
So what do you think
she's gonna come back and say?

954
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,623
I don't think she's gonna be,
"Eboni, I know your dad."

955
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,146
I think that's like a big ask.
You know?

956
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,801
I'm excited,
but I'm nervous because

957
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,105
depending on what she tells me,

958
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:49,068
here's yet another thing
I now will need to process.

959
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:51,984
Okay, that's the door.

960
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,638
You gonna
answer the door, Carey?

961
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:56,815
Child, this year
has been, like, the most.

962
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:59,253
Hi!
It's good to see you.

963
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,776
- How are you, my dear?
- My goodness.

964
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,994
Starting the year planning a wedding,

965
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,605
and planning a marriage,

966
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,781
ending my engagement,
getting sick,

967
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,783
thank god
recovering from COVID.

968
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:10,046
And now here
comes Linda with more good news.

969
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,349
I just can't wait.

970
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:14,529
Alright, so you had tested
at Ancestry DNA,

971
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:17,920
and ultimately, your DNA
results were enough for me

972
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,578
to then determine
that there are three candidates

973
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,319
for your father.

974
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,061
They're all brothers.
They're all brothers.

975
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:26,715
So, it's from
the same family line.

976
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,978
So, wait. One of
these three men is my dad?

977
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:31,241
- Is that what you're telling me?
- I am almost certain of it.

978
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,330
What?! Wait, wait.

979
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,114
She's like,
"Don't graze over that."

980
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:37,073
Wait, I need to just -
give me a second.

981
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:38,724
Process, yeah.

982
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,730
This is crazy.

983
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:43,384
It's exciting, yeah.

984
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,690
- And these men are alive.
- Yes, they are.

985
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:47,779
Holy sh...

986
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:50,391
- I know.
- I have a dad.

987
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,654
Yes, you do!

988
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:56,310
Oh my god. No, this is nuts,
y'all. This is so crazy.

989
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,225
So, the man who I believe to
be, out of the three brothers...

990
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:01,184
Oh, so you have one that
you think is...

991
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,578
I do, just based on his age.
He's born in 1957.

992
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,144
Your mother's born in 1960.

993
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:07,059
- OK.
- That's very close.

994
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:08,931
Yeah, the other
brother is born in 1951.

995
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:10,802
- OK.
- And then the other brother,

996
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,327
- he's born in 1939. So...
- Oh, it's probably not him.,

997
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,024
No. We would've been...

998
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,243
If she's anything
like me, it might be.

999
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,639
- That's true.
- That's a good 20 years older.

1000
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:25,077
Yeah, see, in ,
he would've been 44,

1001
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:26,949
so that's not out
of the realm of possibilities.

1002
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:29,255
- Definitely not.
- And the one who I believe

1003
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:33,434
is your father, he is married
and he has two daughters.

1004
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:41,746
Oh, God!
This is just a lot.

1005
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,661
Yeah, no. It is.

1006
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:45,663
I don't even think
I was prepared for this.

1007
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:48,274
I told Natalie before you came,
I was like, "Maybe some cousins,

1008
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:51,884
maybe at best,
like an aunt or uncle."

1009
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:56,892
The youngest daughter bears a
very strong resemblance to you.

1010
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:59,460
As does your dad.
Who I believe is your father.

1011
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,981
I think I hadn't
allowed myself to, um...

1012
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:07,468
entertain the possibility that
I had a dad who was still alive.

1013
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:11,950
And wow.
Thank you.

1014
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:15,040
I'm so so happy
that I can help.

1015
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:17,260
Oh god.

1016
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,783
This is a lot.

1017
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,133
And it's all
extremely wonderful.

1018
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:24,485
This is literally the best case
scenario that could've happened.

1019
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:27,792
She found him. He's alive.
Amazing. And a half-sister!

1020
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:30,400
I'll show you his picture.

1021
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:34,843
Yeah.
I do see the resemblance.

1022
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,495
He's cute.
He's an attractive man.

1023
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:40,892
He even has that roundness
to his face, like I do.

1024
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:44,156
You know, those cheeks.
This is crazy! I'm sorry.

1025
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,941
But I wanna
sit with it for a beat

1026
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:48,944
before I start
opening up a million new boxes.

1027
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,294
I wanna just be really
happy that I have a dad.

1028
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:54,776
And just kind
of bask in that truth

1029
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,818
for the first time
in my entire life.

1030
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,342
It's beautiful,
and like the fact that

1031
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:03,175
this man who is my
dad is alive

1032
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,439
and after the new year
I get to do the exciting work

1033
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,963
- of potentially...
- That's what I was telling her.

1034
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,269
2021 will be a year of renewal.

1035
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:13,226
Amen.
Thank you, sis. Yay!

1036
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:16,841
Next time on The Real Housewives
of New York City.

1037
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,322
In high school if I hadn't
gotten mixed up with clubs,

1038
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:22,760
I could've been a star athlete,
I could've gone to a probably...

1039
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:24,893
That's what happens when you get
involved with drugs and alcohol.

1040
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:27,370
- Mom.
- Mm. These are good.

1041
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:31,029
Sonjarita! How are you, honey?
You look so pretty.

1042
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:34,119
<i>We did a test last night for
COVID, and...</i>

1043
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:36,208
She's so fine
that she was totally wasted

1044
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:38,036
yesterday when I spoke
to her on the phone.

1045
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,430
- Are you serious?
- Good to see you? Bye!

1046
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:42,345
Oh my god, I speak
so much sh... about Luann

1047
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:45,261
- and I love her so much.
- I can ****ing hear you!

1048
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:49,436
You ready to
play pin the tail on...

1049
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,878
Harry!

1050
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,880
Oh sh...!
Oh my god.

1051
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:58,100
I feel this is disrespectful
to Harry, he's my friend.

1052
00:42:58,184 --> 00:43:00,847
He's not your friend,
he's my ex-boyfriend

1053
00:43:00,932 --> 00:43:04,456
who cheated on me
and ****ed all my friends!

1053
00:43:05,305 --> 00:44:05,885
