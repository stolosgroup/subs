2
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,291
I can't.

3
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,708
Rodian. Do you want me to cut your bonds?

4
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,916
Quiet. Quiet.

5
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,125
Wake up, boss.

6
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,791
<i>Healing session suspended.</i>

7
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
The dreams are back.

8
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,125
Time to go.
They're lined up to pay respects.

9
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,583
I'll let them know you're on your way.

10
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,208
Did you catch any of that?

11
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,541
Something about friendship?

12
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,208
We really need a protocol droid.

13
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,875
<i>Presenting Dokk Strassi,</i>

14
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,500
<i>leader of the Trandoshan family,</i>

15
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:57,000
<i>protectors of the city center
and its business territories.</i>

16
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,333
That's weird.
I used to work for him.

17
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,208
It's even weirder for him.

18
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:08,875
A thousand tidings to the new Daimyo.

19
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,833
It's an honor to be welcomed
to Mos Espa by you, Dokk Strassi.

20
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,250
May you never leave Mos Espa.

21
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,833
Even when a Trandoshan
pays you a compliment,

22
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,958
it sounds like a threat.

23
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,916
<i>Presenting His Excellency,
Mok Shaiz,</i>

24
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,833
<i>Mayor of Mos Espa
and its surrounding plateaus.</i>

25
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,416
The Mayor's Majordomo, actually.

26
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,541
We were told the Mayor
was coming to pay tribute.

27
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,291
Ah, indeed yes. With apologies.

28
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:52,166
I understand how one might draw
such a conclusion from the correspondence.

29
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:58,791
Very well. Extend my greetings
and appreciation for the Mayor's tribute.

30
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,291
Another understandable misunderstanding.

31
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:09,916
The, uh, only tribute I bear
is the Mayor's heartfelt welcome,

32
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,916
which I express in his stead.

33
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,541
So you bring no tribute?

34
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,458
The Mayor's heartfelt welcome

35
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:24,333
and regrets that he's been drawn away
by pressing matters, milady.

36
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,666
If you had spoken such insolence to Jabba,

37
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,583
he'd have fed you to his menagerie.

38
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,000
Apologies. Ap... Apologies.

39
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,083
Tell the Mayor I'm here now.

40
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:42,333
He knows. Yes, he knows.

41
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,416
Perhaps another time. Next.

42
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,875
Actually, there is one other matter,
if I may.

43
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,416
What is it?

44
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,458
The matter of tribute.

45
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,583
I'm confused.

46
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,750
He wants you to pay him.

47
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,666
What? I'm the crime lord.
He's supposed to pay me.

48
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,458
Shall I kill him?

49
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,208
He works for the Mayor.

50
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,750
Is that a no?

51
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:16,791
That's a no.

52
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,916
Lord Fett offers the gift of your leave
unmolested.

53
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,416
Hmm.

54
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,208
Apologies and appreciation.

55
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:36,250
The Mayor may take it differently,
but I shall indeed convey your sentiment.

56
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:46,750
I would not be surprised if you receive
another delegation in the near future.

57
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,000
- Keep an eye on that one.
- I keep an eye on everyone.

58
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,791
<i>These two Gamorreans
were once bodyguards to Jabba the Hutt,</i>

59
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,916
<i>and later, Bib Fortuna.</i>

60
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,416
<i>They did not surrender
even after their patron was killed.</i>

61
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,125
<i>They were captured alive
as a tribute to you, Lord Fett.</i>

62
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,583
<i>Their tortured squeals
will send a piercing message</i>

63
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,208
<i>to all potential challengers
to your throne.</i>

64
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,375
I do not torture.

65
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:21,166
<i>Well, respectfully, Lord Fett,
on Tatooine you must project strength</i>

66
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,208
<i>if you are to be accepted as a Daimyo.</i>

67
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,541
You were loyal
to both your bosses.

68
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,958
Would you be loyal to me
if I were to spare you?

69
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,041
This is a bad idea.

70
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,166
You should have let them
carry you on a litter.

71
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,166
I'm not being carried
around the streets like a useless noble.

72
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,666
It is a sign of power
to the people of Mos Espa.

73
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,041
They're used to seeing the Hutts
paraded around the streets.

74
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,458
Things would go a lot smoother
if you accepted their ways.

75
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,958
No, we're not here for drinks.
We have business with Garsa Fwip.

76
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,416
Looks like business is good.

77
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,916
Would you like your helmet
serviced and cleaned

78
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,583
- while you wait for Madam Garsa?
- No.

79
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,791
Sure. Here, take both of ours.

80
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,875
"Things will go a lot smoother
if you accept their ways."

81
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,291
Welcome to the Sanctuary.

82
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,916
Would you care to partake
in any of our sundry offerings?

83
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,166
Maybe another time.
I'm here to talk business.

84
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,041
Oh, then business it is.

85
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,666
Would you like your Gamorreans
hosed down and fed

86
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,333
while we are sequestered?

87
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,416
No, no, no, it's fine.

88
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,541
This won't take long.
We can do it right here.

89
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,625
This is Master Assassin Fennec Shand.

90
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,208
I'm Boba Fett.

91
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,583
I have replaced Bib Fortuna.

92
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,416
Apologies. I didn't see your litter.

93
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,041
I wasn't carried on a litter.

94
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,208
I walk on my own two feet.

95
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,625
Apologies.

96
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,541
I'm just here to introduce myself
and assure you that your business

97
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,416
will continue to thrive
under my watchful eye.

98
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,000
Well, thank you, Lord Fett.

99
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,375
And thank you
for the gracious introduction

100
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,166
and for making the long journey
to visit our establishment.

101
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,000
It is our little slice of paradise.

102
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,708
And you are always welcome,
as it is yours now.

103
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,500
Huh. Yours look shinier than mine.

104
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,666
Jabba had many vassals.

105
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:59,500
We've got a lot of ground to cover
if we are to keep his empire intact.

106
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,083
I can make the rounds without you.
Jabba rarely left his chambers.

107
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,791
Jabba ruled with fear.

108
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,750
I intend to rule with respect.

109
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,416
If I may...

110
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,375
Speak freely.

111
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,791
In difficult times, fear is a surer bet.

112
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,625
Huh?

113
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,000
Fennec!

114
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,083
Alive.

115
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,833
Get me to the bacta pod.

116
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,875
What?

117
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,458
Uh, what do you want me to do?

118
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,041
Dig?

119
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:13,125
Dig for that?
Oh, you want me to dig for that.

120
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:20,083
Water. You want me to dig for water.

121
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,791
No hard feelings, mate.

122
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,750
Easy, youngling.

123
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,125
I need some water.

124
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,000
I would like a drink.

125
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:16,000
We could have both escaped
if you didn't sound the alarm.

126
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,375
If you kept your snout closed,

127
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,791
if we can get to Anchorhead,

128
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,708
I can get us off world.

129
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:31,000
I could also strangle you
with this ankle chain

130
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,750
and feed your leg to the watchdog.

131
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,958
Oh, that you understand, huh?

132
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,625
Keep it down.

133
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,375
Quiet.

134
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,250
What?

134
00:31:17,305 --> 00:32:17,404
