1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:05,666
<i>I will vanquish these
interlopers who threaten our planet.</i>

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,500
All I ask in return
is that you remain neutral

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,500
if the Pyke Syndicate
approaches you to betray me.

4
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,375
This will be acceptable.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,791
I abide.

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:18,875
Do you trust them?

7
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,708
They are not foolish enough to see

8
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,625
that the Pykes would eventually
take over the whole planet.

9
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,000
We must prepare for war.

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,333
How much treasure do we have in reserve?

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,750
I have plenty of credits.
What I'm short on is muscle.

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,750
Credits can buy muscle
if you know where to look.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,074

14
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,666
You look lost.

15
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,791
I'm here for Kaba Baiz.

16
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,250
What makes you think he's here?

17
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,875
What do you want of him?

18
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,458
He owes
someone important money.

19
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,708
Who?

20
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,458
That's not my business.
I'm here to bring him in.

21
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,208
Well, if I see him, I'll let him know.

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,375
I see him right now.

23
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:11,250
That's not me.
That doesn't even look like me.

24
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,166
I'm gonna give the rest of you

25
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,541
the opportunity to walk out that door.

26
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,541
I have no quarrel with you.

27
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,958
They're not going anywhere.

28
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,375
Looks to me like you're surrounded.

29
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,041
But you look like the practical type.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,791
Let's discuss our options.

31
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,083
I can bring you in warm,

32
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,416
or I can bring you in cold.

33
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,375
Attack!

34
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,041
Your boss is dead.

35
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,833
I'm here to collect on his bounty.

36
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,291
I have no trouble with any of you.

37
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:19,083
There's a pile of New Republic credits
in there that I have no right to.

38
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,791
If you do me the honor of letting me pass,
you all can help yourselves

39
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:28,333
to whatever you think you deserve
from your former employer.

40
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,583
I'd like my reward

41
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,083
and the information you promised.

42
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,958
My business is my own.
Where is it?

43
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,083
Where is the closest
access shaft to the substrata?

44
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,958
You can keep your reward.
There's a bounty on this Klatooinian.

45
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,791
If you won't give me the information,
someone else will.

46
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,500
I'd put that on ice if I were you.

47
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,833
Tend to him.

48
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,333
I didn't know
if I would ever see you again.

49
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,625
Thank you
for saving me on Nevarro.

50
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,375
I am sorry for your sacrifice.

51
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,291
There are three of us now.

52
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,708
We'll put you to work soon enough.

53
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,000
What weapon caused such a wound?

54
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,791
This.

55
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,125
Paz Vizsla, bring it to me.

56
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,875
All this talk of the Empire,
and they lasted less than 30 years.

57
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,333
Mandalorians have existed 10,000.

58
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,791
What do you know of this blade?

59
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,125
I am told it is the Darksaber.

60
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,208
Indeed.

61
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,333
Do you understand its significance?

62
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,208
Whoever wields it
can lead all of Mandalore.

63
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,666
If it is won by Creed in battle.

64
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:00,083
It is said, one warrior will defeat 20,
and the multitudes will fall before it.

65
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,875
If, however, it is not won in combat

66
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,083
and falls into the hands
of the undeserving,

67
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,625
it will be a curse unto the nation.

68
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,500
Mandalore will be laid to waste

69
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,541
and its people scattered
to the four winds.

70
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:24,625
The hilt is of a quality
of beskar I have never seen before.

71
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:29,625
It was forged over 1,000 years
ago by the Mandalore Tarre Vizsla.

72
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,416
He was both Mandalorian and Jedi.

73
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,458
I have met Jedi.

74
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,541
Then you have
completed your quest.

75
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,833
I have.

76
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,750
Then you may join our covert
as we rebuild.

77
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,958
- This is the way.
- This is the way.

78
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,750
This is the way.

79
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,041
Where did you
come upon the Darksaber?

80
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,750
I defeated Moff Gideon.

81
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,416
Did you kill him?

82
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,333
No.

83
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,541
But he was sent off
to the New Republic for interrogation,

84
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,208
and he will face justice for his crimes.

85
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,625
Death would have been justice
for his atrocities.

86
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,958
This is true.

87
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,166
The blood of millions of our kind
is on his hands.

88
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,208
Then he will be
executed for his crimes

89
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,791
by the New Republic Tribunal.

90
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,166
We shall see.

91
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,916
The songs of eons past

92
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,208
foretold of the Mythosaur rising up
to herald a new age of Mandalore.

93
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,250
Sadly, it only exists in legends.

94
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,291
Where did you come upon the beskar spear?

95
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,541
It was the gift
of a Jedi.

96
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,666
It can block a lightsaber.

97
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,208
I used it to defeat Moff Gideon.

98
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,208
It can also pierce beskar armor.

99
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,791
Its mere existence
puts Mandalorians at risk.

100
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:23,333
Mandalorian steel is meant for armor,
not weapons.

101
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,041
Then forge it into armor.

102
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,083
The Darksaber is a more
noble weapon for you to wield.

103
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,708
Have you ever heard
of Bo-Katan Kryze?

104
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,500
Bo-Katan is a cautionary tale.

105
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,166
She once laid claim to rule Mandalore

106
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,333
based purely on blood
and the sword you now possess.

107
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,916
But it was gifted to her
and not won by Creed.

108
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:14,500
Bo-Katan Kryze was born of a mighty house,
but they lost sight of the way.

109
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,500
Her rule ended in tragedy.

110
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,458
They lost their way,
and we lost our world.

111
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,083
Had our sect not been cloistered
on the moon of Concordia,

112
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,041
we would have not survived
the Great Purge.

113
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,250
<i>Those born of Mandalore
strayed away from the path.</i>

114
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,458
<i>Eventually,
the Imperial interlopers destroyed</i>

115
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,500
<i>all that we knew and loved
in the Night of a Thousand Tears.</i>

116
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,583
Only those that walked the way escaped
the curse prophesized in the Creed.

117
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,291
Though our numbers
were scattered to the winds,

118
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:33,500
our adherence to the way has preserved
our legacy for the generations

119
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,291
until we may someday return
to our homeworld.

120
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,208
What shall I forge?

121
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,750
Something for a foundling.

122
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,000
This is the way.

123
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,333
For a specific foundling.

124
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,750
Grogu.

125
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:56,291
He's no longer in your care.
He is with his own kind now.

126
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,416
I want to see him,
make sure he's safe.

127
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,041
In order to master
the ways of the Force,

128
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,625
Jedi must forgo all attachment.

129
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,416
That is the opposite of our Creed.

130
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,541
Loyalty and solidarity are the way.

131
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,291
What shall I forge
for the foundling Grogu?

132
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,416
<i>Solus. T'ad.</i>

133
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,125
<i>Ehn. Solus.</i>

134
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,541
<i>T'ad. Ehn.</i>

135
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,125
<i>Solus. T'ad.</i>

136
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,875
<i>Ehn. Cuir.</i>

137
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,500
<i>Solus.</i>

138
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,833
<i>T'ad.</i>

139
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:13,916
<i>Ehn.</i>

140
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,125
<i>Cuir.</i>

141
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,333
You are fighting
against the blade.

142
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,583
It gets heavier with each move.

143
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,958
That is because
you are fighting against the blade.

144
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,458
You should be fighting
against your opponent.

145
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,458
Stand up.

146
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,791
<i>Solus.</i>

147
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,916
<i>T'ad.</i>

148
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,708
<i>Ehn.</i>

149
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,166
There. Feel it.

150
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,666
You are too weak to fight the Darksaber.

151
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,833
It will win if you fight against it.

152
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,625
You cannot control it with your strength.

153
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,166
I want to try again.

154
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,291
Persistence without insight
will lead to the same outcome.

155
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,791
Your body is strong,
but your mind is distracted.

156
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,750
I am focused.

157
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,125
The blade says otherwise.

158
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,666
Maybe the Darksaber belongs
in someone else's hands.

159
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,541
Maybe.

160
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,916
It was forged by my ancestor,
founder of House Vizsla.

161
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,708
And now it belongs to me.

162
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,708
Because you won it in combat.

163
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,791
That's right.

164
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,541
And now I will win it from you.

165
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,958
Do you agree to this duel,
Din Djarin?

166
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,833
I do.

167
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,875
Fate has brought this blade
back to my clan,

168
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,083
and now fate will end yours.

169
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,041
It is done.

170
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:22,000
Paz Vizsla, have you ever removed
your helmet?

171
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,166
No.

172
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,208
Has it ever been removed by others?

173
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,791
Never.

174
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,291
This is the way.

175
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,541
This is the way.

176
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,958
Din Djarin,
have you ever removed your helmet?

177
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,958
Have you ever removed your helmet?

178
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,458
By Creed, you must vow.

179
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,375
I have.

180
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,416
Then, you are
a Mandalorian no more.

181
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:08,375
I beg you for your forgiveness.
How can I atone?

182
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,500
Leave, apostate.

183
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,250
According to Creed,
one may only be redeemed

184
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,791
in the living waters
beneath the mines of Mandalore.

185
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,083
But the mines have all been destroyed.

186
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,583
This is the way.

187
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,333
<i>Attention, please.</i>

188
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:32,875
<i>Flight 1020, nonstop service to Tatooine,</i>

189
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:36,083
<i>is now ready for boarding
at gate number one.</i>

190
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:40,083
<i>All passengers, please proceed
to the boarding area immediately.</i>

191
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,750
Excuse me, sir.

192
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,500
You're going
to have to remove your weapons.

193
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,291
I'm a Mandalorian.
Weapons are part of my religion.

194
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:55,958
I'm sorry, sir, you can't board
a commercial flight with your weapons.

195
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,541
If you wish to discuss this

196
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:01,375
with my supervisor, I will gladly
book you on tomorrow's flight.

197
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,583
Fine.

198
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,541
I know everything that's in there.

199
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,250
Proceed.

200
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:27,333
Welcome to Mos Eisley.

201
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,708
Here.

202
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,916
On behalf of all our crew,

203
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,250
thank you for travelling
Star Liner Travel.

204
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:39,041
We wish you a pleasant stay
and hope to see you again very soon.

205
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,416
No! No, BD!

206
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,666
Treadwell, get in there and move
that engine block so I can blast it.

207
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:03,625
No? You can't say no. You're a droid.

208
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,041
What is this,
a democracy all of a sudden? R5?

209
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,333
Right. Thought so.

210
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,500
Fine, I'll take care of it.

211
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,666
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

212
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,000
Stupid womp rat.

213
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:34,125
Okay, it's not here. Maybe it ran away...

214
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,416
Oh, it's got me! It's chewing!

215
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:43,041
No! God! No!

216
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,458
What an entrance.

217
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:52,250
BD? You good?

218
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,708
Oh, good. Oh, boy!

219
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:56,541
Hey, look, everyone. It's Mando.

220
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,541
What do we owe the pleasure?
You here to slay another dragon?

221
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,208
Chasing down some elusive bounty?

222
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,916
I got your message.

223
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,583
Message? What message?

224
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,625
You said you found me a replacement
for the <i>Razor Crest.</i>

225
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,041
Yeah, that's right. That's what I said.
That's what I do.

226
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,666
I've been working my butt off, yeah.
Did you bring the cash?

227
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,125
It's right here.

228
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,333
Mind if I count it?

229
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,750
Not that I don't trust you. I just wanna
make sure you don't give me too much.

230
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,541
Hey, droids, make yourself useful.

231
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:32,458
Count this up, and then fire up the grill
before that thing gets gamey.

232
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,250
Right this way. Wait till you get
your eyes on this baby.

233
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,333
So, where is your unlikely companion?

234
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,583
I returned him to his own kind.

235
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,625
Why the hell would you do that?

236
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:48,416
I could've made good money off that thing.
Open a petting zoo.

237
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,500
Where's the ship?

238
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,208
Right this way.

239
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,958
Ready to have your mind blown?

240
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,666
Where's the <i>Razor Crest?</i>

241
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,458
I never said I had a Razor Crest.

242
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,375
I said I had a replacement
for a Razor Crest.

243
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:24,333
- I don't have time for this.
- Hang on a second.

244
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,833
Do you have any idea what this is?

245
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:30,708
This is an N-1 starfighter,
handmade for the royal guard

246
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:33,500
and commissioned personally
by the Queen of Naboo.

247
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,625
This is a pile of junk.

248
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,416
- Do you want your credits back?
- Yes.

249
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,291
No skin off my dip-swap.

250
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,416
Droids, bring this lovely man his money.

251
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,375
Here you go. It's that easy.
Sorry to waste your time. Okay?

252
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,125
While we're waiting, can I tell you
a little something about this honey?

253
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,083
I know she doesn't look like much,

254
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,583
but you got here
a lot earlier than I expected,

255
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,541
and I didn't get a chance to finish.

256
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,500
I mean, clearly, you can see
I've got all the parts right here.

257
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,125
Hmm? It all has a home.

258
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:12,583
Okay?

259
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:17,750
Oh, look, a family of scurriers.
Let's not disrupt the nest.

260
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:21,291
You know how hard it is
to find all original parts

261
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,125
from way back in the Galactic Republic?

262
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,000
I mean, these are all handmade. No droids.

263
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:30,333
And not only that, what I'm gonna do,
just because I like you,

264
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,416
is I'm gonna add on
some custom modifications

265
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,625
that'll make her faster than a fathier,

266
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:40,000
and because this baby's pre-Empire,
she's off the grid.

267
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,666
And did I mention, she can jump
into hyperspace with no docking ring?

268
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,375
I mean, come on!
You gotta see the potential.

269
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,458
Whoo!

270
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,416
I'm telling you, Mando,
you gotta believe me.

271
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,125
This is a classic.

272
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:01,458
Look, at least let me put her together
before you decide.

273
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,708
Can you give me that?

274
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,708
There you go. Hmm?

275
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,333
Get this baby up and goin'.

276
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,666
You know, it'd be a lot faster
if you helped.

277
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,375
Higher.

278
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,791
Yeah. Just a little. No, a little higher.

279
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,750
I can't even see what I'm doing.
Can you stop moving?

280
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,333
Just focus right here.

281
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,416
Yes. Yes, thank you.

282
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,708
Great news!

283
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:39,166
I found you
a turbonic venturi power assimilator.

284
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,083
You're gonna be the fastest ship
on the Outer Rim.

285
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,125
Where did you get this?

286
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,250
It's brand-new. Well, Jawa new.

287
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,083
The Jawas had
a turbonic venturi assimilator

288
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,250
from a Galactic Republic-era starfighter?

289
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,375
Well, they didn't have it. They got it.

290
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,333
From where?

291
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,833
Tatooine is a garden of many bounties.

292
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,916
- I don't understand.
- I gave 'em a list.

293
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,958
- Of parts?
- Yeah.

294
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,125
And they find them for you?

295
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,875
I don't ask. They don't tell.
They give me what I ask for.

296
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,166
In exchange,
I let 'em pick through my dumpster.

297
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,041
- Can I meet them?
- Yeah, sure.

298
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:18,375
R5! See if the Jawas are still out back.

299
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:23,750
Dated a Jawa for a while.
They're quite furry. Very furry.

300
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,833
Lot of issues.

301
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:28,916
Oh, here they are.

302
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,250
If I give them a list of parts,
could they get them for me?

303
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,916
They said make a wishlist
and they'll see what's available.

304
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,333
Okay, I'm looking for mostly
bolt-on aftermarket speed mods.

305
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,333
This is all hand-built, custom.

306
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,375
I'm guessing we need vintage hyperware
if it's gonna fit this antique.

307
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,583
Listen to you.
Don't worry about the shape and size.

308
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,958
Just get the parts you want
with the specs you need,

309
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,458
and I'm gonna make it work, all right?

310
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:01,083
I dated a Jawa.
I know what I'm doing, right?

311
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, that's okay. I'm working
on me right now. Just go find the parts.

312
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:10,791
Furry.

313
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,375
No, bigger.

314
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,458
Uh-uh. Smaller.

315
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:37,333
No. It's the one with the hole on the end
that curves this way.

316
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,916
I think I saw it once before over there
in that pile near the circulators.

317
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:45,625
There you go.
I always knew you were the smart one.

318
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,875
Ah! Don't be jealous.

319
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,041
I don't know why
you're always in such a hurry.

320
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:53,708
"Build me a ship. Fix my blaster holes."

321
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:56,125
You know, I never went anywhere
and look how good I got it.

322
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,666
You know, I've never even been off world.

323
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,541
That's all right. I'm a local gal. Oh.

324
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:04,833
Let me see that doohickey. Oh, yeah.

325
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,833
Oh, that's good. Good find.
What else you got in there?

326
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,833
The entire
vapor manifold is missing.

327
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:13,916
Trust me,

328
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,958
the last thing you want strangling
your thrust capacitor is a vapor manifold.

329
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,541
I fabricated you
this induction intake charger

330
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:23,333
that's gonna double
your output coefficient.

331
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,166
It'll also blow the shaft
out of my motivator block.

332
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,791
That's why I'm reinforcing
your compression housing,

333
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:32,166
and you can access it
by using this Kineso-switch right here.

334
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,375
You hit this button,

335
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,791
you're gonna evacuate your
exhaust manifold, if you know what I mean.

336
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,583
All right, come on, now.
All right, that's enough.

337
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,875
All right. Power up.

338
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:45,833
You got it.

339
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,625
Where does this panel go?

340
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,166
Thanks, little guy.

341
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,208
Do you know how lucky you are
that I got my hands on this baby?

342
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,458
You want to thank me now,
or you want to thank me later?

343
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,916
You get me a Razor Crest,
you can have it right back.

344
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,916
Oh, bantha diddle,
these are a lot harder to come by

345
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,416
than some plain old Razor Crest.
Razor Crest.

346
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,541
No, get it on the groove. Slide it.
There you go.

347
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,375
Just get it right there. No, closer to me.

348
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,958
No, over to the left. Right in the center.

349
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,416
You're banging around in there.
What's happening? Just...

350
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,833
There you go. How hard was that?

351
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:40,583
Beautiful. Now, beat it.

352
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,708
That was fast.

353
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:46,541
These critters could find
a skud in a krill pond. Will that do?

354
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,541
Where did they get
a cryogenic density combustion booster?

355
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,333
- Do you really wanna know?
- Sure.

356
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,500
I got it. They said they crawled
under a Pyke spice runner

357
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,166
and crimped it off
while they were refueling.

358
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,875
Gutsy little fellas.

359
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,541
Let me tell you something,
Pykes do not mess around.

360
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:09,958
Ever since they've been moving spice
through the system,

361
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,375
everything's gone to hell.

362
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,208
Everyone's afraid of 'em and
law enforcement won't even go near 'em.

363
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,041
Well, thanks.

364
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,416
Thanks? What? Are you kidding me?

365
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,833
What'd you do that for?
You're gonna spoil 'em.

366
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,583
Are you trying to make me look bad?

367
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:29,916
It fits.

368
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:05,708
Oh!

369
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,833
Not a gram of fat on her.

370
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,166
You know,
no one's catching you in this thing.

371
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,041
What happened to the droid port?

372
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,333
I hogged it out.

373
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:24,333
You know, I figured,
with your disposition,

374
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,541
you'd wanna forgo the astromech.

375
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,791
Hey!

376
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,875
Watch your language around the customers.

377
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:02,375
Think she's ready?

378
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,750
Ready as she'll ever be.

379
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,125
Start her up.

380
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,875
- Really?
- Yeah, start her up.

381
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:30,958
It's not turning over.

382
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,625
Give it a little bit more juice.

383
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,625
That's a lot of engine for a little ship.

384
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:50,916
Yeah, well, see what she can do!

385
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,166
Shouldn't we run a diagnostic first?

386
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:57,625
Nah! I can hear her!
She's purring! Send her up!

387
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,791
Whoo-hoo!

388
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,541
Engaging forward drives.

389
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,166
She handles a little bumpy.

390
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,375
You're used to a gunship,
but she's a starfighter.

391
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,916
So fly her like one.

392
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,875
Okay. I'll open her up.

393
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,375
Huh? Hey!

394
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,958
<i>Dank Farrik,</i> she's fast.

395
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:04,041
<i> Smooth?</i>

396
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,416
As a gonk's scomp jack.

397
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,875
There you go. Some teamwork.

398
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,541
Controls are real snappy.
How's the maneuverability?

399
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:12,833
<i>You tell me.</i>

400
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:15,708
<i>Point your navigational disposition
between the two suns.</i>

401
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:17,958
<i>You'll come up to Beggar's Canyon.</i>

402
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,666
<i>How's the handling?</i>

403
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,083
Tight. She tracks like a railspeeder.

404
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,958
<i>What did I tell you?
Razor Crest.</i>

405
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,708
Let's see what she's got.

406
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:41,291
<i>Dank Farrik!</i>

407
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,291
<i>Run your beacon for me, N-1.</i>

408
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,750
<i>Was I doing
something wrong, officer?</i>

409
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,583
<i>You're not allowed to fly that fast
next to a commercial ship.</i>

410
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:01,666
You're also operating without a beacon.
I'm gonna need you to run one for us.

411
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:05,208
Sorry, officer,
I got a little carried away there.

412
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:06,375
Transmitting now.

413
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,750
Hmm.

414
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,291
Your engine model
doesn't match your power drive.

415
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,500
We just built her.
I was taking her up for a test flight.

416
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:18,250
Haven't been able to update
the registration just yet.

417
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:22,750
<i>We're gonna need
to see your title tabs. Send us a ping.</i>

418
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,916
Yeah, sorry, officer,
but my transmitter isn't hooked up yet.

419
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,666
I'll head right back to Mos Eisley
and get it sorted out.

420
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:32,625
Relinquish your flight controls
for remote-control access.

421
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,166
<i>Hold on
a second there, Lieutenant.</i>

422
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,708
<i>I think we can let him off
with a warning this time.</i>

423
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,708
Thank you, officer.
I'll have that taken care of.

424
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,333
<i>One thing before you go.</i>

425
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,416
Yes?

426
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,208
Your voice is mighty familiar.
Did you used to fly a Razor Crest?

427
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,791
I think you have the wrong guy, officer.

428
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:59,708
That ship showed up
on a transponder log back in Nevarro

429
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,375
in an incident
involving Imperial remnants.

430
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,166
<i>I'm just connecting some dots here.</i>

431
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,625
You mind answering a few questions?

432
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:22,541
How did it jump?
He didn't power up his hyperdrives.

433
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,958
Didn't jump, kid.
Those were his sublight thrusters.

434
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:30,000
<i>There's no trace of him on our sensors.
We reporting this?</i>

435
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,708
You want to go back to base,
fill out reports all day?

436
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,583
<i> No, sir.</i>

437
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,375
Whoo! Well? How was it?

438
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,750
Wizard.

439
00:45:56,833 --> 00:46:01,583
Those J-type pulse engines really tighten
the old evacuation port, don't they?

440
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:08,000
Oh, by the way, an old friend of yours
dropped by, said she was looking for you.

441
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,083
A friend of mine?

442
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,833
Don't worry.
I told her I didn't know where you were.

443
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:15,291
Then I locked her out
and engaged the hangar security system.

444
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,833
She tell you her name?

445
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,125
Fennec Shand.

446
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,541
I thought you said that
the hangar security system was on.

447
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:25,875
Don't get away from me.
You come right back here.

448
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:29,333
This is the third mistake this week.
Someone's getting deprogrammed.

449
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,208
By any chance, are you looking for work?

450
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:33,875
I could be.

451
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,208
The pay is good.

452
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:37,833
What's the bounty?

453
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:40,375
No bounty. We need muscle.

454
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:42,958
Boba Fett.

455
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,458
He sure would appreciate it.

456
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,750
Tell him it's on the house.

457
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:52,791
But first,

458
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:56,041
I got to pay a visit to a little friend.

458
00:46:57,305 --> 00:47:57,798
