1
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:04,708
I'm collecting on behalf
of the Tuskens of the Dune Sea.

2
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:08,083
The Kintan Striders
have already collected protection money

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,916
for the same territory you lay claim to.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,074

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,833
Under Master Bib's watchful eye,

6
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,458
Mos Espa
was divided amongst three families.

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,875
He relied on the uneasy alliances
to preserve his tribute and title.

8
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,625
With apologies, sir...

9
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,458
No one respects you.

10
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,583
The streets have turned to chaos.

11
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,125
There is no work, Mighty Daimyo.

12
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,500
Then you will work for me.

13
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,750
You better fight as good as you talk <i>dank.</i>

14
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,333
Here is your prisoner.

15
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:13,166
I offer him back if you renounce
all claims to Jabba's legacy on Tatooine.

16
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,791
Release him.

17
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,875
Take it from an ex-bounty hunter,

18
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,291
don't work for scugholes.

19
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,041
It's not worth it.

20
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,416
Not today, old girl.

21
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,583
Still too many guards.

22
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,958
Let's get something to eat.

23
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750
Here you go.

24
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,458
Enjoy.

25
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,458
Aren't you a little old to be here?

26
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,583
She needs modification.

27
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,083
No walk-ins. Appointment only.

28
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,500
This woman is about to die.

29
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,000
You should've started with that.

30
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,291
It's done.

31
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,875
Aren't you gonna close her up?

32
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,083
And cover all that beautiful machinery?

33
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,541
Drink.

34
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,166
What happened?

35
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,833
You were dying of a gut shot.

36
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,541
I saved your life.

37
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,875
What did you do to me?

38
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,916
I brought you to a mod-parlor
on the outskirts of Mos Eisley.

39
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,333
It was the best I could do
under the circumstances.

40
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,625
Take the black melon.

41
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,333
It will help you recover.

42
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,208
It takes some getting used to.

43
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,875
With time you start to crave it.

44
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:47,708
You are Master Assassin Fennec Shand
of the Mid Rim.

45
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,083
I take it I'm worth more alive, huh?

46
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,541
You are.

47
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,708
I'll pay double my bounty.

48
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,875
I don't want money.

49
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,041
Who are you?

50
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,666
I am Boba Fett.

51
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,333
Boba is dead.

52
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I was...

53
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,250
left for dead on the sands of Tatooine.

54
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:29,916
Like you.

55
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,166
I was rescued by the Sand People.

56
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,125
They took me in,
treated me as one of their own.

57
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,416
I tried to help them.

58
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,458
Instead I got them massacred
by Nikto speed bikers.

59
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,541
Speed bikers defeated Tuskens?

60
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,875
That's highly unlikely.

61
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,541
I want you to help me.

62
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,625
Help me recover my Firespray gunship.

63
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,541
Where is it?

64
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,416
Jabba the Hutt's palace.

65
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,958
Bib Fortuna took over his territory.

66
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,000
And now he rules from that palace.

67
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,166
If the ship is yours,
why don't you just ask for it back?

68
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,166
Because I might not like the answer.

69
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,916
Without my armor, I'm less persuasive.

70
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,791
If I help you...

71
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,166
my debt is paid.

72
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,833
If that is what you wish.

73
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,666
Your ship's there all right.

74
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,541
Any idea how many guards?

75
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,541
I can't tell.

76
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,375
The gate opens, some come out, some go in.

77
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,875
Let's take a closer look.

78
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,125
It's time.

79
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,333
It's time to say farewell, my friend.

80
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,375
You served me well.

81
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes, I know.

82
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,250
I know I'm gonna miss you, too, old girl.

83
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,625
Now go.

84
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,000
Find other banthas. Make baby banthas.

85
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,291
Go!

86
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,083
You're free to roam the Dune Sea.

87
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,250
Shouldn't you wait until we get
your ship back before you do that?

88
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,750
Why?

89
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,250
Either I get it or I die.

90
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,625
Soon you'll be free, too.

91
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,375
What's next for you?

92
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,833
I'm gonna find my armor.

93
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,708
Then I'm gonna kill that bloated pig
who double crossed me.

94
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,416
Take his throne.

95
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,875
You wanna head a Gotra?

96
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,125
Why not?

97
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,250
You're a hunter.

98
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,333
I'm tired of working for idiots
who are gonna get me killed.

99
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,583
The Tuskens took me in.

100
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,541
Made me part of their tribe.

101
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,250
I was ready to leave hunting behind.

102
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,000
People like us don't get to decide
when we're finished.

103
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,708
Ah.

104
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,250
There she is.

105
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,791
There are too many guards.

106
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,791
Then we time their patrol and go in quiet.

107
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,833
And...

108
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,583
What was that?

109
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,500
I don't know. More rats?

110
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,250
Go find it.

111
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,416
I will contact the rat catcher.

112
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,375
I don't think it was a rat.

113
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,500
Call secur...

114
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,750
No one sounded the alarm.

115
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,166
Let's get to the hangar.

116
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,625
We'll slip past the guards.

117
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,958
Oh.

118
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,666
Huh?

119
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,791
I'll watch the door.

120
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,125
Where'd you go?

121
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,000
Uh-oh.

122
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,916
Got ya.

123
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,458
Do you know who I am?

124
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,791
I am Boba Fett.

125
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:34,958
Quick little bugger.

126
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,291
Can we go now?

127
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,041
Let's go.

128
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,291
Good work.

129
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,458
Not bad yourself.

130
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,375
Let's go.

131
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,750
Sleemo!

132
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,583
You go.

133
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,916
I'll handle them.

134
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,916
Make sure that thing can still fly.

135
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,208
Let's get out of here.

136
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,125
Damn it.

137
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,500
What the hell are you doing?

138
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:35,208
We need to get the gate open
but I can't see a thing!

139
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,666
I'm a little busy here!

140
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,541
Guns are jammed. I can't get a shot.

141
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,333
I've got it. Close the ramp.

142
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,541
I hope you know what you're doing.

143
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,750
Next time, we stick to the plan.

144
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:58,833
Next time?

145
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,166
How's the ship?

146
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,750
She's in good shape.

147
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,500
Just a little rusty.

148
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,208
There are good mechanics in Mos Eisley.

149
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,250
I'll do the maintenance myself.

150
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,333
There's an advantage
to people thinking you're dead.

151
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,083
Now your debt is paid.

152
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,958
Where would you like to be dropped?

153
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,458
Where are you headed?

154
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,791
I have a few scores to settle.

155
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,916
I'll go for the ride.

156
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,708
Huh?

157
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,708
Hang on.

158
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,750
The Sarlacc Pit.

159
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,666
That's where I was trapped
all those years ago.

160
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,291
That's where I'll find my armor.

161
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,833
In there?

162
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,208
It's dissolved.

163
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,708
Not beskar.

164
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,083
Damn it. I can't see a thing.

165
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:02,916
Be careful.

166
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,208
Shoot it!

167
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,166
Come on.

168
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,833
Fire in the hole.

169
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,416
Next time don't touch my buttons.

170
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,625
Nothing.

171
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,291
All junk.

172
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,083
You're burning. It's not safe in there.

173
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,166
Yeah.

174
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,958
My armor's not down there.

175
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,291
It served its purpose.

176
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,541
It saved you from the acid.

177
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,208
What you need to find is a bacta tank.

178
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,333
Scurrier?

179
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,666
Thanks.

180
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:21,583
Are you serious
about forming your own house?

181
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:25,708
How many times have you been hired
to do a job that was avoidable?

182
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,583
If they only took the time to think.

183
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:32,166
How much money could have been made?

184
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:35,041
How many lives could have been saved?

185
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,625
Then you and I would be out of work.

186
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:42,416
I'm tired of our kind dying
because of the idiocy of others.

187
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,541
We're smarter than them.

188
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,791
It's time we took our shot.

189
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,166
We?

190
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,333
Yes.

191
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:59,625
If I'm gonna start a house,
I need brains and muscle.

192
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,125
You have both.

193
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:05,583
It's tempting.

194
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,708
But I'm an independent contractor.

195
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll do jobs for you.
But I value my freedom.

196
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,583
I can offer you something
no client ever has.

197
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:19,166
What's that?

198
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:20,791
Loyalty.

199
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,625
I will cut you in on the success

200
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,083
and pledge my life to protect yours.

201
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,750
Living with the Tuskens has made you soft.

202
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,750
No.

203
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,583
It's made me strong.

204
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,375
You can only get so far without a tribe.

205
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,458
Boba!

206
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,291
Congratulations, Master Fett.

207
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,708
You are completely healed.

208
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,208
What about the scars on the inside?

209
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,541
Those take longer.

210
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,583
Anything from the Mayor's Majordomo?

211
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,458
Is he cooperating?

212
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,000
Oh, he's singing like a Yuzzum.

213
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,625
But still, no sign of the Mayor.

214
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,458
- My armor, quickly.
- Relax.

215
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,041
The Mods are combing the streets
of Mos Espa.

216
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,916
If he's here, they will find him.

217
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,166
I should still show my face in town.

218
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,958
You sure that's a good idea?

219
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,458
War could break out any day.

220
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,416
Power hates a vacuum.

221
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,500
I think you've made your point.

222
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:07,750
I remember your years in the Pit.

223
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:14,458
I've never seen a more impressive display
of martial prowess, and you were a legend.

224
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:20,000
And the name Krrsantan
drew crowds by the thousands.

225
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:24,208
Your knuckle dusters
are more feared than blasters.

226
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,625
You've met every challenge.

227
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,750
You've won every trophy.

228
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:33,833
Is it not beneath you to dismember
this unfortunate Trandoshan?

229
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,541
Thousands once cheered such a display.

230
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,416
But those days have passed.

231
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:47,208
In this more civilized place
in these more civilized times,

232
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,125
what was once celebrated
in the bloodlust of the arena

233
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,541
is now seen as horror and cruelty.

234
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,750
There, there. Isn't that better?

235
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,666
And you've nothing left to prove.

236
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,291
You are a champion.

237
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,750
You are above such pettiness.

238
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:11,666
Now, you have run up
quite a bar tab, Santo.

239
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,333
So, what say you release this customer

240
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:17,625
and let these fine folks
get back to their fun and in return,

241
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,416
I will wipe your debt off the books?

242
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,208
It was worth a shot.

243
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:02,666
Hit it, Max.

244
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,250
Hey, mate.

245
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,083
Looks like you could use a job.

246
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:36,625
Jabba the Hutt
once sat upon that throne.

247
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:40,750
His reign ended in a ball of fire
on the Dune Sea

248
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:44,333
and then Bib Fortuna took his place.

249
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,458
You were all once captains under the Hutt.

250
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:53,541
But you quickly left the family
when Fortuna claimed to be the heir.

251
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,666
He was a terrible leader
with no right to the throne.

252
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,875
Oh, you each tried to take his place,

253
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,708
but were thwarted by his guile
and treachery.

254
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:11,125
It took this man, Boba Fett,
to remove him.

255
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,708
You all accrued wealth and riches
under Jabba the Hutt.

256
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:20,666
You can again, if you listen to Boba Fett.

257
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,208
I may sit on that throne.

258
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:37,125
But I have no designs
on any of your territories.

259
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:41,625
I ask for no tribute or quarter,
and I expect to give none either.

260
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:45,708
I'm here to make a proposal
that's mutually beneficial.

261
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,875
As I'm sure you all know,

262
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,666
the Pyke Syndicate
are mustering troops in Mos Espa.

263
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:58,416
They have slowly absorbed our planet
as part of their spice trade.

264
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,125
They have bribed the Mayor

265
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:05,041
and are draining Tatooine of its wealth.

266
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:11,083
We make many credits
from the sale of spice in our territories.

267
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,333
And why do you deserve to be the Daimyo?

268
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,375
What prevents us all from killing you
and taking what we want?

269
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,000
Easy, boy.

270
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:35,875
Easy.

271
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,708
Think he's a little hungry.

272
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,875
Please. Sit.

273
00:40:55,666 --> 00:41:00,083
Why speak of conflict
when cooperation can make us all rich?

274
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,208
Master Garfalaquox asks
what it is that you are proposing.

275
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,250
I am proposing
that all the families of Mos Espa

276
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:15,500
join in a defensive alliance
until the Pyke Syndicate is vanquished.

277
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:19,250
They have only challenged your territory.

278
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,125
Why should we spill the blood of our ranks

279
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:26,750
for a feud waged between you
and the Pykes?

280
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:28,875
Yes.

281
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,208
Then I will fight these battles alone.

282
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,583
I will vanquish these interlopers
who threaten our planet.

283
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,625
I will make the streets safe again.

284
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,958
So all in this room can prosper.

285
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,583
All I ask in return
is that you remain neutral

286
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:54,750
if the Pyke Syndicate approaches you
to betray me.

287
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,416
This will be acceptable.

288
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:16,666
Master Garfalaquox
finds this acceptable as well.

289
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,791
I abide.

290
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,041
Do you trust them?

291
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,708
I trust them to work
in their own self-interest.

292
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,750
My deal is a lot better than
what the Syndicate would offer.

293
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:10,791
They may be stubborn,
but they are not foolish enough

294
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,375
to see that the Pykes would eventually
take over the whole planet.

295
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:20,750
Either way, we must prepare for war.

296
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,916
How much treasure do we have in reserve?

297
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:28,166
I have plenty of credits.

298
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,583
What I'm short on is muscle.

299
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:34,625
Credits can buy muscle,
if you know where to look.

299
00:43:35,305 --> 00:44:35,792
