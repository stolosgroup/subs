and the Aqualish Quarter.

163
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,875
As you can see,
all our flanks are covered.

164
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,416
Nobody is sneaking up on us.

165
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,541
When the people of Freetown arrive,

166
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,541
we will have the forces required
to pivot our strength

167
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,541
to whatever region
the Pykes choose to attack from.

168
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,750
For now?

169
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,208
We wait.

170
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,416
Lord Fett?
There is someone here to see you.

171
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,041
I thought you said
nobody could sneak up on us.

172
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,500
I thought I smelled something.

173
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,875
If you're looking for a job, you're late.

174
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,583
CAD BANE: I've already got a job.

175
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:44,125
I'm here to negotiate
on behalf of the Pyke Syndicate.

176

00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,208
And tell your bosses
we know they're outnumbered.

180
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:07,291
I wouldn't be counting on the people
of Freetown to be coming anytime soon.

181
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,750
I paid Marshal Vanth a visit.

182
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,625
You should've never left him
without his armor.

183
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,083
Before you get any ideas,

184
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,541
I've got back shooters too.

185
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,500
Let the spice move through Mos Espa,

186
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,291
and all this can be avoided.

187

BOBA FETT: No.

188

What do you propose then?

189
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,791
BOBA FETT: I will only negotiate
with the head of the Pyke Syndicate.

190
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,875
You mean the one that massacred
your Tusken family

191
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,666
and blamed it on a speed bike gang?

I have no compunction whatsoever

316
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,208
genuflecting or even groveling
if needs be,
