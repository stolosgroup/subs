4
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,458
We were told the Mayor
was coming to pay tribute.

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:32,208
The only tribute I bear
is the Mayor's heartfelt welcome.

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,583
Tell the Mayor I am here now.

7
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,416
He knows.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,666
I intend to rule with respect.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Fennec. Alive.

10
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,666
Who sent you?

11
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,166
What were your orders?

12
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,333
Speak, prisoner.

13
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,833
Well, if he's not gonna speak,
he no longer needs his head.

14
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,583
We spared your life

15
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,000
after you tried to take mine.

16
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,833
And you curse me?

17
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,958
What do we know of this prisoner?

18
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,333
He is of the Order of the Night Wind.

19
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,375
Assassin for hire.

20
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,125
Very expensive.

21
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,625
Overpriced. You're paying for the name.

22
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,791
Their reputation is legendary.
There is no way this one will talk.

23
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,666
I know of their reputation.

24
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,750
They're just people... in hoods.

25
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,041
There is no way he will talk.

26
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,625
They fear no man.

27
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,458
Fine.

28
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,833
Perhaps he fears the rancor.

29
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,583
I was sent by the Mayor!
The Mayor sent me! Let me out!

30
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,375
It's empty.

31
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,166
Assassin of the Night Wind.

32
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,458
Shall we visit the Mayor?

33
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,458
I am Boba Fett.

34
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,666
I'm here to see the Mayor.

35
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,791
"Boba Fett."

36
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,666
Um... Do you have an appointment?

37
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,250
I found one of his stray pets.

38
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,916
I'm here to return it to its master.

39
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,875
Well, I don't see your name
in the schedule.

40
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,250
So, you'll have to... Oh.

41
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,000
Pardon the lack of pomp for your entrance.

42
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,333
However, I did not see your litter arrive.

43
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:51,166
Nevertheless, we are both honored
and delighted by your serendipitous visit.

44
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,208
However, I regret to inform you

45
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:58,125
the Mayor is indisposed
for the rest of the week, and there are...

46
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,750
This... This area here is restricted.

47
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,000
Nope, you're not supposed...

48
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,958
Sir, if you would be so kind as to...

49
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,500
Apologies for the intrusion.

50
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,750
Terribly sorry, Your Eminence.

51
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,250
Who is this who enters unannounced?

52
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,416
You know damn well who.

53
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
It is the new Daimyo, Boba Fett,
Your Excellence.

54
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,416
If you do not who I am,

55
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,458
then why did you send this man
to assassinate me?

56
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,000
I can assure you, the Mayor had nothing...

57
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,958
He's a member
of the Order of the Night Wind.

58
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,333
Ah!

59
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,916
Then you admit it.

60
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,708
The Order of the Night Wind
are not allowed

61
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,625
to operate outside of Hutt Space.

62
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,916
Thank you for turning him in.

63
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,625
Give this man his reward.

64
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,750
I am not a bounty hunter.

65
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:05,083
Is that so?
I've heard otherwise.

66
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,875
I know that you sit
on the throne of your former employer.

67
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,541
Bib Fortuna
was not my employer.

68
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,291
It was Jabba the Hutt's throne.

69
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,875
Yes. And now it is mine.

70
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,916
And I will take this payment

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,125
as what you should have brought me
as tribute.

72
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:38,583
You should remember, you serve as long
as the Daimyo of Tatooine deem it so.

73
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,000
Before you threaten me,
you should ask yourself,

74
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,000
who really sent the Night Wind?

75
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,583
I have no motive.

76
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,541
As you said, I serve at your pleasure.

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,416
I am not a fool, Mok Shaiz.

78
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,416
And those who thought otherwise
no longer draw breath.

79
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,625
Here is the tribute I offer,
some advice.

80
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,166
Running a family
is more complicated than bounty hunting.

81
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,041
Is that it?

82
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,333
Go to Garsa's Sanctuary.

83
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,500
You'll see what I speak of.

84
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,416
Ah, what a surprise.

85
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you for the honor
of your patronage, Mr. Fett.

86
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,166
Please have a seat at the bar.
I'll see if I can free up a table.

87
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,083
Would you care to have a beverage
while I sort this out?

88
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,708
What's going on here?

89
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,458
In what respect?

90
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:14,875
Mayor Mok Shaiz sent me here
as though there's something I should know.

91
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,625
And now you're sweating
like a gumpta on Mustafar.

92
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,458
You haven't heard?

93
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,250
Heard what?

94
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,500
The Twins have laid claim
to their late cousin's bequest.

95
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,833
The Twins are preoccupied
with the debauchery of Hutta

96
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,958
to bother with any ambitions on Tatooine.

97
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,291
Watch my back.

98
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,833
I don't care what your tablet says.

99
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,375
This is Mos Espa and I am Daimyo here.

100
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,916
Oh.

101
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,666
You can bring
as many gladiators as you wish

102
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,583
but these are not the death pits of Duur
and I am not a sleeping Trandoshan guard.

103
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,833
This territory is mine.

104
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,291
Go back to Nal Hutta.

105
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,833
Your cousin Jabba is dead.

106
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,791
His cowardly Majordomo
usurped his territory

107
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,083
and then I killed him.

108
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,041
All that is his belongs to me now.

109
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,541
Your sister is right.

110
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,666
If you want it,
you'll have to kill me for it.

111
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,958
Mm.

112
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,458
They're Hutts.

113
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,750
We would have to get permission
if you wanna kill 'em.

114
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,458
Maybe it's settled.

115
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,083
You really think so?

116
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,333
No.

117
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,083
I am holding it the same.

118
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,583
Show me.

119
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,875
Come on. Come on.
Come on, let's move it. Move.

120
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,833
Get down there. Get down.

121
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,791
I will stop the train.

122
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,375
I will stop them.

123
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,416
I will take rifle and stick.

124
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,083
Be back by morning.

125
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,083
It's not...

126
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,333
It's not right.

127
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,708
Did you say something?

128
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,958
I said it's not right.

129
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,208
It's not...

130
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,041
Stop it!

131
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,083
Leave him alone!

132
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,041
A gift for you.

133
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,666
Huh! Whoa, stop, stop, no!

134
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,958
No! Stop!

135
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,375
Whoa! These are mine!
These are mine, stop!

136
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,041
These are mine.

137
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:20,291
I will teach you how to ride.

138
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,125
I will teach you.

139
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,125
This is how we will stop the train.

140
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:49,125
Okay, this makes it go.

141
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,625
This makes it stop.

142
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,416
Go. Stop.

143
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,208
Like a bantha.

144
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,750
Yes?

145
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,500
Maybe not. Okay, who wants to go first?

146
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:13,958
Sit.

147
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,541
Okay, go, stop.

148
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Jump to me.

149
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,666
Jump!

150
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,750
Come, come.

151
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:04,208
When train comes,
need you to help signal with this.

152
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,333
The train goes faster than this.

153
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:24,333
You want to see how fast the train goes?

154
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,541
Riders to the bikes!

155
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,375
Warn the others!

156
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,541
Move!

157
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,583
Riders, ready?

158
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,708
To the train!

159
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,291
Get down!

160
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,083
Watch out!

161
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,416
Stop the train!

162
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,541
Who's the leader?

163
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,791
Are you going to kill us?

164
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,375
That depends on how you answer
what I'm about to ask.

165
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,791
Are you carrying spice?

166
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,416
What do you mean by "spice"?

167
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,708
Sansanna spice
from the slave mines of Kessel.

168
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,875
What does spice look like?

169
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,291
Like that.

170
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,208
This is not looking good for you.

171
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,375
We thought you were uncivilized raiders.

172
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,083
We were trying to protect our route.

173
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:13,041
These sands are no longer free
for you to pass.

174
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,208
These people lay ancestral claim
to the Dune Sea,

175
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,250
and if you are to pass,
a toll is to be paid to them.

176
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,000
Any death dealt
from the passing freighters

177
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,916
will be returned ten-fold.

178
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,708
Now, go back to your syndicate
and present these terms.

179
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:39,875
Your lives are a gesture of our civility.

180
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:44,916
Now walk.

181
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,708
Single file,
in the direction of the high sun.

182
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,458
It will lead you to Anchorhead by sunset
if you leave now.

183
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,208
But we'll be killed.

184
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,833
You now travel
under the protection of the Tuskens.

185
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,875
No harm will come of you.

186
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,708
We will die of thirst
without our water car.

187
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,625
We will give you each a black melon.

188
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,458
You will survive on its milk
as these people do.

189
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:13,625
Now go.

190
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,375
You shouldn't have to hide.

191
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,166
You are warriors.

192
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,750
You have machines now too.

193
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:31,791
And you know
every grain of sand in the Dune Sea.

194
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,916
A gift?

195
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,625
Why?

196
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,625
A lizard?

197
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,083
Thank you.

198
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,541
I will let it guide me.

199
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,083
I'm sorry.

200
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,791
I think I swallowed it.

201
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,791
It's a tricky little bugger.

202
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:41,041
I thought he was part of the dream.

202
00:42:42,305 --> 00:43:42,319
