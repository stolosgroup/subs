1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,958
<i>In order to master</i>
<i>the ways of the Force,</i>

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:07,042
<i>Jedi must forego all attachment.</i>

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,292
That is the opposite of our Creed.

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,500
Loyalty and solidarity are the way.

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,583
What shall I forge
for the foundling Grogu?

6
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,167
Welcome to the Sanctuary.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,458
I'm just here to introduce myself
and assure you that your business

8
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:31,083
will continue to thrive
under my watchful eye.

9
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,000
As I'm sure you all know,

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,875
the Pyke Syndicate
are mustering troops in Mos Espa.

11
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:40,417
<i>They have slowly absorbed our planet</i>
<i>as part of their spice trade.</i>

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,542
How much treasure do we have in reserve?

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,875
I have plenty of credits.
What I'm short on is muscle.

14
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:49,792
Boba Fett.

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,667
He sure would appreciate it.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,708
Tell him it's on the house.

17
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:58,000
But first, I gotta pay a visit
to a little friend.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,074
Watch Movies, Series & LiveTV
www.flixify.app

19
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,958
It's all there.

20
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:48,125
We'll leave the spice
and take the credits back to Mos Eisley.

21
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,750
The rest will follow.

22
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,042
Do you know
where you are, gentlemen?

23
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,750
Think it through.

24
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:03,750
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt
being you're not from around here

25
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,458
and say you figured
you're in the middle of nowhere.

26
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,500
But everything out there

27
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:11,625
to everything out there

28
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,042
is the Mos Pelgo territories,

29
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:21,292
and these stripes indicate
I'm the marshal of said territories.

30
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,750
Now, I don't know what arrangements
you have with the authorities in Mos Espa,

31
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,167
and let's be honest,
in Mos Eisley, anything goes,

32
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,583
but out here I'm the one
tells folks what to do.

33
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,167
I didn't see what's in that chest,

34
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,250
and consequently no laws have been broken

35
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,708
far as I'm concerned.

36
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,542
If you gentlemen load up your wares
and head back to where you came,

37
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,875
we can chalk this one up
to you guys reading the map wrong.

38
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,667
Think it through.

39
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,500
I can see you're the smart one.

40
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,792
I got a proposition for your bosses.

41
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:25,833
Tell 'em I've heard of the Syndicate.
Take their credits back with you.

42
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,375
And I say this with respect,

43
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:33,667
anyone gets lost running spice through
Mos Pelgo again will be lost forever.

44
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:41,250
Now, load that chest and go.
Consider it a fine for trespassing.

45
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,375
It's worth more than your town.

46
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,417
Well, then, maybe I'll retire.

47
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,125
Hello, friend.

48
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,542
I'm looking for Skywalker.

49
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,250
I came to see the kid, Grogu.

50
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,167
Is this where they are?

51
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,125
Hey. Droid.

52
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:56,917
Hey.

53
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,500
Don't shut off. Wake up.

54
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,125
Hey, I'm looking for Skywalker.

55
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,583
He had a kid with him.

56
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,250
Is that a bench?

57
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,708
How long will I be waiting?

58
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,750
Is anyone here?

59
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,917
Anyone alive?

60
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,375
Grogu.

61
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,208
All right, let's go for a walk.

62
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,083
I want to tell you about someone
you remind me of a great deal.

63
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,083
His name was Yoda.

64
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,000
He was small like you,
but his heart was huge,

65
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,000
and the Force was strong in him.

66
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,833
He once said to me,

67
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,042
"Size matters not."

68
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,083
That's how he talked.

69
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,542
He would speak in riddles.

70
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,292
Have you heard anyone
talk like that back home?

71
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,083
Do you remember back home?

72
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,167
Would you like to remember?

73
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,833
Let me help you remember.

74
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,375
-Go! Go! Go!
-Hurry! Hurry! Move! Move it!

75
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,875
Welcome back.

76
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,500
The galaxy is a dangerous place, Grogu.

77
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,125
I will teach you to protect yourself.

78
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:41,458
You.
I didn't expect to see you here.

79
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,708
I'm an old friend of the family.

80
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,083
I thought you weren't
going to help train Grogu.

81
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm not. Master Luke is.

82
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,125
Then what are you doing here?

83
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,875
That's my question for you.

84
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,333
I'm here to see the kid.

85
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,417
That's why R2 brought you to me instead.

86
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,500
What is this place?

87
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,500
There's nothing now,

88
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,042
but will someday be a great school.

89
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,042
Grogu will be its first student.

90
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,375
I'd like to know how he's doing.

91
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,250
He is doing fine.

92
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,708
I wanna see him.

93
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,042
I know you do.

94
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,125
Let us take a walk.

95
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,750
I warned you when we met

96
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,333
that your attachment to Grogu
would be difficult to let go of.

97
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,417
He was a Mandalorian foundling in my care.

98
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,250
I just wanna make sure he's safe.

99
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,708
There is no place in the galaxy
more safe than here with Luke.

100
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,500
I don't understand why you're all right
with Skywalker's decision

101
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,292
to train the kid when you wouldn't.

102
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,083
Because it was his choice.

103
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,125
I don't control the wants of others.

104
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,958
Then, it's my choice to go and see him.

105
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,958
Of course. If that is what you wish.

106
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
All right.

107
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,542
Are you doing this for Grogu,
or are you doing this for yourself?

108
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,167
I just... I wanna give him this.

109
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,375
Why? So he will remember you?

110
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,458
No.

111
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,792
As a Mandalorian foundling,
he should have this. It's his right.

112
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,833
Foundling.

113
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,917
Perhaps he is a Padawan now.

114
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:31,792
Well, either way,
this armor will protect him.

115
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,833
If you are set on it,

116
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,417
then allow me to deliver it.

117
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,208
I came all this way.

118
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,833
He's right there.

119
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,375
Grogu misses you a great deal.

120
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,958
If he sees you,

121
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,708
it will only make things
more difficult for him.

122
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,000
Make sure he's protected.

123
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,667
All right.
It's time to continue your training.

124
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,083
Let's see you jump.

125
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,208
Really? That's all you got?

126
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,167
Bend down, jump, and as you do,

127
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,292
feel the Force flow through you.

128
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,250
You're trying too hard.

129
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,750
Don't try. Do.

130
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,417
Come on. I want to show you something.

131
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:36,542
Hang on.

132
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:06,792
Look. The wide world exists in balance.

133
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,167
Feel the Force all around you.

134
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,750
Through the Force,
you will find balance as well.

135
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,542
Concentrate.

136
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,375
Use the Force.

137
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,500
That's it.

138
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,583
Very good.

139
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,750
Better.

140
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,500
This is a training remote.

141
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,333
It will test your reflexes.

142
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:00,625
No, that isn't how it works.

143
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,750
This is how it works.

144
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:31,333
Get back up. Always get back up.

145
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,167
Very good.

146
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,000
Good.

147
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,292
You've taught him well.

148
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,625
It's more like he's remembering
than I'm actually teaching him anything.

149
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,292
Sometimes the student
guides the master.

150
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,375
The Mandalorian was here.

151
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,208
As I told you.

152
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,792
The two share a strong bond,

153
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:19,167
and he brought him a gift.

154
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:35,583
Sometimes I wonder if his heart is in it.

155
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,208
So much like your father.

156
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
What should I do about him?

157
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,042
Trust your instincts.

158
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:07,125
Will I see you again?

159
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,667
Perhaps.

160
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,083
May the Force be with you.

161
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,250
I'm here at the request of Fennec Shand.

162
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:47,125
The Pyke Syndicate has been gathering
soldiers the last few weeks.

163
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:51,292
Mayor Mok Shaiz is on their payroll
and has flown off world,

164
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:55,792
which leads us to believe
the storm is about to break.

165
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,917
It was a scheduled vacation, actually.

166
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:09,708
Here's a map of where they are gathering,
based on whispers.

167
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:15,625
The three crime families of Mos Espa
seem willing to lay low

168
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:19,125
and let the Pykes move on our territory.

169
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,417
This is the Mandalorian, Din Djarin.

170
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,708
Thanks to him and Krrsantan,

171
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:30,542
we now have enough experienced muscle
to act as enforcers.

172
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,875
The Mods have done a thorough job
of surveying the streets,

173
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:39,792
but we lack the numbers to cover
our territory if an all-out war comes.

174
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,333
We need foot soldiers.

175
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,125
I might be able to help with that.

176
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,583
You want to park your starship,
you got to do it out there in the flats.

177
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,417
I'm looking for Marshal Vanth.

178
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,125
I don't think you heard what I said.

179
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:58,458
-I heard you.
-I'll take it from here, Deputy.

180
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,250
He's new.

181
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,542
Still a bit jumpy.
Is that a Naboo starfighter?

182
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,542
That's what it started off as.

183
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:26,625
Haven't seen you since you gave up
your armor. How have you been?

184
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,500
More careful. Where's the little guy?

185
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,792
Back with his own folk.

186
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,875
That's too bad.

187
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,333
I guess we both lost something
we were fond of.

188
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,583
Can I buy you a drink?

189
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:55,208
I still don't see
what all that's got to do with me.

190
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,583
I need you to lead a garrison.

191
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,542
Your people are good fighters,

192
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,875
and there's plenty of credits
in it for them too.

193
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,792
The peace is intact, Mando.

194
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,000
We took out that dragon.
My people don't want to fight no more.

195
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:16,250
Your town might be good for now,
but it's all part of the same planet.

196
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,917
We need good people to step up

197
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,500
or the spice is bound
to come through these parts.

198
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,625
As long as I'm here, that's not a problem,

199
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:28,792
so why should they risk their lives
for this Boba Fett?

200
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,792
Mos Pelgo might be good right now...

201
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:32,875
Freetown.

202
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,000
What?

203
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,000
It's called Freetown now.

204
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,583
We changed the name. Suits us better.

205
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:43,833
Well, I fought side-by-side
with the citizens of Freetown,

206
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,583
and they're brave people,

207
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:48,500
and the Pyke Syndicate has us outnumbered,
and we need your help.

208
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,292
The town wants no part of it.

209
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,625
That's a city folk fight.

210
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,208
Is that what you say too, Marshal?

211
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,458
We're square, you and me.

212
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:10,500
Yes, we are. But I didn't think
you were one to back down from bullies.

213
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,167
See, that's what I like about you, Mando.

214
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,375
That big smile of yours
lets you get away with anything.

215
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:24,500
There's no easy way to ask for a favor.

216
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,917
I'll tell you what.

217
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,167
Things are tough around here,

218
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,625
but I'll see what I can do.

219
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,583
Get the word out.

220
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:59,833
I want all men and women of fighting age
to come to town. I want to have a meeting.

221
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,958
It's not our problem, Marshal.

222
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:05,917
No, but it might be,
after they hear what I'm gonna say.

223
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:38,000
- Hey, Jo.
- Afternoon, Marshal.

224
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,833
Do me a favor and tell these people
to head inside for a spell.

225
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:45,125
Is something wrong, Marshal?

226
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,000
I hope not.
Just rather err on the side of safety.

227
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,458
- Go on. Go, go, go.
- Let's go. Quickly.

228
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,375
What's going on, boss?

229
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,292
Let me handle this, Deputy.

230
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,125
I'm not leaving you out here alone.

231
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,375
Get inside.

232
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,375
Cobb Vanth.

233
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,875
And who might you be?

234
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:05,125
Whatever Fett is paying you, we'll match,

235
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,250
and all you've got to do is stay put
and let things play out.

236
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,250
Hey, the Marshal ain't for sale.

237
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,250
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

238
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:49,083
I'd be careful where I was
sticking my nose if I were you.

239
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,250
Is that friendly advice or a threat?

240
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:11,500
Boba Fett is a cold-blooded killer
who worked with the Empire.

241
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:18,958
You tell your spice runners
Tatooine is closed for business.

242
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,667
This planet's seen enough violence.

243
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:29,042
You should've never given up your armor.

244
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:30,750
Tatooine belongs to the Syndicate.

245
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,542
As long as the spice keeps running,

246
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,875
everyone will be left alone.

247
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,208
Hey, hey! Over here!

248
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,542
Come on. Somebody get him.

249
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,000
We need some help!
Can someone call the doctor?

250
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,708
Get a medpac!

251
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:53,833
Is he okay?

252
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:54,917
Grab the stims.

253
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
The Marshal, is he breathing?

254
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,333
Come on, get him! Get him!

255
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:03,708
There's something wrong
with the Marshal! Somebody help!

256
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,292
Come on! Bring him inside!

257
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,750
<i>Might I get you something?</i>

258
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,167
Can we take your helmets for a cleaning?

259
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:05,708
Excuse me.

260
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Nothing.

261
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:16,750
<i>Oh! Excuse me.</i>

262
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,625
<i>Oh, wait! You forgot your camtono.</i>

263
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:25,083
The Mandalorian wanted you to have this.

264
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,250
But before you take it,

265
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,917
I will give you a choice.

266
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:46,292
This...

267
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,167
is a lightsaber.

268
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,792
It belonged to my teacher, Master Yoda.

269
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:00,792
And now,

270
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,917
I'm offering it to you.

271
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,208
But you may choose only one.

272
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:20,250
If you choose the armor, you'll return
to your friend, the Mandalorian.

273
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:24,750
However, you will be giving in
to attachment to those that you love

274
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:27,625
and forsaking the way of the Jedi.

275
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,458
But if you choose the lightsaber,

276
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,917
you will be the first student
in my academy,

277
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,750
and I will train you to be a great Jedi.

278
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,750
It will take you many years
to master the ways of the Force,

279
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,667
and you may never see
the Mandalorian again

280
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,500
because, Grogu, a short time for you
is a lifetime for someone else.

281
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,667
Which do you choose?

281
00:42:09,305 --> 00:43:09,499
