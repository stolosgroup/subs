Downton Abbey
Season 2, Episode 2

4
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,800
Letter for you, William.

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,405
Why on earth are you doing that?

6
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,180
Well, someone's got to. Yes, indeed
they do.

7
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:59,920
And that someone is William or one
of the maids.

8
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:02,405
You're making work for yourself,
Mr Carson,

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,680
and I've no sympathy with that.
I'm not asking for sympathy.

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,285
I don't think you should be... What?

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
For heaven's sake. If something's
wrong put it right.

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm sorry, Lang. I don't mean to
snap.

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,000
Not to worry, my lord. You've been
in the trenches I have not.

14
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,040
I have no right to criticise.

15
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not a soldier now.

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,880
You've been invalided out. That is
perfectly honourable.

17
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,840
Is it?

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,040
People look at me and wonder why I'm
not in uniform.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,440
Then you refer them to me and I'll
give them a piece of my mind.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
Hm?

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,440
Penny for your thoughts. They're
worth a great deal more than that.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,920
What is it? My papers. They've come.
I've been called up.

23
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,405
Oh, you never have. What does it
mean?

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,940
I report for my medical
on Wednesday and once

25
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm through that I go
to Richmond for training.

26
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:08,440
Then you go to war? With any luck. I'll be
beggared if it's over before I get there.

27
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,880
If they'd listen to me it'd be over
by tea time.

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,320
Daisy, I wonder...would you give me
a picture to take with me?

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,000
I haven't got one. Then have one
taken, on your afternoon off, please.

30
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:22,240
That's enough. Let her get on with
her work.

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,685
How's Thomas coming along?

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,360
I wish he could be treated at our
hospital here.

33
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,960
Well, it's only for officers. Of
course.

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,085
Although, ideally he'd love to be
transferred there to work.

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
He won't be sent back to the front?
Not with his hand the way it is.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,240
It's such a pity he isn't under Dr
Clarkson.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,485
We might have been able to influence
him a bit. I should hope so.

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,060
Without this family
and all the money you've

39
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,600
spent his precious hospital
wouldn't exist at all.

40
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,920
Perhaps I'll ask his advice. You
never know.

41
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
I was sure you'd have a good idea of
what to do for the best.

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,780
Fancy a tour in England, Davis?

43
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,805
I assume you're having me on, sir.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,080
Not at all. General Sir Herbert
Strutt

45
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,320
has asked for my transfer to be his
ADC.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,120
He's touring England to boost recruitment.
I know Manchester and Yorkshire well.

47
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,200
It would mean a few months at home
and a promotion to captain.

48
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,160
I can't object to that.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,080
I've only got a few days before the
medical, my lady.

50
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,165
Then go and tell your father.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,560
You don't mind, do you,
Carson? We must manage

52
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,920
with no footman at all
from next Wednesday.

53
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:37,240
It'll be no different if we start
now. And you've always got Lang.

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,760
We wish you every good fortune.
Don't we, darling?

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,645
We certainly do.

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
Good luck, William. Thank you, my
lord.

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,740
So, both my footmen have gone to the
war

58
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,960
while I cut ribbons and make
speeches.

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
And keep people's spirits up...

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,840
which is very important.

61
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,440
By God, I envy them though.

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,360
I envy their self respect and I envy
their ability to sleep at night.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,100
Mr Carson doesn't like
the smell of cleaning

64
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,400
materials in here, not
just before luncheon.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,440
Come on, Mrs O'Brien. We don't want
to be unfriendly, do we?

66
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,320
You obviously don't.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Finish it now but don't blame me if
Mr Carson takes a bit out of you.

68
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,200
(CLEARS THROAT)

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,680
Hello, Mr Lang. Everything all
right?

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,325
Why do you say that?

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,480
No reason. I only meant I hope
you're enjoying yourself.

72
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:48,525
I know I would be in your shoes.

73
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,680
You never tried for the job, did
you? I never got the chance.

74
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,800
I'd no sooner heard that Mr Bates
was gone than he arrived.

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,440
What brings you here, Mr Molesley?

76
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,480
I was wondering if Anna was anywhere
around.

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,720
I could find her if you like. Oh,
no, no, no.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Just give her this. We were talking
about it the other day

79
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:13,040
and I came across a copy in...Ripon.

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,520
Elizabeth And Her German Garden?

81
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,445
Whatever's that about?

82
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
It's about an invitation to talk
some more, that's what.

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,520
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,040
Lady Grantham.

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,160
I'd love to help but it's not within
my power

86
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:42,400
to hook men from hither and thither
as I please.

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,720
That's not at all what I was asking.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,480
I thought you were saying you wanted
Corporal Barrow

89
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,205
to come and work here when he's fully
recovered.

90
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,920
I think it a credit to him that he
wants to continue to serve in this way...

91
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,660
after he's been wounded. Well,
that's as maybe

92
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:01,480
but it's not for me to decide what
happens next.

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,445
Mr Carson, are you quite well?

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Oh, leave me alone.
(GRUNTS WITH EFFORT)

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,720
After 24 hours it disappeared. Are
you all right, Carson? Of course.

96
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,760
That is, perfectly all right, Your
Ladyship, thank you.

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,485
Er, no.

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,680
Cousin Isobel says Matthew's coming
home in a fortnight.

99
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,960
He's touring England with some
general.

100
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,920
We'll have a dinner when he's here.

101
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,920
I was going to ask Richard Carlisle
about then for Saturday to Monday.

102
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,260
Be careful, Mary. Sir Richard
mustn't think you're after him.

103
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:51,487
Isn't that the truth? The truth is
neither here nor there.

104
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:54,680
It's the look of the thing that
matters. Ask Rosamund.

105
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,480
It'll take the edge off it. That'll
be nice.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,045
Like before the war.

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,600
How can we manage a pre-war house
party without a single footman?

108
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,400
My dear, Rosamund is not a house
party.

109
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,080
She's blood.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,780
I saw Mrs Drake when I went into the
village.

111
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,560
The wife of John Drake who has
Longfield Farm.

112
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,125
Oh. What did she have to say?

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,760
Apparently their final able-bodied
farmhand has been called up.

114
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,285
They need a man to drive the
tractor.

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,680
Hasn't Drake recovered from his illness?
I thought he was better. He's much better.

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,200
But he doesn't drive.

117
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,005
So I told her I could do it.

118
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,400
What? I said I could drive the
tractor.

119
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,520
Edith! You are a lady not Toad of
Toad Hall.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,960
Well, I'm doing it.

121
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,320
Don't look so bewildered. It's
simple.

122
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,725
I will drive the tractor.

123
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,565
Well, can you do that? Absolutely.

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,720
Can you hitch up the plough or
whatever it is I'm dragging?

125
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,200
Of course. When would you like me to
start?

126
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
I'd better get you something to
wear.

127
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Oh, I like a bit of life
in a house but I just

128
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,840
hope Mr Carson doesn't
spontaneously combust.

129
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,560
I had a letter yesterday.

130
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,205
Yes? It's my sister's boy.

131
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,480
He's with the Lancashire Fusiliers.

132
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:31,485
Only he's gone missing.

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,280
Missing presumed dead they call it.

134
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,720
Oh, no.

135
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,680
How did it happen? They can't find out
- how it happened, why it happened,

136
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:45,560
whether we can be sure it did happen
or he isn't lying prisoner somewhere.

137
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,320
Ask his lordship. He'll have friends in
the War Office. They can dig something up.

138
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,680
Oh, I don't like to bother him.

139
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Why not? He's got broad shoulders.

140
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,160
That's ever so fine, Mr Lang.

141
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
How can you make those big hands do
such delicate work?

142
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,800
I expect there's no end to the
things they could manage.

143
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,760
Giving you a slap for a start.

144
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
That is good. Very good.

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,760
I like to see a proper skill.

146
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Blokes think they can be a valet if
they can smile and tie a shoelace

147
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,800
but there's an art to it and I can
tell you've got it.

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,320
My mother taught me.

149
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,080
She was a lady's maid, like you.

150
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,205
Well, she knew what she was about.

151
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,880
Oh, Mr Lang. As you know, Sir
Richard Carlisle arrives later

152
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,405
and the Crawleys are coming for
dinner tonight.

153
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,640
I really can't have maids in the
dining room for such a party

154
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:50,840
so I'd be grateful if you'd help me
and play the footman.

155
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,325
Me? Wait at table?

156
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,205
Well, it's not ideal but I'm afraid
I've no choice.

157
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,120
The footman's liveries are in a
cupboard past Mrs Hughes' sitting room.

158
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,240
You should find one to fit you.

159
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm not sure what I can do but I'm
happy to try.

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
What's his name? Archie.

161
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,680
That is Archibald Philpotts.

162
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,980
He was in the Lancashire Fusiliers.

163
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,080
They think he was in northern
France.

164
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,360
You realise the most likely outcome
is that he has indeed been killed.

165
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,000
I understand, my lord. But we'd
rather know the worst than wonder.

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,200
Hm.

167
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,165
Ah. Oh, hello, Mr Molesley.

168
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,400
What are you doing here? I asked inside
and they said you were at the laundry.

169
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:42,520
Lady Mary is wearing this tonight. I
wasn't sure it was done.

170
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:45,377
I wondered if you'd had a chance to
read that book.

171
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,200
You only gave it to me yesterday. Of
course, of course.

172
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,040
But when you have read it I hope we
can exchange our views.

173
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,400
That'd be nice. Perhaps we might
bring some of the others in.

174
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,680
We could have a sort of reading
club.

175
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,805
We could do that.
(DISTANT BELL RINGS)

176
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,040
Or we could talk about it together
just we two. (FOOTSTEPS)

177
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,800
Heavens. It's later than I thought.
I must get on.

178
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,080
(DOOR OPENS)

179
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm off to change but I wanted you to
know I sent a note to Clarkson

180
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,805
which should do the trick. What did
you say?

181
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,960
That you'd asked a favour and, given that
the estate shoulders the hospital costs,

182
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:35,800
it did seem unfair if we weren't
allowed a few perks.

183
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:38,240
Quite right. Thank you, darling.

184
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,880
Well done, my lady.

185
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,200
(ENGINE RUMBLES)

186
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,040
Ready?

187
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,240
Ready!
(HEAVY CLUNKING)

188
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,800
Come on, damn you.

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
(GRINDING)

190
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,400
Whoa-ho-ho! Yes!

191
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
To the victor...the spoils.

192
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,565
Did you plant that tree?

193
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,560
Steady on. It must be 40 years old.

194
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,480
It's not a flattering light.

195
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,920
My father planted it. But you have
to be tough with fruit trees,

196
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,880
not let them outstay their welcome.

197
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
Farming needs a kind of toughness,
doesn't it?

198
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,840
There's room for sentiment but not
sentimentality.

199
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,080
Beautifully put, if I may say so, my
lady.

200
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,040
You should be a writer. Thank you.

201
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,720
How are you getting on? Very well, I
think.

202
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,920
It's not too hard for you? Not at
all. She's stronger than she looks.

203
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,600
I've brought you something to eat,
my lady.

204
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm afraid it's not what you're used
to.

205
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,880
Hey, it's not for you.

206
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,880
So it is you.

207
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,360
Ethel thought I must have a soldier
fancy man.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Is she the new maid? Yes.

209
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,760
She's a soppy sort.

210
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,800
So, tell me, was Dr Clarkson
thrilled to have your services?

211
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,160
It's Major Clarkson now but yes.

212
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,360
I don't know how you did it.

213
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,720
What about your blighty?

214
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,880
My God. It's not so bad.

215
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,080
And it lived up to its name and got
me home.

216
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,925
You'd better come inside.

217
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,245
Where's William? Training for the
army.

218
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,520
I thought he might have died for
love of you.

219
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,605
Don't be nasty as soon as you're
back.

220
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,480
Imagine Carson without a footman.
Like a ringmaster without a pony.

221
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,005
We'll have none of your cheek, thank
you, Thomas.

222
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm very sorry, Mrs Hughes, but I'm
not servant any more.

223
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,200
I take my orders from Major
Clarkson.

224
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Who's this? Ethel, the new maid. I
told you.

225
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,200
I didn't realise I was dealing with
an ex-footman.

226
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm the one that got away.

227
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,525
Gives hope to us all.

228
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,280
Ethel, help with the luggage.
They're nearly back with Sir Richard.

229
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,080
We've got a visitor, Mr Carson.
I've seen him.

230
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,400
Where's Mr Bates? Gone. Replaced by
Mr Lang.

231
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,480
So not all the changes were bad.

232
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,080
Oh. We're so pleased to have you
here, Sir Richard.

233
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,005
Lady Grantham. Welcome. Thank you.

234
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,725
I hope the train wasn't too tiring.
Hello, Mary.

235
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,520
Not a bit, no. I got a lot done.
Hello, Aunt Rosamund.

236
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:19,480
Brother, dear. How are you?

237
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,680
Lovely to see you, Rosamund.

238
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,760
He's nice, isn't he? He spent the
entire journey reading his own papers.

239
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,040
But I'm sure I'll love him dearly if
he'll ever look up from the page.

240
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,725
Branson, when you've finished
unloading

241
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
go to the hospital and remind Lady
Sybil that we expect her for dinner.

242
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,405
And tell her I mean it.

243
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Really. They're working her like a
packhorse in a mine.

244
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,080
I think she enjoys it though.

245
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,840
Please tell her to come home in time
to change.

246
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,120
I can't possibly come. Really, Mama
is incorrigible.

247
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,360
It's not poor Branson's fault.

248
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,720
What is the point of Mama's soirees?
What are they for?

249
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,760
Well, I'm going up for dinner and
I'm glad. Is that wrong?

250
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,405
Thomas.

251
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,800
You can cover for Nurse Crawley,
can't you?

252
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,400
I can.

253
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,840
So you're back then, safe and sound.

254
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,885
That's not how I'd put it with my
hand the way it is

255
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,680
but, yes, Major Clarkson's found me
a place and I'm grateful.

256
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,680
Can you give Lieutenant Courtenay
his pills?

257
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,640
Of course I can. Be glad to.

258
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,005
(DOOR OPENS)

259
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Is everything under control?

260
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,040
Mr Lang seems a bit nervous.

261
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,800
Stage fright. But what about you?

262
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,560
Oh...I'm a trouper.

263
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,200
And we can't complain, can we? Not when
you think what's going on in France.

264
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,080
Still...a broken heart can be as
painful as a broken limb.

265
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,440
Don't feel sorry for me, Mrs Hughes.
I'm not.

266
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,120
I know what real love is and there
aren't many who can say that.

267
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm one of the lucky ones.

268
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
If you say so.

269
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,840
So the fashion for cocktails before
dinner hasn't reached Yorkshire?

270
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,520
I could get Carson to make you one
but I won't guarantee the result.

271
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
Mrs Crawley, Captain Crawley and
Miss Swire.

272
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Ah. Isobel.

273
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,885
Well now, still in one piece.

274
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,605
Thank God. Touch wood. I never
stopped touching it.

275
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle? My
cousin, Captain Crawley.

276
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:55,085
How do you do? And his fiancee Miss
Swire.

277
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I know Miss Swire. Her uncle and I
are old friends.

278
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:00,120
Well, old acquaintances anyway.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,920
What do you think Mary sees in him?
Besides the money, you mean?

280
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:10,840
It must be more than that. For
you...not necessarily for her.

281
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,240
What's General Strutt like? Well,
you know. Rather important.

282
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,840
And brave. He got the DSO in South
Africa.

283
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,360
Is there any chance it might be permanent
that we can count you out of danger?

284
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,560
It would be such a relief. I wouldn't
want that, I'm afraid.

285
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,725
He's promised to get me back to
France.

286
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
How's your appointment with the
North Ridings working out?

287
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,920
Oh, that. W...

288
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,040
It seems I won't be going to the
front after all.

289
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,965
I made a mistake.

290
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,960
They only wanted a mascot.

291
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,560
Mary tells me you're in newspapers.

292
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,725
Well, I own a few. Oh.

293
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,325
That must be quite a responsibility

294
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,560
at a time like this, you know, in a
war.

295
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,120
When it's so important to keep
people's spirits up.

296
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,005
Lady Grantham, my responsibility is
to my investors.

297
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,480
I need to keep my readership up. I leave
public spirits to government propaganda.

298
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,525
So now you've met Granny.

299
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,765
I warn you she has very strong
opinions.

300
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,880
Oh, you need have no fear where
that's concerned, my dear.

301
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,880
We're more than evenly matched.

302
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,300
Where are the spoons for this? Just
here.

303
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,485
Oh, my God. I've forgotten the
sauce.

304
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,080
Mr Lang's bringing the sauce and the
Melba toast. Right, good.

305
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,357
Now, Mr Lang, are you ready? I think
so.

306
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:31,600
It's always the left and not ladies
first.

307
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,605
No, just follow Mr Carson.

308
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,520
Start with old Lady Grantham, then
his lordship, then just go on round.

309
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,160
You must have done this before. Not
since the war started.

310
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,805
I don't think I even knew that. Why
in't it just ladies first?

311
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,500
Wouldn't it be more
polite? That's how it's done

312
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,160
on the continent. We don't
like foreign ways here.

313
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,160
I gather your footman, Thomas, has
returned to the village. No.

314
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,245
Crikey. Where did you see him?

315
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
At the hospital. Seems he's working
there.

316
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,040
I wonder how he wangled that.
(No, no, get back behind me.)

317
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,045
What do you make of our plutocrat?

318
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,605
He's an opportunity. Mary's needs a
position

319
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,680
and, preferably a powerful one. He
can provide it.

320
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,160
You don't think she'd be happier
with a more traditional set-up?

321
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:26,160
Will she have the option?

322
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,240
Thank you but I already have some.
No, no. Give that to me.

323
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,240
Oh! I do apologise, my lady.

324
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,680
Mr Lang, get a cl- (GROANS IN PAIN)

325
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,960
(MOANS) Carson. Carson, what's the
matter?

326
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Now, Carson, it's all right.
Everything will be fine.

327
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:49,097
Edith, go with Branson and fetch
Major Clarkson.

328
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:52,240
I'll telephone and explain. What
about my dress?

329
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,605
Edith will get you a coat. Come.

330
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,320
Sybil will know what to do until the
doctor comes.

331
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,325
There's never a dull moment in this
house.

332
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,080
Lady Sybil and I will take him upstairs.
Mrs Hughes will show us the way.

333
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:06,520
I can help. No, let me. I know what
I'm doing.

334
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,885
I'm sure that's not necessary, my
lady.

335
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,240
It's not my lady now, Carson.
(Mr Lang.) It's Nurse Crawley.

336
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,240
(Mr Lang. Come on.)

337
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,900
Anna and Ethel, I must trust the
dinner to you.

338
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,800
I'd say the first course is a thing
of the past.

339
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:24,005
Then clear and lay the hot plates.

340
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,960
Daisy, you fetch the beef and the
rest of it. Anna, you serve the wine.

341
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,805
Mr Lang, you can clear up the mess.

342
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,880
I'll do that. There's no need. I
don't mind. I thank you.

343
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,680
Mr Lang, you'd better go downstairs.

344
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,805
Well, Clarkson's seen him.

345
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,760
It's definitely not a heart attack
but he does need rest.

346
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:49,760
He's working much too hard.

347
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
For a start he's just got to let the
maids serve in the dining room.

348
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,240
Quite right. There is a war.

349
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,320
Even Carson has to make sacrifices.

350
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Poor Lang. He looked like a rabbit
in front of a snake.

351
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,120
I don't understand it. He seemed so
solid when I met him,

352
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,480
even taciturn, now he's a bundle of
nerves.

353
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,680
I heard what you said to Matthew
about the regiment.

354
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,000
Everyone else knows what a fool I
made of myself, why shouldn't he?

355
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,600
I don't think you're a fool. Isn't
that enough?

356
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:21,960
No.

357
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,600
Maybe it should be but it isn't.

358
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

359
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,320
(DISTANT MACHINE-GUN FIRE)

360
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Are you all right, Mr Lang?

361
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
You're not, are you?

362
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,760
I've seen shell shock before, you
know.

363
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I had a brother with it.

364
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,320
My favourite brother, as it happens.

365
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,240
And I was his favourite too.

366
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,520
They sent him back and he's dead
now.

367
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,960
They won't send me back.

368
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm a goner as far as they're
concerned.

369
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:16,960
You shouldn't be working yet. I must
work.

370
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I don't know what to do else.

371
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I have to work. (FOOTSTEPS)

372
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,285
Mr Lang. I thought you'd gone up.

373
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
He wanted to hang up the livery
before it got creased.

374
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,160
Well, we can discuss the dinner
another time.

375
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,680
I'll say good night. Good night, Mrs
Hughes. Good night.

376
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,325
May I come in?

377
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,640
That's very kind of you, my lady,
but do you think you should?

378
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,880
Let's hope my reputation will
survive it.

379
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
And rest easy, please.

380
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,000
I gather it isn't too serious. Oh,
I've been very stupid, my lady.

381
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,045
I let myself get flustered.

382
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,365
I regard that as highly
unprofessional.

383
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
It won't happen again. Don't be too
hard on yourself.

384
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:26,400
I was particularly sorry to spoil
things for Sir Richard,

385
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:28,600
knowing he was a guest of yours.
Don't be.

386
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
I think he found it all quite
exciting.

387
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,880
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

388
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,760
I don't know. Maybe.

389
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
And Captain Crawley...

390
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,400
is he happy with the changes, so to
speak?

391
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,480
May I give you one piece of advice,
my lady?

392
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Tell him what's in your heart.

393
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,240
If you still love him, let him know.

394
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,960
Then even if he's killed, and he may
be, you won't be sorry.

395
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,160
But if you don't tell him you could
regret it all your life long.

396
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,760
And what about Miss Swire?

397
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:16,760
Well...Miss Swire.

398
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,880
As if any man in his right mind could
prefer Miss Swire to you.

399
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,320
Oh, I'm so sorry, my lady. I didn't
know you were in here.

400
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:32,960
I was just going. Carson's been
boosting my confidence.

401
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,240
That's something I'd never have
thought she was short of.

402
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,560
What about you, sir?

403
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,200
What did you do before the war
started?

404
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,760
I was up at Oxford.

405
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,120
But I only ever planned to farm.

406
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,120
Farm and shoot.

407
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,960
And hunt and fish.

408
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,080
And everything I'll never do again.

409
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,360
You don't know that. We've had cases
of gas blindness wearing off.

410
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:15,045
Rare cases.

411
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,125
And much sooner than this.

412
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,360
It doesn't help me to be lied to, you
know.

413
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm finished.

414
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,400
And I'd rather face it than dodge it.

415
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,480
I'd better go.

416
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,720
Where's Rosamund? She's with your
mama.

417
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,080
Trying to talk her into the idea of
Sir Richard.

418
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,120
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

419
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,880
Are you?

420
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,565
Can we stop for a minute?

421
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,400
Don't tell me you're tired. I'm not
tired, I'm hot.

422
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,445
This tweed is too thick.

423
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,120
It looks more suited to shooting
than walking.

424
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,160
I had it made for the weekend. I
didn't know there was a difference.

425
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:01,720
It doesn't matter. That's like the
rich who say money doesn't matter.

426
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:04,137
It matters enough when you haven't
got it.

427
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,520
I know you don't care about our
silly rules.

428
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,520
You're always very clear on that
score.

429
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,520
You make me sound rude and I hope
I'm not that.

430
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,800
I mean to learn how to do things
properly and you could help me a lot.

431
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,560
But I'm not ashamed of being what
they call a self-made man.

432
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm proud of it.

433
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Is the point of all this to test me
in some way?

434
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Maybe.

435
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,680
Are you shocked by my bold and
modern values?

436
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,600
Oh, Sir Richard, you flatter
yourself.

437
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,520
It takes a good deal more than that
to shock me.

438
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,400
But, Mama, who do you imagine is out
there with more to offer?

439
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:55,720
I'm not a romantic. I should hope
not.

440
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,680
But even I will concede that the
heart does not exist

441
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:00,977
solely for the purpose of pumping
blood.

442
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,240
That is charming, especially from
you.

443
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,920
But Mary seems to have...blotted her
copybook in some way.

444
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
So she needs a suitable marriage
that will mend her fences.

445
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,645
Well, how do we know Carlisle is
suitable?

446
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,365
Who is he? Who'd ever heard of him
before the war?

447
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Sir Richard is powerful and rich and
well on the way to a peerage.

448
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,740
Of course, he may not be all that
one would wish

449
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,467
but Mary can soon smooth off the
rough edges.

450
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,160
Well, you should know. What do you
mean by that?

451
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,725
Marmaduke was a gentleman.

452
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,045
Marmaduke was the grandson of a
manufacturer.

453
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,800
His mother was the daughter of a
baronet. Maybe...

454
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,080
but they were no great threat to the
Plantagenets.

455
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,320
The point is I made up for any
social deficiencies.

456
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,365
And he provided me with a position.

457
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,685
It was a good exchange and it worked
well.

458
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
How can Matthew have chosen that
little blonde piece?

459
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:02,720
You speak so eloquently of the human
heart, Mama.

460
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,440
You must be aware of its...vagaries.

461
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,840
'Things cannot be as they were and
Jack has your best interests at heart.'

462
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,200
Stop.

463
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,320
Who's Jack?

464
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,840
My younger brother.

465
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,400
He means to replace me.

466
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,520
It's what he's always wanted.

467
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah...well...

468
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,040
I'm sorry.

469
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,840
I mustn't bore you.

470
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,480
Don't let them walk all over you.

471
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,640
You've got to fight your corner.

472
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,560
What with? Your brain.

473
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,600
You're not a victim. Don't let them
make you into one.

474
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
You know, when you talk like that...

475
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,360
..I almost believe you.

476
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,280
You should believe me.

477
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,920
All my life they've...

478
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,600
..pushed me around just cos I'm
different.

479
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,280
How? Why are you different?

480
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
Never mind.

481
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,725
Look...

482
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,880
Look, I...I don't know if you're
going to see again or not.

483
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,960
But I do know you have to fight
back.

484
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,160
How dare you threaten me? How dare
I?

485
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,965
I assure I dare a great deal more
than that.

486
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,580
But you can't, you wouldn't. I
didn't say I would.

487
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,160
I was merely reminding you it was in
my power.

488
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,960
Lady Painswick. Lady Rosamund.

489
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm sorry. I'll get these things
sorted out before long.

490
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,200
It's not important.

491
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
Miss Swire and I were just talking
about old times.

492
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,240
Happy old times, I hope.

493
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,440
Will you forgive me? I want to write
some letters before dinner.

494
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,920
Let's have a rest. We've earned it.

495
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,640
I should have got a glass. You can't
drink out of a bottle, my lady.

496
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:34,685
I wish you'd call me Edith.

497
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,920
And of course I can drink from the
bottle.

498
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,920
Would you like me to teach you to
drive?

499
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,600
Not much...cos then you wouldn't
come here no more.

500
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,840
Although that wouldn't matter to you.

501
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,800
Why do you say that?

502
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,920
You're pretty and clever and fine.

503
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,720
You're from a different world.

504
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,200
Is something wrong? No, just having
a break.

505
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,500
Because you want to get into town to
fetch the bone meal.

506
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:12,520
And be back in time to feed the cows
before it's dark.

507
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,720
They could always have a midnight
feast.

508
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,840
That's it, sir. If you move the stick fast
enough you don't have to slacken your pace.

509
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,840
Check the width of the space as well
as any obstruction.

510
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,120
Lieutenant Courtenay, well done.

511
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
You're making good progress. Thanks
to my saviours, sir.

512
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,800
So you'll be pleased to hear that it's
time to continue your treatment elsewhere.

513
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
What? At Farley Hall.

514
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,280
You're not ill any more. All you need
is time to adjust to your condition.

515
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:50,320
The staff at Farley can help with
that.

516
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,000
But, sir, these two are helping me
here.

517
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,000
Nurse Crawley and Corporal Barrow
are not trained in specialist care.

518
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,280
Please. Don't send me away.

519
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,360
Not yet.

520
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,640
Sir, surely we...

521
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,600
Lieutenant...you must know that
every one of our beds is needed

522
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,680
for the injured and dying from
Arras.

523
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,920
Hm?

524
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,600
Corporal, I'll see you in my office.

525
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,180
Sir, I only meant to say that
Lieutenant Courtenay is depressed.

526
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:33,800
I will not leave wounded soldiers
freezing or sweating under canvas

527
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,965
because a junior officer is
depressed!

528
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,480
(KNOCK AT DOOR) Yes? I thought you
may want to know what I think.

529
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:41,565
Why should I?

530
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,080
Nurse Crawley, I may not be your
social superior in a Mayfair ballroom

531
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:48,600
but in this hospital I have the
deciding voice.

532
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,160
Please help him prepare his
belongings. He leaves in the morning.

533
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,140
Anna and Ethel will wait at the table.
I will supervise. What's wrong with that?

534
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:05,360
Nothing. Except that it's how a chartered
accountant has his dinner served.

535
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:08,637
I can think of worse insults. If you
say so.

536
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,880
But I don't want Lang allowed
anywhere near it.

537
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Oh, Mr Bates. Where are you when we
need you?

538
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,400
Can you bring me the wine ledgers and
I'll make a selection?

539
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:24,240
His lordship's already done that.
Just try to rest.

540
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,765
To rest or to feel redundant?

541
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,240
Both if it'll slow you down for a
minute and a half.

542
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,240
The world does not turn on the style
of a dinner.

543
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,560
My world does.

544
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
How does he know Miss Swire?

545
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,205
What? Miss Swire.

546
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,120
They were in the garden when I came
back from Mama's.

547
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:47,080
I suppose they met in London.

548
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Would you like me to come back
later, my lady? No, come in.

549
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:55,040
I was just leaving.

550
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,380
How's Carson getting on? Oh, much
better, my lady.

551
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:07,000
Mrs Hughes is having a job keeping
him in bed.

552
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,840
He gave me some advice last night.

553
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,525
Oh, yes?

554
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,520
Was it good advice?

555
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,005
It was about honesty.

556
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,240
He thinks I should say what I really
feel.

557
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,520
Sounds a bit wild for Mr Carson.

558
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,640
Do you think he's right?

559
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,560
Well, they do say honesty is the
best policy.

560
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,085
And I think you regret being honest

561
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,320
less often than you regret telling
lies.

562
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,120
He must have smuggled a razor into
his bed.

563
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
There was nothing to be done.

564
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,120
It's because we ordered him to go.
We don't know that.

565
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
This is a tragedy, I don't deny it.

566
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,840
But I cannot see what other course
was open to me.

567
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,285
We have no room for men to
convalesce

568
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,000
and Farley is the nearest house I
can send them to.

569
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,640
There is a solution and it's staring
us in the face.

570
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,040
Downton Abbey. Would they ever allow
it?

571
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,840
Or even consider it? I think they
would.

572
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,120
After this I think they can be made
to.

But, Sir Richard, you don't have to
- Richard, please.

575
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,040
You see, I want you to marry me.

576
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Why?

577
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,480
Because I think very highly of you.

578
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,040
Very highly...goodness.

579
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,640
I mean it. I think we'd do well
together.

580
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,540
We could be a good team.

581
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:19,560
Now, that sounds better.

582
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,965
But I can't help thinking

583
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that tradition demands a little
mention of love.

584
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:30,360
Oh, I can talk about love and moon
and June

585
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:32,360
and all the rest of it if you wish.

586

But we're more than that.

587

We're strong and sharp.

588
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,480
And we can build something worth
having, you and I, if you'll let us.

589

and bounds.

But I promise to think about it
properly.

593

I'm counting on it.

If you just go to that one over
there.

595

You're right here. Right to the
other end. Down you go.

see. Yes, I just want to help.

No. No, it's more savage and more
cruel than I could have imagined but...

604
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,840
I feel useful for the first time in
my life. That must be a good thing.

not.

You're quite safe.

608
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,640
So you wouldn't go back...

609
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,685
to your life before the war?

610
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,840
No. No, I could never go back to
that again.

What's the matter?

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,920
Are you looking for Matthew?

I was...but it's not important.

Tell me what it is...please.

619
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,560
He has to go a day early. Tomorrow
morning, in fact.

620
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,960
Only to meet his general, surely.
Not back to France.

621
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,200
But he must go back one day.

622
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,040
I can't imagine what I'd do if
anything happened to him.

623
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I know he'll be all right.

No, you don't. None of us do.

We say that sort of thing but we
don't know.

If he died I don't think I could go
on living.

doesn't sound too dangerous.

I can't...but thank you.

Just to say...

639
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,840
..we hope you're still coming for
dinner tonight.

640
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,760
Certainly we are. Why wouldn't we?

641
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Sure? It'll be your last evening.

642
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,200
Why? Don't you want me? Of course I
want you...very much.

643
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm sorry you've had a wasted
journey. Not at all.

644
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,680
I needed an excuse for a walk.

645
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,320
I'll see you at eight.

646
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,280
Ethel said you wanted me. No, no, I
just need a word with you.

If it's about the book I'm afraid -
It's not about the book.

648
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,600
What is it then?

649
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,200
I understand that Mr Bates has
gone...for good.

650
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,480
Yes, I believe that's true.

651
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
So I was hoping...

652
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,040
..we might be able to see a little
more of each other.

653

Mr Molesley...

654
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
..I take this as a real
compliment...

655
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,560
But it's not going to happen.

656
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:30,120
No.

657
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,760
You see...

658
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,920
..if you had a child and that child
was taken from you,

659
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
if the child was sent to the moon,

660
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,200
there'd never be one day when they
were out of your thoughts,

661
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,640
no moment when you weren't praying
for their welfare,

662
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,960
even if you knew you'd never see
them again.

663
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,560
That's you and Mr Bates.

664
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,960
That's me and Mr Bates.

665
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,240
But thank you.

666
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,080
I've kept you too long. You should
get back or they'll be looking for you.

667
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:21,120
We've done a lot, haven't we? We
have.

668
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,720
I'll have to invent some tasks or they'll
be no need for you to come much more.

669
00:43:25,755 --> 00:43:27,680
Then start inventing, please.

670
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,160
I will.

671
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,040
Cos I'd hate it if you were to stay
away.

672
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
So would I.

673
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,560
I'd absolutely hate it.

674
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,320
I can't believe I've done that. I'm
awfully glad you did.

675
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
You'll have me thrown in the tower.

676
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,920
Only if they give me the key.

677
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:02,245
Fold it in. Don't slap it.

678
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,640
You're making a cake not beating a
carpet.

679
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,920
Oh, sorry, Your Lordship, I didn't
see you there.

680
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,965
It's quite all right, Mrs Patmore.

681
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,960
I wonder, is there somewhere we could
have a word? Er...

682
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:16,400
er... Why not go into my sitting
room?

683
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,640
Please sit.

684
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,525
I do have some news of your nephew.

685
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,840
I telephoned the War Office. They've just
come back to me but it's not good news.

686
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,285
I knew he was dead all along.

687
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,000
I said so to my sister. I said, 'Kate,
he's gone and you'll have to fa -

688
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:39,960
Mrs Patmore, it's worse than that.

689
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,840
What can be worse than being dead?

690
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,200
Private Philpotts was shot for
cowardice on 17 February.

691
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,685
Oh, my God.

692
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,520
This explains why the regiment was
reluctant to supply information.

(SOBS)

694
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,520
Mrs Hughes, could you come in,
please?

695
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,920
Mrs Patmore has had some bad news.
Her nephew has been killed.

696
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:20,480
Oh, he never has? And that's not
all.

697
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:22,480
It is all, Mrs Patmore.

698
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,405
Let us make sure it is all.

699
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
Your sister needs to know no more
than this.

700
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,920
We cannot know the truth. We should
not judge.

701
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,445
I think it's a ridiculous idea.

702
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,725
Why? Because this is a house not a
hospital.

703
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,240
Granny, a convalescent home is where
people rest and recuperate.

704
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:48,240
But if there are relapses, what
then?

705
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,280
Amputation in the dining room?
Resuscitation in the pantry?

706
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:54,637
It would be the most tremendous
disturbance.

707
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,960
If you knew how chaotic things are
as it is.

708
00:45:56,995 --> 00:45:58,960
But when so much good can be done.

709
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,640
I forbid it.

710
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,640
To have strange men prodding and
prying around the house.

711
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,960
To say nothing of pocketing the
spoons.

712
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,885
It's out of the question. I hesitate
to remind you

713
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,480
but this is my house, Robert's and
mine, and we will make the decision.

714
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Oh, I see.

715
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,600
So now I'm an outsider...who need
not be consulted.

716
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,560
Since you put it like that, yes.

717
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,640
What was it like at the hospital
today?

718
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,880
At the front...

719
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
..the men pray to be spared, of
course.

720
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,160
But if that's not to be...

721
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,280
..they pray for a bullet that kills
them cleanly.

722
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,240
For too many of them today that
prayer had not been answered.

723
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,325
We'll eat in about 20 minutes.

724
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,400
Good. And would you have any to
spare for a poor traveller?

725
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,920
William, I don't believe it. Pinch
me. I am your dream come true.

726
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,760
You're like a real soldier. I am a
real soldier, thank you very much.

727
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:23,805
Now come and give me a kiss. Ooh.

728
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,380
We'll have none of that. Won't you
let a tommy kiss his sweetheart,

729
00:47:27,415 --> 00:47:30,807
when he's off to fight the Hun? Have
you finished your training?

730
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:34,200
Not yet but it won't be long. On the
eve of departure we'll see

731
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:36,120
but right now put her down.

732
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,845
I'll show you.

733
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,080
What do you think? There. Smart, in't
it?

734
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,520
William? What a treat to see you.

735
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,080
And how smart you look.

736
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,405
Welcome. Thanks. Supper won't be
long.

737
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm just clearing the dining room.
Shall I help?

738
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,920
Course not. You're in the army now.

739
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
So, still full of the joys of war
then?

740
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,120
I'm not sorry to be part of it, Mr
Lang, and I can't pretend I am.

741
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,165
Oh, yes, you're part of it.

742
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,120
Like a metal cog is part of a
factory.

743
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,680
Or a grain of sand is part of the
beach.

744
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,760
It's all right, Mr Lang. I
understand.

745
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,000
And I'm not saying I'm important or
owt like that.

746
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,845
But I believe in this war.

747
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,600
I believe in what we're fighting for
and I want to do my bit.

748
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,000
Then God help you.

(LOW CONVERSATION)

750
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,960
Edith seems jolly tonight.

751
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,240
She's found her metier - farm
labouring.

752
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,245
Don't be so tough on her.

753
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,880
That's like asking the fox to spare
the chicken.

754
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,280
What about you? Last time you told
me good news was imminent.

755
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,120
Would you be happy if it were? Of
course.

756
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,120
I've found someone now and I want
you to do the same.

757
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,560
If you'd taken another minute to
make up your mind,

758
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:18,600
we'd all have marched over the cliff.

759
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,320
I'll tell you something else as
well...

760
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,120
William's got more to say than a
parliamentary candidate.

761
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,600
What's the matter? I know it's my
fault...

762
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,200
but I wish I hadn't let him think
that we're like sweethearts.

763
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,080
Because we're not. Not by my
reckoning, anyway.

764
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,920
Too late for second thoughts now,
missy.

765
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,460
You don't have to marry him when it
comes to it

766
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:45,120
but you can't let him go to war with
a broken heart

767
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:46,960
or he won't come back.

768
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,160
What a time we've had.

769
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,200
Poor Sir Richard must have thought
he'd come to a madhouse.

770
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,120
I don't expect it'll put him off.

771
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,360
I'm going to accept him.

772
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,120
Do you think I should?

773
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,880
That's not for me to say.

774
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,240
If you love him more than anyone in
the world then of course you should.

775
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,680
It's not as simple as that. Oh?

776
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,525
It is for me.

777
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,520
But then I'm not your ladyship.

778
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,720
Did you love Bates more than anyone
else in the world?

779
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,820
I did.

780
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:43,520
I do.

781
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
I'll never love again like I love
him.

782
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,240
Ever.

783
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,400
Well, there you are then.

784
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,040
One day you'll meet someone else and
you'll marry.

785
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,520
Perhaps it'll be second best but...

786
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,360
..it doesn't mean you can't have a
life.

787
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,320
I think it does...for me.

788
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,960
Are you sure you should be doing this?
We've managed well with Mrs Hughes.

789
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,645
Quite sure, my lord.

790
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,920
And breakfast is not a taxing
assignment.

791
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,480
Edith, this is a message for you. Mrs Drake
writes that they've decided to hire a man

792
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:30,480
so they won't be needing you any
more.

793
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,320
Is that all she says? Oh, well,
she's very grateful.

794
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:37,520
Here. She says she and Drake send
their thanks to you

795
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:39,840
for giving up so much of your
valuable time.

796
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,240
I expect it's rather a relief.

797
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,800
Oh, I wouldn't say that...

798
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,120
not entirely. Has Lady Sybil gone
already?

799
00:51:49,155 --> 00:51:51,565
She had a tray at half past six. She
would.

800
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,480
Carson, did you know we're to be
turned into a hospital?

801
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:56,365
A convalescent home.

802
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
I'm afraid we've all bullied you
into the whole thing.

803
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:01,845
I hope you're not dreading it too
much.

804
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,080
Not exactly but it's a brave new world
we're headed for, no doubt about that.

805
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,080
We just try to meet it with as much
grace as we can muster.

806
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,100
I thought I saw Mr Bates. Isn't he
in London?

807
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:22,645
Thomas, the footman, managing
Downton Abbey?

808
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,400
Give orders for the beds, the nurses
and the patients

809
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:27,320
to be packed up and shipped out at
once!

810
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:29,285
Do you remember when Aunt Rosamund

811
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,645
found you and Richard Carlisle in
the garden?

812
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,640
I hope you didn't unearth anything
too fearful. Ask Mary.

813
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:36,597
I'll get them one way or another.

814
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:38,485
There's no need to be so rough.

815
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,720
There's every need...to stop a
murder.

816
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:42,205
Are we engaged?

817
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,820
It's not against the law
to take a mistress. I know

818
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:47,400
you and I love you. That is
not the right path for you.
