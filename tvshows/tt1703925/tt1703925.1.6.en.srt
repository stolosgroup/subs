3
00:00:20,243 --> 00:00:21,843
Can't find that in Sheboygan.

4
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:24,796
Huh?

5
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:26,898
Why don't you help me out here? Yes, ma'am.

6
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:35,707
Oh... Oh, hey, Ryan.

7
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,341
I, um, didn't see you there.

8
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:39,512
Yeah, I didn't see you, either.

9
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:42,682
That's so weird that neither
of us saw each other.

10
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:45,118
You remember my boyfriend Drew.
What's up, bro?

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,721
Oh.

12
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:48,322
We're going to put some burgers

13
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:49,690
on the grill later.

14
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,492
Maybe crack some brews?

15
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:52,827
Yeah, you should come.

16
00:00:52,828 --> 00:00:54,129
Sounds fun.

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,964
Here comes the corny nickname.

18
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:57,666
See you then, Ry-Guy.

19
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,601
And here comes the part where he carries her

20
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,837
into the house like a
Viking on a rape quest.

21
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:03,473
No! No! Come on.

22
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:13,851
He's going to wreck that, mate.

23
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,689
I know how you feel about Jenna.

24
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,725
Stop pretending this whole Drew
situation doesn't make you sick.

25
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:22,360
I'm surprised you still have an appetite.

26
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:23,628
What am I going to do?

27
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,229
She's dating Drew,

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,164
and he doesn't seem like such a bad guy.

29
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:29,133
Mm. Not a bad guy, huh?

30
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:30,968
Have you any idea what it feels like

31
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,469
to have someone come into your house,

32
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,704
treat you with no respect

33
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,505
and act like they own the place?

34
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,576
Did you eat my sandwich?

35
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:40,844
Oh, I get it.

36
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:42,879
Because I'm a dog, right?

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,948
I can only imagine what
you'd say if I was black.

38
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:52,087
Hey, Ryan. Wait for it.

39
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:54,022
Yeah! Ry-Bread!

40
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:58,928
Hey, Drew... a blank.

41
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,330
Ha! Burgers will be up soon.

42
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,398
Have a seat, bro.

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,367
Uh...

44
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,435
I-I don't... I don't mind standing.

45
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:07,669
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

46
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,937
Hey, Wilfy, down.

47
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,007
Go on.

48
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:19,115
That's it.

49
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:22,118
You love your Big Daddy Drew. Yes, you do.

50
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,987
Now, sit.

51
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,188
In the dirt? Wilfy, sit.

52
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:30,026
Ah! That's my boy.

53
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:33,529
Wow. Never seen Wilfred so well-behaved.

54
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,164
Oh, he's always like that with Drew.

55
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,065
I think it's the sound of his voice.

56
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,400
He's got a pack mentality.

57
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,801
Dogs want to please their alpha,

58
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:41,203
so they like to know who's in charge.

59
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:47,809
Look, I live and breathe
Sheboygan Lager sales,

60
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,478
so when I find out this Milwaukee's Brew guy

61
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,514
is talking to my clients, here's what I do.

62
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:55,917
I go into his territory,

63
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:59,955
and I take 15 store managers
out golfing in one week.

64
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:01,256
And before I know it,

65
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:04,126
my sales are up 40%.

66
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,096
About a month later,

67
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:09,198
I see this Milwaukee's Brew guy at a bar.

68
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,534
He's looking all drunk and depressed.

69
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:15,304
Turns out he lost his job.

70
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:17,806
Aw. So I bought him a beer.

71
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:19,675
A Sheboygan Lager! Come on!

72
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,209
Yeah!

73
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,145
Don't you think that was
a little harsh, Drew?

74
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:25,180
Insert moronic sports metaphor here.

75
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,982
When it comes to beverage sales,

76
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:30,185
you either swing for the fences
or you get off the field.

77
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:31,920
Nauseating.

78
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,188
I don't understand, Wilfred.

79
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,590
If you hate Drew so much,

80
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,058
why do you do everything he says?

81
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,960
I don't know, Ryan.

82
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,829
Why do you do everything I say? I don't.

83
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,130
- Hey!
- Aw, drop it.

84
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,065
Now.

85
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:47,137
Dogs shouldn't eat from the table, Ry.

86
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:49,239
Makes 'em think they're our equals.

87
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,607
But that doesn't mean we can't have

88
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,943
a little fun, now, does it, Wilfy?

89
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:55,946
Do that again, and I swear to... What?

90
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:57,113
Careful, Drew.

91
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,648
Oh, it is on.

92
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,517
Oh. Wilfred loves to wrestle.

93
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:02,352
Here we go. Bring it on, bitch.

94
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:04,354
I'm going to punch those perfect
white teeth down your throat.

95
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:07,390
Great guy.

96
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,859
He really is.

97
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,727
I just wish he wasn't so competitive.

98
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,030
You fur ball!

99
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:16,433
Got to be competitive to
be good at sales, right?

100
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,968
Yes, but sometimes he takes it too far.

101
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,604
You know, like last Christmas,

102
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:23,073
my dad beat him at Wii Golf,
and he got so angry

103
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,741
that he threw the controller
through the window.

104
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,076
I was so upset, I didn't
talk to him for a week.

105
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:29,579
Well, nobody's perfect.

106
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,781
Well, that's true.

107
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:34,884
And Wilfy's just crazy about him.

108
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,118
I'll bite off your ears

109
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,786
and box the bloody holes that remain!

110
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,654
And he's got a good heart,

111
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,756
and... he makes me really happy.

112
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,192
All right.

113
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:47,828
I think the big fella's all tuckered out.

114
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:53,967
Your death... will be... my holiday.

115
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,210
Hello?

116
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,344
Ryan, it's me.

117
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,946
Wilfred, what's wrong?

118
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:07,648
Back-to-back-to-back-to-back-
to-back orgasms.

119
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:08,849
That's what's wrong.

120
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,350
I'm hanging up.

121
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,156
What?

122
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:17,557
Ryan, it's me again.

123
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:19,392
We can't sit by and let this caveman

124
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:21,761
get his naughty-boy on
with the love of our life.

125
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:24,230
Or maybe you need some more convincing.

126
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,935
We have to get rid of Drew.
Wilfred, Jenna's in love.

127
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:32,271
I don't want to do anything
to hurt their relationship.

128
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:35,408
Why not? Because it's wrong.
Stop bothering me.

129
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,411
I will not stop bothering you until...

130
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,679
Wilfy, quiet!

131
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,713
Gotta go.

132
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,886
JENNA Yeah! Oh!

133
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:48,590
Bring it! Oh!

134
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:51,526
Put your legs up.

135
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,362
Put your legs up, please.

136
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:55,130
Come on. Come on, Bear.

137
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:56,398
Work with me here.

138
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,933
Aah! What's the use?

139
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:02,570
You see what Drew does to me, Ryan?

140
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,105
I'm so emasculated, I can't even

141
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:07,042
raise a fence post for stupid old Bear.

142
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:09,444
I need your help.

143
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:12,880
What you're asking me to do
goes against my conscience.

144
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:15,183
I couldn't live with myself. Really?

145
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:16,918
But Drew sex-punching
Jenna for hours on end--

146
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,353
you can live with that?

147
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,755
Look, we just have to be patient.

148
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,191
Long-distance relationships
almost never last.

149
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:24,992
And from what Jenna tells me,

150
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:26,394
it sounds like they've got other problems.

151
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,896
From what Jenna tells you?

152
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:31,700
So... so you guys are,
like, girlfriends now?

153
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,069
No.

154
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,305
This is how it started with Jenna's

155
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:38,975
old college chum, Bobby "Blue Balls" Davis.

156
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,612
The only scoring he did was
the triple letter bonus

157
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,347
on their nightly Scrabble game.

158
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,850
You want to go down like that?

159
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:48,085
You're running out of time.

160
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:51,556
Hey.

161
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:53,224
You here to pick up Wilfred?

162
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:54,558
Actually, I was going to ask you

163
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,060
to keep him a little longer.

164
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,361
We're going out to dinner to celebrate.

165
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:59,330
I'm coming to L.A., bro!

166
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,931
I'm moving in with Jenna!

167
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,301
Looks like you better start brushing up

168
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:05,635
on your seven-letter Scrabble words.

169
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,670
Here's a few for you.

170
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:08,904
Sexless.

171
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:09,939
Flaccid.

172
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,073
Dry-dick.

173
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,942
Shall I go on?

174
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,777
All right. Here's what I'm thinking.

175
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,446
We wait until Drew is asleep,

176
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:25,816
and then we put his hand in warm water.

177
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:28,553
Then, just when he starts to pee himself,

178
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:30,756
we take a rock and crush his skull.

179
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:32,291
That's your plan?

180
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,293
Well, how would you kill him?

181
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:37,597
What's the one thing Jenna
hates most about Drew?

182
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,500
Vaginal tearing from his huge cock.

183
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,769
He's a sore loser.

184
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,905
Look, all I have to do
is beat him at something

185
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,841
and make sure Jenna's there
to see him lose his shit.

186
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,043
That is the stupidest, most ridiculous...

187
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,745
Actually, that's pretty good.

188
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,814
Except for one thing.

189
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:57,117
Drew's a born winner, and you're... you.

190
00:07:57,118 --> 00:08:01,288
That may be true, but there is
something I'm really good at.

191
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,192
Ah. Here we go.

192
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:10,798
What the hell is that?

193
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,233
My old chemistry set.

194
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:18,339
"Little Suzy Baker's Oven."

195
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,708
What are you going to do,
challenge Drew to a Bake-Off?

196
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,876
That was my sister's.

197
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,717
Behold...

198
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,186
the instrument of Drew's destruction.

199
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,257
My Ping-Pong paddle

200
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:39,860
from when I was All-State
Table Tennis champion.

201
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:42,796
So chemistry, baking and Ping-Pong.

202
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,798
I guess my only question is:

203
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,134
how were you not blow-jobbed to death

204
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,669
by the entire cheerleading squad?

205
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,141
The beagle has landed.

206
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:55,242
Wilfred!

207
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,177
I'm sorry, man.

208
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:59,913
I tried to get him in the house,
and he ran over here.

209
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,449
You crazy mutt. Going somewhere?

210
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,851
Oh, yeah. Some play downtown.

211
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,720
Jenna's almost ready.

212
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,854
You're a Ping-Pong guy, huh?

213
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,189
I dabble.

214
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,991
Yeah, I used to play.

215
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:12,359
Used to?

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,595
Yeah, I kind of promised Jenna

217
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,030
I'd lay off competitive sports for a while.

218
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:20,400
Sometimes... I get a little too intense.

219
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,968
Oh. That's cool.

220
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:24,271
You don't seem like the
Ping-Pong type anyway.

221
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,340
What do you mean?

222
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,275
Well, you're a big guy.

223
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,210
Usually, Ping-Pong players are quicker.

224
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,579
I'm pretty quick, bro.

225
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,582
I guess I'll just have
to take your word for it.

226
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,520
You know what? What the hell?

227
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,222
One game won't kill me, huh?

228
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,057
Let's set it up.

229
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:45,259
Well done, Ryan.

230
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,627
Don't screw it up.

231
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,795
I got this.

232
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,266
Oh, I got lucky.

233
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,068
Yeah, you did.

234
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,502
Get him a body bag! Yeah!

235
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,003
Wilfy, quiet!

236
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:01,740
Ryan, serve.

237
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:03,342
There you are.

238
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:06,110
Right on cue. Drew, what are you doing?

239
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,546
The show doesn't start till 3:00,
babe. We'll be quick.

240
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:10,414
But we had a deal. Oh, come on.

241
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,449
It's just a friendly
little game, right, Ryan?

242
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,018
Totally, bro.

243
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:18,856
Oh, yeah! Get some!

244
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:20,825
I probably should have warned you--

245
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:25,097
back at the break room at
Sheboygan Lager, I was 192-0.

246
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:31,971
Oh, yeah! 43-43.

247
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:33,473
- Tied again.
- Bloody hell!

248
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:35,875
Come on, Drew. We're
already a half hour late.

249
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:37,877
Okay, can't we just say
that next point wins?

250
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,712
Hey, those aren't the rules, Jenna.

251
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:41,280
Uh, I think that's a good idea.

252
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,015
Fine. Whatever.

253
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:45,317
Your table, your rules. Next point wins.

254
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:46,785
I thought you said you were good.

255
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,053
I've seen more aggressive ball play

256
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,421
in an airport men's room.

257
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:52,023
Geyour head in the game!

258
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:00,064
No!

259
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:02,333
Yeah!

260
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:04,469
Sheboygan Lager, bitch!

261
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,138
That's how we do!

262
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:09,141
That's... how... we... do!

263
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:12,144
Yeah! Yeah!

264
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,217
Whoo!

265
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,755
All right, babe, let's go see that play.

266
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:27,124
What?! I'm not going to the play with you!

267
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,326
I'm not going anywhere with you, ever again!

268
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:32,829
Wait, Jenna!

269
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:42,371
That... was... awesome!

270
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:44,840
I've never seen Jenna so upset.

271
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,643
You don't think that pains me, too?

272
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:50,713
But that's the price we
pay for true love, Ryan.

273
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:52,915
Now if you'll excuse me,

274
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,751
I'm gonna go tear a new asshole
in the back of Bear's neck.

275
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,423
Hi, Ryan.

276
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:05,692
Do you wanna come in?

277
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:07,860
No, thanks.

278
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,129
I'm actually just waiting
for a cab to the airport.

279
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,399
Jenna broke up with me.

280
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,601
Really?

281
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,002
I'm so sorry.

282
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,704
Yeah, uh,

283
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,709
I just wanted to come over and apologize.

284
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,311
I'm embarrassed.

285
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:29,883
Well, we both got a little heated there.

286
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:32,386
It's like, I know what I'm doing is wrong,

287
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:35,022
and I just can't help myself.

288
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:38,492
Like with that Milwaukee's Brew guy...

289
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:43,164
I didn't actually buy him a Sheboygan Lager.

290
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:46,200
I bought myself a Sheboygan Lager.

291
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:49,336
Then I spit it in his face and
told him to lick my balls.

292
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:54,008
What's wrong with me?

293
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,242
Something.

294
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:58,645
Yeah.

295
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:01,648
And now it cost me the most
important thing in my life.

296
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:05,819
I just wish I was more like you.

297
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,188
You seem so...

298
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,824
in control.

299
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,596
Anyway, take care, man.

300
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:16,797
You, too.

301
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:30,009
That... was... hilarious!

302
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,545
Did you see how destroyed he was?

303
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:36,082
Uh, yeah. I feel bad.

304
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,351
That's just your conscience
being a total gaylord.

305
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:39,552
He's gone, Ryan!

306
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,387
The tyrant is exiled!

307
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,290
He was on the wagon and we
threw him under the bus.

308
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,559
We need to fix this.

309
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,761
The only things that need fixing are

310
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,362
your tangled transportation metaphors.

311
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,097
We got exactly what we wanted!

312
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,199
No, you got what you wanted.

313
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,135
You always do this--

314
00:13:56,136 --> 00:14:00,172
you manipulate me and you
don't listen and you push

315
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,041
and push and push

316
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,711
until I finally give in and
do something I know is wrong.

317
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,313
I don't like your tone, Ryan.

318
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:07,380
Why?

319
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,982
Does it remind you of someone?

320
00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:10,918
You know, you may not have liked Drew,

321
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,553
but at least you respected him.

322
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:15,189
Blah, blah, blah. Shut up and
go make yourself a sandwich.

323
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,891
I'm hungry. And this time,
don't put so much--

324
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,128
Did you just...?

325
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,163
You can't just...

326
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,505
All right, Ryan.

327
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:33,340
Point taken.

328
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,710
I guess you're in charge now.

329
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:40,247
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.

330
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:45,352
So, what, what would you have me do?

331
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:48,089
I want you to help me
undo the mess we've made.

332
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,159
That's gonna take some thought.

333
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,097
Um, is it all right with you
if I go and comfort Jenna

334
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:57,400
while I ruminate on that subject?

335
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:00,069
Yeah.

336
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,505
Sure.

337
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,107
May I be excused?

338
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:16,250
Hi, Jenna, it's Ryan.

339
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:20,756
Look, I'd really like to talk
about what happened with Drew.

340
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:22,758
Give me a call back when you get a chance.

341
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:43,610
Hello?

342
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,111
Hello, Ryan.

343
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,314
Wilfred, what's going on?

344
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,916
Just calling to see if you'd
followed your conscience yet.

345
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,019
Any luck getting Drew
and Jenna back together?

346
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,254
I'm working on it.

347
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:54,222
Oh, good!

348
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:57,225
I'm very happy for you.

349
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,227
Too bad you won't be around to see it.

350
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:00,629
What are you talking about?

351
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,631
Did you enjoy your brownie, Ryan?

352
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:04,933
What? How did you know it--

353
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,802
I made it just for you.

354
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:08,838
I hope you like my secret ingredient.

355
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:09,939
What did you put in it?

356
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,307
Oh, nothing really.

357
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:13,576
Just a powerful neurotoxin

358
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:16,246
that is coursing through
your bloodstream as we speak.

359
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:18,215
What?

360
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:20,117
Did you really think I'd
give up my alpha status

361
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:21,519
without a fight?

362
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,455
I wonder what your outlook is, Ryan.

363
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:27,592
"All signs point to...

364
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,660
dead!"

365
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:35,733
Where are you?

366
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,301
I'll never tell!

367
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:40,271
And if you think you'll find me,

368
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:42,507
then you've vastly underestimated the depth

369
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:44,876
of my brilliantly... Oh, hey, Ryan.

370
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:46,244
What's all this about poison?

371
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:47,545
I didn't manipulate you

372
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:48,847
into getting rid of Drew

373
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:51,316
just to let your conscience screw it up.

374
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:54,086
<i>I had to poison you.</i>

375
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,554
I don't believe you.

376
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:57,489
I don't believe you'd do that to me.

377
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,459
That's just the neurotoxin

378
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,194
eating away at the part

379
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,395
of your brain that allows
you to believe things.

380
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:04,896
Are you feeling weak?

381
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,664
Is your heart racing?

382
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:10,368
Is your mouth getting dry?

383
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:16,007
You think you're more powerful
than me, don't you, Ryan?

384
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:20,579
Well, I have news for you!

385
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,481
Give me that! Never!

386
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:25,317
But I will let you have it!

387
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:45,837
Are you all right?

388
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:49,340
You... saved me.

389
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:52,877
Why did you save me?

390
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:54,713
It was the right thing to do.

391
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,849
After everything I did to you?

392
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,920
I will never understand humans.

393
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,723
But this is the reason why we
will ultimately defeat you.

394
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:06,091
Wilfred, focus.

395
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,560
What did you poison me with?

396
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,729
Theobromine.

397
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,231
Oh, my God!

398
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:12,732
You've heard of it?

399
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,267
No, but it sounds terrible.

400
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:15,836
I still can't believe you poisoned me.

401
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:17,270
I still can't believe

402
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:19,173
you bopped me on the nose with a newspaper.

403
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,708
Bopped, Ryan!

404
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,244
I never wanted to dominate you.

405
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,046
I just didn't wanna be dominated by you.

406
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:26,681
Oh.

407
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,984
If I make it through this,

408
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,353
I'm gonna start listening to my gut more,

409
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:34,988
and you're just gonna have to accept that.

410
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,422
Understood, mate.

411
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:37,990
Hell, maybe you're onto something

412
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,925
with all this conscience stuff.

413
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,061
I'm even starting to
think I should stop doing

414
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:43,729
that god-awful thing to your mouth guard.

415
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,230
What thing? What did you do? Shhh.

416
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:48,233
Conserve your energy, mate.

417
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:50,802
WOMAN Dr. Kakel, call the operator.

418
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:52,638
Well, it looks like you're okay, Mr. Newman.

419
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,340
Your blood tests showed zero toxicity.

420
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,343
But I ingested a large
quantity of theobromine.

421
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,846
So did I, at lunch,
when I had a Hershey bar.

422
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,547
Theobromine's just a
chemical found in chocolate.

423
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:03,115
So, it's not poisonous?

424
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:05,584
Only if you're a dog.

425
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:07,286
Chocolate?

426
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,388
Ask him about the raisins.

427
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:10,589
I put raisins in there, too.

428
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:16,576
Well, it's official,

429
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:17,910
Jenna forgave Drew.

430
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:19,913
They're back together.

431
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:22,715
I'm sorry to hear that, Ryan.

432
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:25,285
I'm sorry for both of us.

433
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:26,653
If it's any consolation,

434
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:28,789
I promise not to try to kill you again.

435
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,894
I appreciate that.

436
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:36,498
I wouldn't drink that if I was you.

437
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:39,301
I'll get you a fresh beer.

438
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,006
I'll just pour this one out.

439
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:48,144
Ah! Ah!

440
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,748
Ah...!

441
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,717
Ah!

442
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,102
What's wrong, mate?

443
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:15,338
I'm still thinking about Jenna.

444
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,280
I know what'll cheer you up.

445
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,782
Bear, come here.

446
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:27,083
I want you to meet my friend Ryan.

447
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:32,754
