00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:15,574
God, it's so nice to hav
an afternoon off.

3
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:17,810
I'm glad you're able to
come out to lunch with me.

4
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:21,247
Well, Mondays are
usually pretty light.

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,716
Um, it's Thursday.

6
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:27,386
Right. I'm just saying that
Mondays work, too,

7
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:28,754
lunch-wise.

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,424
Jenna?

9
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:32,825
Oh, my God, Nick! Hey!

10
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,326
I thought it was you.

11
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:36,461
Uh, this is my
neighbor Ryan.
Hey.

12
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:39,096
I profiled Nick for the Local
Hero of the Week segment

13
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:40,930
on the 5:00 news.

14
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:44,099
He spent a whole year in Africa
building houses for the poor.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,733
Solar powered, of course.

16
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,268
They each have
the carbon footprint

17
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,503
of a tiny African baby.

18
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,671
Oh, and I made them shoes.

19
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:54,207
Nick is an amazing person.

20
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,845
Hey, it's all about the kids...
who have shoes now.

21
00:00:57,846 --> 00:01:00,781
Wow, you're like the great white
Oprah, aren't you?

22
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:03,151
Actually, I think of myself
as post-racial.

23
00:01:04,553 --> 00:01:06,154
What do you do, Ryan?

24
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:10,959
Oh, um, well, it's
Thursday, so, uh...

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,629
Oh, Ryan used to be
a very powerful lawyer,

26
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,364
but now he's taking
some time off.

27
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:17,132
Ah... to do what?

28
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,901
Uh, you know...

29
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:24,637
Well, that sounds...

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,373
Come on, mate,
give us a bit

31
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:29,774
of that gouda
I'm smelling.

32
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:31,643
Wilfred, no,
you can't have cheese.

33
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:33,177
What am I supposed to eat?

34
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:35,113
The grass down here tastes
like shit

35
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:36,547
and the shit tastes like grass!

36
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:40,951
Wilfred? Wilfred!

37
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,453
Wilfred, come back!

38
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:45,823
I'll go.
You two catch up.

39
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:47,425
(urine splashing)

40
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,627
You know cheese
isn't good for you.

41
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:51,963
I'm sick of you telling me
what I can and can't do.

42
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:55,033
It's like those baby killers
say, "My body, my choice."

43
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:57,035
I'm sorry, but apparently,
looking after you is

44
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:58,737
my sole reason for getting
out of bed.

45
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,506
What am I doing with my life?

46
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,807
Nothing.

47
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:04,708
Don't undersell
yourself.

48
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,344
<i>How many people can watch
a whole season of The Wire</i>

49
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:09,446
in one sitting?
Not many, I'd wager.

50
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,914
That shit is dense.

51
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:13,082
The way Jenna jumped in
to cover for me...

52
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,350
like I'm some kind of loser.

53
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,118
Is that what people think of me?

54
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,387
What are you,
a golden retriever?

55
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,522
What do you care
what other people think?

56
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:20,690
Uh, excuse me.

57
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,025
Would you sign
a petition

58
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,460
to support the
South Venice Hospice?

59
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,629
Yeah, sure.
Great.
Just sign

60
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,531
right here, but don't worry
about the address part.

61
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:28,865
You can just leave that blank.

62
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,201
Why would I do that?

63
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:33,970
Well, you could
list a shelter or something.

64
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,339
Shelter? You think
I'm homeless?

65
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,108
Do I look homeless?

66
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:41,779
Well, you were talking
to a dog.

67
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,650
Here we are.

68
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:49,119
Whoa, you said
we were going
for a walk.

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,223
A walk, Ryan, which by
definition means no destination.

70
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,058
Even a cat knows that.

71
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:56,828
I thought it would be a good
idea for us to get off the couch

72
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,730
and do some volunteer work.

73
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:00,365
You mean like community service?

74
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:02,000
That's for drunk drivers
and wife beaters,

75
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,169
not decent folk like us.
Now come on.

76
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,071
Let's go over to that playground
and blaze a fatty.

77
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:08,973
Come on. It'll feel good
to do something worthwhile.

78
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,441
Besides, these people have

79
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:12,176
a lifetime of wisdom
to share with us.

80
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:15,178
Like what, how to keep from
sitting on your balls?

81
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,613
Wilfred, we're doing this.

82
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,315
You can't make me
do whatever you want.

83
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,583
You're not my husband!

84
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:23,119
Oh, my God! The stench!

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,454
Wilfred, you can't
pee here.

86
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,656
Why not?
Everyone else is.

87
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:30,158
Hi. We're here to volunteer.

88
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,293
Oh, fantastic.

89
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:34,329
Stay right there. I'm gonna
start planning your parade.

90
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,964
Just a cake will be fine.

91
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,900
Anyway, uh, this is Wilfred,
and I'm...

92
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:41,202
You know what? Let's not bother
with the names, you know?

93
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:43,772
If you make it through the
day, we'll revisit this.

94
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:44,873
Kill me, please!

95
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,109
What?
I wanna die!

96
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,112
Why won't they let me die?!

97
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:51,714
Oh, you don't mean that.

98
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,282
You've got a lot
of living to do.

99
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:54,984
There are mountains
to be climbed.

100
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's gonna change his diaper

101
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:59,255
on those mountains, huh?
These people are ready to die.

102
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:01,424
Hope is the last thing
they need.

103
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:04,326
A coffin is the last thing
they need. Up top.
I just thought...

104
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,596
Uh-uh, our only job is to offer
them peace and comfort.

105
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,966
for their final days,
not cheery little pep talks.

106
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,401
Think you can handle that?

107
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:14,302
Uh-huh.
Okay. All right, Mr. Gordon.

108
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,004
You can't do that.

109
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,574
Can't eat cheese,
can't jack morphine.

110
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,276
<i>Is there anything
I can do, Ryan?</i>

111
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:22,945
(Haitian accent):
That dog can't be in here!

112
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,815
Oh, it's okay.
He's a service dog.

113
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:28,117
There's something about that dog
I don't like.

114
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:31,220
Something about him
rattles me bones.

115
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,521
I ain't rattling
your bones.

116
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,089
Not without
a few drinks in me.

117
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,691
Have a nice day.

118
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,293
I don't get it, Ryan.

119
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,096
No one in America
wants to be a nurse?

120
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:42,265
Admit it, Ryan,
you're not getting

121
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,702
any satisfaction
out of this.

122
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:47,271
You're only here so Jenna
and everyone will think
you're a do-gooder.

123
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:51,042
Yeah, okay, I want
to be admired.

124
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:54,279
I want people to think
I'm a good person

125
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,747
like that douchebag
in the park.

126
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,349
What's wrong with that?

127
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,652
The only opinion
that matters is yours.

128
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:06,124
Come on. Let's get stoned
and then go home and get stoned.

129
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,659
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither are you.

130
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,362
Fine. You want to heal the sick
like Florence Henderson,

131
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:13,931
be my guest.

132
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,833
That's Florence Nightingale.

133
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:19,003
No, I'm talking about the
episode where Jan got the mumps.

134
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:21,372
Or was that Bobby?
And why did they need Alice?

135
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,508
Sure, they had six kids,

136
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,676
but Carol didn't
even work.

137
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:28,946
I guess what I'm trying to
say is I'm very, very high.

138
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:30,448
I'm gonna take a nap.

139
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:37,188
Mr. Helms, I took that pile
of photos on your dresser

140
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,990
and I put them in
this scrapbook

141
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:43,128
so you could look
at your loved ones.

142
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,864
If there's anything else
I can do for you...

143
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,399
Wait.
Yes?

144
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,667
Do that thing you did
for me in Paris.

145
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:51,770
I'm not sure I...

146
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:54,372
Come on, Betty.
The war's over.

147
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:57,509
Take these trousers off
and toss my salad.

148
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,077
What?

149
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,479
Do it, you little whore!

150
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,416
Get your tongue in there
and play with yourself.

151
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,719
That's it.
I'm done.

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,454
Hey, volunteer guy,
scrub that out.

153
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,790
Actually, I was just
about to get my dog and...

154
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,993
(alarm blaring)

155
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:15,294
(monitor flatlines)

156
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,696
Oh, my God, your dog.

157
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:21,165
Officer, I swear,
she told me she was three.

158
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,033
I'm sorry.
I'll get him out...

159
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,402
No, no, no, he sensed that
Mr. Gordon was leaving us

160
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:27,404
and he didn't want him
to die alone.

161
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,606
Your dog did
a beautiful thing.

162
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,976
He did?

163
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:36,045
Well, compassion was
the first trick I taught him.

164
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:38,748
Hi, I'm Ryan.

165
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:42,218
Everybody, this is Ryan

166
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,688
and his dog Wilfred.

167
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:54,637
I knew Wilfred was special,
but this is amazing.

168
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,906
Well, I'm not sure he
actually did anything.

169
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:58,641
No, I've heard about
this kind of thing.

170
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:01,244
There was this cat in Ohio
that predicted 22 deaths.

171
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:02,912
They say that it's
a chemical thing,

172
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:05,281
something that
they can smell.
Hmm.

173
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:06,649
I just thought he went in
there to pass out...

174
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,519
...sleep.

175
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,021
So, Wilfred has a gift.
How about that.

176
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:14,557
JENNA:
I am so proud of him.

177
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:17,227
I'm proud of you both.

178
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,296
Come here, Wilfred.
Come here.

179
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:22,933
I'm gonna make you
a special dinner.
(playful growling)

180
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,734
Hey, if you're not
doing anything, do
you want to join us?

181
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,069
I'm just going
to toss a salad.

182
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,804
Sounds great.

183
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:30,507
Okay. (playful growling)

184
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,576
Think you might be
disappointed, mate.

185
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,944
Sometimes the term
"tossed salad"

186
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:36,112
means a bowl of lettuce.

187
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:40,216
Drop it.

188
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:41,984
Wilfred, come on.
I don't want you to be sick

189
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:43,986
when we go back to
the hospice tomorrow.

190
00:07:43,987 --> 00:07:45,888
Hmm, yeah, I don't
think I'm going back.

191
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,056
What? Why?

192
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:48,791
I know you're getting off

193
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,926
on being a big hero,
but let's look at the reality.

194
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:53,763
I'm a dog with a wondrous
spiritual gift.

195
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,999
And you're a man who made
a 30-foot paperclip
chain last week.

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,368
Wilfred--
Who has the power now, Ryan?

197
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,136
Cause it's feeling like...

198
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:04,708
(clicking tongue)

199
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,544
me.

200
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,112
If I'm gonna do this,
it's gonna cost you.

201
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,349
Okay, what do you want?

202
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,152
What I want is--
whatever I want.

203
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:15,686
But that stuff makes you--
(farting)

204
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:17,054
Sorry, didn't catch
that. Makes me what?

205
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:18,089
It makes you--
(farting)

206
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,490
Come again?

207
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,191
I'm not playing this--
(farting)

208
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:23,060
Are you--
(farts)

209
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:25,262
I--
(long fart)

210
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:26,496
Oh, God! Oh!

211
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:28,131
Don't deny yourself, Ryan.

212
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,399
Enjoy it.

213
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,734
Enjoy me.

214
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,038
Look at that.

215
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,307
It's like Wilfred is an
angel of mercy to them.

216
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,210
I'm glad you came back.

217
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:42,379
It's nice to see someone
who really cares.

218
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,215
There's a lot of jerks who
volunteer just to make
themselves look good.

219
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,884
You're kidding.
Do people actually do that?

220
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:49,553
Oh, yeah.

221
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,356
That dog need to go back
where he come from--

222
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:55,258
the gates of Hell.

223
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,294
Maybe you should go back
to where you came from--

224
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:59,629
right over there
where you were standing--

225
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,997
before you came over here.

226
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,499
(sighs)

227
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,401
Don't mind Ruby.

228
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:07,837
She's been a total bitch since
the earthquake took her family.

229
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,107
Oh, look!

230
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:13,244
It's like Wilfred can
sense that Mrs. Miller's

231
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:14,979
ready to leave us.

232
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,382
I'm going to go
call her family.

233
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,418
Yeah, you can run,
but you can't hide.

234
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,787
But you can't really run either,
can you?

235
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:24,856
Checkmate.

236
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,092
I'm reading you
a book, Mr. Helms.

237
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,795
Did I ever tell you about
the time I choked a Jap?

238
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:33,599
1942. I was at
my first Brandeis mixer.

239
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,667
I think it's time
for your nap.

240
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,040
What's going on?

241
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,241
(monitor beeping)
(sighs)

242
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:42,509
Mrs. Miller hasn't
passed yet.

243
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,244
Maybe Wilfred's wrong.

244
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:45,645
Was yesterday just a fluke?

245
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,282
No, no, Wilfred's
done this a lot.

246
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:51,317
He predicted 22 deaths
at a hospital in Ohio.

247
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:53,587
I thought that was a cat.

248
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:56,023
Lame-stream media.

249
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,692
Piss off!
I'm working!

250
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,727
Maybe he could use
a little walk.

251
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,963
What's the problem, Wilfred?

252
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,598
You said you could do this.

253
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,633
Save it, Ryan.
I'm under enough pressure.

254
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,868
Where'd you get
that key card?

255
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,569
That there be none
of your business.

256
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,272
(humming tune)
Whoa, you can't do this.

257
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:18,375
I can do
whatever I want.

258
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,611
That's the deal, right?

259
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:22,079
I'm not kidding
around here, Wilfred.

260
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,247
This is serious stuff.

261
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,715
Some of it is.

262
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:28,419
Some of it's just
over-the-counter crap.

263
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,922
This is not going to happen.
All right, then,

264
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,491
well, I guess
we're through here.

265
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:36,127
I'll go back to being a dog,
and you can go back

266
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:39,031
to your celebrated status
as a land baron in Farmville.

267
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,936
Bottoms up.

268
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:52,075
Oh, that's right,
you're driving.

269
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,845
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

270
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:59,882
I have to go shepherd
Mrs. Miller's soul to Heaven.

271
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,617
Or Hell.

272
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:02,985
I leave those details
to others.

273
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,059
I promise you,
she was so close to...

274
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,594
She was right on
the brink of death.

275
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,231
Oh...

276
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,432
(monitor beeping)

277
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:18,102
Tell the truth, Wilfred.

278
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:19,870
This is all just a scam,
isn't it?

279
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:21,739
These things take time.

280
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,208
Trust me, she's on her way out.

281
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,710
Just get me some dinner.
I want pizza.

282
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,046
Huh! The last thing
I'm giving you is more cheese.

283
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:31,749
Pizza is what I want.
We had a deal.

284
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,217
Well, that's when
I was stupid enough

285
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,152
to think you were for real.
The deal's off.

286
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,921
Now let's get out
of here

287
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:40,091
before we completely
humiliate ourselves.

288
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:42,560
I hate to think that
any minute now...

289
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:45,196
(alarm wailing)

290
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,635
(monitor flatlines)

291
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:53,504
So, about that pizza...

292
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,439
Did you...?

293
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,043
Oh, my God, Wilfred
did it again.

294
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:01,512
And I want the kind
with cheese in the crust.

295
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,148
(steady tone continues)

296
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:09,781
You lied to me!

297
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:11,182
You told me
you had a gift.

298
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,217
And you told me
we were getting pizza.

299
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:15,086
What's the bigger
lie here, mate?
I ask you that.

300
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:16,554
I can't believe
I let this happen.

301
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:17,888
You killed that woman!

302
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,724
Now that's just crazy talk.

303
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:22,526
You're really overreacting here.

304
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:23,928
I saw you with the pillow.

305
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:24,996
I was fluffing it!

306
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:26,197
Over her face.

307
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm just doing God's work, mate.

308
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:31,436
And a lot more efficiently,
I must say.

309
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,937
Well, it stops now.
(knocking)

310
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:36,540
Hey! I've been waiting
for you to get home.

311
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,109
I told my producer
about your work at the hospice,

312
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,245
and he agreed that you
and Wilfred would be perfect

313
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,380
for our next Hero
of the Week segment.

314
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,583
Oh, I'm no hero.

315
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:47,619
Of course you are.
Look, it'll be great.

316
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,320
Me and my cameraman will follow
you around the hospice

317
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:51,689
so we can show the whole world
what you've done.

318
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,625
I don't think that's such
a great idea.
Don't be so modest.

319
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,828
Yeah, it's not like you were
doing this to impress anybody.

320
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,797
Besides, I'm kind of
already committed

321
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:59,332
for tomorrow
night's broadcast.
Look, Jen...

322
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,234
Ryan, you're doing this.
I can't call my producer

323
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,203
and tell him that I couldn't
book my own dog.

324
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:05,506
You hear that, Ryan?
Hey, we're on.

325
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,742
I'm gonna be
a TV star.

326
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,645
I better start working
on my catchphrase.

327
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:15,616
So I'd like to get some B-roll
of you with one of the patients.

328
00:13:15,617 --> 00:13:16,784
Uh, maybe him?

329
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:22,155
Yeah. Or anyone else?

330
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:24,524
Hi, I'm Lisa. I'm the
staff coordinator.
Jenna.

331
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,526
I am so happy that
you're doing a story

332
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,494
on Ryan and his
amazing work.

333
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:30,763
You are an
inspiration.
I'm really not.

334
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:32,398
Stop it! Okay, can you believe

335
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,067
that I had to talk him
into this?

336
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:35,969
Some people would kill
for this kind of attention.

337
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,204
I know, right?
So humble.

338
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:38,572
Excuse me.

339
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,040
He's so sweet.
I know.

340
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:44,011
We can't go through
with this.

341
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,713
Relax, Ryan.

342
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:48,083
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

343
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,852
To be a well-regarded douchebag?

344
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,221
No. I mean,
I-I thought...

345
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:55,757
Sorry, Ryan, but I have
the power now.

346
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:59,093
I can't be bothered
by what you want anymore.

347
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,329
Now it's about
what the people want.

348
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,531
And they want sweet release.

349
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,700
I'm their savior, mate.

350
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:11,070
So the question isn't
"What does Ryan want?"

351
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:12,938
It's "What would Wilfred do?"

352
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,039
That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

353
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,708
(snorting)

354
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:22,414
(sighs)

355
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:24,783
(inhales)

356
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,818
It's show time.

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,074

MAN 1: Hey, everybody,
Wilfred's back!

359
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:41,165
Pick me!
I just want to die!

360
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:45,670
WOMAN: No, no! I'm more
tumor than person! Pick me!

361
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,338
MR. HELMS:
I'll suck your dick!

362
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,107
That's a good pitch,
but I want to hear others.

363
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:52,142
Ah... you.

364
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:55,312
Skeletor. Why do you
deserve to die?

365
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:59,684
You think you smart, but I
figure out what you are doing!

366
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:01,253
Your dog be distracting
everybody

367
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,455
so you can steal our medicines!

368
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:06,058
Zip it, Ruby.
I checked the records.

369
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,063
Your key card is the only one
accessing the drug closet.

370
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,764
So if anything's missing,
it's on you!

371
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,633
You'll be sorry.

372
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:17,937
Soon, everybody be sorry!

373
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,572
(panting)

374
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:22,141
Don't worry, I'll deal
with the nurse.

375
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:24,677
I'll make her see the light.
What are you gonna...?

376
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:28,014
Hey, are you ready
for your close-up?

377
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:32,352
Okay. All right, Ryan,
we're almost ready. You nervous?

378
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:36,189
I'm just trying to figure out
how the hell I got here.

379
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,724
Look, just be yourself.

380
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:39,660
You know, the one thing that
being in front

381
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,128
of the camera
has taught me is that

382
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:42,363
some people are gonna
like you,

383
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,764
and some people
are gonna hate you.

384
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,499
But if you worry
about what other people think,

385
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,301
you'll just drive
yourself crazy.

386
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,103
You'll be great.

387
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:51,072
So I'm just gonna start
by asking you a few questions.

388
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:52,240
(loud thud)

389
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:54,742
Oh, my God!

390
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:56,811
It's Ruby.

391
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,615
RYAN:
Wilfred!

392
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:05,853
Oh, my God,
you did it!

393
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:08,189
You really did it!

394
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,525
Whatever I did, I did
for the both of us.

395
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:14,161
No! I never wanted this!

396
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,030
Tell me something,
Ryan.

397
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,165
When those pathetic bags
of bones

398
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,268
down there fall to their knees

399
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,505
and pray for death, who do you
think they're praying to?

400
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:26,574
Me! That's who.

401
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,442
You've lost your mind.

402
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,744
It's like you've got
some kind of God complex!

403
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:32,847
I'll let you in on
a little secret, Ryan.

404
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:35,282
I haven't got a God complex.

405
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:40,121
<i>I am God! Thunder!</i>

406
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:41,789
How did you do that?!

407
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,158
Lucky coincidence!

408
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,226
You've got it wrong, Wilfred...

409
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:48,829
and so did I!

410
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,931
I don't care
what other people think!

411
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:54,234
The only thing that matters
is how I feel about myself!

412
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:57,938
Well, it's a little late
for that.

413
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,807
I won't let you get away
with this.

414
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,543
Stay out of my way...

415
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:07,414
or the next bed I curl up in
might be yours.

416
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:09,716
No!

417
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:11,752
I have something to say!

418
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:13,720
You're making
a big mistake, Ryan.

419
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:16,757
I don't care. I can't let this
go on any longer.

420
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:18,493
Hey, look, Ruby left
a suicide note.

421
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:19,661
She did?

422
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:25,435
Are you sure it's in
human handwriting?

423
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:26,936
I swear
that's not a racial thing.

424
00:17:26,937 --> 00:17:29,373
Look, Ryan, I hate
to do this,

425
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:32,743
but I think there's
a bigger story here
than you and Wilfred.

426
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:34,211
No, no, no, there's
no story here.

427
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,446
We don't need this
kind of publicity.

428
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,615
I'm sorry, but you've got
a rogue nurse who

429
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,751
apparently stole
huge amounts of drugs
and then killed herself

430
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:43,121
out of guilt.
This is a pretty
juicy exclusive.

431
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:45,890
This hospice is struggling
as it is.

432
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,859
This could shut us down.

433
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,894
I know, and I feel
really, really badly.

434
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,635
We're going live.

435
00:17:56,358 --> 00:18:01,427
You know, you had me
worried back there
at the hospice.

436
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:05,331
You-you didn't actually
kill anyone, did you?

437
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,567
No! Ryan!

438
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:14,406
Except for the old lady.
I definitely killed her.

439
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:15,774
Gotcha.

440
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,176
(sighs)

441
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:19,879
But seriously,
I did.

442
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,049
Ah-ha! I'm kidding!

443
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,351
Wait. You're kidding
that you did,

444
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:27,586
or you're kidding
that you didn't?

445
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:33,125
Okay, Ryan, I... I really don't
want you to get mad here,

446
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:36,361
but I'm guilty...

447
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,863
of being charming.

448
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,100
And killing
an old lady.

449
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,469
With kindness!

450
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,771
And a pillow.

451
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,973
Just kidding!

452
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,978
Or am I?

453
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,054
Nice kid.

454
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:04,890
That is so typical
of Western thinking:

455
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:06,659
If you can't see it
for yourself,

456
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,160
it doesn't exist.

457
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:10,129
I've actually got
many, many magical powers

458
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,897
that would blow your mind.

459
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:14,099
Like what?

460
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,736
Off the top of my head,
I can make you disappear.

461
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:20,005
(scoffs) Prove it.

462
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,840
Make me disappear.

463
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,008
Okay.

464
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,846
Look deeply
into my eyes.

465
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:31,216
Now you... you've really got
to concentrate here, okay?

466
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:35,453
So, we're breathing
deeply in through the nose

467
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:38,956
and out through
the mouth.

468
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,925
Focus.

469
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:47,700
Now one big one.

470
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:53,873
Oh! Oh, God!

471
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,510
And just like that, he's gone.

472
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,500
