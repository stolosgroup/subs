00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,446
What?!

6
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:29,921
I mean, I used to be invisible to him, but

7
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:32,051
now he keeps looking at me,

8
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:34,649
like he knew we stole
these plants from him.

9
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,028
I'm just being paranoid, right?

10
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:39,663
Well, these buds are called
Purple Thunder Paranoia,

11
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,498
but no, you're not being paranoid.

12
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,100
No, of course I am.

13
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,836
Like right now, it looks
like he's coming over here.

14
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:50,039
He looks pissed. Why would he
be coming over here pissed?

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,443
I don't know, Ryan. Maybe
because you smashed his window,

16
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:54,345
stole his weed and shat in his boot?

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,846
You smashed his window.

18
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,950
You, me. What's the difference?

19
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:02,543
What is the difference?

20
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:17,537
Wilfred, I think there's
something in that weed.

21
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:20,207
I don't think so, mate,

22
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,210
but there's only one way to find out.

23
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:37,791
Yeah, that doesn't happen till later.

24
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,733
Later? What are you...?

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,293
Wilfred what's going on?

26
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:45,500
Am I dreaming?
I want to wake up now.

27
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,702
Ryan, there's something I need to tell you.

28
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:49,204
I don't think you'll remember this,

29
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:50,539
but perhaps that's for the best.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,175
None of this is real.

31
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,010
There's no way he could know it was me.

32
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,712
That's the thing I need to tell you, mate.

33
00:01:55,713 --> 00:01:58,448
He knows.

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,366
Up for a stroll, mate?

35
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,906
Oh. It's for you.

36
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,144
Open it.

37
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:25,346
You don't have to say,
"Open it," okay, Ryan?

38
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,547
I know to open it.

39
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:31,719
It's a Kobe beef femur
from a high-end butcher.

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,454
It's the best money can buy.

41
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:36,724
Feel that weight.

42
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,793
Oh, I thought you'd be excited.

43
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:40,394
You want me to be excited, Ryan?

44
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:41,862
Buy me a new bong.

45
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,597
Or better yet, a vaporizer.

46
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,934
But a bone? It's like giving
a basketball to a black guy.

47
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:49,169
It was meant to be a
token of our friendship.

48
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,005
Oh, speaking of tokin',

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,799
let's spark up some of that
weed we nicked from Spencer.

50
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,642
Maybe we can vaporize it in my new bone.

51
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:58,646
Hmm. No.

52
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:00,415
Won't quite work, will it?

53
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,716
What's going on here?

54
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,785
What kind of racist monster

55
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:06,254
would spray-paint the symbol
of another person's culture?

56
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:08,490
It's a hate crime!

57
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:12,059
Hey white boy, is that your dog?

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,961
No, I'm just watching him for a friend.

59
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:16,263
My wife is extremely fearful of dogs.

60
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:17,935
Lakshmi was bitten in the old neighborhood.

61
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,206
We had to call Animal Control
and put the beast down.

62
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,269
So would you please?!

63
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,404
Wilfred,

64
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,106
come!

65
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,908
Please?

66
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,476
It's not like I was gonna bite her.

67
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,012
Last time I had Indian,
it gave me the shits for a week.

68
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:40,119
Come back to the scene of the crime,
didn't you? I know it was you!

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,622
I know it was you!

70
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,192
I had to call the cops on
that hoodlum a few weeks ago.

71
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,861
I'm certain this is his revenge.

72
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,965
That motorcycle dick is
ruining the neighborhood.

73
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,634
You need to put that asshole in his place.

74
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,736
What's the point of a confrontation?

75
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,338
I'd just get my ass kicked.

76
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,140
So what? That'd be less painful

77
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,742
than walking around in constant fear.

78
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:05,280
What would you suggest I do?

79
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:08,216
March over there,
look him straight in the eye,

80
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:10,818
and say, "I'm the man
who shat in your boot."

81
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:13,672
and then you *** and *** in the ass

82
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,491
You want me to have sex with him?

83
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:18,493
It's called domination.

84
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:21,396
That's how dogs handle it,
and believe me, it's very effective.

85
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:23,465
And have you done this with another dog?

86
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,821
Every goddamn day.

87
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:27,581
I can't imagine a scenario

88
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,771
in which I would do something like that.

89
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:33,341
Well then, you have no imagination.

90
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:35,710
If only that were true.

91
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,122
I mean, I used to be
invisible to him, but...

92
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:41,288
but now he keeps looking at me,

93
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,916
like-like he knew we stole
these plants from him.

94
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,721
I'm just being paranoid, right?

95
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:47,589
Well, these buds

96
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,658
are called Purple Thunder Paranoia,

97
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,326
but no, you're not being paranoid.

98
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,194
Of course I am.

99
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,742
Ryan, there's something I need to tell you.

100
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:12,547
- Is that...?
- It is.

101
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:15,383
Mate, the thing is, he knows.

102
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:17,718
- How is that possible?
- Because after

103
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,420
we broke into his house,

104
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:22,690
I think I may have left your
wallet under the window.

105
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:23,958
- What?!
- Actually,

106
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,827
wait. No, no.

107
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:28,496
I definitely did do that.

108
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:39,033
I know you're in there!

109
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:41,258
Why the hell would you leave
my wallet outside his window?

110
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,817
I don't know, Ryan. Why is the sky grey?

111
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,418
Why is the grass grey?

112
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,520
Why is a rainbow grey, grey,

113
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:50,289
grey, grey, grey and infra-grey?

114
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,893
Now open the door, pull down
his pants and tear that ass up.

115
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,998
Hey, Ryan, lose something?!

116
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,500
Uh. Oh, wow, I've been looking for this.

117
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,001
Yeah, because you dropped it

118
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:06,604
when you broke into my house,
you piece of shit.

119
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:08,789
Enough words, Ryan! I'll hold him down,
you get his pants off.

120
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:09,972
No! No, no, no, no, no.

121
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:10,986
I can explain.

122
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,646
Yeah, go ahead, but I'm
not a very good listener.

123
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:16,882
They, uh... they-they
broke into my house, too!

124
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:18,617
Come on, Ryan.

125
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:20,252
Only a complete tosser would believe...

126
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,354
Keep talking. Yeah.

127
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:22,789
They stole my wallet.

128
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,190
They-They must have dropped it

129
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,059
when they broke into your house.

130
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,561
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit.

131
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,063
No! N-No bullshit, and

132
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:32,900
that sick bastard actually
took a dump on my Blu-ray.

133
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,681
- He shit in my boots!
- Yeah.

134
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:38,688
Guess you think you're
pretty clever, eh, Ryan?

135
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:40,597
Yeah, well,

136
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:43,376
looks like we're both victims here.

137
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:46,211
I'm sorry, I-I didn't even get your name.

138
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:47,379
Oh, it's Spencer.

139
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,114
You know, it's funny.

140
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,515
I... I've seen you around the neighborhood,

141
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:52,350
and I... I always figured you were a dick,

142
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:55,688
but now I feel like I'm the dick.

143
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,324
I'm sorry I barged in on you.

144
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:01,128
Hey, it's fine. Anytime.

145
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,696
ah.

146
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,937
You make me sick.

147
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:11,239
Oh, you're mad at me? You set me up!

148
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,475
- You pussed out!
- I did not puss out.

149
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,076
Sometimes when I look at you,

150
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:16,578
I can almost see a giant tampon string

151
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,146
hanging out of you. Ryan, you can't

152
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,616
run away from your problems.

153
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,438
I'll take care of this my way,

154
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,219
the way that did not get my ass kicked.

155
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,087
He's gone, and he's not coming back.

156
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:27,524
Well, that's interesting,
because he's at the front door.

157
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,192
No, he's not.

158
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:37,033
Hey,

159
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:39,574
now that I think you're cool,
and you think I'm cool,

160
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,464
I was thinking we can hang out.

161
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:42,465
Oh. Hmm...

162
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:44,774
You like porn? God, listen to me.

163
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:46,542
What am I, some kind of idiot?

164
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:48,277
Who doesn't like porn?

165
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,696
Damm, this shit gets my rock hard.

166
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,617
You too, right?

167
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:58,186
Uh...

168
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,620
Yeah... I guess.

169
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,955
Having fun, Ryan?

170
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:03,991
Just another lazy Sunday watching porn

171
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,659
with your drunk, rock-hard neighbor.

172
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,327
It's all good.

173
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,296
I'm having a great time, too, buddy.

174
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:12,226
Hard to believe four hours ago,
we didn't even know each other.

175
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:15,467
Four hours? Yeah!

176
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:17,671
Hey, how... how long does
that battery last anyway?

177
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:20,041
Oh, shit! I should have brought my cord.

178
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,509
You're not a Mac guy, are you?

179
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,411
Oh, well, the thing is, I...

180
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,983
Nice save! Good doggy!

181
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:30,685
Yeah! Now we can porn out all night!

182
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,620
Uh, well, let me... let me just

183
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:35,990
feed Wilfred his lunch,
and then we can resume

184
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,059
porning out.

185
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,632
Okay, lunch-wise, I'm thinking

186
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,133
a thinly-sliced porterhouse on a...

187
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,935
I'm not making you lunch, Wilfred!

188
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:50,504
It's like you're torturing me for fun. Why?

189
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,574
I'm giving you a gift,

190
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,542
and it pains me to watch you squander it.

191
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:57,511
A gift?! What you're
giving me is a sociopathic,

192
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:59,115
porn-crazed pain in the ass.

193
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,314
Oh, I forgot.

194
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,684
You're the resident
authority on gift giving.

195
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:05,587
- That bone is a nice gift.
- It's a shit gift!

196
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,822
What I'm giving you is far more valuable.

197
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:09,457
A chance to be rid of that
knuckle-dragging asshole

198
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,059
once and for all.

199
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,495
I'm gonna get rid of him... my way.

200
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:18,400
Hey buddy, I think I'm a little porned out.

201
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:20,235
Oh, I get it.

202
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,237
Say no more. I, uh...

203
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,640
Sometimes I come on a little bit strong.

204
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:26,442
You know, at least,
that's what my caseworker says.

205
00:09:26,443 --> 00:09:28,110
So enough porn.

206
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:28,878
Yeah.

207
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:30,946
Let's hit the titty bar!

208
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:34,516
Oh, that... that... that sounds fun, um,

209
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,318
but I-I really should...

210
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,987
I should clean out the poop
from the Blu-ray player.

211
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,421
It's been a few days, so...

212
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,089
Oh. Oh, okay.

213
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,288
Okay, rain check, buddy. Okay.

214
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:47,194
Hey Ryan some of that
weed we stole off Spencer!

215
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,763
- What is up with your dog?
- Yeah, stolen weed right here.

216
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:51,566
- I'll bring it up.
- He is, like, freaking out.

217
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,201
- Shouldn't we see what's up?
- No. Hey.

218
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,236

when you have a transsexual
stripper for a dad.

00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:13,113
You can tell me anything, Ryan.

247
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:17,383
And I want you to be
completely honest with me.

248
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,317
My last buddy...

249
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:20,053
Jesse...

250
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,121
he was a liar and a thief.

251
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:26,826
And that's why I punched him
in the throat and rip off his ear!

252
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,694
Now, what'd you want to tell me?

253
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:32,665
I was just gonna say, um...

254
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,435
th-that stripper has weird breasts.

255
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,176
Oh nice! Where?

256
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:38,537
Her?

257
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:39,972
Her?

258
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:45,677
Mm.

259
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,812
That was weird.

260
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:52,831
Well, see you around.

261
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:56,321
Hey, I got half a bottle of schlag
and taco shells inside.

262
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,856
The night is young.

263
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:00,125
Schlag and taco shells it is!

264
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,493
W-Wilfred, come here!

265
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,996
Relax. I know how to get him back.

266
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,368
Look at that dumb dog.

267
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,504
Ryan!

268
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:13,367
Are you seeing this?

269
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,982
This... defys...

270
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:20,847
all... logic!

271
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:25,886
Why...

272
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,654
can't I...

273
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:29,489
catch... it?

274
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:32,979
Ryan... make it stop.

275
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:36,163
I'm begging you, do something!

276
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:37,865
Wilfred's been misbehaving all day.

277
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,733
He deserves this.

278
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,802
Okay, check this out.

279
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,808
Where are you, you gray bastard?

280
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,911
Show yourself!

281
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:53,380
Let's finish this!

282
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,049
What's going on? What's all the noise?

283
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,453
There you are.

284
00:12:58,454 --> 00:12:59,454
Wilfred, no!

285
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,295
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Don't worry,

286
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,563
we're gonna take him to a nice farm upstate.

287
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:07,798
Ooh, a farm.

288
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,967
With duckies and piggies and ponies.

289
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:12,369
I wonder if I can kill a pony.

290
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,839
There must be something I can do. Please.

291
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:19,209
All right, give me 50 bucks,

292
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,280
I'll leave him leashed up to the
Dumpster behind Animal Control.

293
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:23,915
Thank you. Thank you so much.

294
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,968
Hey, Ryan! I just found this Persian chick

295
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:30,078
on Craig's List who said she'll
let us throw a shoe at her.

296
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,191
What the hell is he doing here!

297
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:35,160
Spencer. Jesse.

298
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,696
- Wait. You're Jesse?
- Yeah, that's

299
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,932
the little bitch who stole my girlfriend

300
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:40,999
<i>and my toaster oven.</i>

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,068
You banged my mom!

302
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:45,937
One time! And I texted you
the minute I finished!

303
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:47,505
I didn't lie about it!

304
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,592
You're friends with this jerk?

305
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:50,174
Best friends.

306
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:51,575
Huh.

307
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:52,843
Well, in that case...

308
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,112
the deal's off!

309
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:58,049
Oh, and by the way, there is no farm.

310
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,385
He's getting the needle.

311
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,522
So long, Ryan.

312
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,758
Come visit me at the farm.

313
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,410
Bring bread for the ducks!

314
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:16,932
What the hell?
I told you the deal was off.

315
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,004
And why you bring him?

316
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:20,040
I'm onlye here becaue my new best friend

317
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,708
asked me to come.

318
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,910
You two have some things to talk about.

319
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:26,812
Right, Spencer?

320
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:29,720
In the meantime, may I have five minutes
alone to say good-bye to my dog?

321
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,917
Ten cages down on your right.

322
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:40,052
Yeah, I hear you yapping.
You want the smokes,

323
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,839
but what are you gonna do for me?

324
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:43,161
You think it was easy smuggling these in?

325
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,430
Believe me, it didn't tickle coming out.

326
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,561
It's about time.

327
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,046
Good to go?

328
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,018
I'm working on it.

329
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:57,388
Look, I shouldn't have let Spencer tease
you with that laser pointer.

330
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:58,697
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,813
Apology accepted.

332
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:07,133
Isn't there something you'd
like to apologize for?

333
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,019
No that I can think, no.

334
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,017
My wallet?

335
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:13,786
Everything else you've put me through today?

336
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,521
Why would I apologize for giving you a gift?

337
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:16,827
If anything, a thank you would be nice.

338
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,096
Uh, yeah, she was your girlfriend,

339
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:20,664
but she was a prostitute!

340
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:23,100
You knew damn well she
didn't work on Saturdays!

341
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:25,270
You banged her on Shabbas, man!

342
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:28,039
Seems like you've got everything
under control, eh, Ryan?

343
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,742
Getting my ass kicked is
not gonna solve anything.

344
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:35,279
Ryan, will you please tell this
lying thief the mining of loyalty?

345
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,783
Oh, right! This coming from the
guy who took advantage of my mom!

346
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:42,153
My sweet, innocent mom
when she was on ecstasy!

347
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:44,321
Okay, guys, enough!

348
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:48,559
Spencer, you may not think what you
did to Jesse was wrong,

349
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,724
but he thinks it was wrong,
and he was hurt by it.

350
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,549
The same goes for you too, Jesse.

351
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:56,500
And if caring about

352
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:58,937
your best friend's feelings
isn't important to you,

353
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,815
then maybe you don't know
what friendship really is.

354
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,703
Aw, take your mutt.

355
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,382
I'll lose the paperwork.

356
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,250
Thank you.

357
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,333
You... watched any porn lately?

358
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:21,015
I have a government job,

359
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,750
all I do is watch porn.

360
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:28,701
Oh, hey, Ryan, do you mind if I, um...

361
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:30,737
Not at all. Go porn out.

362
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,941
So, Spencer's back with Jesse,

363
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,577
and I didn't get my ass kicked.

364
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,814
Guess I can run away from my problems.

365
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,716
Hey!

366
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:44,777
The third amigo has arrived!

367
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:46,323
- And the saga continues.
- I was just

368
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,388
on my way over to Spencer's
to grab the schlag.

369
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:51,425
Nice! You brought food for the crew!

370
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,374
Jesse and I let ourselves in.
I hope you don't mind.

371
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,131
I don't mind, Ryan. Do you mind? Oh!

372
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:00,000
Okay, here's what I'm thinking, all right?

373
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,344
****

374
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:04,372
bottle rocket fight.

375
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,691
Then, assuming there's no major burns,

376
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,010
we head over to the waterslide park.

377
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,312
And after that, we go to the bar,

378
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,381
where the bartender
won't even throw us out

379
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,250
because it's, like, the best bar ever.

380
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,951
I shat in your boot.

381
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:19,229
What?

382
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,743
I broke your window, I stole your weed,

383
00:17:21,778 --> 00:17:23,431
and I took a shit in your boot.

384
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:25,084
And then I lied to your face.

385
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,858
Why?

386
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,052
Because you're an asshole, Spencer.

387
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,399
<i>How am I an asshole?</i>

388
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:33,165
Because you-you rev your motorcycle

389
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,934
at all hours of the night,

390
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:38,037
you sprayed the Patels' statue,
and you leave your damn

391
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,406
trash cans in front of my damn garage all...

392
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:43,009
You steal from me,

393
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,111
lie to me! I am gonna rip your...

394
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:49,514
You all right, mate?

395
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:52,286
Am I all right?

396
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,989
Oh.

397
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,994
Oh.

398
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,502
I lost a tooth.

399
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:02,974
And I think he may have
broken my eye socket.

400
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:09,103
I was in a fight.

401
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:13,139
With a scary dude.

402
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,243
And I'm all right!

403
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,058
Thanks, Wilfred.

404
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:19,825
Thank you.

405
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,499
This turn out to be a pretty *** gift after.

406
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:27,590
What the hell?

407
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,276
- I, uh... - He has ten seconds
to get his friend out of your house.

408
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,527
You have ten seconds
to get your friend out of my house.

409
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:34,965
Or else the same thing's
gonna happen to him.

410
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:37,307
Or else the same thing's
gonna happen to you.

411
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:38,135
Oh, shit, man!

412
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,704
And if you ever see his
face again, you're gonna

413
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:42,300
slash his family's throats in their sleep
and then go to their funerals

414
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,075
and slaughter everyone who shows up.

415
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:45,843
Oh, that's gold. Say that, Ryan.

416
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:48,274
I'm not saying that.

417
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:50,088
You're such a pussy.

418
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,183
I owe you, this is a tough one.

419
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:20,062
Um, I guess I'd screw Toto,

420
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:22,164
marry Lassie and kill Marmaduke.

421
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,666
Your turn.

422
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,613
Oh, no thanks. Dogs aren't really my thing.

423
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:27,618
Answer the question Ryan.

424
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,470
Uh... all right.

425
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:32,646
- I guess I'd screw Anne Hathaway.
- No, no, she's not on the list.

426
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:34,608
Go pick someone on the list.

427
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:37,211
These are all dogs.

428
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,463
Ok. Lassie.

429
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:45,219
You can't screw Lassie.

430
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,892
She's my wife!

431
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:48,779
Now pick someone of the list!

432
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:52,492
The only other name on here is Scrappy-Doo.

433
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:55,362
That's sick, Ryan. He's only ten months old.

434
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:57,597
What, you-you into kiddies?
Is that your thing?

435
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,332
I didn't have any other choice!

436
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,600
You could have taken a pass.

437
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,199
You're doing it wrong.

438
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:06,746
No, I'm not.

439
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,374
You're missing the whole point of the toy.

440
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,944
Here, give it here.

441
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:36,088
