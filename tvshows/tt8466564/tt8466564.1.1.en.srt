00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:15,916
You refer to the prophecy of the
one who will bring balance to the Force.

3
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,166
You believe it's this boy?

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,625
Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

5
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,250
<i>Clouded this boy's future is.</i>

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,375
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,583
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,875
Impossible to take on a second.

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,416
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

10
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.</i>

11
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,166
No!

12
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,291
<i>I foresee you will become
a great Jedi Knight.</i>

13
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,833
Obi-Wan.

14
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,916
Promise me you will train the boy.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Yes, Master.

16
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,000
He will bring balance.

17
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,541
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

18
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>Your apprentice Skywalker will be.</i>

19
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,541
What took you so long?

20
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,250
<i>Obi-Wan is a great mentor.</i>

21
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,500
<i>As wise as Master Yoda</i>

22
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,875
<i>and as powerful as Master Windu.</i>

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,791
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

24
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,333
<i>I see you becoming
the greatest of all the Jedi.</i>

25
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,708
<i>I feel lost.</i>

26
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,708
Lost? What do you mean?

27
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,416
<i>I'm not the Jedi I should be.
I want more.</i>

28
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,083
And I know I shouldn't.

29
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,791
<i>How do you know the ways of the Force?</i>

30
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,541
My mentor taught me everything
about the Force.

31
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,291
Even the nature of the dark side

32
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,500
Only through me

33
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,208
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

34
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,125
I can't.

35
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,708
Don't give up, Padmé.

36
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,333
<i>The power to save Padmé.</i>

37
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,166
I found a way to save you.

38
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,250
<i>Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.</i>

39
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,708
The boy you trained, gone he is.

40
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,250
I will not kill Anakin.

41
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,958
This is the end for you, my master.

42
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,958
I have failed you, Anakin.

43
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,916
I have failed you.

44
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,708
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

45
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,458
You underestimate my power.

46
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,208
You were the Chosen One!

47
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,166
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

48
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,666
He's still alive.

49
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,833
<i>You were my brother, Anakin.</i>

50
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:09,958
<i>You shall be known
as Darth Vader.</i>

51
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,250
Obi-Wan?

52
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,833
There's good in him.

53
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,041
<i>Rise.</i>

54
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,500
<i>Hidden,
safe the children must be kept.</i>

55
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,583
<i>We must take them somewhere</i>

56
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,708
<i>where the Sith
will not sense their presence.</i>

57
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,791
My wife and I will take the girl.

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,916
<i>We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.</i>

59
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,708
<i>Leia.</i>

60
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,791
And what of the boy?

61
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,208
<i>Luke.</i>

62
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,000
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

63
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,041
I will take the child and watch over him.

64
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,333
<i>In your solitude...</i>

65
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,875
<i>training I have for you.</i>

66
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,916
<i>Your old master.</i>

67
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,541
<i>How to commune with him I will teach you.</i>

68
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,875
This way! Quick!

69
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,083
Come on! Let's go!

70
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,416
- Let's go!
- This way!

71
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,083
Come on! Let's go!

72
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,500
- This way.
- Hurry!

73
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,666
Watch out!

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,750
Come on! Move! Quick!

75
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,000
- Go. Come on! Go. Go! Go!
- Run! This way! Hurry!

76
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,375
No!

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,750
What do we do now?

78
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,625
We run.

79
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,875
<i>Execute Order 66.</i>

80
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,916
<i>Execute Order 66.</i>

81
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,375
<i>Execute Order 66.</i>

82
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,250
You know who we are.

83
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:35,916
Inquisitors.

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,958
You know what we do?

85
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,291
You hunt Jedi.

86
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:44,541
In actuality, I would say
the Jedi hunt themselves.

87
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:53,458
Do you know the key
to hunting a Jedi, friend?

88
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,583
It is patience.

89
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,083
Jedi cannot help what they are.

90
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,291
Their compassion leaves a trail.

91
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:13,250
For example,
in our line of work, rumors run rampant.

92
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Here's one I heard just recently.

93
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:21,416
It involves a Jedi hiding right here
in your lovely saloon.

94
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,166
Let's say ours is a wanderer.

95
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,666
Maybe he's looking for people like him.

96
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,583
Comes across this establishment.

97
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,750
Nice place.

98
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,833
And then he sees you.

99
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,916
A man in need.

100
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,750
Perhaps the locals are stealing from you.

101
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,458
Threatening you.

102
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,791
So what is the Jedi to do?

103
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,166
Help you and risk exposure?

104
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,333
Or move on?

105
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:09,833
Now, if he were smart, he'd keep moving,
but the Jedi Code is like an itch.

106
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,750
He cannot help it.

107
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,208
So he steps in and saves your saloon.

108
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,833
You offer him a place to hide.

109
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,291
Fresh water, shade from the suns,

110
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,541
but the stories, they begin
and they travel quickly.

111
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,666
His compassion has been his undoing.

112
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,458
There.

113
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,416
Prepare him for interrogation.

114
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,958
You're wasting your time.
You know that, right?

115
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,958
You'll never find us all.

116
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,166
You are reckless.

117
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,625
Why chase after scraps?

118
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,041
Scraps are all we have left.

119
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,750
Then we should be hunting bigger prey.

120
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,958
He is not yours to find.
We are past this, Third Sister.

121
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,916
I will not warn you again.

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,458
You will forget this fixation with Kenobi,
or I will relieve you of your duties.

123
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,625
Is that clear?

124
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,083
Yes, Grand Inquisitor.

125
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,541
Consider him forgotten.

126
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,083
It's only half.

127
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,958
Please, I have a family.

128
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,833
One more word, I take it all.

129
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Keep moving.

130
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,458
Something you want to say?

131
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,208
You're late.

132
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,416
Do you have it?

133
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,333
I'll give you...

134
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,458
I'll give you 50.

135
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,833
Yes, I had some parts stolen.
I need a new processor board.

136
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,458
Teeka, if you're gonna steal my parts
and then sell them back to me,

137
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,416
could you at least clean them first
as a courtesy?

138
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,375
A Jedi?

139
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,541
Well, don't count on it.

140
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,916
I've heard the Jedi are all but extinct.

141
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,166
Here.

142
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,166
Well, thank you, Teeka. Goodbye.

143
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,375
<i>I know there's…</i>

144
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,583
<i>You were my brother, Anakin!</i>

145
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,583
Promise me you will train the boy.

146
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,166
<i>Obi-Wan...</i>

147
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,333
<i>Only pain will you find.</i>

148
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,208
<i>There's good in him.
I know there's...</i>

149
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,375
<i>You were the Chosen One!</i>

150
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,625
I hate you!

151
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,500
Master Qui-Gon.

152
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,791
Master?

153
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,500
Grab two of those canisters.

154
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,791
Luke?

155
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,833
Luke!

156
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,666
Luke!

157
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,583
Did he go back inside?

158
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,750
He's run off.

159
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,875
Luke?

160
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:24,791
Luke?

161
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,833
Luke?

162
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,250
Master.

163
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,916
I thought I saw you in the town,
but I wasn't sure.

164
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,541
I didn't think you'd survived.

165
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,625
You're making some kind of mistake.

166
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,250
I'm sorry, my name is Nari.

167
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,208
Um, there's no mistake.

168
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,541
You're looking for somebody else.

169
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,208
What are you doing here, Obi-Wan?

170
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,416
My name is Ben.

171
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,333
Come on, please.

172
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,916
Please.

173
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,333
You have no idea what I've been through.

174
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,166
You must leave.

175
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,375
You'll draw too much attention.

176
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,750
But I have nowhere to go.

177
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,208
They're hunting me. You have to help me.

178
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,833
You want my help?

179
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,375
Take this.

180
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,708
Walk into the middle of the desert
and bury it in the ground.

181
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,416
Stay hidden.

182
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,208
Live a normal life.

183
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,125
What about the people that need us?
What about the fight?

184
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,625
The fight is done.

185
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,583
We lost.

186
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,125
What happened to you?

187
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,666
You were once a great Jedi.

188
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,833
The time of the Jedi is over.

189
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,583
Go back to the town.

190
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,875
Let it go.

191
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,666
We're going to be late.

192
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,625
Come on, let's hurry it along.

193
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,708
How is she doing?

194
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:00,791
She's ready?

195
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,458
Great.

196
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,333
Thank you.

197
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,875
Remember,
my sister's whole family is coming.

198
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,666
We need their support.

199
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,333
So try not to make anyone cry.

200
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,875
There will be sweetmallows
at the reception after.

201
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,000
If you behave, I will let you...

202
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,666
She insisted
you would find it amusing, Your Highness.

203
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,000
She's either in the cellar,
in the kitchen...

204
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,541
...or in the woods.

205
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,958
Medical freighter.

206
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,333
Pleasure barge, boring.

207
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,083
Casino ship? Not bad.

208
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,416
Ooh. A Tri-wing. That's a new one.

209
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,625
Ooh. An Aquillian Ranger.

210
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:35,083
Probably scouting for Merson pirates.

211
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,750
No? Trader, maybe?

212
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,000
Leia Organa!

213
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,625
You had to do this today?

214
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,708
Do what?

215
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:45,875
Down.

216
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,791
It is like raising a Glor-ag.

217
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,041
No Lola for the rest of the day.

218
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,166
But she didn't do anything.

219
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,250
Shut her down.

220
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,875
I mean it.

221
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,458
If you behaved as well as you climb,

222
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,625
you'd be a senator already.

223
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,125
You'll have to change
in the speeder. Come.

224
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,625
It's not like anyone would miss me
if I wasn't there.

225
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:26,791
I'd miss you.

226
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,625
All I ever do is wave.

227
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,291
Then do more than wave.

228
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,500
You get out of this what you put into it.

229
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,416
I'm sorry, Mother.

230
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,416
I really am.

231
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,291
I promise I won't do it again.

232
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,958
You know, I can feel you doing that.

233
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,666
Come on.

234
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,666
It's like living in a prison.

235
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,833
A prison?

236
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,958
I want you to stay away from him.

237
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,041
We don't need anything from you, Ben.

238
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,708
It's just a toy.

239
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,333
It's a lot more than that.

240
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:03,208
There's more to life than your farm, Owen.

241
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:06,208
He needs to see that.
There's a whole galaxy out there.

242
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,583
I'm asking you to leave us alone, Ben.

243
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:10,666
I mean it.

244
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,166
Is he okay?

245
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,375
You don't care if he's okay.

246
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,000
You care if he's showing.

247
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,791
He's my responsibility, Owen.

248
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,541
- I'm his uncle.
- We talked about this.

249
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:24,041
When the time comes, he must be trained.

250
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,500
Like you trained his father?

251
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,166
Anakin is dead, Ben,

252
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,166
and I won't let you
make the same mistake twice.

253
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,166
So, leave him on the farm with his family,
where he belongs.

254
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,791
Move. Now.

255
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,166
Get back.

256
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,416
All of you.

257
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,041
Out of the way.

258
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,791
Back up.

259
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,291
You know why we are here.

260
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:08,291
There is a Jedi hiding on this planet.

261
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,916
We need to know where he is.

262
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,750
You will be rewarded well.

263
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:14,875
Or you'll be punished!

264
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,000
Reva!

265
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,625
Hands go first!

266
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,583
That way, when you reach for anything,

267
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,291
you think of us.

268
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,375
This is the Outer Rim.

269
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,208
You have no rights here.

270
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,541
We're not under the Empire's...

271
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,416
All we want is information.

272
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:49,916
If anyone knows anything about a Jedi...

273
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,541
You know something?

274
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,458
What's your name?

275
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,833
Owen.

276
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:09,875
Owen.

277
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,625
Farmer, right?

278
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,041
Wife?

279
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,125
Kids?

280
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,958
My family's of no concern to you.

281
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,333
They might be.

282
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:22,041
- You got a Jedi on that farm, too?
- No.

283
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,375
Why should I believe you?

284
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,250
I have no love for the Jedi.

285
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,458
Jedi are vermin.

286
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,333
I kill vermin on my farm.

287
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,833
You protect your family.

288
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,791
I like that, Owen.

289
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,625
It's important.

290
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,000
You think you could protect them from me?

291
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:59,375
Tell me where the Jedi is,
or this man and his family die!

292
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,875
The Jedi are cowards.

293
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,791
They failed you,

294
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:10,625
abandoned you.

295
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,916
There is no point in protecting them.

296
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,041
They would not do the same for you.

297
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,166
But you can save this man.

298
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,291
Save his family.

299
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:37,708
Enough!

300
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,291
If you remember anything,

301
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,416
rewards will be given.

302
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,916
Stand down, Third Sister.

303
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,250
Now!

304
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,125
Next time, Owen.

305
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,125
Ah! Move.

306
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:15,166
You are too impulsive.

307
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,250
I'm sick of wasting time!

308
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,666
This place is beneath us!

309
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,000
The Grand Inquisitor was right.

310
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,083
You still want Kenobi.

311
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,083
But he's gone, and you won't find him.

312
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,458
We spent the last ten years
looking for him.

313
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,458
Maybe you've been looking
in the wrong places.

314
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,750
What is it you think you will gain
by capturing him?

315
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,333
What I'm owed.

316
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,583
Be careful, Third Sister.

317
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,416
You go too far.

318
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:57,041
Maybe you don't go far enough.

319
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,125
Thank you, Owen.

320
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:16,875
I didn't do it for you.

321
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,000
Right on time as always.

322
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,416
Anything good today?

323
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,958
A trade ship and an Aquillian Ranger.

324
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,791
Probably scouring for pirates.

325
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,416
That's what I said.

326
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,375
- Don't encourage her.
- All right.

327
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,875
Come now.

328
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,583
Let's get this over with.

329
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,041
- Breha.
- Sister.

330
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,375
- Greetings.
- Hi, cousin.

331
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,375
Princess.

332
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,791
Oh, there they are.

333
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,041
Princess.

334
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,416
Hi, Princess.

335
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,041
Profits have been good.

336
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:50,958
After the disaster of the Republic,
the Empire is finally lining some pockets.

337
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,750
There are still some issues
that we need to address.

338
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,791
Slave labor, taxation of the Outer Rim...

339
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,375
I didn't come here to end slavery, Bail.

340
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,750
I came to eat your food.

341
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,208
Save the bleeding heart for the Senate.

342
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,833
A drink, Senator?

343
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,125
Ah. Thank you.

344
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,083
Your Highness.

345
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:16,791
Oh. Thanks, Y-O.

346
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:17,958
My pleasure.

347
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,333
You thank your droids?

348
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,458
It's good manners.

349
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:25,458
You don't need manners
when you're talking to a lower life form.

350
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,708
Then I guess I don't need manners
when I'm talking to you.

351
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,583
You know the difference
between you and me, cousin?

352
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,291
I know things.

353
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:38,458
My father says
they never let you leave this planet.

354
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:43,250
They don't want anybody to know about you
because you're not one of us.

355
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,791
You're not even a real Organa.

356
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,916
You're scared of him.

357
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,666
Your father. You want him to like you,
so you repeat what he says

358
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,166
even though you don't really know
what it means.

359
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,833
You think being like him
will make people frightened of you,

360
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:05,583
but really, you're the one who's scared.

361
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:08,416
You've never made one decision
for yourself in your entire life,

362
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,208
and you never will.

363
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,833
I may not have seen much, cousin,

364
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,250
but I can see that.

365
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,666
He was being horrible to everyone.

366
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,875
He's your cousin.

367
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:27,458
He's rude to droids.

368
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:29,791
You have to rise above, Leia.

369
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,875
You owe him an apology.

370
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,291
I'd rather be digested by a jakobeast.

371
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:53,541
I wanted to live out way past Kathou
when I was your age.

372
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,333
Chase purrgil, you know?

373
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,916
I had a whole plan.

374
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:01,708
What happened?

375
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:03,541
I got older.

376
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:06,458
Had to find some other adventures.

377
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,208
Started chasing your mother instead.

378
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,666
This is your future, Leia.

379
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:17,458
In a few years, you'll be
off to university, then Junior Senate.

380
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:18,541
The Senate's boring.

381
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:21,041
It's people in itchy clothes arguing.

382
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:24,041
Well, it may seem so...

383
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,375
I don't want to be a senator.

384
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:28,583
It is why
you'll probably be one of the best.

385
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,750
I'm not even a real Organa.

386
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,666
What?

387
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:39,416
Don't ever say that.

388
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,708
You are our child.

389
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:48,250
You are an Organa in every way.

390
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,666
One day, this planet
will look to you, Leia.

391
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,416
There are many ways to lead.

392
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,750
You just have to find yours.

393
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,500
Plus, imagine the look
on your cousin's face

394
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,666
when you get to boss him around for real.

395
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:08,791
But for now,

396
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:11,750
we will...

397
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,708
apologize.

398
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,666
Yes, Father.

399
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,750
Hmm.

400
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,166
I'll wait for you downstairs.

401
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,666
Thank you.

402
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,333
She's gone.

403
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,750
I thought you said
you've really got through to her.

404
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,416
You know what she's like.

405
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,916
I know who she's like.

406
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,833
Send a unit.

407
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:51,916
She can't be far.

408
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,958
Hello, Princess.

409
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,333
Why are you here?

410
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,458
Just waiting.

411
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:08,250
For what?

412
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,250
For you.

413
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,291
Help!

414
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,833
Help!

415
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,833
Help! Help me, please!

416
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,875
<i>We don't know who it was.</i>

417
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,583
<i>No ransom, no leads.</i>

418
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:46,041
<i>Whoever they are,
they knew where she would be. They...</i>

419
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,833
<i>They were waiting.</i>

420
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,125
<i>She needs you, Obi-Wan.</i>

421
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,666
<i>We can't trust anyone else.</i>

422
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,250
What about the Senate?

423
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,500
<i>We cannot let this become public.</i>

424
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,916
<i>It would draw too much attention.</i>

425
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,666
Well, your guard then? Or a bounty hunter?

426
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,833
<i>Only you know how important
she really is, Obi-Wan.</i>

427
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:11,500
<i>If Leia is discovered...</i>

428
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,166
I can't leave here, Bail.

429
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,541
My duty is to the boy...

430
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,541
<i>What about your duty to his sister?</i>

431
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,208
<i>She's as important as he is.</i>

432
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,916
It's been ten years.

433
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,041
I'm not who I used to be.

434
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,250
Find someone else.

435
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,041
She'll be better off.

436
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:50,250
Let go of me!

437
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,791
- Let go!
- Shut her up.

438
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,833
She's headed for Daiyu.

439
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,750
You should not have come.

440
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,083
They hid their signature
behind a freight transport.

441
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,000
The ship is on its way there now.

442
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,791
I can't.

443
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,625
She's my daughter, Obi-Wan.

444
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,875
I told you...

445
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,416
I'm not the man you remember.

446
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,833
You're going to have to be!

447
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:58,041
I can't leave the boy.

448
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,041
This isn't about the boy, and you know it!

449
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,125
You've made mistakes. We all did.

450
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,458
It's the past.

451
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:06,916
Move on. Be done with it.

452
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,625
You couldn't save Anakin,

453
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,916
but you can save her.

454
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,791
And what if I can't?

455
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:22,083
There is no one
I trust more with my child than you.

456
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,666
Please, old friend.

457
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,500
For her.

458
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:32,125
One last fight.

459
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,916
Come on, Lola. Come on.

460
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,125
Can you untie me?

461
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,166
I'm not afraid of you.

462
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,416
Give it time.

463
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,416
Lola!

464
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,083
My father will rescue me!

465
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:26,125
He'll send a whole army!

466
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:28,541
No one's coming for you.

467
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:26,875
This is a bad idea.

468
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:28,708
Kidnapping kids...

469
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,500
you think it's gonna work?

470
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,500
Just get this over with.

471
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,666
You sure he's gonna come?

472
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:18,708
<i>He fought beside her father
during the war.</i>

473
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:20,750
<i>He'll come.</i>

474
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,250
<i>He won't be able to help it.</i>

475
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,708
<i>The Jedi will hunt himself.</i>

476
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,375
Well?

477
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:56,625
You coming or not?

477
00:47:57,305 --> 00:48:57,604
