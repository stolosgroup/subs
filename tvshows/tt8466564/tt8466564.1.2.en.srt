1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:04,750
<i>You know who we are.</i>

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>Inquisitors.</i>

3
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:08,625
You hunt Jedi.

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,458
I would say the Jedi hunt themselves.

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,291
<i>The fight is done.</i>

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:21,250
<i>Stay hidden. Live a normal life.</i>

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,041
<i>I'm asking you
to leave us alone, Ben.</i>

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,208
<i>We talked about this.
When the time comes, he must be trained.</i>

9
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,083
Like you trained his father?

10
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,125
<i>We spent
the last ten years looking for him.</i>

11
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,541
<i>Maybe you've been looking
in the wrong places.</i>

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,375
You're not one of us.
You're not even a real Organa.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,666
You owe him an apology.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,250
I'd rather be digested by a jakobeast.

15
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,083
Hello, Princess.

16
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,041
Help! Help me, please!

17
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,875
She's headed for Daiyu.

18
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,125
I told you,
I'm not the man you remember.

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,416
<i>Please, old friend.</i>

20
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,625
<i>For her.</i>

21
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,208
<i>One last fight.</i>

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

23
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,291
No, no. I'm not gonna...

24
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,958
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

25
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,583
If it says "Delayed,"
mine's gonna say the same thing.

26
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,333
I can do nothing about the weather
on that planet.

27
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,416
No, you know what? I...

28
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,625
I really... I don't have time for this.
Just be going, okay?

29
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,666
Excuse me.

30
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,833
I'm looking for a ship.
I was tracking its signature.

31
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,250
You're in Daiyu now.
All signals in or out are blocked.

32
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,375
People like their secrets out here.

33
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,708
No!

34
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,791
Oh, stop.

35
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,458
If ever I needed guidance, Master,
it's now.

36
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,916
Spare any credits?

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,583
Help a veteran get a warm meal.

38
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,583
Out of the way.

39
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,916
Move it.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,791
P, X, nine, eight, seven...

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,916
All right, come on.
Break it up. Clear a path.

42
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,250
You want some spice, old man?

43
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,666
I got Kessel pure, glitterstim,
and Felucian.

44
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,000
What do you need?

45
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,708
How about some information?

46
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,083
I'm looking for my daughter.

47
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,375
She was taken, and she's on this planet.

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,875
Well, if she's here,
you're never gonna see her again.

49
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,625
Nobody leaves this place.

50
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,500
I was someone's daughter once, too.

51
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,958
Here.

52
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,416
That one's free.

53
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,041
Couple more of those
and you'll forget she ever existed.

54
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,458
You having trouble?

55
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,208
There's a Jedi. He helps people.

56
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,666
The Jedi are all gone.

57
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll take you to him.

58
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,833
For the right price.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,833
It's okay, you're safe now.

60
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,125
I won't let anything happen to you.

61
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,291
Spaceport passenger check.
Gate 3-C, do you read? Over.

62
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,500
<i>This is Gate 3. Copy.
Who is this? This is a private channel.</i>

63
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,625
This is a Jedi mind trick.
Do not be alarmed.

64
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,458
I'm inside your mind.

65
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,583
<i>You're inside my mind.</i>

66
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,750
I'm sending a mother and son to your gate.

67
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,000
You will let them through
when they arrive.

68
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,875
<i>I'll let them through
when they arrive.</i>

69
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,791
They are to be given
safe passage to Corellia.

70
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,875
<i>They'll be given
safe passage to Corellia.</i>

71
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,208
I'm now leaving your mind.

72
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,833
- The Force is so strong with you.
- Yeah, I know.

73
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,083
Use Gate 3-C.

74
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,083
Thank you for helping us, Haja.

75
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,750
Oh. The Jedi must protect their own.

76
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,083
With your son's abilities,
they will come for him.

77
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,583
Get him safe.

78
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,708
Oh.

79
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,375
- It's all there.
- Oh, you didn't have to.

80
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,625
Every credit.

81
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,583
- We will never forget you.
- You must.

82
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,291
My safety depends upon it.

83
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,541
Now, go.

84
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,458
Go.

85
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,416
Be safe, little one.

86
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,166
Be safe.

87
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,875
They're on their way.
I'm gonna take a quick break, okay?

88
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,250
Call you in a little bit.

89
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,250
<i>Roger that.</i>

90
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,750
I'm looking for a Jedi.

91
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,958
How'd you get in here?

92
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,333
A girl has been kidnapped.
I need your help to find her.

93
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,166
I am Haja Estree, Jedi.

94
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,416
I help all who are in need.

95
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,791
In return, I ask only a few credits.

96
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,541
The shadows are my realm, for the light
is an unforgiving place for my kind.

97
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,833
Of course. How much?

98
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,875
Five hundred to locate the girl,

99
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,958
another three hundred to take you to her.

100
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,416
Goodness, that light is unforgiving.

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,083
I mean, that's a really good deal.

102
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,458
Oh, make it a thousand,
I'll even show you some tricks.

103
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,166
What do you know of the Force, my friend?

104
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,750
Just that it's a lot of remotes
and magnets.

105
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,416
Okay, I know how this looks.

106
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,708
It looks like you
just took money from that family.

107
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,291
I got them safe. Just a little poorer.

108
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:05,000
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
- That depends on what you tell me.

109
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,291
What are you, a bounty hunter?

110
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:12,083
You're a bottom-feeder,
a rat who preys on weakness.

111
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,708
But in my experience, rats know more
about the sewers than anyone else.

112
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,375
So judgmental.

113
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,083
You'll help me find
this girl I'm looking for.

114
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,375
Yeah, I'll do it.

115
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,250
- You'll help me?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,875
- Can I trust you?
- Definitely.

117
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,375
<i>All right, if it's the sewers you want,
there's only one place to go.</i>

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,333
<i>But you'll never get in.</i>

119
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,666
Hey.

120
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,875
What are you doing back here?

121
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,541
Oh, I seem to have lost my way.

122
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,166
- Yeah, well, get back to work.
- Right.

123
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,625
Where's the girl?

124
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,666
Leia.

125
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,250
Leia.

126
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,166
I didn't know that Jedi could bleed.

127
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,750
I'm surprised you fell for it.

128
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,083
I figured you'd be smarter
than to risk everything

129
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,750
for a spoiled little brat.

130
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,708
The Inquisitor really figured you out.

131
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,750
She'll be here soon.

132
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,083
Then we'll be rich and you'll be dead.

133
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,875
Where is the girl?

134
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,250
- She must be close.
- Doesn't matter.

135
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,666
You're not getting out of here.

136
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,916
You're not a Jedi anymore, Kenobi.

137
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,458
You're just a man.

138
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,375
And you're bleeding all over my floor.

139
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,958
Well, everybody bleeds.

140
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,750
Move.

141
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,291
- Wait.
- Let go of me!

142
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,458
Wait!

143
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,625
Let go!

144
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,666
Who are you?

145
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,083
Your father sent me. I'm here to help you.

146
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,333
Where's the army?

147
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,708
Come. I'm gonna get you out of here.

148
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,375
Why should I trust you?

149
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,041
Would you rather stay here?
Now, let's go.

150
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,791
Come on.

151
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,125
We don't have much time.

152
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,708
Keep your head down.

153
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,583
This would've been easier
with the army.

154
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,375
Shh. Quiet.

155
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,458
Where is he?

156
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,375
Come in here. We have to change.

157
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,666
Is that a...

158
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,416
You're a Jedi?

159
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,541
Quiet.

160
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,958
It's just... you seem
kind of old and beat up.

161
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,125
There is a port across the city.

162
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,750
We need to make the last transport.

163
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,916
Okay, then let's go.

164
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,083
Wait.

165
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,083
You have no idea what I'm risking
being here, Your Highness.

166
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,625
From now on, you'll do
exactly as you're told, understand?

167
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,500
You would kidnap
an Imperial Senator's child?

168
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,416
- We've done worse.
- You have no right.

169
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,791
I found a link between him
and Organa in the archives.

170
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,458
I used the girl as bait.

171
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,583
And you did this without informing me?

172
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,000
You left me no choice.

173
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,583
She thinks she will gain favor
by capturing Kenobi.

174
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,291
Whatever power you are craving,

175
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,958
it will not change what you are.

176
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,041
And what is that?

177
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,833
The least of us.

178
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,833
You came to us from the gutter.

179
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,208
Your ability gave you station, but...

180
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:26,958
all the power in the world
can't mask the stench beneath.

181
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:31,125
Maybe that stench is your failure.

182
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,583
Secure the city.

183
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,958
I will take Kenobi in myself.

184
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,916
You are no longer required, Sister.

185
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,333
I brought Kenobi here.

186
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,333
Stand down.

187
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,833
You will be dealt with when we return.

188
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,583
<i>Send it across the city.</i>

189
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,083
<i>I want every lowlife and bounty hunter
on this planet</i>

190
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,375
<i>to know Kenobi is here.</i>

191
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,208
<i>They only report to me.</i>

192
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,208
You really think
those scum can catch a Jedi?

193
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,083
<i>I don't want them to catch him.
I want them to squeeze him.</i>

194
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:29,500
<i>He'll reveal himself eventually,
and I will be waiting.</i>

195
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,291
Come on.

196
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,375
Here, put this on.

197
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,375
- Can I try this one instead?
- Half the city is looking for you.

198
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,541
Put this on.

199
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,375
A little green cape.

200
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,958
You don't need those.

201
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,083
And the gloves.

202
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,291
Thank you.

203
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:37,041
Now, if anyone asks, we're farmers
from Tawl and you're my daughter.

204
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,666
Granddaughter, maybe.

205
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,500
- What?
- Nothing.

206
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,916
- Where are we?
- Daiyu.

207
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,000
This place is incredible.

208
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,750
Do you smell that?

209
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,583
Don't smell anything.
Don't look at anything.

210
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,166
Don't touch anything.

211
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,083
You sound like my parents.

212
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,041
Why aren't you using your lightsaber?

213
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,833
Maybe it's because
you're not really a Jedi.

214
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,125
I heard they all died.

215
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,250
I read that Jedi can make things float.
Make me float.

216
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
- What?
- I want to float.

217
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,166
- No.
- Because you can't.

218
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,166
Because if I use the Force,
then it'll draw attention to us. Come on.

219
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,291
You haven't even told me your name.

220
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,375
Ben.

221
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,666
It's not a Jedi name.

222
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,416
Well, that's my name.
You'll have to trust me eventually.

223
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,250
How can I trust you when I know
you're hiding something?

224
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,958
You think the less you say,
the less you give away,

225
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,041
but, really, it's the opposite.

226
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,750
- How old are you?
- Ten.

227
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,666
You don't sound like you're ten.

228
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,666
Thank you.

229
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,708
Come on.

230
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,083
We had him. Look at this reward.

231
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,958
Oh, that's embarrassing.

232
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,291
It says he's with a girl.
He'll have half of the city on him now.

233
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's get to him first.

234
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Come on.

235
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,000
Wha...

236
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,916
- Who was...
- He's a bounty hunter.

237
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,541
Make sure the port is shut down.

238
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,541
I want a garrison here within the hour.

239
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,166
And remember, this is no ordinary Jedi.

240
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,333
Kenobi is the last ember of a dying age.

241
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,208
Extinguish him.

242
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,625
Consider it done.

243
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,666
There's something you should see,
Grand Inquisitor.

244
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,208
Reva.

245
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,916
We'll stay here for now.

246
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,625
No noise from that.

247
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:52,416
Her name's Lola.
And she won't make any. She's hurt.

248
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,875
Good.

249
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,666
What happened to her anyway?

250
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,458
She was ripped to pieces by kidnappers.

251
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,500
She'll be all right, though. She's strong.

252
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,250
I let your parents know you're safe.

253
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,083
You'll be back in the palace,
back to normal, by nightfall.

254
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,000
Normal. Great.

255
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,875
Now who's hiding something, Princess?

256
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,833
You don't have to call me that.
I'm just Leia.

257
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,166
Stay here.

258
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,416
What is that?

259
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,791
Why is there a picture of you?

260
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,583
You did lie.

261
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,375
- Leia...
- That's what you were hiding.

262
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,541
You're the reason I'm here.

263
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,708
They took me to get to you.

264
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,375
- Did my father even send you?
- Of course he did. Leia, listen to...

265
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,333
How do I know
you're not the real kidnapper?

266
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,250
- You have to trust me.
- You aren't a Jedi.

267
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,791
- Your father is a very old friend.
- I don't believe you.

268
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:20,958
Leia.

269
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,291
Leia!

270
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,166
No!

271
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,750
Wait!

272
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,500
It's her. It's the girl.
Just tell us where he is.

273
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,208
- Leia!
- No!

274
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,041
- Leia, wait! Stop!
- Leave me alone.

275
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,666
No. Wait!

276
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,166
Leia!

277
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,750
Leia!

278
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,041
Leia!

279
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,750
Stop!

280
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,458
Leia!

281
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,625
Stop, Leia!

282
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,000
Leia! Leia!

283
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,416
Wait!

284
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,458
Leia!

285
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:55,958
Leia!

286
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,333
Leia, don't!

287
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,000
Leia, no!

288
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,875
No! Leia, no!

289
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,416
Hold on! Hold on tight!

290
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,875
- Ben!
- Don't let go, Leia.

291
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,375
- Hold on tight.
- Ben!

292
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:55,250
Hold on. Just... Just...

293
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,958
Leia! Leia, no!

294
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,291
No!

295
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,375
Ben!

296
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,791
She's all right.

297
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,291
Are you all right?

298
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:42,458
You...

299
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,916
You really are a Jedi.

300
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:47,708
We need to move.

301
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:55,500
<i>All incoming
and outgoing travel is canceled.</i>

302
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,583
<i>Have identification ready for scanning.</i>

303
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,250
Team five check-in.
Team five.

304
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,500
Who are they?

305
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:07,750
Inquisitors. Many were Jedi
who turned to the dark side.

306
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,625
Now, they hunt their own kind.

307
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,666
And this is all for you?

308
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,333
Who are you?

309
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,500
The bounty is on me. Let her go.

310
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,708
Listen carefully. The entire city's
locked down. It's done.

311
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,583
You need another exit.

312
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,083
It's a cargo port. It's fully automated.

313
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,958
They won't be looking for you there.
Go to transport eight.

314
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,750
- What are you saying?
- It goes to Mapuzo. They'll be waiting.

315
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:34,833
Who'll be waiting?

316
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,791
There are people out there
who can help you.

317
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:39,375
You expect me to trust you?
You're a criminal.

318
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:43,666
Look, have I made a few bad decisions?
Sure. Do I feel bad about it? Sometimes.

319
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,916
Do I like credits? Yeah.

320
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,583
- So much stuff you can buy with credits.
- Haja.

321
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,750
You remembered my name.

322
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,250
I'm trying to make amends.

323
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,083
I got that family safe, and I'm gonna
do the same for you.

324
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,958
If I'd known what you were...

325
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:02,291
Doesn't matter what I am.
I just need to get the girl home.

326
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,625
Go to these coordinates.

327
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,875
They'll help you from there.

328
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,291
And how do I know this isn't just a trap?

329
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,541
What choice do you have?

330
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,625
You're not alone, Obi-Wan.

331
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,500
Buy you as much time as I can.

332
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:31,041
I know she put a bounty on Kenobi.
Where is he?

333
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,875
I don't know!

334
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:37,166
I don't... know.

335
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,625
Finally, we meet.

336
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,416
We both know why you're here.

337
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,416
I am Haja Estree. Jedi. You found me.

338
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,416
You're as good as they say.

339
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,708
Get out of my way.

340
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,833
What's the bounty on me now?

341
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,250
A million? Two million?

342
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:13,125
Doesn't matter
because you will not get it.

343
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:15,750
You're no Jedi.

344
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:19,833
But you know where one is.

345
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:22,375
I'm the only Jedi around.

346
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,833
- Where is he?
- That wasn't magnets, was it?

347
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,416
What did you ask? You know what?
I'm not gonna answer it.

348
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,916
I don't need you to.

349
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,625
We must be careful.

350
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,541
This is a cargo port.
It's not meant for people.

351
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:59,166
Then they won't look for us here.

352
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,958
Well, not unless it's a setup.

353
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,000
Is it that hard to believe
you might have friends?

354
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:11,250
Look, since I met you, I've been chased,
shot at, I almost fell to my death,

355
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,000
and now there are Inquisiting people
after us.

356
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,916
If somebody is offering us help,
I think we should take it.

357
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,166
Now, come on.

358
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,208
What now?

359
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,416
Nothing,
you just remind me of someone.

360
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,916
She was fearless, too. And stubborn.

361
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,541
- I'm not stubborn.
- Yes you are.

362
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,791
I'm not!

363
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,583
Was your friend a Jedi, too?

364
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,708
No, she was a leader.

365
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,875
She died a long time ago.

366
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,791
Uh, I'm sorry.

367
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,166
Me, too.

368
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,750
Obi-Wan...

369
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,333
Leia.

370
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,375
If I don't get back in time, go.

371
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,708
I'll be right behind you, I promise. Go!

372
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,833
I can feel you.

373
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,000
Your fear betrays you.

374
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:03,041
You don't have to worry.

375
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,583
You're not going to die...

376
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,750
today.

377
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:16,750
I'm just going to take you to him.

378
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,958
Lord Vader will be pleased.

379
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,916
You didn't know.

380
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,000
He's alive, Obi-Wan.

381
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:42,375
Anakin Skywalker is alive.

382
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:50,250
And he's been looking for you
for a long time.

383
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:55,000
And I will be the one
to deliver you to him.

384
00:32:56,083 --> 00:33:00,333
Third Sister! I can stand the reek
of your ambition no longer.

385
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,125
I found him. We have him!

386
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,291
And I cannot risk you
losing him again.

387
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,041
Move aside.

388
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:15,833
Watch and learn.

389
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,750
Really think I'd let you
take all the credit?

390
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,250
Who's in the gutter now?

391
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,541
You can't run, Obi-Wan!

392
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,583
You can't escape him!

393
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,791
We will find you!

394
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,958
We will destroy you!

395
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:16,916
What is it?

396
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,750
Are you okay?

397
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,083
Anakin.

397
00:34:29,305 --> 00:35:29,253
