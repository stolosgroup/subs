It was eight.

when the pigs broke in.

So they only took seven
and put 'em on trial.

right here,

owned by a Gallagher.

Now we got
three hipster coffee shops.

It was seven before
the COVID took down the weak.

with that virus.

120

Sure, it was right behind the...

121
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,066
No, no,

122
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,444
not because it was
behind the stockyards,

123
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,946
because it was the back
of the Gallagher yards.

Break up a downer or something.

Frank used to rub whiskey
on our gums.

It's by the stove.
Just add hot water.

There's a new bag of coffee
in the fridge.

168
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,616
Like what?

169
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,200
I don't know, we could do, uh,

170
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:41,411
I don't know,
one night on, one night off.

171
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:43,330
You know, one of us
stays at my old house

172
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,682
or your dad's,
gets a good night's sleep

173
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:45,766
while the other one stays here.

174
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,376
We could, uh, trade off,
you know?

175
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:50,003
Okay.

176
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,546
Dibs first night.

177
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,299
Who got evicted?

178
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,800
Aniya, that girl who was working

179
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,636
at the beauty supply shop
on Ashland.

180
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,220
Is that the one that, uh,
bellied up?

181
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,388
Oh, my God.

182
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,515
Yeah, yeah. One of many.

183
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:05,477
Hey, I need you to run
some errands for me today...

184
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,938
Grocery, paint store.

185
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,607
Is that a problem?

186
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,610
No. Glad to.

187
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,071
[Lip] Mm.

188
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:20,241
- I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
- That's a good idea.

189
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,707
[baby squeals]

190
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,459

[siren chirps]

197
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:21,678
[Carl] Got you, fucker.

[Carl exhaling heavily]

200
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,648
Outstanding, Gallagher.

201
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,358
Thank you, sir.

202
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,776
Why didn't you shoot him?

203
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:38,570
I knew I could catch him, sir.

204
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,947
- Uncuff him. Give me the gun.
- [handcuffs ratcheting]

205
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:43,491
[chuckles]

206
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,952
That's how it's done, cadets.

207
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,263
Never shoot a suspect
in the back.

208
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,872
You wait for 'em to turn around,

209
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:50,707
and then you shoot 'em
in the face.

210
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:52,917
Good to know, sir.

211
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,130
[electric razor buzzing]

212
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:58,506
Why are you shaving your head?

213
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,341
'Cause I'm goin' bald.

214
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:01,593
But you're bald now, Kev.

215
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,929
Exactly. Now no one will know
I was going bald.

216
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,264
Science.

217
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,683
Should I just pour the weed
right in?

218
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,393
Yeah, I think so.

219
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:13,104
Go see if those gummies
are setting up right.

220
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,695
They need a few more minutes.

221
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:23,907
Hey, no sampling the product.

222
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:32,332
Excellent, Gemma.
Nice and tight.

223
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,417
Amy, good,
but a little less product

224
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,044
in the next one, okay?

225
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,379
Kev, what are the girls doing?

226
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,715
Their tiny fingers are perfect.

227
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:42,193
Look, this is why
they used little kids

228
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:44,928
to dig stuff out of machinery
back in the old days.

229
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:47,305
They outlawed that, Kev.
It's called child labor.

230
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,350
Well, we're a family business
now.

231
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:51,619
We all need to pull
our own weight.

232
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:54,521
No. Girls, go finish
getting ready for school,

233
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,022
and don't forget your masks.

234
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,249
I was gonna have 'em
wash their hands

235
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,001
- when they were done.
- Girls, wash your hands.

236
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,111
Did you pick up
the display case?

237
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,779
Yeah, it's in the truck.

238
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,405
Isn't this exciting?

239
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,616
Legal weed in Chicago?

240
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:07,700
Can you believe it?

241
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:10,245
Remember Diego, my roommate
from the group home,

242
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,704
the one with the glass eye?

243
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:13,123
He got 20 years.

244
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:14,964
Now we can just sell it
right out in the open.

245
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,210
Not out in the open.
We're not licensed yet.

246
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:19,629
And we're supposed
to be closed anyway.

247
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,173
Amy?

248
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,092
Gemma.

249
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:26,136
Girl's got a gift.

250
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:27,679
[door squeaks, slams]

251
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,349
[footsteps approaching]

252
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,060
Mm, morning Mr. Milkovich.

253
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,687
Morning, Mr. Gallagher.

254
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,939
Five times last night.
I'm feeling kinda raw.

255
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,023
How about you, stud?

256
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,942
I could go another five
right now.

257
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,235
- Mm - Mm-hmm.

258
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,154
Some big talk.
You ready to back it up?

259
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,905
Gotta get to work.

260
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:47,615
Call in sick.

261
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:48,825
We need the paycheck.

262
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,618
All right. Your loss.

263
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,054
Hey, you making breakfast
for both of us?

264
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,788
No. Didn't know you were
gonna get up.

265
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,998
You didn't get up yesterday.

266
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,875
Well, throw some more bread
in that bitch.

267
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,044
Sorry, I only make toast
for husbands who have jobs.

268
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,588
Good thing I have a job.

269
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,881
No, you have a laundromat owner

270
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,602
who's terrified
you're gonna smash his face

271
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,593
- into a dryer again.
- Exactly.

272
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:07,987
I'm sure he'd write you
fake paystubs

273
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,811
to give to your parole officer
if I asked him.

274
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:12,265
That's not the point.
We need more money coming in.

275
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,516
All right.

276
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:14,827
Fine, I'll hit the Stop & Shop
on Rush.

277
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:17,312
Hey, no. I don't wanna be
some sad-ass prison widow

278
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,105
catching a bus to Stateville
every weekend.

279
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:20,940
No? Want me to get
some shitty-ass

280
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:22,066
minimum-wage job like you,

281
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,484
hauling boxes
around a warehouse?

282
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:24,569
No.

283
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,821
There aren't many other jobs
left around here, Mick.

284
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,299
It's either Amazon
or digging graves.

285
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:29,717
Until you decide to do
one or the other,

286
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,951
my shitty minimum-wage job
is the only money

287
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:32,952
we got coming in.

288
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:35,371
- And the bills are piling up.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,415
Okay, fine.

290
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,059
I'll start digging into
the wedding present money

291
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,377
instead of saving it
to get our own place.

292
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:44,505
Do what you gotta do, lover.

293
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,507
Me, I'm gonna go
take an ice bath.

294
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,801
My asshole's on fire.

295
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,264
Just not right.

296
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,142
I mean, Julia's only
ten months younger than me.

297
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:57,602
Why do I have to plead guilty

298
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,270
and wear this fuckin'
ankle bracelet

299
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,397
and do all that
community service

300
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,983
when Carl did the exact
same thing with Julia

301
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,443
but they didn't arrest him?

302
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,320
Well, not exactly
the same thing.

303
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:11,991
He wasn't banging Julia
and her mom at the same time.

304
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,160
No, that judge
just hates lesbians.

305
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:16,913
I mean, did you see the way
that he looked at me,

306
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:18,373
at Julia?

307
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:19,707
It was disgust.

308
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:20,917
[Sandy] Mm, I don't know.

309
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,102
He seemed pretty into it to me,

310
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:24,504
especially when, uh,
Julia was describing

311
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:26,756
how you used to go down
on her for hours.

312
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,174
[Debbie scoffs]

313
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:29,717
It's looking good, sweetie.

314
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,594
Okay, it's time
to get ready for school.

315
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:34,639
No more Zoom. Real school.
Let's put your shoes on.

316
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,561
How long do you think it'll be
before the school

317
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,226
shuts down again this time?

318
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,978
I bet a week.

319
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,062
UPS just dropped this off.

320
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:42,855
[gasps] It came!

321
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:44,857
- What is it?
- Gotta put 'em on.

322
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,776
Put what on?

323
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,236
Let's go.

324
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:50,947
Energetic music

325
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:53,533
Hmm. What do you think?

326
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,326
Everything?

327
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,579
Welding, plumbing, carpentry,
household repairs.

328
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,665
[chuckles] I mean, it could
have multiple meanings.

329
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,709
What?

330
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,668
[both laugh]

331
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,254
Liam, no.

332
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:08,006
Hello, Debbie Does Everything?

333
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,425
Um, I've got a rusty pipe.

334
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:11,986
You think you could
shine it up for me?

335
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,761
[scoffs] Look at my truck.

336
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,930
That doesn't tell you
that I'm a handyman?

337
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:19,309
Debbie Does Everything?
My sewer line is clogged.

338
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,770
Can you please come over
and plunge it for me?

339
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:28,526
Upbeat music

340
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,069
Huh.

341
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,450
You see that house
with the "For Sale" sign?

342
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,870
The Sons of Columbus
burned a cross in the yard

343
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,456
the first night
the Jacksons moved in.

344
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:43,249
But the Jacksons were tough.

345
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,544
Used to be sharecroppers
in Alabama.

346
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,505
A racist bonfire
didn't scare them.

347
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,138
Mr. Jackson died of the 'VID
last spring.

348
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,392
He was a janitor over at Mercy.

349
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,605
[slurping]

350
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:08,816
Getting a little dry here,
laddie.

351
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,905
My memory elixir!

352
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,241
Hey...

353
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,453
thanks for caring for what
I have to say, by the way.

354
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:24,207
Well, you're the only person
who responded to my flyer.

355
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,251
[Frank laughs]

356
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:32,632
"Units start as low
as $170,000."

357
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:37,261
Time was, you could've bought
a whole block down here

358
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,013
for that much money.

359
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:42,892
Everything's changing.

360
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,979
The Prius crowd is moving in,

361
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,774
taking advantage of the folks
who lost their jobs

362
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,150
in the Corona hoax.

363
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:53,277
- Oh, hey, girl!
- Hey!

364
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,281
Let's go over by the park.

365
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,617
I'll show you

366
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,371
where the best crack house
in Chicago used to be,

367
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,581
see if any of the old gang's
still around.

368
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:08,668
Bright music

369
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,212
Okay, Franny.

370
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:13,256
Remember, no hugging anybody.

371
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,074
[Debbie] They say anything
about going back

372
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:23,266
to alternating days, yet?

373
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:24,434
[man] Jesus, I hope not.

374
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:27,228
Boss won't let me bring Tommy
to work anymore.

375
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,314
- [Debbie] Who's the new guy?
- Uh, Barry.

376
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,524
[Debbie] What'd he do?

377
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,943
[man, exhales] Rapist, I think.

378
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:35,069
Yeah, he just got out.

379
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,171
His son's kinda cute, though.

380
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,613
He's the spiky-haired one

381
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,133
right there in the Slayer
shirt, you see him?

382
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:41,033
[Barry] Hey, Slash!
Anyone gives you shit,

383
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,910
I just want you
to punch 'em in the throat

384
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,287
like I showed you.

385
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,622
[Debbie] Barry,
you're over the line, man.

386
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,834
The fuck'd you say?

387
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,086
That line...
It's exactly 500 feet

388
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:53,504
from the school's entrance.

389
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,339
If you cross it,
the cops could bust you.

390
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,717
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

391
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,510
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

392
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,971
Debbie, misdemeanor...
Statutory rape.

393
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:04,140
But she was only
ten months younger than me.

394
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:07,226
Barry, statutory two,
with felony.

395
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:09,812
But hey, she looked 20.

396
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,481
Upbeat rock music

397
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:12,607
I love you, Franny.

398
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,942
Remember, no hugging
the other kids.

399
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,214
IOUs?

400
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,548
[water bubbling]

401
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,717
What the fuck is this?

402
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,136
I go to get our money
for the utilities

403
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:45,806
out of our wedding cash,
and all I find is IOUs.

404
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,409
You spent all our money
from the wedding?

405
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,268
Relax, you know I'm good for it.

406
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,938
That's not the point.
It's not your money.

407
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:53,898
It's our money.

408
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,859
Okay, so I spent
some of our money.

409
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,236
On what?

410
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,530
I don't know. Stuff.

411
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,908
It's-it's not your money
to spend.

412
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,035
We decided we were saving it
to get our own place.

413
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,870
No, no. You decided
we were saving it

414
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:08,871
to get our own place.

415
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,182
I said we should
use the wedding money

416
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:11,433
for us to have some fuckin' fun.

417
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,667
Yeah, one of us has certainly

418
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,852
been having some fuckin' fun.

419
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:16,379
Oh, quit being a bitch.
I'll pay it back.

420
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,926
Oh.

421
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:25,054
We're supposed to be making
these decisions together.

422
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:29,850
Okay, so can I use some of
our money to buy a beer?

423
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,310
One beer.

424
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:32,395
Sure. One beer.

425
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:34,188
- Yes.
- Great.

426
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,273
So what about lube?

427
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,483
Can I use our money to buy lube?

428
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,735
You're the one who likes
that expensive strawberry shit.

429
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,320
I'm good with spit.

430
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:44,156
What about your meds?
Ain't cheap.

431
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:46,117
That comin' out of your money
or our money

432
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,470
- or is that coming out of...
- There isn't any your money

433
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,746
or my money,
there's only our money.

434
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:52,873
That's what happens
when you get married.

435
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,041
Sure.

[door clicks opens]

441
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:19,859
[sighs] Okay, I'm off.

442
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,028
You have a good day
with Daddy, all right?

443
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,779
I thought you were gonna
fix the wheel

444
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,114
on that jogger yesterday.

445
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:27,158
Yeah, no.
I got caught up with this.

446
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,035
Okay, well, do it,
and take Fred for a run.

447
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:31,787
Fresh air's supposed to
help babies sleep at night.

448
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,040
And then I need you
to go by the paint store

449
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,625
and pick up four gallons
of this:

450
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,169
- Seafoam Morning Mist.
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,712
And then can you swing by
Voodoo Java

452
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:41,797
and get me a skinny grande
latte with extra foam

453
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,923
and drop it by the salon?

454
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,926
I've got ten clients today,
and I am not gonna make it

455
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,137
without my midday caffeine.

456
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,434
So how much did we pay for this?

457
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,186
It's a '47 Chief.

458
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,854
Mm-hmm.

459
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,232
3 grand.

460
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:01,817
Just 'cause things are tight,

461
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,629
you know, the salon was closed
for a long time,

462
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:07,198
your hours being cut back
at the shop, so...

463
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,991
Voodoo Java?

464
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,453
I know, but it's so good.

465
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,580
Well, you know,
this'll be worth, I mean,

466
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,541
around 12 when I'm done,
maybe even more.

467
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,418
Mm.

468
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,544
- All right.
- Yeah.

469
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,962
- [Tami] Bye.
- Both: Muah.

470
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,381
Don't forget to wear your mask.

471
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,383
I don't wanna
get that shit again.

472
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,550
Ha.

473
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,180
I made a big mistake, son.

474
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:32,348
See, I rented this house

475
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,533
without asking your mommy first,

476
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:36,227
and now I'm basically her bitch.

Gallagher, you ready
for this afternoon, cadet?

480
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,696
- Sir.
- Department's counting on you.

481
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:47,863
I won't let you down.

482
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,490
Don't let that oath mess ya up.

483
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,158
- Sir?
- Yeah, you know,

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,536
the truth, the whole truth,
nothin' but the truth...

485
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:55,121
[chuckles] It's all bullshit.

486
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:57,140
You just tell the judge what
they need to hear to convict.

487
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:58,624
The bastard's guilty as hell.

488
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,084
Roger that.

489
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,337
I'm, uh, I'm aware
your academy application

490
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:06,048
included several irregularities.

491
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,675
Irregularities, sir?

492
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:10,970
Your age, your IQ score.

493
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:13,556
But with the loss of so many
officers to the 'rona,

494
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,683
the bosses are willing
to put you on the street,

495
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,285
as long as you do
the right thing today.

496
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,019
- I will, sir.
- It's not a tough call

497
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,229
to give you a badge.

498
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:22,648
You're number one in your class
in firearms,

499
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,316
choke holds, baton beatings.

500
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:26,235
Well, what about
my classroom work, sir?

501
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:28,404
You know, state laws,
criminal statutes?

502
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:29,488
I'm kind of a slow reader.

503
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,614
- Dead last.
- [sighs]

504
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,217
But, hey, you don't have
to be an Einstein

505
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:33,868
to wear the blue.

506
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,494
Bustin' heads is a man's job,

507
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:37,538
and you are a natural born
ass kicker.

508
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,082
So you go in that courtroom
this afternoon and kick ass.

509
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,917
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

510
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,461
Rock music

511
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,922
I like making bad decisions

512
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:49,467
That's right, Jamie.
Keep those ropes movin'.

513
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,178
Your rhomboids are loving it.

514
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,846
Back straight.

515
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:55,139
Engage those abs.

516
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,515
That's it, Celeste.

517
00:21:56,557 --> 00:21:58,058
[growls] That's two more laps.

518
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,560
You got this.

519
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:01,562
All right, listen up,
kombucha drinkers.

520
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:03,898
The Alibi has special prices

521
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:06,066
for all your cannabis needs.

522
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:07,067
Sore muscles?

523
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:08,795
Anxiety 'cause you're not
getting enough likes

524
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,447
for your most recent
adorable puppy post?

525
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:13,491
The Alibi's got
two-for-one deals

526
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,409
on all spliffs
for anyone wearing

527
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:16,660
a Kev Fit t-shirt,

528
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,388
which are for sale
right over there on that tire.

529
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:20,581
What the hell are you doing,
Dash?

530
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:22,041
Get your overeducated ass up

531
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:24,627
and give me another 50 mailbox
presses.

532
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,922
Jesus, man. Are you all right?

533
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,465
It's my crypto.

534
00:22:29,507 --> 00:22:30,758
Your what?

535
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,218
My Bitcoin.

536
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,844
It's down 30, and I was using it

537
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,846
to leverage my Tether
and my Ethereum.

538
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,766
I have no idea
what you just said.

539
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:42,061
[sighs] Oil futures gutted
my portfolio last spring.

540
00:22:42,102 --> 00:22:44,688
So if there's another
two-point drop on my cryptos,

541
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,899
I'll have to cover
a margin call.

542
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:48,025
So that's bad.

543
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,110
It's fucking Death Star
Order of the Sith

544
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,905
Korriban invasion
exploding planet bad, man!

545
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:55,658
I'll-I'll have to call
my-my dad.

546
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:58,744
- I got you. Come on.
- Okay.

547
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:01,831
Acid rock continues

548
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:08,879
[knocks in
"shave and a haircut" rhythm]

549
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:20,057
[door hinges squeak,
door closes]

550
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:25,521
Blue Dream. Yellow Sunflower.

551
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:28,399
Purple Haze. Our five-year-old
daughter Gemma

552
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,942
rolled those herself.

553
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:32,278
- [sighs]
- Pink Peppermint.

554
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,654
Mama's Mocha.

555
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:36,198
Gorilla... although,
I don't recommend Gorilla

556
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,449
for a beginner like you.

557
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:38,409
Oh, I'm not a beginner.

558
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,636
I smoked a lot of weed
in college.

559
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,579
College weed,
not the same thing.

560
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,247
Where'd you go to college?

561
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,958
- Kenyon.
- Where the fuck is Kenyon?

562
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,460
- Ohio.
- [scoffs]

563
00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:50,963
[laughs] Yeah, you're a rookie.

564
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:53,048
Stick with the gummies
and the baked goods.

565
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,552
V baked these brownies
herself this morning.

566
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:57,761
Ooh, I love brownies.

567
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,030
You've had these kind
of brownies?

568
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,431
No, but they look delicious.

569
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,057
They have a kick.
You gotta make sure

570
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,602
you have someplace safe to sit
after you eat one.

571
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:05,686
One brownie?

572
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:08,355
Jesus, potheads
are a bunch of pussies.

573
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:10,065
I knocked back 15 tequila shots

574
00:24:10,107 --> 00:24:13,277
at my nephew's weird socially
distant wedding last week,

575
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,362
and was fine driving home.

576
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:16,280
Fifteen?

577
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,674
You check the grill of your car
the next morning

578
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:20,075
to make sure there wasn't blood
and hanks of hair?

579
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:22,161
What's a socially distanced
wedding like?

580
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:23,287
Stupid.

581
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,705
It was one person per pew,

582
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,540
and the bride and groom
kissed each other

583
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:27,541
with their masks on.

584
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,727
Like they're not just
gonna go back

585
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:30,669
to the Honeymoon Hotel
and bang boots.

586
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:34,715
Okay, weed is for old hippies
and cancer patients.

587
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:36,050
Real men drink.

588
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:39,887
Taylor Swift over there needs
a shot of JB, not gummies.

589
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:43,390
I-I tried weed when Grammy
had some for her glaucoma.

590
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:44,600
Made me sleepy.

591
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:47,102
Aw, this isn't your
grammy's weed, Kermit.

592
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:48,604
Glaucoma weed is a Prius.

593
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:50,856
This is a Ferrari at Daytona
weed.

594
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:52,191
[banging on door]

595
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:53,734
We're closed.

596
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,027
[banging continues]

597
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,655
City of Chicago
says all bars are closed

598
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,282
until further notice.

599
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,952
[banging rapidly]

600
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:04,304
Go, go, go, go, go!
Hide in the back.

601
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:07,373
- This is what we practiced.
- We are absolutely complying

602
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:09,667
with the mayor's
very smart decision

603
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,087
to close all bars and taverns.
[banging continues]

604
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:17,883
frantic rock music

605
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:18,676
[door opens]

606
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,678
Distractions all around

607
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,262
- [Frank] What's up?
- Oh, my...

608
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,264
- The fuck, Kev?
- Come on.

609
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,016
Hail 'rona survivors.

610
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,726
What-where is everyone?

611
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:29,228
Fuck, Frank?

612
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,747
You were supposed to use
the secret knock

613
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:31,939
on the door in the gym.

614
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:32,898
What? No, no.

615
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,317
I heard somewhere
bars are open again.

616
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,318
Three weeks ago, maybe.

617
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,154
Mayor shut us all down again
on Tuesday.

618
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:41,740
Well, who the hell
can keep track?

619
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:44,159
And excuse me,
but fuck the mayor.

620
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:46,996
He has no authority
to tread upon my rights

621
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:48,372
as a free American male

622
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:51,375
to drink my favorite brew
in the tavern of my choice.

623
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:55,212
The mayor is a she, and she has
every right to do it, and has.

624
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,548
Come on out, everyone.
It's just Frank.

625
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,884
[laughs] There they are.
Do you want to...

626
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,028
[Veronica] False alarm,
everybody.

627
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:03,303
Uh, this is-this is Brad.

628
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,723
He's making a major film
about me.

629
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,932
Actually, my name is Alan.

630
00:26:06,974 --> 00:26:10,561
I'm a graduate student
at Lake Forest.

631
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,355
Holy shit.

632
00:26:14,565 --> 00:26:16,567
What the hell is that?

633
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,154
Have I finally arrived at Mecca
after a long pilgrimage?

634
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,031
Hands off, Frank.
We're not offering credit

635
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:23,198
on cannabis products.

636
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,366
Payment up front only.

637
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:27,536
Lake Forest? The hell are you
doing all the way down here?

638
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:29,079
My doctoral dissertation

639
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,831
is on neighborhoods
in transition

640
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,291
due to the economic displacement

641
00:26:32,332 --> 00:26:33,417
caused by the pandemic.

642
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,020
[Veronica] Well, you've come
to the right place.

643
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:37,337
Lots of economic displacement
and transition

644
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:38,797
going on around here.

645
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,216
[Frank]
Gentrification, my friends.

646
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:43,510
The ten percenters
gobbling up what's left

647
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:47,181
of the working man's dreams
when he's down and out.

648
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:51,185
Felled by a tiny,
lifeless microbe.

649
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,812
We're the last of the Mohicans.

650
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:56,607
Chicago aboriginals
struggling to preserve

651
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,775
a vanishing culture.

652
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,544
[Alan] Actually, there were
aboriginal cultures

653
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,236
here before us.

654
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,030
The Miami
and the Kickapoo tribes.

655
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,198
Also Gallaghers.

656
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,742
Kev, could we?

657
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:10,454
Oh, shit, I... pay the man.

658
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,082
- Do you take Venmo?
- Hell no.

659
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:15,959
[exhales] Holy shit.

660
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,252
[thud]

661
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,422
- Gorilla?
- Yep.

662
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:22,549
Ohio. [laughter]

663
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:24,968
[banging]

664
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,845
Hey, Mrs. Lionetti,
I'm almost done.

665
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:28,764
Leave. Now.

666
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,432
Huh? I'm almost finished.

667
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,643
- Seven?
- Seven what?

668
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,728
She was seven years old?

669
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,562
Who was seven years old?

670
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:36,939
If my Tony were still alive,

671
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,191
he'd take you down to the lake,
shoot you,

672
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:40,400
and push you in for the fish.

673
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:41,610
What are you talking about?

674
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:44,780
I got a notification.
I checked the website.

675
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:47,699
- What website?
- The sex offender website.

676
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,993
And your picture is on it.

677
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,995
This is you, right?

678
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,082
Upbeat music

679
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,640
I was off and runnin'

680
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:15,394
I never saw it comin'

681
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,938
But sometimes
all the moves that you make

682
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,483
Start to shake
all the meaning from before

683
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,156
I was up and comin'

684
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:30,951
I never stop for nothin'

685
00:28:30,993 --> 00:28:33,996
But then she ripped
my heart from my chest

686
00:28:34,037 --> 00:28:35,998
Hey, Hassan, coffee still fresh?

687
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,332
Four hours old.

688
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:38,542
That's good enough.

689
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:41,128
Oh, oh, oh

690
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,921
Gimme one sec.

691
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,677
Oh, oh, oh

692
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,346
Hella sweet

693
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:54,183
- That still a buck?
- Yep.

694
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:57,269
Here you go.

695
00:28:57,311 --> 00:28:58,854
Thank you.

696
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:09,573
$5.49? Jesus.

697
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,117
Hella sweet

698
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,206
Oh, oh, oh

699
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:19,625
Hella sweet

700
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:27,090
He spent all our wedding money
on God knows what.

701
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,092
Isn't marriage supposed to
be about communication?

702
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,428
Compromise? Agreed upon
mutual fuckin' goals?

703
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,489
How's that supposed to happen
when one person in the marriage

704
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:35,241
just goes off and does
whatever the hell he wants

705
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:37,559
without telling the other
person what he's doing?

706
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:39,853
Sounds just like me
and my first husband, Juan.

707
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:40,771
No communication.

708
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,248
[Ian] He sits around
the house all day

709
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,858
like we're not in the worst
economy since the Depression.

710
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,485
Says we're still
on our honeymoon.

711
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:47,653
How long you been married?

712
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:49,529
Six months.

713
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:51,114
What's he expect us to live on?

714
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,699
The bills are piling up.

715
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:54,117
[coworker] Marriage is hard.

716
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,512
You should've worked that shit
out before you tied the knot.

717
00:29:56,536 --> 00:29:59,790
Once you're married,
it's already too late.

718
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,212
Upbeat music

719
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,686
Let me show you somethin'

720
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:21,770
It's on the scene

721
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:24,189
A new wave, 360 degrees

722
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:25,691
Above the power

723
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:26,942
The power of me

724
00:30:26,984 --> 00:30:29,736
Me as in he, and she, and we

725
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:30,946
Yeah, you got the news

726
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:33,240
There's something in the air

727
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:34,533
There's something in the air

728
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:39,663
[door opens]

729
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,540
Thanks, Teri.

730
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:48,839
- Hey.
- Hi.

731
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,091
Look at you.
You fixed the jogger.

732
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,968
Yeah.

733
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,346
Hello, baby of mine. Hi.

734
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,142
Wow. You're sweating.

735
00:31:00,183 --> 00:31:02,561
- I did five miles.
- [chuckles]

736
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:06,148
[gasps] Thank God.
You're my savior.

737
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:09,318
And, uh, two packets
raw sugar, right?

738
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,029
- Yes. Thanks.
- Here you go.

739
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,823
Did you go by
the paint store yet?

740
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,658
I'm heading there next.

741
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,662
Oh. Where's my foam?

742
00:31:20,704 --> 00:31:23,540
Oh, uh, you know,
it must've gotten

743
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,168
all mixed in, you know,
when I was running.

744
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:28,003
Oh.

745
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,010
Oh, God.

746
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,846
Delicious.

747
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:40,098
Thank you.

748
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,016
Both: Muah.

749
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:42,684
Oh. [inhales sharply]

750
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:48,857
[laughs]

751
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:53,653
Seven! It says Julia
was seven years old, not 17.

752
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,905
[laughs]

753
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,073
It's not fuckin' funny.

754
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,700
Everybody's gonna think
I'm a child molester.

755
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,660
Well, you sort of are.

756
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:03,789
It's got my address, my social
security number, my email.

757
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,956
God damn it.

758
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:06,267
I'm lucky if
the neighborhood moms

759
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,377
don't show up out front tonight
with torches

760
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:10,837
to hang me from the playground
swing set.

761
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,423
Okay, it's probably
not that big of a deal.

762
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,966
Look at all these other guys.

763
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:17,344
- What?
- All these little dots

764
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,388
on the map are sex offenders
in the area.

765
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:20,972
[Debbie] Jesus.

766
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:22,182
There must be 100 of them.

767
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:24,393
What the fuck
is wrong with people?

768
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,396
Hey, that's Mr. Mosier
down the block.

769
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:29,689
I knew it. He was always
way too into Halloween.

770
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:31,775
[Sandy] Nice picture, though.

771
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,151
[scoffs]

772
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:35,153
You're sexy.

773
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:38,031
I mean, look at that cleavage.

774
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:42,077
- Yeah, I do look pretty hot.
- Mm-hmm.

775
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,620
Oh, shit.

776
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,747
Who the hell is
gonna hire me now?

777
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,294
I told Lieutenant Rucker
I was undercover,

778
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,171
but he said I wasn't undercover.

779
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:57,509
But I was.
Which is why I'm here today.

780
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:00,929
What were you asked to do in
that house, Mr. Gallagher?

781
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:03,348
[clears throat]
Empty my bowels, ma'am.

782
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,183
So, defecate?

783
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:07,352
[sighs] I did not defecate.

784
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:09,521
I took a shit.

785
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:11,690
[clears throat]
Can you point to the man

786
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:13,608
who told you to take that shit?

787
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,777
That's him, ma'am.

788
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,028
Please let the record show

789
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,949
Mr. Gallagher identified
the defendant, Otis Grange.

790
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,788
Mr. Winston.

791
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,376
So, Mr. Gallagher,

792
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:33,128
you're a police cadet,
are you not?

793
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,504
Yes, sir.

794
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,631
And you're 19 years old?

795
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:37,716
Almost 20, sir.

796
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:40,051
And how exactly
did you get a spot

797
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:44,723
at the Chicago Police Academy
at such a tender age?

798
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:47,851
Tender? [scoffs]
I'm not tender, sir.

799
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:48,977
I work out.

800
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,271
- I can bench 240.
- [Winston] Good for you.

801
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:54,065
Did anyone promise you a spot
at the police academy

802
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:56,526
in exchange for your testimony
against my client today?

803
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,154
Sir, if you were to work
garbage duty

804
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:00,906
in Chicago for six months,

805
00:34:00,947 --> 00:34:02,699
you'd deserve a spot, too.

806
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,909
Is that a no?

807
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,912
Garbage in Chicago is dirty,
sir.

808
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:08,371
Very dirty.

809
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,290
So no quid pro quo.

810
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:11,374
Squid pro what?

811
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,085
Were you told that you could
enter the police academy

812
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:17,422
two years early
in exchange for your testimony?

813
00:34:17,464 --> 00:34:20,091
And let me remind you
that you have taken an oath

814
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:22,010
in this court to tell the truth,

815
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,638
and only the truth,
so help you God.

816
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,972
No, sir.

817
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:27,641
I got into the academy
because they know

818
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:30,227
I'm gonna be
a great police officer.

819
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,396
You understand, Mr. Gallagher,

820
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,024
that lying under oath
is perjury,

821
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:38,693
punishable by up to five years
in state prison.

822
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:40,570
Are you calling me a liar, sir?

823
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:43,323
Why? Because I grew up poor
on the South Side?

824
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,326
Because my father is a drunk
and my mother was a junkie?

825
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:47,786
Because I'm not as smart as you

826
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:50,664
and you can humiliate me
using big words I don't know.

827
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:53,166
I got into the academy
because they know

828
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,543
when we roll up on a gun fight,

829
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,503
I'll be the one running
towards the shooting,

830
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:57,420
not away from it.

831
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,881
They know when
a 911 call comes in

832
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:02,717
and it's some bastard scumbag
pistol-whipping

833
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:05,011
a little girl, trying to steal
her pink bicycle,

834
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:08,557
that I'll be there, ready to
take a bullet in the face.

835
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:11,476
Upbeat music

836
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,732
O... kay.

837
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:21,528
There you go. Hey, man.

838
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,321
- [Lip] Yo, Flavio.
- Hey.

839
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:24,549
I didn't know you worked here.

840
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:26,050
I thought you were
still at Rowdy's Chicken.

841
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:27,701
Yeah, yeah,
Rowdy's closed for good, man.

842
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,804
I survived the first shutdown,
but not the second one.

843
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,455
So my uncle got me a job here.

844
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,456
He's afraid of my mom.

845
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,000
We all are. She drinking again?

846
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,710
Yeah. Waving that gun around.

847
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,295
- [Lip] Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

848
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,254
That your kid?

849
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:42,632
Uh, yeah, that's Fred.
Oh, he's sleeping.

850
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,634
Hey, look, you got, uh,

851
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,762
this Seafoam Morning Mist?

852
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:49,889
Uh, sure, yeah.
The Monticello Collection.

853
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,017
Supposed to be the colors
Thomas Jefferson created

854
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:53,101
for Monticello.

855
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:54,311
No kidding. Jefferson, huh?

856
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,812
Yeah, it's probably bullshit,

857
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,606
but the PBR crowd eats it up.

858
00:35:57,647 --> 00:35:59,941
- It's pricey, though.
- Yeah? How pricey?

859
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:01,067
Uh, how many you need?

860
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:02,611
I don't know, four gallons.

861
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:04,738
Set you back a little over
a hundie with tax.

862
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,406
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

863
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:08,617
Um...

864
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,619
Hey, what about these?

865
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,330
[Flavio] Paint the yoga mat
ladies buy and then return

866
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,251
'cause they say it didn't
match the sample book.

867
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,543
- Got any blues?
- Mm, probably.

868
00:36:21,254 --> 00:36:22,964
Mm, hmm...

869
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:24,758
[Lip] Hey.

870
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:27,052
Oh, wait, what about this one?

871
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:28,803
Ah, no, they're not the same.

872
00:36:28,845 --> 00:36:30,013
Ah, it's close enough.

873
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,931
You got another one
of these blues?

874
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,558
Uh...

875
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

876
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:37,312
[Lip] All right, great.

877
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:39,147
Now we just need two more.

878
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:40,857
That's not bad.

879
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,526
Hey, what do you think
about those?

880
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,986
And blend together in the mixer,

881
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:46,213
[hits can] pour the mixed paint

882
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,322
back into the cans.

883
00:36:47,364 --> 00:36:48,924
You write Seafoam Morning Mist
on those cans,

884
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:50,718
there's an extra tenner in it
for you, all right?

885
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,243
- Deal.
- Thank you, thank you.

886
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:53,244
Thank you.

887
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:56,498
Hey, we're all set, okay, bud?

888
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:58,833
We're almost outta here,
all right?

889
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:04,172
You check to make sure
he's still breathing?

890
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:06,549
I think he wet his pants.

891
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,777
Where the hell'd you get that?

892
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:10,387
[Frank] On the floor.
Joe College didn't finish it.

893
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,306
Pretty good shit.
I'd give it four puffs.

894
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:16,893
- [woman] How's the Blue Dream?
- Mm.

895
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,187
"You'll float on
a downy bank of clouds

896
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,147
on a bright summer's day."

897
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:22,524
The Pink Peppermint?

898
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:24,150
"Hints of an herb garden,

899
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:26,319
Alice in Wonderland,
and the Mad Hatter."

900
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:27,838
[woman] What flavor
are the gummies, lime?

901
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,632
- [Kevin] Mm-hmm.
- Jesus, where the fuck are we?

902
00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:31,866
Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory?

903
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,827
What about the Purple Haze?
Is it really strong?

904
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:34,929
Uh, I'm not too sure
about that one.

905
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,204
We just got that one in.

906
00:37:36,246 --> 00:37:38,081
But our daughter Gemma...
She's five...

907
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:39,499
- She rolled those herself.
- Oh.

908
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,418
Maybe I could be of some help.

909
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,336
Why don't you order one of each,

910
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:45,213
and I can sample them for you

911
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:49,008
and then rate them on my world-
renowned Gallagher Puff Scale?

912
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,926
Puff Scale?

913
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,804
One puff being a glass of rosé

914
00:37:52,846 --> 00:37:54,556
on a warm, summery day.

915
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:57,267
Five puffs being you wake up
naked in an alley

916
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,369
with something
stuck in your ass,

917
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,145
no idea where the fuck you are.
[laughs]

918
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:01,855
Leave the customers alone,
Frank.

919
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:04,566
Two Pink Peppermints
and ten gummies, please.

920
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:05,942
[Tommy]
Christ. Do we really need

921
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,653
another legal
intoxicating substance?

922
00:38:08,695 --> 00:38:12,490
- That shit's a gateway drug.
- [Frank laughs] Weed?

923
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:16,077
We're 20 years into
the next century, Nancy Reagan.

924
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,372
It's really a question
of personal freedom.

925
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:21,291
Why is it any
of your damn business

926
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,252
if I choose to smoke a fat one
after dinner?

927
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:28,298
Or shoot up in the privacy
of my local Denny's bathroom?

928
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,384
It's my life.
My body, my choice.

929
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:32,778
[Veronica] Your problem,
Tommy, is you think

930
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,179
knocking back boilermakers

931
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,930
while your ass
is stuck on that stool

932
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:37,390
is something
that all red-blooded

933
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:39,601
white American males
are supposed to do,

934
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:43,271
while smoking weed
is a Black folk thing.

935
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:45,231
The only reason
why marijuana's been illegal

936
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:46,625
for the last hundred years
is because

937
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:48,568
poor Black people
in the ghetto were smoking it.

938
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,905
Marijuana prosecution
was criminalized racism.

939
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:55,158
Now that white people decided
they like smoking it,

940
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,493
it has to be made legal.

941
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,828
Can't make lily white kids
go to prison

942
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,497
for having a couple of blunts.

943
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,833
That's it.
That's how we stop it.

944
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,627
We've been getting gentrified

945
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:09,380
because it's gotten
too safe down here.

946
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:11,633
The murder rate
was at an all-time low

947
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:14,469
before the 'VID, right?

948
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:17,388
Rich people weren't afraid
to move down here.

949
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,392
But now that we've had
a few good riots,

950
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:23,353
burned a few bougie stores,

951
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,189
I'll bet you the gentrifiers
are gettin' nervous.

952
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:30,902
All we gotta do is make
the Yards dangerous again.

953
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:34,197
Make sure the murder rate
is rising.

954
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,406
Spill some blood.

955
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:37,283
What? We have to shoot people?

956
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:39,452
No, no, not just any people.

957
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:40,537
The right people.

958
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:44,415
Shoot a couple of Millennials,
like Alan here.

959
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:47,877
Oh, ho, the gentrifiers
would be on the first Uber

960
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,420
back to Bucktown.
[scattered laughs]

961
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:51,714
It's a little extreme,
don't you think?

962
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,300
Well, you don't
have to kill him.

963
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:57,095
Just wound them.
Get on the news.

964
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:59,973
Make the South Side
dangerous again.

965
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:01,683
That's the Chicago I loved.

966
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:02,892
A lot of bleeding.

967
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,103
Well, I should
probably get going.

968
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:08,481
Oh, hey!
It was so great meeting you.

969
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:11,734
- [Veronica] Take care!
- Not that door. Back door.

Don't be a stranger.

He sure acts like he's having
a pretty great time.

973
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:22,954
Hey, you know, we should try it.

974
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:25,248
No thanks. I'm not a loser.

975
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,333
It's great for
the immune system.

976
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,295
Also the libido.
I've had epic sex on weed.

977
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:33,798
If you don't wanna smoke it,
why not try a brownie?

978
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,301
[Veronica] They're all-natural
and delicious, too.

979
00:40:36,342 --> 00:40:39,053
Who doesn't love a brownie?

980
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:41,097
Okay, one brownie.

981
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,892
- Tommy?
- Nope.

982
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:49,856
Mmm, these are delicious.

983
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:53,526
Come on. What are you, chicken?

984
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:55,486
Chicken?
A-are we in second grade?

Oh, I'm bang, bang,

He's going down.

00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,353
Congratulations, Gallagher.

1006

He'll be up all night later.
He's teething.

1007

Have you tried Frank's whiskey
trick with the tub?

1008
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,712
I'm pretty sure that's
considered bad parenting now.

1009
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:58,132
I'm pretty sure that was
considered bad parenting then.

1010
00:42:02,095 --> 00:42:04,013
What's up?

1011
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:08,476
Oh, the whole [sighs] marriage
thing is harder than it looks.

1012
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:10,311
Do you and Tami
share your money?

1013
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:12,605
We're not married.

1014
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:14,232
You say so.

1015
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:15,775
So how do you handle your cash?

1016
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:18,319
Do you put it all together,
or just some of it, or what?

1017
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:19,821
Here, hold this wrench,
will you?

1018
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:21,239
Yeah.

1019
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,866
The money? Uh...

1020
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,828
Uh, I guess Tami
kinda runs things.

1021
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,789
So you just give her
all your money and that's it?

1022
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:32,792
We don't really have
enough money to worry about it.

1023
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,836
But, uh, truth is,

1024
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:37,171
I don't really care much
about money.

1025
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:39,340
And she cares a lot.

1026
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,276
Me and you, we never had
much of anything growing up,

1027
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,052
and we always managed
to get by, right?

1028
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,596
- Barely.
- Lemme see.

1029
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:48,683
Tami, she always had enough.

1030
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:52,603
Ever since this pandemic,
she's worried we won't.

1031
00:42:52,645 --> 00:42:54,605
It's weird how people with money

1032
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:55,833
are always afraid of losing it

1033
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:58,860
and all poor people can
think about is spending it.

1034
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:00,236
[grunts]

1035
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,489
But do you decide what you're
gonna spend money on together?

1036
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,408
Well, there's really not much
to decide.

1037
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,537
We're, uh, pretty much broke
at the end of the month.

1038
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:11,539
Why?

1039
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:13,666
You and Mick having
some money troubles?

1040
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:16,669
Yeah, I make it, and he doesn't.

1041
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:19,732
[Lip] What, you didn't wanna
talk about any of that stuff

1042
00:43:19,756 --> 00:43:20,798
before you got married?

1043
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,801
I figured we just agreed
on how things were gonna work.

1044
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:25,845
Guess not, huh?

1045
00:43:25,887 --> 00:43:27,930
Yeah. It's my mistake, I guess.

1046
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,808
Well, gotta talk about it.

1047
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:35,980
Right? You compromise,
all that couple shit.

1048
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:39,525
Look, you, uh, love each other,

1049
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,653
Right?

1050
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:45,531
- Yes.
- Okay, so,

1051
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:47,867
gotta get on the same page
about how this marriage thing

1052
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:49,744
is supposed to work.

1053
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:52,848
You sure I can't
just get him to do

1054
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:54,874
everything the way I want?

1055
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,335
Pretty sure, yeah.

1056
00:44:00,588 --> 00:44:02,066
Look, we didn't have parents
who could show us

1057
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,051
what a relationship
was supposed to look like.

1058
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:07,386
We gotta figure out that shit
as we go.

at the well-child checkup.

take the mugshot

with my cleavage off the site

1064
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:24,362
and get Julia's age right?

1065
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:27,073
Yes, she was 17, not seven.

1066
00:44:27,115 --> 00:44:30,118
Well, then check
the damn court records!

1067
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:35,540

probation if she'd been seven?

Really?

1069

diddled a seven-year-old?

correct Julia's age,

1073

about the mugshot.

In the air tonight

1129
00:47:53,154 --> 00:47:54,488
[zipping]

1130
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:55,781
Oh, Lord

1131
00:47:55,823 --> 00:47:57,867
[door opens]

1132
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:01,078
And I've been waiting
for this moment

1133
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,248
For all my life

1134
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,543
We need to be honest
with each other, all right?

1135
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,462
No more secrets.

1136
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:11,005
- No more secrets at all?
- No.

1137
00:48:11,047 --> 00:48:13,215
Nothing but truth.

1138
00:48:15,134 --> 00:48:16,903
We should've talked about what
we expected from each other

1139
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,471
before we got married,
but we didn't,

1140
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:20,848
- so now we have to.
- Look, if this is about

1141
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,267
the wedding money,
I'm gonna pay it back, man.

1142
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:26,145
Yes, but it's also about...

1143
00:48:26,187 --> 00:48:29,857
It's about what we want
the marriage to be.

1144
00:48:29,899 --> 00:48:31,817
We need some rules.

1145
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,110
Yeah, I'm not great with rules.

1146
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:36,238
A mutual understanding
of how shit is gonna work.

1147
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,366
What does that mean?

1148
00:48:38,407 --> 00:48:40,409
Like, how we spend money
together,

1149
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:44,246
joint purchases, monogamy.

1150
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,873
The hell is that?

1151
00:48:45,915 --> 00:48:48,709
Not fucking other people.

1152
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:50,378
Oh.

1153
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,464
We just talking fucking,

1154
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:56,258
or are we talking
about blow jobs, too?

1155
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,552
I think blow jobs should count,
yeah.

1156
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,515
Right.

1157
00:49:05,434 --> 00:49:08,312
You really never wanna
fuck anybody else?

1158
00:49:08,354 --> 00:49:11,190
I mean, I... if I'm being honest,

1159
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:13,901
I'm not really sure either.

1160
00:49:13,943 --> 00:49:15,903
It's just kinda hard to imagine

1161
00:49:15,945 --> 00:49:17,863
that I'm never, ever gonna wanna

1162
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:20,282
fuck anyone else, you know?

1163
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,493
But I also know I...

1164
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:24,453
definitely don't want you
to fuck anyone else.

1165
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:25,955
Well, hold on, that just means

1166
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,307
you wanna be able
to fuck other people

1167
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,267
but you don't want me to be
able to fuck other people.

1168
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,419
That doesn't sound fair.

1169
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,713
Okay, so we're both monogamous

1170
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:36,066
or we both get to fuck
other people.

1171
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,093
- Yeah. That sounds fair.
- Mm-hmm.

1172
00:49:39,135 --> 00:49:41,804
Upbeat music

1173
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:45,266
What do you wanna do?

1174
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:46,267
What do you wanna do?

1175
00:49:46,308 --> 00:49:48,436
I asked you first.

1176
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:52,648
I don't know.

1177
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,900
Okay, uh, I'll tell you what.

1178
00:49:56,152 --> 00:49:58,154
We'll both each write down
what we want,

1179
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:02,491
then we'll turn our answers
over at the same time.

1180
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:04,702
Great.

1181
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,621
I saw you walkin'
down the street

1182
00:50:07,663 --> 00:50:10,291
With your headphones on
I could hear your beat

1183
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:13,419
Like, ba da, ba da ba da

1184
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:15,963
Ba da, ba da ba da

1185
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:18,299
Ba da, ba da ba da

1186
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,968
Oh, yeah

1187
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,929
- Ba da, ba da ba da
- I'm gonna eat you

1188
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:25,598
Ba da, ba da ba da

1189
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:26,891
I'm gonna eat you

1190
00:50:26,932 --> 00:50:30,644
- Ba da, ba da ba da - Oh, yeah

1191
00:50:30,686 --> 00:50:32,980
So we both turn 'em over
on three.

1192
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:36,901
One, two, three.

1193
00:50:36,942 --> 00:50:38,486
Hey

1194
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:39,546
Hey, turn your
fuckin' paper over.

1195
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,755
I think I spelled
monogamy wrong.

1196
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:42,090
- I spelled monogamy wrong!
- Will you let me...

1197
00:50:42,114 --> 00:50:43,949
I spelled it wrong!
Oh, shit, he-ey-ey-ey!

1198
00:50:43,991 --> 00:50:46,619
[chuckling]
Look who's a real cop now.

1199
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,954
Yep. Badge, gun, and everything.

1200
00:50:48,996 --> 00:50:50,164
- You graduated?
- Tomorrow.

1201
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:51,516
But they gave us
the uniforms today

1202
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,851
so we can wear 'em
to the ceremony.

1203
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,419
[Mickey] Fuckin' fantastic.
No more parking tickets for me.

1204
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:57,880
You don't have a car, dumbass.

1205
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,340
- [Ian] Hey.
- [Debbie] Hey.

1206
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:00,984
- [Carl] Where y'all goin'?
- Lip and Tami's.

1207
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:03,135
Gotta finish drywalling
the living room.

1208
00:51:03,177 --> 00:51:04,970
Hey, y'all get enough chicken?

1209
00:51:05,012 --> 00:51:07,723
Two buckets of extra crispy.

1210
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,142
You two coming or what?

1211
00:51:10,184 --> 00:51:11,495
- Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
- [Ian] Uh...

1212
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:12,978
Yeah.

1213
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,064
Let's do it.

1214
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:19,026
Upbeat music

1215
00:51:19,068 --> 00:51:20,361
Hey!

1216
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:24,615
[chatter]

1217
00:51:24,657 --> 00:51:25,616
[door opens]

1218
00:51:25,658 --> 00:51:27,219
[Kevin] How am I supposed
to open the door

1219
00:51:27,243 --> 00:51:28,762
- when I don't have any hands?
- [Lip] Yo!

1220
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,055
- [Kevin] What's up, Lip?
- [Lip] My man.

1221
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,831
- Hi! We have arrived!
- [Lip] Hi! What the fuck?

1222
00:51:32,873 --> 00:51:33,749
- [Sandy] Hi.
- Yo! Hey.

1223
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:34,708
- [Debbie] We made it.
- Hi.

1224
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,961
[overlapping chatter]

1225
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,379
Look at you.

1226
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,005
- Check it out.
- Wow. Nice.

1227
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:41,525
[Ian] Hey, gimme a hammer.
I wanna break some shit.

1228
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:43,300
- [Lip] You wanna help?
- I guess so.

1229
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:44,343
There you go.

1230
00:51:44,385 --> 00:51:46,428
- Yo.
- Yo.

1231
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,472
Hey, you guys talk?

1232
00:51:48,514 --> 00:51:52,142
Uh... sort of.

1233
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:55,104
- Yeah?
- Yeah. We'll figure it out.

1234
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,274
[upbeat rock playing over radio]

1235
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:02,778
Hey.

1236
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,239
[laughs] Uh, hey.

1237
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:07,259
- [Lip] Everything good?
- Yeah, yeah.

1238
00:52:07,283 --> 00:52:10,411
All right. Hey, I wanna
show you something.

1239
00:52:10,452 --> 00:52:12,246
Yeah?

1240
00:52:13,622 --> 00:52:15,291
What do you think?

1241
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,917
Uh, it's beautiful.

1242
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:19,461
Definitely worth
the extra money.

1243
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,879
Absolutely.

1244
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:22,965
Okay, I am starving.

1245
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:26,468
[chatter]

1246
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,262
[Veronica] Hey, Tami.

1247
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,307
Hey.

1248
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,726
Hey, Fran, you wanna
help Uncle Carl?

1249
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:35,060
Lose your doubts

1250
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:38,063
Holding on, let it out

1251
00:52:38,105 --> 00:52:39,607
This is the beginning

1252
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:41,817
[Frank] This is my Chicago,

1253
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,194
the Chicago I love.

1254
00:52:44,236 --> 00:52:46,822
Lip's got a baby now.

1255
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:49,950
Debbie's got a kid
and a rap sheet.

1256
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:51,827
Carl's gonna be a cop.

1257
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:53,621
Didn't see that coming.

1258
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:55,956
Ian's married to a Milkovich.

1259
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:59,376
[chuckles]
Really didn't see that coming.

1260
00:52:59,418 --> 00:53:01,920
Family looking after family.

1261
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:04,131
That's the South Side way.

1262
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:05,507
The Gallagher way.

1263
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:10,012
It's a long walk back
from yesterday

1264
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:14,391
Yeah, this is our Chicago.

1265
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:17,603
It's disappearing fast.

1266
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:19,813
But before it's gone,

1267
00:53:19,855 --> 00:53:23,275
we're gonna enjoy
every fuckin' minute of it.

1268
00:53:24,652 --> 00:53:26,320
We're comin' home

1269
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:31,325
We're comin' home

1270
00:53:38,457 --> 00:53:40,125
[chuckles under breath]

1271
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,004
[door opens]

1272
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:47,091
Are you Hot Lesbian
Convict Lady?

1273
00:53:47,132 --> 00:53:49,843
Would you, um,
like to buy some cookies,

1274
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:52,471
Hot Lesbian Convict Lady?

1275
00:53:52,513 --> 00:53:55,349
I'm only seven. [both laugh]

1276
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:57,191
The bigger, the better,
the better, the bigger

1277
00:53:57,226 --> 00:53:59,603
The bigger, the better,
the better, the bigger

1278
00:53:59,645 --> 00:54:01,522
More, more, more

00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:03,649
Hey, I really want it right now

1280
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:05,693
Hey, turn it up real loud

1281
00:54:05,734 --> 00:54:13,734
Hey, I really want it right now
