3
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,944
<i>Maddy knew who she was
from a very early age.</i>

4
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:06,413
<i>For as long as Maddy could remember,
everybody loved her.</i>

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,339
<i>She never knew exactly what it was.</i>

6
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:19,009
<i>She just knew
that she had something special.</i>

7
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:23,513
<i>Something intangible.
Something immeasurable.</i>

8
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,396
<i>And it gave her confidence.</i>

9
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,777
<i>That's why she loved pageantry,</i>

10
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:41,655
<i>because you didn't have
to be the prettiest, or the tallest,</i>

11
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:44,741
<i>or the blondest, or the whitest.</i>

12
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:47,162
<i>You just had to have fucking confidence.</i>

13
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:52,082
<i>And she probably would have gone
on to win Miss Universe.</i>

14
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,918
<i>If it weren't for this guy.</i>

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,962
<i>A beauty pageant coach, Marcus Cutler,</i>

16
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:59,923
<i>was arrested today
on 18 counts of child molestation.</i>

17
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:03,593
That's it, you're done.
No more pageants. This is sick.

18
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:07,347
<i>Her dreams were dashed by some random
50 year old creep who didn't molest her,</i>

19
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:09,641
<i>let alone ever meet her.</i>

20
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:13,230
<i>She refused to eat for a week
out of protest.</i>

21
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:20,151
<i>But then she realized
how much she liked not doing anything.</i>

22
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,945
<i>Maddy would never say it out loud,</i>

23
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:24,781
<i>especially not today
because everybody's so political,</i>

24
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:31,162
<i>but she never really had any desire
to have a career or job.</i>

25
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,832
<i>She was just interested in doing
what she did,</i>

26
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:37,794
<i>just without school
and the other bullshit.</i>

27
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,796
<i>Her mother was an esthetician,</i>

28
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:43,883
<i>which is a fancy way of saying
she gave pedicures to rich people.</i>

29
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,136
<i>And her dad was a drunk
who was always pretending</i>

30
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:48,305
<i>to hold jobs longer than he did.</i>

31
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:51,766
<i>She quickly realized that there are
two kinds of people in the world.</i>

32
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:55,520
<i>The people who sit in the chairs,
with their feet in the foot bath.</i>

33
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:59,151
<i>And the people who kneel
in front of the foot bath.</i>

34
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:04,404
<i>She used to sit and study
the women who came in.</i>

35
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:08,366
<i>She'd pay attention to what they wore
and what they'd talk about.</i>

36
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:12,037
<i>And what she realized was that
none of them actually did anything.</i>

37
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,124
<i>I mean, they may have had children
to raise or like, homes to decorate,</i>

38
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,919
<i>but at the end of the day,
they literally did nothing.</i>

39
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:24,674
<i>They literally did nothing.</i>

40
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:27,971
<i>And strangely,
none of them had confidence.</i>

41
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,975
<i>She had had a thing for Nate for a while
before he finally asked her out.</i>

42
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:38,271
<i>At first he was a gentleman. Like,
flowers every day kind of gentleman.</i>

43
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:39,856
<i>And he was smarter than most guys.</i>

44
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:41,399
Maddy.

45
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,610
<i>Plus Nate like, really loved her.</i>

46
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:47,781
- I love you.
- I love you too.

47
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:51,284
<i>And she did love Nate.
She loved her relationship with Nate.</i>

48
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:54,329
<i>She was also a really good girlfriend.</i>

49
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:56,206
<i>Granted, she didn't always
tell the truth.</i>

50
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,749
Are you a virgin?

51
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,502
<i>Because the truth-truth is
that when she was 14,</i>

52
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:05,006
<i>on vacation in Panama City Beach,
she met a guy who was like, 40.</i>

53
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,509
Hey, you from around here?

54
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,220
<i>Which in retrospect,
seems kind of rape-y and weird,</i>

55
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:12,514
<i>but honestly,
she was the one in control.</i>

56
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:14,057
Yeah.

57
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,851
<i>She could tell by looking in Nate's eyes
how much it meant to him.</i>

58
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:19,020
- Like fully?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:20,897
<i>That she was 100% his.</i>

60
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,486
What about, like,
have you ever been fingered?

61
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,904
Only on my own.

62
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:30,701
<i>Plus it's not like anyone could feel
the fucking difference.</i>

63
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:35,956
<i>But that's the thing
about guys like Nate.</i>

64
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,209
<i>They don't actually want a person.</i>

65
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:46,256
<i>They want something
they can own and possess.</i>

66
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:49,301
<i>Like Sharon Stone in</i> Casino.

67
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:51,970
<i>But the cool thing
about Sharon Stone in</i> Casino

68
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,306
<i>is that she ran the fuck over De Niro.</i>

69
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:56,641
I'd fucking kill for that coat.

70
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:59,644
- <i>And she did the same to Nate.</i>
- How much do you think it costs?

71
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:04,316
<i>Seriously, Sharon Stone in</i> Casino
<i>was like, Maddy's spirit animal.</i>

72
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,401
<i>She also watched a lot of porn.</i>

73
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:09,529
<i>Not because it turned her on
or anything, it didn't.</i>

74
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:14,244
<i>But if you analyzed it really closely,
there were a ton of really good secrets.</i>

75
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,750
<i>Sometimes during sex she would imagine</i>

76
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:24,669
<i>she was a ventriloquist
controlling her body,</i>

77
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,423
<i>moving her hips and arching her back
in just the right way.</i>

78
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,927
<i>She wanted Nate to feel good
about the way he fucked.</i>

79
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:35,889
<i>Because if you make a guy
feel confident and powerful...</i>

80
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,975
- <i>Well, they'll do anything.</i>
- That one.

81
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:41,311
- I got you a present.
- Really?

82
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:43,482
Yeah, after dinner. It's in the car.

83
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,364
Oh, my God, it's perfect.

84
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,451
- I fucking love you.
- I fucking love you too.

85
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:02,415
<i>She did worry about
the whole monogamy thing though.</i>

86
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:05,543
<i>It's not like she ever, cheated-cheated.</i>

87
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:09,130
<i>Every now and then she'd find herself,
in like, a gray area.</i>

88
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:13,385
- I'll do anything to fuck you.
- You're sweet, but no.

89
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:16,513
<i>Except for that DJ
who said he opened for Calvin Harris.</i>

90
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:19,057
<i>And that stockbroker guy with the family
who lived on Oak Street.</i>

91
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:22,104
<i>And the hot dude
who ran the roller rink.</i>

92
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:30,110
<i>But honestly, those were all times
when Nate and her were on a break.</i>

93
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:33,738
<i>Plus, Nate could be a real asshole.</i>

94
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,534
<i>And sometimes,
Maddy fantasized about punching Nate.</i>

95
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:41,663
<i>But because of who he was as a person,
she was afraid he'd hit her back.</i>

96
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:44,541
<i>Especially because he was coming
to terms with his sexuality.</i>

97
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,418
You're fucking dead to me.

98
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,631
<i>It's like, the root
of a lot of violence.</i>

99
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:55,844
<i>And when she got home that night,
she felt sick to her stomach.</i>

100
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:58,307
<i>Like enough to throw up.</i>

101
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,351
<i>It wasn't the violence that scared her.</i>

102
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:06,980
<i>It was the fact that she knew,
no matter what he did,</i>

103
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:09,276
<i>she'd still love him.</i>

104
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,045
<i>Nothing in the world
comes close to opiates.</i>

105
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,340
<i>A good ES 7.5 Vicodin? Fuck.</i>

106
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:38,970
<i>But honestly, the best thing
I've ever had is Fentanyl.</i>

107
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:44,059
<i>There's not a thing on planet Earth
that compares to Fentanyl.</i>

108
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:48,772
<i>Except Jules. Jules is a close second.</i>

109
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,901
<i>Jules. Jules. Jules. Jules.</i>

110
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:54,736
<i>And you know what would be better?
Jules and Fentanyl.</i>

111
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,405
<i>But I can't do both,
because Jules won't have me.</i>

112
00:07:57,407 --> 00:08:01,244
<i>So for now, I'll choose Jules.</i>

113
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:09,334
- Rue, dinner's ready.
- Okay.

114
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,711
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. No.

115
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:14,381
Yeah. For... Yeah, for dinner.

116
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:17,594
- Just give me a second.
- Okay.

117
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,476
You two have a good time
at the carnival?

118
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:29,062
- Yeah. It was cool.
- It was all right.

119
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:33,110
- Rue said you got sick on the Gravitron.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

120
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:41,326
So Jules slept over last night?

121
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:45,497
Yeah, so?

122
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:53,588
- Are you two in a relationship?
- I don't know. Yeah. Kind of.

123
00:08:54,923 --> 00:09:00,095
It may not matter what I think.
But I really like her.

124
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,724
Me, too.

125
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:15,360
Baby, just take your time,
you've come a long way.

126
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,696
You're delicate.

127
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:23,952
- I'm not delicate.
- Yes, you are.

128
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:29,247
It's fine, Mom. We...

129
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:32,709
We had a very long conversation
about everything, and...

130
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:36,173
We're just gonna take things
really, really slow.

131
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:51,271
Yo, looks good. You ready?

132
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:58,610
- How bad does it hurt?
- It doesn't hurt at all.

133
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:01,112
It's all good,
I've been doing this for years.

134
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:04,284
I love you, Rue, but there's
no fucking way I'm doing that.

135
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:10,372
<i>I didn't know what happened
the night Jules met Tyler.</i>

136
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:13,416
<i>I knew it wasn't good.
But I was afraid to pry.</i>

137
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:17,045
<i>And selfishly,
things had been going really well.</i>

138
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,298
Show me exactly where the hold-up is.

139
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,551
<i>Granted, after the carnival,
things got really fucking weird.</i>

140
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:26,932
Hey, can I call you back?
Slow down.

141
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:31,728
Slow down, what's happening?

142
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:37,693
I'll meet you out front.

143
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:01,881
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Jacobs.

144
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:06,513
- Do you mind telling me what's going on?
- Let's talk once we get inside.

145
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,998
- Cal, you okay?
- Yeah. Give me a second.

146
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:45,844
<i>Now what had happened was that morning,
Maddy went to school.</i>

147
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,762
What are you, the Unabomber?

148
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:52,641
- What are you, a dominatrix?
- No.

149
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:57,020
- I didn't mean for real, bitch.
- Obviously.

150
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:01,608
- Seriously, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just have my period.

151
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,860
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

152
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:07,864
<i>And Maddy's first class
was Intro to Calc in Room 202.</i>

153
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:10,825
<i>Which, unfortunately, was
in the upper left wing of the school.</i>

154
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:13,453
Is the air conditioner
like, not working?

155
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:16,247
It's broken.
You could always take off your hoodie.

156
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:20,085
<i>Now, if it was a normal day, Maddy
would have just taken off her hoodie.</i>

157
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,504
<i>But since Nate choked her...</i>

158
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:26,174
<i>Maddy woke up three hours early, applied
more concealer than a burn victim,</i>

159
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,928
<i>and tried her best to cover up.</i>

160
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:34,641
<i>To compound the problem, she also
suffered from a drop in serotonin</i>

161
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:36,518
<i>from the Molly she took at the carnival.</i>

162
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,646
<i>Got depressed, and therefore hadn't had
anything to eat or drink</i>

163
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,481
<i>the entire weekend.</i>

164
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:43,858
<i>Plus, she actually was on her period.</i>

165
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,322
Maddy? Maddy?

166
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:52,867
She's in here!

167
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:54,661
I'm fine.

168
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:57,205
Why is everyone like, so dramatic?

169
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:00,542
Obviously, you've been
through a lot this weekend.

170
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:03,795
But my real concern
is the bruising on your neck.

171
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,755
There is no bruising on my neck.

172
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:10,093
- The paramedics saw it.
- Yeah, well, they're lying.

173
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,054
Madeleine, look...

174
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:18,268
I understand that you may be afraid
to talk about how you got hurt.

175
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,729
But I want you to know
that it's not your fault.

176
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:23,940
I'm trying to find
a really respectful way to say this,

177
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:26,693
but this doesn't concern you.

178
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:31,948
It does concern me, Madeleine.
You're 17 years old.

179
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:37,414
If I suspect that you are being abused,
I am mandated by law to report it.

180
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:41,001
Is it someone you know?

181
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,377
Was it Nate Jacobs?

182
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:47,756
All I know is she, like, knocked
over a giant pot of chili

183
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,924
and called his mother the c-word.

184
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:52,802
I mean, he did like,
grab her by the arm.

185
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,013
Yo, straight up, that chick is crazy.

186
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,641
But do you know
why Nate and Maddy were fighting?

187
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:59,517
I don't wanna talk until I get a lawyer.

188
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,978
You're not being charged with anything.

189
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,523
- Look. Nate's gay.
- I'm being serious, Barbara.

190
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:09,527
No, I'm telling you, he's actually gay.
That's why Maddy was upset.

191
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,071
I don't know about the carnival,

192
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:14,908
but I do know she smashed some dude
in the pool at McKay's.

193
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,451
Smashed?

194
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,955
- That's why he attacked the new girl.
- What new girl?

195
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:23,794
The one who cut herself.

196
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,674
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

197
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:33,426
Mr. Jacobs, can you please come with me?

198
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:35,263
- What?
- Come with me.

199
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:43,563
- You wanna tell me what the problem is?
- Don't worry, we will.

200
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:53,280
What was that about?

201
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:55,657
Probably because Nate tried
to kill Maddy.

202
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,826
What?

203
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:59,494
Because she found all the gay porn
on his phone.

204
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,121
- Who told you that?
- You did.

205
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:02,956
- When?
- At the carnival.

206
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,129
Okay, Lexi, never repeat that, because,
literally, none of that is true.

207
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:23,184
Daniel, I can't. I'm sorry.

208
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:27,856
I just... I'm dating somebody
and I really don't wanna fuck it up.

209
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,567
It's cool. Don't worry.

210
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:33,695
I just like you,
and I kind of thought you liked me.

211
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:36,656
I do. I just...

212
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,952
I have a boyfriend.

213
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:42,914
Please don't say anything.

214
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:50,005
If I promise to not say anything,
can we hang out again?

215
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:07,979
- Hey, did you get my texts?
- No.

216
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:11,983
Really? I sent you a bunch of texts.

217
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:15,070
I didn't get them.

218
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,238
It says like delivered on my phone.

219
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,285
Look, I really don't want
to talk about this right now.

220
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,956
Wait, are you for real?

221
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:28,877
Did I like, do something?

222
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,839
I don't know, Ethan, did you?

223
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,510
<i>So the night of the carnival,
while fucking Luke Kasten,</i>

224
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:40,178
<i>Kat had an epiphany.</i>

225
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,389
<i>She was fucking Luke Kasten.</i>

226
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:45,185
<i>Luke motherfucking Kasten.</i>

227
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:51,147
<i>And for those of you
who didn't go to East Highland...</i>

228
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,900
Luke Kasten was a fucking God.

229
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:56,861
I mean, he graduated years ago
and people still talk about him.

230
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:59,239
He has the biggest dick I've ever seen.

231
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,324
And I was looking at him
while he was fucking me,

232
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:04,619
I can see his face scrunching up,
and he was cumming all over my stomach,

233
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:08,707
and I had this, like, realization.
You know, like this epiphany.

234
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:15,005
That no matter how cool or sexy
or smart, you think a guy is,

235
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,091
they're actually just fucking pathetic.

236
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,971
<i>It's true, KittenKween.</i>

237
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:27,058
By the way, if you wanna cum, I put
a body harness on my Amazon wish list.

238
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,230
- I may need you to buy it for me.
- <i>Yes, KittenKween.</i>

239
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,065
- <i>Can I be honest with you?</i>
- <i>Always.</i>

240
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:36,568
- <i>What I realized is that like...</i>
- Where're you going?

241
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,487
<i>...my whole life, all I've tried to do
is take up less space.</i>

242
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,364
- To the mall.
- <i>Tried to hide from guys like,</i>

243
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:45,660
<i>who might like, whisper to their friend,
under their breath, as I walked by.</i>

244
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:49,247
<i>I spent my whole life afraid people
were going to find out that I was fat.</i>

245
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:51,583
<i>But honestly, who gives a shit.</i>

246
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,376
<i>I'm so in awe of you, KittenKween.</i>

247
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:56,923
<i>There's nothing more powerful
than a fat girl who doesn't give a fuck.</i>

248
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:22,449
Hey.

249
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:27,621
- I thought you weren't from around here.
- I'm not.

250
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:33,335
I get off work at 7:00.
You wanna hang out?

251
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:43,929
Why are you suddenly being so mean?

252
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:51,518
You don't understand, Mom,
he didn't do it.

253
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,061
- Then who did?
- It wasn't Nate.

254
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:55,272
- Maddy stop lying.
- I'm not lying!

255
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:58,441
I'm not gonna let this son of a bitch
attack my daughter and get away with it.

256
00:18:58,443 --> 00:18:59,985
- Right?
- Absolutely.

257
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:01,528
He needs to know
that there are consequences.

258
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,571
- Mom!
- I would like to press charges.

259
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:05,240
- You're not fucking pressing charges.
- I am gonna press charges.

260
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:06,825
- No, you're not pressing charges.
- This is for your own good.

261
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:10,495
- No, you're not pressing charges.
- Okay.

262
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:13,709
I will have to press charges.

263
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:20,007
- Are you okay, Mr. Jacobs?
- I'm fine.

264
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:27,514
Mr. and Mrs. Jacobs.
Thanks for getting here so quickly.

265
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:31,349
So it appears
that your son and Ms. Perez

266
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:33,977
had a physical altercation
on Saturday night,

267
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:36,104
in which he allegedly strangled her.

268
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,857
- What?
- There are multiple eye witnesses.

269
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:43,572
Ms. Perez has extensive bruising.
And her family will be pressing charges.

270
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:47,907
There must be some misunderstanding.

271
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,910
This doesn't sound like
something my son would do.

272
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:53,330
I would like to talk
to the Perez family.

273
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:56,082
Actually, Mr. Jacobs,
I think it would be best for you

274
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:59,294
to speak with your son
before we take him to the station.

275
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,423
He's just this way.

276
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:37,501
Did you do it?

277
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:42,798
Not really.

278
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:49,179
- Did you admit to it?
- No.

279
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,518
Did you do it?

280
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:06,571
No.

281
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,034
That's good to hear.

282
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,665
Her family's going to press charges.

283
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,753
- Fuck.
- Hey.

284
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:27,048
Listen to me.

285
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,594
You need to stay composed.
Don't get angry. Don't make a scene.

286
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,808
You walk out of this school
with your head held high.

287
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,188
Look at me. Hey, look at me.

288
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:48,778
What's about to happen to you,
to me, to our family,

289
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,408
is not gonna be easy.

290
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:57,539
You walk out first.
I'm right behind you.

291
00:21:58,874 --> 00:22:00,626
Come on.

292
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:17,184
I love you.

293
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,266
Okay. One, what was that about?

294
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:03,061
Two, can we talk about the fact
that you fucked Nate's dad?

295
00:23:03,063 --> 00:23:06,982
Rue, swear to God, like on your life
that you will never tell anyone.

296
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:09,943
- That you fucked Nate's dad?
- I'm serious.

297
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:11,820
This is like...

298
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:16,574
Even if you decide you hate me one day.
Like, you can never tell anyone.

299
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:22,080
- Why would I ever hate you?
- That's not the point.

300
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:25,542
Seriously, this is some
go-to-your-grave shit.

301
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:27,713
I promise!

302
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:37,220
- Do you think Nate knows?
- No. Why would Nate know?

303
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:40,890
Well, when you went up
to the chili booth, Nate was there.

304
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:42,644
Did he look like he knew?

305
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:47,774
No, like, literally,
like I didn't even notice.

306
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:52,738
Nate's scary.

307
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,409
The whole fucking family is scary.

308
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:03,373
I don't wanna have this conversation.

309
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:07,876
You know what'd be amazing?

310
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:09,836
If they paid you off
with a bunch of money,

311
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:11,673
and then we'd do
a bunch of really cool shit.

312
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:17,721
Rue. This is not a joke.

313
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:34,110
<i>I don't know why Jules didn't trust me.
Or why she'd think I'd ever hate her.</i>

314
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:38,239
<i>There's literally nothing in the world
that Jules could do to make me upset.</i>

315
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,783
<i>I even told her that.</i>

316
00:24:39,785 --> 00:24:43,288
- Yeah, right.
- No, for real. It's true.

317
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,963
So like, do you have a lot of
one night stands?

318
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:56,009
Define a lot.

319
00:24:57,177 --> 00:25:01,888
- Like more than five?
- Yeah.

320
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,643
- More than 10?
- I don't know.

321
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:09,020
More than 20?

322
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:12,482
- Why does it matter?
- It's just a question.

323
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:14,653
Who cares?

324
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:17,737
Is the sex, like, good?

325
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:21,783
I don't know, it's like,
it's not even the point, you know?

326
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:26,246
It's more about, like,
everything that leads up to it.

327
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:29,207
That's the good part.

328
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:33,128
I mean you've had
one night stands, right?

329
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,671
No.

330
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:38,133
But you've, like, hooked up with people
that you just met, right?

331
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,218
Not, not like... I don't know.

332
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,431
Wait. How many people
have you slept with?

333
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:47,561
- Not many.
- No like, what's your number?

334
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,897
<i>This is so embarrassing.</i>

335
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:58,320
<i>I had my first kiss at the age of 12,</i>

336
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:03,658
<i>with a boy I didn't really like,
but I just wanted to get it over with.</i>

337
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,869
<i>I gave four hand jobs in eighth grade,</i>

338
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:10,248
<i>two blow jobs in ninth, one of which
I was emotionally coerced into.</i>

339
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,542
I'm literally going to tell the entire
school that you sucked my dick,

340
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:15,879
so you might as well just suck my dick.

341
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:18,298
<i>And there was the time that Lexi
got asked to the Freshman formal</i>

342
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,470
<i>by Tucker Blake, and I tried
to teach her how to French kiss.</i>

343
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:28,308
Is this like, really weird
and uncomfortable for you?

344
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,018
No, not really.

345
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,607
Okay. I'm gonna get ready.

346
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:40,570
<i>Also, at 15,</i>

347
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:45,283
<i>I ate two xannie bars, drank a beer,
which is super dangerous,</i>

348
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:47,621
<i>and lost my virginity.</i>

349
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:53,083
- Did you cum?
- Yeah.

350
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:54,753
Weird.

351
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,715
You look like you came hard.

352
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:06,471
<i>All I know is,
life is not a Nicholas Sparks novel.</i>

353
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:09,226
- That's it?
- Yeah. That's it.

354
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:16,191
Wait, so like,
have you ever been in love?

355
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:26,535
Fucking pigs! Fuck you!

356
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:29,452
Hi Maddy, I'm detective Riley.

357
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:32,247
I understand this is traumatic,
but you're going to have to cooperate.

358
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:35,417
If you literally step any closer
I will fight you.

359
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,086
Miss, this is procedure,
I need you to remove your sweater now.

360
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,672
And if you don't,
we will remove it for you.

361
00:27:40,674 --> 00:27:44,009
Really, bitch? How?

362
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:47,554
- Calm down.
- Take a deep breath, take a deep breath.

363
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:51,433
- Look, we don't wanna hurt you.
- Get off of me.

364
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:53,768
- Please.
- Relax.

365
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,856
There we go.

366
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:24,215
I know you're really upset right now,
and you don't want to hear this.

367
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:29,929
But trust me when I tell you
that the person that did this...

368
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:32,225
...doesn't love you.

369
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:44,569
So you grabbed her?

370
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:48,951
I grabbed her by the arm to drag
her away, I didn't choke her.

371
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,208
I asked her why she was acting that way
and what she was doing.

372
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,880
I don't want to get her in any trouble,
but she had taken a lot of drugs.

373
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:09,511
- What drugs?
- I don't want to get her in trouble.

374
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:12,182
She's not going to get in any trouble.

375
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:15,976
Molly.

376
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:20,397
- As in MDMA?
- Yeah.

377
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,696
But I don't know if it was pure.
I don't do drugs. So I don't know.

378
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:30,907
And after that conversation,

379
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:34,911
was that the last time you spoke
to Ms. Perez that evening?

380
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:36,456
Yeah.

381
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,885
I know we don't have
the healthiest relationship.

382
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:53,221
I know that.

383
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:57,769
My dad's always telling me
that she's a distraction and he's right.

384
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:04,190
I love her, I really love her.

385
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:08,655
No matter how crazy she acts,
no matter what she does, I love her.

386
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:19,207
It's kind of embarrassing
to admit, but...

387
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:23,835
In the times when we've broken up,

388
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:27,341
I know for a fact
that she's been with other guys.

389
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:32,804
And it's possible that, that night...

390
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:40,103
It doesn't matter.

391
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:44,942
- What were you gonna say?
- It doesn't matter.

392
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,360
I love Maddy.

393
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:51,363
And I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

394
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,949
<i>The fallout from Nate's assault
was swift.</i>

395
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:56,201
<i>We're suspending your son
until the investigation is completed.</i>

396
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:59,955
- But that could take months.
- <i>And harsh.</i>

397
00:30:59,957 --> 00:31:03,333
East Highland football team
has a zero tolerance policy.

398
00:31:03,335 --> 00:31:06,711
<i>I am a survivor of abuse.</i>

399
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:10,090
<i>It took me 10 years to admit that.</i>

400
00:31:10,092 --> 00:31:12,717
<i>Because the most insidious symptom
of abuse,</i>

401
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:19,099
<i>is the inability to admit that what
you are enduring is not normal,</i>

402
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:23,397
<i>not okay, and not love.</i>

403
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:27,274
<i>Those are the moments
that keep me up at night.</i>

404
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:33,154
<i>Thinking about all the times
that I ignored that voice in my head.</i>

405
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:36,618
<i>You know, they told me,
"What are you doing?"</i>

406
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:41,496
<i>And what happens
a month, six months, a year,</i>

407
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:44,416
when she moves away,
and goes to college?

408
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:49,421
When she tells you
she just wants to be friends?

409
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:53,260
- You mean “if.”
- No, Rue, I mean “when.”

410
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:57,304
I mean, I don't know
we talked about living together.

411
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,514
Like, if she goes to school in New York,
I'll just go with her.

412
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:03,935
- I'll go anywhere she goes.
- I think you're missing my point, Rue.

413
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:08,150
Nothing in high school lasts forever.

414
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,905
You should meet her.

415
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:20,702
Go ahead, Rue.

416
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:24,541
<i>What the fuck are you talking about?</i>

417
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:28,710
Hey, everyone.
I'm Rue, and I'm an addict.

418
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:30,881
Hi, Rue.

419
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:40,972
I guess, I just wanted to make amends
with everyone.

420
00:32:40,974 --> 00:32:46,730
Because most...
Every time I've shared, I was lying.

421
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,774
Yeah, every time I've collected a chip,

422
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:56,073
whether it be 30 days, or 60 days,
or 90 days, I was lying.

423
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:07,084
But I met someone.

424
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:12,253
And she's helped.

425
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:15,966
And now I want to stay clean.

426
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:20,387
And shit! Maybe that's...
Maybe that's me being selfish.

427
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:23,348
And Ali just scared the shit out of me

428
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,518
because he told me
that it wasn't gonna last.

429
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,689
And, fuck, you know what?

430
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:32,776
Maybe you're right.

431
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,656
But I really, really, really,
hope you're wrong.

432
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:45,247
Because I've been clean for 13 days.

433
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:52,170
And it's been okay.
I've actually been really happy.

434
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:56,339
So...

435
00:33:56,341 --> 00:34:00,927
Yeah, I don't know, I guess
that's why I wanted to come here

436
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:03,265
and tell you guys the truth.

437
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,562
Thank you.

438
00:34:11,356 --> 00:34:12,941
Thank you.

439
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:21,656
So is this like a friend thing with Rue?
Or is it like a...

440
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:25,035
I don't wanna talk about it.

441
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:27,370
I'm just wondering.

442
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:31,460
Are you two, like, a thing?

443
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:38,048
No, we're not a thing.
I don't know what a thing is.

444
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,842
Because I've been thinking,
you know, if it was...

445
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:43,178
If you two were a thing,

446
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,972
we could all just do,
like, a family thing together.

447
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:47,599
Maybe go out to dinner or something.

448
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:51,519
No, I don't want to go to dinner
with you and Rue. I'm sorry.

449
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:57,319
Why, because you're embarrassed of me
or is it because you're a thing?

450
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:04,076
- You're hilarious.
- Fair enough.

451
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:07,412
Is she still going to meetings?

452
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,666
That's great.

453
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:14,044
You're a good influence.

454
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,897
<i>McKay had heard the news about Nate.</i>

455
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:21,568
He had a bunch of dick pics
on his phone.

456
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,195
And was like what?
Sending them to other girls?

457
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:27,117
No. McKay, it wasn't his dick.
It was other guys' dicks.

458
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:29,784
I'm confused. Who told you that?

459
00:36:29,786 --> 00:36:31,870
What dick pics?

460
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,080
The ones you told me about,
on his phone.

461
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:37,917
I don't know if your brain is all
scrambled from all the Molly you take.

462
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,794
But I never said that.

463
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:43,381
If you ever spread a lie like that,
I will fucking come for you.

464
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:47,218
- We good?
- Yeah.

465
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,762
Anyway, look, Cassie.

466
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:52,225
I'm really sorry about what happened
the other night at the carnival.

467
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:56,394
It's okay.

468
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:59,149
No, I should've said something to Nate.

469
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:05,528
It just really hurt my feelings.

470
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,451
I mean, I feel like you weren't proud
to be my boyfriend.

471
00:37:13,997 --> 00:37:15,749
Cass.

472
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,962
Give me a kiss.

473
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:26,093
I'm proud to be your boyfriend,
trust me.

474
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:33,725
- I'm sorry, too.
- What do you have to sorry about?

475
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:43,650
I love making music.
Yeah, I mean, but to be honest,

476
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:47,404
I don't think I'm good enough yet
to like, just do music.

477
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:50,951
But that's like, my dream,
you know, whatever.

478
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:58,415
- What about you?
- What about me?

479
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:02,335
You look like you're creative
or something, you know.

480
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:05,422
- Creative?
- Yeah.

481
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:09,509
I don't know,
just like the way you dress and stuff.

482
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:12,347
I just thought you might be an artist
or something.

483
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,562
Look, if you want to hook up
we can hook up.

484
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:27,444
- I wasn't expecting that.
- Really?

485
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:30,280
I was just making conversation.

486
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:34,411
I think that's my point,
you really don't have to.

487
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:43,501
<i>Maddy wasn't doing well.</i>

488
00:38:43,503 --> 00:38:45,462
<i>Over the course of the last five days,</i>

489
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:50,383
<i>Maddy had sent Nate
a total of 273 text messages.</i>

490
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:53,553
<i>None of which he answered.</i>

491
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:55,889
<i>Plus, everyone in her life
was against her.</i>

492
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:58,266
It's not real love, Maddy.

493
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:00,894
- Who the fuck are you to judge?
- Don't swear!

494
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:04,814
Seriously, Mom, Dad has slept on
the couch since I was 10 years old.

495
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:08,234
- Don't be cruel, Maddy!
- I'm not.

496
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:10,278
I'm just saying,
love is a million things.

497
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,740
Sometimes it feels good
and sometimes it doesn't.

498
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:16,451
The one thing I know
is that Nate loves me no matter what.

499
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,496
He'd fucking kill for me,
and I'd kill for him.

500
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:23,833
It feels good to know that there's one
person in this whole fucked up world

501
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,502
who has my back.

502
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:27,295
You think I want this?

503
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:31,883
You live in the same house and you
don't even say one word to each other.

504
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:34,469
That's the difference
between me and you.

505
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:40,141
You're right. I felt the exact same way
about every person I ever dated.

506
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,560
The same!

507
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:46,564
Kat, I need to come over like right now.

508
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:49,609
- <i>I'm not home.</i>
- What? Where are you?

509
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,028
<i>With a... friend.</i>

510
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,073
- Who?
- <i>It doesn't really matter.</i>

511
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:57,033
<i>I'm in the middle of something,
can I call you later?</i>

512
00:39:57,035 --> 00:40:01,746
Can you blow them off, please?
I really need you right now.

513
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:04,584
<i>I can't, I gotta go.</i>

514
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:10,257
- Sorry about that.
- It's all good.

515
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:16,346
So, like...

516
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:01,058
Fuck. It was just...

517
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:05,729
That was really good.

518
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:13,360
Seriously, that was like...

519
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,572
one of the best blowjobs I've ever had.

520
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,690
One more time, okay? One more time.

521
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:39,738
- Rue seems really good.
- Yeah. She does.

522
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,992
It's because of you, you know?

523
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:53,128
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

524
00:43:16,234 --> 00:43:21,698
I'm so sorry I'm late, my landlord
is just such a fucking cocksucker.

525
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,367
You know, that type of person
that, like, just tries

526
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,703
to get under your skin
for like no reason?

527
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:32,542
Whatever, you don't care. I can breathe.

528
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:37,337
Oh, my God. You're actually hot.

529
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:39,214
Can I...

530
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,132
Would you like
a glass of champagne?

531
00:43:41,134 --> 00:43:44,012
Honey, no, I don't do alcohol.

532
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,688
You from around here?

533
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,316
I'm from planet Venus, baby.

534
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,241
I'm Minako.
But all the boys call me Mina.

535
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:32,603
I'm...

536
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:36,521
Can you please stop the music?

537
00:44:36,523 --> 00:44:41,111
Jeez, what is up with you?

538
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,871
- You wanna popper?
- No.

539
00:44:54,207 --> 00:44:56,585
Well, then what do you want?

540
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:01,340
I just want to talk for a little bit.

541
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:04,718
What do you want to talk about?

542
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:08,347
I've just had a really long week.

543
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:12,142
- Wife?
- No.

544
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,521
- Kids?
- Yeah.

545
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,406
- Boys or girls?
- Boys.

546
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,999
Do you think this stuff affects them?

547
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,920
Even if they don't know it?

548
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,465
I don't know.

549
00:45:45,425 --> 00:45:49,094
You think hiding it
creates the same thing in them?

550
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:53,308
Honey, I don't know.
Everyone knows who I am.

551
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:04,778
You know...

552
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:10,993
I've spent my whole life
trying to keep this part of me separate.

553
00:46:13,745 --> 00:46:17,457
But I feel
like it's poisoned everything.

554
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:25,463
I thought that I was doing
what was best for everybody.

555
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:31,763
And then I look at my boys
and they have so much anger.

556
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:34,850
Not just anger...

557
00:46:36,768 --> 00:46:38,520
...but rage.

558
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,565
And it scares me.

559
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:48,071
Because it's too late.

560
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:52,034
It's always gonna lived inside of them.

561
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,622
All of problems you have, baby...

562
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,375
...I'm here to fix them.

563
00:47:02,044 --> 00:47:08,423
All that bad energy,
you can give it to me.

564
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,552
I can handle it.

565
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:18,118
I think we never do this anymore.

566
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,788
Yeah.

567
00:48:28,964 --> 00:48:32,882
- You wanna stay the night?
- Ah, I should probably go home.

568
00:48:32,884 --> 00:48:36,305
Okay. Is it cool if I just go with you?

569
00:48:39,224 --> 00:48:41,268
Yeah, sure.

570
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,071
Chris.

571
00:48:57,284 --> 00:48:59,077
What's up, bro?

572
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,749
Yeah, I'm with her right now. What's up?

573
00:49:05,417 --> 00:49:08,420
Can you please can tell Maddy
to download Signal?

574
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:21,224
Fuck him!

575
00:50:55,027 --> 00:50:56,903
Hey, handsome.
