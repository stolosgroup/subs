1
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:11,653
What?

2
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:14,022
Helen Hayes broke her foot.

3
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:16,425
Oh, no.

4
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:19,124
Actually, I thought she was dead,
so this is, you know--

5
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:23,025
She's, like, ahead of the game,
ifyou think about it.

6
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:25,036
- Makes you think.
- It sure does.

7
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:27,572
You got to seize every moment.

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,507
So what do you want to do today?

9
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,774
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

10
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:37,975
- Something.
- That'd be good.

11
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:39,814
- Don't you think?
- Sure.

12
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,650
You know, it's Sunday.
We got the whole city at our feet.

13
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:45,589
Okay.
There's a 10K run in the park.

14
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:50,028
The gay pride parade.

15
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,688
Again?

16
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,728
Think we have enough gay friends?

17
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:00,995
To do what?

18
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:03,406
- I'm just asking.
- What are you talking about?

19
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:06,445
There's Eddie and Rob,
Tony Prado--

20
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:09,106
Tony's not gay.
I fixed him up with my sister.

21
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:14,113
Look.
They're fighting again.

22
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:16,747
- Who?
- Bulgaria, Turkey...

23
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:19,519
that whole Midnight Express area.

24
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,761
Look right there at how lucky we are...

25
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,889
that at least
we don't live in a war zone.

26
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:32,798
- I'm gonna get up.
- Good for you.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

28
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:51,750
Tell me why

29
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:53,348
I love you like I do

30
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:55,155
Tell me who

31
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,788
Can start my heart as much as you

32
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:01,425
Tell me all your secrets
and I'll tell you most of mine

33
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:05,597
They say nobody's perfect
Well, that's really true this time

34
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,639
I don't have the answers

35
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,504
I don't have a plan

36
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:11,406
But I'm mad about you, baby

37
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:13,035
So help me understand

38
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:15,080
What we do

39
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:17,048
You can whisper in my ear

40
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,879
Where we go

41
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,351
Who knows what happens after here

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,183
Let's take each other's hand

43
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:27,352
As we jump into
the final frontier

44
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,894
I'm mad about you, baby

45
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:32,260
Yeah

46
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,697
I'm mad about you

47
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,072
Oh, God, I wish I still smoked.

48
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:50,980
There's nothing like that first
cigarette after you brush.

49
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:55,849
- What are you doing? What?
- What am I doing?

50
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:58,288
I thought we agreed
to do the puzzle together.

51
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:00,621
Yes, but I couldn't find you.

52
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:02,217
I only did the downs.

53
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:05,025
You called the 900 number
for the answers, didn't you?

54
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,362
That is sick...

55
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,426
that you would even accuse me
of something like that.

56
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:15,133
So you're telling me you actually knew
the 16-letter word...

57
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,540
for a Suriname pidgin language.

58
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,239
- Hey, I had a life before you.
- I'll be checking the phone bill.

59
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:23,009
I have no doubt that you will.

60
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,153
Why are there rocks in our bathtub?

61
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,746
It's not a rock.
It's a pumice stone.

62
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,525
What's pumice?

63
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,254
It's a rock.

64
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:41,861
Wow. I had the weirdest dream
last night.

65
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:44,095
- About what?
- About us.

66
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,831
Oh, yeah?
What were we doing?

67
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:48,465
- Well, we were sitting on a couch--
- And?

68
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,135
And eating potato chips.

69
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,337
- And?
- And...

70
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:55,880
we were watching
the Weather Channel.

71
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,683
- That's it?
- That's it.

72
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,548
We were sitting, eating and watching.

73
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,112
- That's a dream you remembered?
- I'm not saying I'm proud of it.

74
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,351
I'm just sharing.

75
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:08,154
Maybe it's symbolic.

76
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:11,355
Maybe the couch was really
a ship or something.

77
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,625
Oh, no.
This was definitely a couch.

78
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,633
There were cushions, you know?

79
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:18,226
Or the Weather Channel.
Weather means change, you know?

80
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:20,864
Winds, storms, highs, lows.

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,636
Nah, I think they said
"fair and mild" the whole time.

82
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:27,869
What about the chips?
Were they at least barbecued flavor?

83
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:30,438
No.
Nope, plain chips...

84
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,450
but crispy, you know?

85
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:36,045
We'd better get out ofthe house.

86
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,252
Fine.
Tell me what you want to do.

87
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:43,591
All right. There's an Amish quilt
exhibition at the folk art museum.

88
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:45,460
Boy, that'll be a mob scene.

89
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:48,091
Well, what do you want to do,
besides go to a movie?

90
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:51,534
Fine. I won't go to a movie. You know,
the Belgian film festival's at the Quad.

91
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:54,596
I'm all atingle.
We always go to the movies.

92
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,507
This article says
every quilt tells a story.

93
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:00,204
You find me a quilt that tells
the story of Casablanca...

94
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,712
I'll be there.

95
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:08,250
"Gal Friday. Hair stylist, hand model--"

96
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,255
That would be good.
You have beautiful hands.

97
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:13,224
Yeah, but they're not reliable.

98
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,157
Your hands?

99
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,628
Who is this guy Kelly,
and why does he need all these girls?

100
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,860
Look at this.
" Body parts found in bag inJersey."

101
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:27,529
Wow.

102
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,938
I wonder if
it's anyone I know.

103
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,773
Why would you automatically
assume that?

104
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:36,076
What, you think I don't have friends?

105
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:39,117
Oh, my.
I should get down to the theatre.

106
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:42,018
- What are you going to see?
- Will Rogers Follies.

107
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,487
Big date?

108
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,456
Yeah, right, Paul.

109
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,856
- You meeting somebody there?
- No.

110
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:52,324
You know what? It's a musical, and
there'll be plenty of people on stage.

111
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,465
- Call me later.
- Okay.

112
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:02,674
What is that? An actual
cooking thing going on there?

113
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:04,835
Well, I thought I'd give it a try.

114
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,208
- What is it?
- A cassoulet.

115
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,544
- Oh. What's that?
- Same as a casserole.

116
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,550
So why would they call it that?

117
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:15,348
I don't know.
Should I call Paris?

118
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,685
No, itjust seems,
why not call it a casserole?

119
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,156
Why do that to people?

120
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,557
Because they're bastards
and they hate you.

121
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:26,492
It's different.
You want different, right?

122
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:28,055
I do?

123
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,999
Sure seems that way.

124
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,433
Did we have a fight
while I wasn't here?

125
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,441
I thought we promised
not to do that anymore.

126
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,967
I just love waking up on a Sunday and
having my husband tell me I'm boring.

127
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:44,282
Honey, it was a dream.
Boy, I'm glad I shared that.

128
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,713
It does not mean
that I'm bored with you.

129
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,088
Exactly. Ifyou sayyou're bored
with our life, how should I take that?

130
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,026
I didn't say I was bored.
It was a dream. It was my dream.

131
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:59,587
So put it on me. It's all me, okay?
I'm a boring, boring man.

132
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,031
And I married you,
so what does that say about me?

133
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:06,070
Where do you get this?

134
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:10,472
I keep reading about all these things,
these happening places we've never been.

135
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:13,706
- Why aren't we out there?
- 'Cause nobody invited us. That's why.

136
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:17,306
I'm serious. How did this happen?
I used to be out there all the time.

137
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:20,546
I frizzed my hair. I wore hats.

138
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:22,416
I slept with artists.

139
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,023
Once.

140
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,284
Commercial. Still--

141
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,625
- What kind of hats?
- All kinds. Big funky hats.

142
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,827
Little funky hats.
I wore hats.

143
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,836
I've never seen you wear a hat.

144
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:41,236
Yeah, well, I guess those days are gone.

145
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:44,071
This isn't working.
Do we have a slotted spoon?

146
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:46,373
- Let's do something.
- Really?

147
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,003
- What did I just say?
- Like what?

148
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,071
- Whateveryou want.
- The quilt show?

149
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:52,379
The quilt show, I'm not so sure.
You know, there's--

150
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:57,144
Those folk art things,
they get pretty dangerous.

151
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,953
- How?
- Wilding.

152
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:02,856
- Wilding?
- A lot ofwilding goes on in there.

153
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:04,919
You'd be surprised.
It's, like, gangs and rumbles.

154
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:07,522
- Between whom?
- The Amish...

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,693
and the other Amish.

156
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:12,896
It's like theJets and the Sharks
with them. You don't want to be there.

157
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,497
Nice try.
Do we have any cumin?

158
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:18,702
- How about the film festival?
- The Belgian one?

159
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,745
Honey, ifwe don't go,
who will?

160
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:24,044
Do me a favor.
Call Fran and ask her what cumin is.

161
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:26,949
Oh, no.J ust use pepper.
It's the same thing.

162
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:27,917
Please.

163
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:33,020
- Fran's gonna make a big deal ofthis.
-J ust ask her.

164
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:35,117
I'm asking her.

165
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,986
- Hello. Dr. Devanow.
- Mark, hi. It's Paul.

166
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:40,463
- It's Paul.
- Hi, Paul.

167
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:44,799
- That was Fran.
- I figured. Do you know what cumin is?

168
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,701
- Oh, Fran loves it.
- Loves what?

169
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:48,603
- Cumin.
- I love it.

170
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:50,005
- Fran loves it.
- What is it?

171
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,770
- What is it?
- What is it?

172
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,835
Very earthy.
Also good for the middle ear.

173
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,972
- Hold on. I'm getting the book.
- She's getting the book.

174
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:58,642
- What book? No, don't get a book!
- Hi. It's me.

175
00:08:58,717 --> 00:09:01,686
Would you believe I own
one entire book ofcumin recipes?

176
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,585
You know something?
Yes, I would.

177
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:07,353
Here. Let mejust read to you.
"Chapter One: The history ofcumin.

178
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,462
The historyofcumin
can almostbeseen...

179
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,021
as the history of man himself.

180
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:17,364
First discoveredin the netherreaches
ofthe Indian terrain--"

181
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:18,960
Well?

182
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:21,097
She says it's like pepper.

183
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:26,912
All right. So we go to lunch first,
then the film festival...

184
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:29,675
then 86 minutes
ofyour quilt show thing.

185
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:32,342
- Eighty-six minutes?
- Same time as the movie. Seems fair.

186
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:36,544
But we got to get out of here now.
The parade'll hit our block any second.

187
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:38,283
- So?
- So...

188
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:41,417
they already closed Hudson for the 1 0K,
which means ifwe're not out now...

189
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:44,485
- we're stuck for two hours.
- Found it. What do you think?

190
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:48,761
It's very hip, very happening.
Let's get uptown where nobody knows us.

191
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,265
- It's your mother.
- How do you know?

192
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,865
How did I know Fran was going
to do 40 minutes on cumin?

193
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:58,876
Hi, we 're out. Leave a message,
and we 'll callyouback.

194
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:01,674
Jamie?It'syourmother.

195
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:05,409
Mom, we're here.
We'rejust going out.

196
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,384
No, she went to the theatre.

197
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:10,422
Look at this.
Did we ever eat at Fung We?

198
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:13,219
- Slacks and a nice top.
- Did we?

199
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,692
- Once, I think, yeah.
- They closed it.

200
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:19,094
Mom, the people in the theatre
are not gonna know she's your daughter.

201
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,096
- For health violations.
- What?

202
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,863
They closed Fung We
for health violations.

203
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:28,338
Stop it. We'll call you later.
You too. Bye.

204
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,341
We ate there two months ago.
Come on.

205
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,644
I haven't felt quite right ever since
I ate those steamed dumplings.

206
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:37,341
- They were terrible.
- They made me thirsty.

207
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,043
- Stop it.
- I'm just saying.

208
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:44,652
A tapeworm takes two months to grow.
That's what I think I have.

209
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:47,283
Come on.
Lunch, quilt, movie. Let's go.

210
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,351
- I don't think I can eat lunch.
- Fine. Quilt, lunch, movie.

211
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:54,058
- Let's just get out of here. Come on.
- Fung We. They should call it Fung Yu.

212
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:59,197
There's all these men
outside your building.

213
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:01,637
It's a parade.
It's the gay pride parade.

214
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,470
Oh.

215
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,737
How come nobody hit on me?

216
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:10,045
- You disappointed?
- It's nice to be asked.

217
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:12,879
- Listen, Selby, we're heading out.
- No, that's cool.

218
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:14,782
I'm just gonna hang out for a while.

219
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:17,321
You know, I'm doing the 1 0K.

220
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,648
Here?

221
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:22,421
Yeah. I started it.

222
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:26,521
I figured that I'd wait it out,
then blend in at the finish line.

223
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:30,560
You would not believe the women
just waiting there...

224
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,365
with towels and Gatorade.

225
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,635
- So you entered this race--
- Don't even engage.J ust go.

226
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,903
Don't feed the dog.

227
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:43,638
Hi, buddy.

228
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:46,742
Did they leave you
all alone here on a Sunday?

229
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,151
Sucks, doesn't it?

230
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:53,317
Well, you and me,
we are feasting.

231
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,257
Look at that! Ooh!

232
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,295
Oh, who's the best dog?

233
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,922
- Who's the best guy?
- Selby!

234
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,758
Bad dog.

235
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,695
What happened?
I thought you guys were going out.

236
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:14,378
Oh, honey, come here. You're gonna miss
theJ udy Garland balloon.

237
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,589
Yes, Ma.

238
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,591
Right, Ma.

239
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,991
Yes, Ma. Ma?

240
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:33,930
Let me say hi to Dad.
Hi. Okay.

241
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:35,796
Fine. Yes, Ma.

242
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:40,669
- Does this look like it's jelling?
- That's clotting.

243
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:42,366
No, that'sJamie, Ma.

244
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:43,999
- No, she knows, she knows.
- Knows what?

245
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:46,704
How annoying it is to talk
to somebody when they're on the phone.

246
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,940
No, she's cooking, Ma.

247
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:51,278
Why would I lie?
Yes, she is.

248
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,349
A cassoulet.

249
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,319
It's like a casserole.

250
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:58,549
To make trouble, that's why.

251
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,889
Because they're French.
Ma, listen. I got to go.

252
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,520
I got to go. I am.
Yes. I do.

253
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,996
Bye. I will. Bye.

254
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,100
- Have you seen the book review?
- I don't look at the book review...

255
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,764
'cause all they do is give away
the end, and I hate that.

256
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,172
Where are the obituaries? I got to see
what they said about Stanley Conn.

257
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,834
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

258
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,072
My motherjust said
it was really well written.

259
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:27,313
-Why are you eating? We're going out.
-We don't have time. Is the parade over?

260
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:31,823
Yeah, like, two minutes ago.
Did they seem really festive this year?

261
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,120
I think it's sad they even
have to have a parade.

262
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:39,028
I magine ifsomeone told you the person
you chose to love was a sin?

263
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:41,691
I mean, besides your mother?

264
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,758
Hey. She's crazy about you.

265
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:45,599
That's halftrue.

266
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,696
Come on. The streets are open,
the paths are clear.

267
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:51,504
We head uptown for the film festival,
then 43 minutes ofyour quilt show--

268
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:52,874
- Eighty-six.
- Whatever.

269
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,641
Then back home for some cassoulet,
which, God willing...

270
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:57,375
will havejelled by then.

271
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,017
- Don't.
- I won't.

272
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,748
Hi, we 're out. Leave a message
and we 'll callyouback.

273
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,517
Hi. It's Lisa.

274
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,354
- Don't.
- I'm not.

275
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:11,055
Iknowyou'reprobablyout.
Ijustreallyneededto talk toyou.

276
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:15,099
Hi, I'm here. What's the matter?
Are you all right?

277
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:20,934
- What is wrong?
- She's having a trauma.

278
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:24,373
- From what?
- The Will Rogers Follies.

279
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:28,569
What do you think it was?

280
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:31,172
The story?

281
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,616
The music?

282
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,414
The rope tricks?

283
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:41,020
Your sister okay?

284
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,755
I think I convinced her to go
back in for the second act.

285
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:46,959
What was it?

286
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:50,024
She decided ifWill Rogers met her,
he wouldn't like her.

287
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,728
Look at this:
Portugal, round trip, $300.

288
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:57,036
We can't even make it to the lobby.

289
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,835
- Come on. Let's go. Movie, quilt--
- We don't have time now.

290
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:03,973
I have to be back by 7:00 to put this
in the oven, or it's ruined.

291
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:06,609
- Says who?
- Right here. They're very specific.

292
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:08,880
It doesn't look like the picture,
does it?

293
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:14,281
You know, once you light and shellac it,
it's really gonna come to life.

294
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,987
So what we'll do is go
to the movie--

295
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:19,155
- What?
- We only have time to do one.

296
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:21,392
So you just assumed
it would be yours?

297
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,934
- Yes.
- What do you call that?

298
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:26,266
Compromise.

299
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:29,307
It makes more sense. I would have
a worse time doing your thing.

300
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:31,934
Look, you'll like it, because
you can have popcorn, Gummi Bears--

301
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,410
- Call it.
- Heads. Tails. Heads.

302
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,275
- You sure?
- Heads.

303
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,282
Thankyou.

304
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,750
- Two out ofthree.
- I'm sorry.

305
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:45,487
Hi, we 're out. Leave a message
and we 'll callyouback.

306
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:49,522
Paul?
Paul, is thatyou?Hello?

307
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:51,892
You there?No? Oh.

308
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,524
Okay, listen. It's me, Mark, all right?
I'm atapayphone.

309
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:58,831
This isn'tan emergency, but I'llbe
here for the next couple ofminutes.

310
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:02,101
The numberhere is 822...

311
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:06,069
then there 's eithera 4
ora French 7.

312
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,408
- Leave it.
- Hello?

313
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,108
Hello? Paul? Paul?

314
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,981
Is that you? Oh.
I thought you were the machine.

315
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:16,748
- I'm not.
- Oh. Okay, listen.

316
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:20,189
Fran and I were at Zabarl's.
A new shipment ofspices just came in.

317
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:23,193
Fran wanted me to call and find out
ifyou needed any cumin.

318
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,895
- You're out?
- Yeah.

319
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,991
- You're out in the world?
- Yeah.

320
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,969
Anyway, listen. We werejust
at the Belgian Film Festival.

321
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:35,063
You went to the Belgian Film Festival?

322
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,937
- Yeah
- How-- Why?

323
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,137
Well, we went to the Quad Cinemas.
Number one was sold out.

324
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,146
Number twostartedtoo late.

325
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,012
Number three-- they only had seats
in the first five rows...

326
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,551
and you know Fran's neck, so we went
to the Belgian Film Festival.

327
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:48,984
Actually, it was pretty good.

328
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:51,488
Although it's a little confusing,
youknow?

329
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:55,492
I guess it makes sense when you find out
it's all supposed to be a dream...

330
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,528
butyou don't findthat out
until the veryend.

331
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:01,563
Hello? Paul?

332
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,828
It's not like it's Psycho.

333
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:06,302
I can't go if I know the end.
I told you that.

334
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:08,635
Fine, so we'll go see the quilts.
Let's just get out of here.

335
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,834
Here we go.
There's a revival of Citizen Kane.

336
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:14,436
Rosebud's his sled.
Let's go to the museum.

337
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,845
I really had my heart set on a movie.

338
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,940
- So my heart doesn't count?
- Who won the toss?

339
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,609
That only covered the Belgians.

340
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:23,711
Let's do something
neither of us want to do.

341
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:26,451
Oh, great. Like hiring your Cousin I ra's
band to play at our wedding.

342
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,460
- That was good.
- Lay offof I ra.

343
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,223
This is ridiculous.

344
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:35,027
You want to do your thing, I want
to do mine. Why don't wejust do it?

345
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:38,800
What, alone?

346
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,394
Why not?

347
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:43,172
That's true.

348
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:45,505
We used to do things alone
all the time, didn't we?

349
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:46,305
Yes.

350
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:48,608
We don't have to do
every little thing together.

351
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,614
Exactly. Look at my sister.
Look at Selby.

352
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:52,616
- Ifthey can do it--
- You know why?

353
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:55,380
Because they're not sitting around
waiting for somebody to hold their hand.

354
00:17:56,621 --> 00:18:00,955
Good foryou. So you know what?
Let's do that. I'll see you here later.

355
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:02,755
Okay.

356
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,024
Are you going?

357
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:08,157
Yeah.
Are you gonna go?

358
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,666
Yeah.

359
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:14,301
What, to the quilt thing?

360
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:17,034
Probably. I don't know.

361
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:19,706
Should I go with you?

362
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:25,075
I thought you wanted to see a movie.

363
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:29,010
Go. You go. Seriously.

364
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:40,321
That's exactly what they're doing.

365
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,693
My sister and Selby.

366
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:45,997
What?

367
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,938
They're waiting for someone
to hold their hand.

368
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:52,803
Maybe.

369
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:56,780
I mean, it's what I was doing,
running around in these stupid hats.

370
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,583
Hey, listen.

371
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:04,554
I was running around without a hat,
and it was no picnic either.

372
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:11,452
Come here.

373
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,293
Come here.

374
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,429
I have a quilt...

375
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,027
I want to show you.

376
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,871
Hi, we 're out. Leave a message,
and we 'll callyouback.

377
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,551
Youguys there?
It's me, Selby.

378
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:37,486
You'll love this.
I won the 10K.

379
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:48,332
Sorry about dinner.

380
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:52,025
- It was an effort.
- Thankyou.

381
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:54,037
No, I meant to eat it.
It was an effort.

382
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:01,170
You know something?
I can honestly say now...

383
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:05,012
I have read the Sunday paper
cover to cover.

384
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,744
- And?
- And...

385
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:09,218
I am just as stupid
as I was this morning.

386
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,621
Thankyou for a perfect Sunday.

387
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,392
Hey, could have been worse, you know.

388
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:23,059
No, I mean it. It was perfect.

389
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,863
- Seriously?
- Yes.

390
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:27,404
- You're not bored?
- No, are you?

391
00:20:27,472 --> 00:20:30,236
Am I b--
Are you kidding me?

392
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:32,674
I got you, I got potato chips.

393
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:34,678
How much better could this be?

394
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,714
This is the Weather Channel.

395
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,046
Oh, this is it.

396
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,053
This is my dream come true.

397
00:20:44,305 --> 00:21:44,272
