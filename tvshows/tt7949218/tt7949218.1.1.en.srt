Hush. Feel. I will talk.

The devil who killed my sister...

who preaches the Vision heresy,

- Physician.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

512
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:18,838
[QUEEN KANE] We've had
this conversation in the abstract.

513
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:22,342
Keep still. It is no secret that we spoke.

514
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,094
And once I asked you the question...

515
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:31,351
"Do you believe the evil power of light
can be passed into a child?"

516
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:35,522
No. I don't believe
it can be passed into a child.

00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,107
[QUEEN KANE] Don't lie to me.

I hear it.

519

It wastes so much time.

Caution, fear.

I honestly do not know.

523
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:02,799
Your Majesty, Jerlamarel is one man.

524
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:06,052
He served us food in this very room.

525
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:11,516
He was born to a slave,
and this power he told you he had...

526
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,854
perhaps he was a footman
attempting to impress his queen

527
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:20,150
with stories he'd heard in the cradle.

We have trouble here in our capital.

The holy power from the river is failing.

The people say we are losing God's favor.

Perhaps it's time
to bring our best soldiers home.

the evil of light
once almost destroyed the world.

Men used it to control and twist

Forests burned.
The air filled with poison.

we have crossed into a new world.

Paris, who is this man?

547
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:13,112
His name is Jerlamarel.

548
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:19,727
I knew him well, once.

549
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,147
He's a heretic.

550
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:29,237
The Witchfinders came in search of him
because he preaches a particular heresy.

551
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:35,827
He told me he has a power
that we would call magical or evil...

552
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:41,374
but which he says almost every human being
on earth once had.

553
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:45,003
He preaches that the God bone
we use for weapons and tools

554
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:49,507
was not made by the gods,
as we've been told.

555
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:53,928
Nor the eternal smooth that never rots.

556
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:56,931
Or the flat, straight mountains of Payan.

557
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:59,684
They were all made by humans.

558

Human beings like us, who all had
the same lost ability as he has.

Jerlamarel said
he could not explain it to me.

560
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:14,824
He only said he has the power to see.

561
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:22,848
And if we follow his instruction,
we will find sanctuary.

Then it is settled.

we will follow its path.

When the path beside the river disappears,

00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:18,346
we will walk in the water,
so no dogs can follow.
