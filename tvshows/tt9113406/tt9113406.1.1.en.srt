00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,344

mad Stapleton niggas

17
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:52,056

18
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:54,185
‐ I don't care how many
we gotta go through, son.

19
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,148
We dropping Dennis tonight.

20
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,111
Know what I mean?

21
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,584
<i>And if there's one thing
I'm sure of,</i>

22
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,713
<i>it's that drugs destroy your
mind and destroy your home.</i>

23
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:10,844
‐ I l‐love this s‐shit, nigga.

24
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,765
Hey, yo, you love that shit

25
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,810
How many times

26
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,814
I got you.

27
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:18,275
<i>They're filthy drug peddlers...</i>

28
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:19,820
Hey, yo, turn
that shit off, son.

29
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,240
It's time to eat. Come on, yo.

30
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,729

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,399
This shit mine, man.

32
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:54,515
- Y'all hungry?
- Y'all ready for this oatmeal?

33
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:55,851
This my comic?

34
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:57,938
Took my comic from me?

35
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,692
This is a old one.

36
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,488
This is right before
Tony Stark got paralyzed.

37
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,577
He was in a wheelchair too,
just like y'all,

38
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:07,416
but he was still a superhero.

39
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,966
‐ W‐what... h‐happened?

40
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,468
What happened.

41
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:14,931
He got shot.

42
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:26,244
Yeah, his ex‐girl
put one through him.

43
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:29,208
See, this nigga fucked up
all the bad guys,

44
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,131
the Hulk, whoever,

45
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:36,140
but in the end, all it took was a
crazy‐ass bitch to lay Iron Man down.

46
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,194
Fuck!

47
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:47,955
Yo, don't move! Don't move, son!

48
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:56,138
- Yo, come on, move.
- Get the fuck up out of here.

49
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,685
Yo. Yo, you hit?

50
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:01,231
Yo, you okay back there?

I'm okay. I'm okay.

52
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:15,677
<i>Shit! The cops came mad quick!</i>

53
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:17,764
Pull over right there.
Let me stash the TEC.

54
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:20,061
<i>Right here, right here!</i>

55
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,245
What's the deal, Sha?

56
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,708
Yo, what up, Bobby?

57
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,799
- You okay?
- Nigga.

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,886
You almost killed me.

59
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,473
Yo, my bad, son.

60
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,986
Shit, son.

61
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:12,916
Ma!

62
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:15,045
What is it?

63
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:17,885
Is it morning already?

64
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,977
Wake me in an hour.

65
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,756
Where you going?

66
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,828
Where you coming from?

67
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,587
Niggas had to put in work.

68
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:58,800
Yo, Bobby, I need you
to stash this shit for me.

69
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,610
Hey, yo, this shit is still hot.

70
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,221
Yo, what the fuck?

Yo, play that beat again, son.

Yo, D‐Love.

73

Yo, D‐Love.

74
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,270
- Let me get two for five.
- I ain't working.

75
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:32,523
Come on, man. Bless a nigga.

76
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,861
Yo, I said I ain't fucking working!

77
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,157
A'ight, yeah, nigga.

78
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:38,911
Red tops in the Hill is better

79
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,583
than your bullshit
blue tops anyway.

80
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:43,755
Fuck a Stapleton nigga!

81
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,834
Hey, yo, throw

82
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,921

you know what I'm saying?

83
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:07,552
Make my hair curl
like James Brown!

84
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,138
‐ One dollar more.

85
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,307
‐ Come on, sister Lee.

86
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:11,602
You know I love you.

87
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,523
You don't love nobody.

88
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:21,747
‐ What up, son?

89
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:23,585
‐ Shit just got real.

90
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,013
‐ Hey, this‐‐

91
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:32,852
this is what you should be
putting your work into.

92
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:35,315
Fuck the streets, nigga.

93
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,610
Nigga gotta eat.

94
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:40,701
Ain't making no bread
off of no music, son.

95
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,747
This is a hobby we picked up
in the lobby,

96
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,959
- you know what I mean?
- Hey.

97
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,006
I told you
in Miss Hoover's class.

98
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,346
We gonna make it big.

99
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,269
‐ Get the‐‐look, son.

100
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,068
Niggas is not in third grade.
Come on now.

101
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,246
Hey, yo, this shit crazy, Sha.

102
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,415
<i>What did you say?</i>

103
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,668
<i>Fight, damn it!</i>

104
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,880
You're lucky ain't no one
got hit,

105
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:10,218
but what'd you expect Power
and Sha was gonna do?

106
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,139
I can't let that shit
slide, Divine.

107
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,474
Look, Dennis.

108
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:15,019
You know I'd hit Power back
for you,

109
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,773
but we need to leave it alone
for right now.

110
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:19,738
We only a few grand away
from getting these bricks.

111
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,825
‐ Nah, 'Vine.

112
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,453
Fuck Power.

113
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:24,956
Fuck that bitch nigga Sha.

114
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,587
Fuck Park Hill.
Fuck all them niggas.

115
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,839
What about our rep?

116
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,924
‐ No, it's better to have
a rep in the streets

117
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,469
than a rep in jail.

118
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,307
‐ Hey, yo, pass the hot sauce,

119
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,738
Look, D, we gonna get
them niggas.

120
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,158
Trust me.

121
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:46,165
But business is first.

122
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,419
Yeah, them keys are coming
to Staten Island next week.

123
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,215
You know, no more having
to go Uptown

124
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,135
for our re‐up?

125
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,514
‐ Yeah, I heard that.

126
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:55,266
Well, hear me on this.

127
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:56,895
We focus on that cream,

128
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,067
then we let off that steam.

129
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:02,615
I want you and Ason
to do the pick‐ups

130
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,160
and the drop‐offs
with my brother tomorrow.

131
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:07,375
A'ight?

132
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,465
‐ You gonna finish
that beef and broccoli, yo?

133
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,720
‐ Yeah, nigga, I'm gonna finish
my beef and broccoli.

134
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,599
I'm just saying... you just ate up 
all that fucking chicken.

135
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,269
What the fuck you want
beef and broccoli for?

136
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,231
God damn it.

137
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:21,904
Eat my beef. You done fucked
up my whole appetite.

138
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,195
<i>Nah, nah.</i>

139
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,883
<i>Nah, can't just be about me.</i>

140
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,540
Fighting over
the same dollars...

141
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,439
Yeah, I like that shit.

142
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,985
Yeah.

143
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,418
Bobby, you still here?

144
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,179
Little bro.

145
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,310
Bobby, you're supposed
to be out there doing pickups.

146
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,566
Shit.

147
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:06,696
Hey, yo, what time is it?

148
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:07,698
No, never mind all that.

149
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,367
You're so focused
on your records,

150
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,039
you don't even know
what happened last night.

151
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,103
So what happened last night?

152
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,486
Dennis got his crib shot up.

153
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:29,784
Wait, what?

154
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:31,453
Yo, is everybody good? Is...

155
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:32,833
Yo, everyone was lucky.

156
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,509
A'ight, good, good.

157
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,600
Y'all figure anything out?

158
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,864
That track you were just playing...

159
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:50,618
who's running on it?

160
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:53,456
It was Sha.

161
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:57,006
And when'd y'all record that?

162
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,932
A while ago.

163
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:05,773
Why?

164
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,115
Go do your fucking pickups.

165
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:14,081
I'm going to bed.

166
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:27,106
Ooh, I'm telling Mommy!

167
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,277
You need to mind your business.

168
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,406
And make sure
you don't waste them eggs.

169
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,868
But I want Frosted Flakes.

170
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,079
You know better.

171
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,624
No sugar in the morning.

172
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,085
I'll ask Mommy.

173
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,922
She's sleeping
'cause she worked a double.

174
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:40,718
Do you really wanna wake her up?

175
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,224
Hey, what's going on over here?

176
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:45,602
Let me see
what this tasting like,

177
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:46,771
'cause you know
you ain't eating this.

178
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,357
You don't want that.

179
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,780
Hey! ‐ Hey.

180
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,660
Well, you know
Shurrie's the best cook.

181
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,289
‐ - I wish I had me a plate.

182
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,210
- ‐ It's on the stove.
- Thank you.

183
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,423
Y'all hurry up
and get to school, all right?

184
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:01,509
Y'all gonna be late.

185
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,388
Divine said you already are.

186
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:09,526
‐ Fuck.

187
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:14,952
Yo, Power, we gotta hit Dennis

188
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:17,415
before him and Divine hit us.

189
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,085
He ain't gonna hit us.

190
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,423
Not yet.
That's not Divine's way.

191
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:23,343
He on his suit‐and‐tie shit.

192
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,847
That nigga want
to be a businessman,

193
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:26,601
but the problem is, what we do

194
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:27,811
ain't no fucking business.

195
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,858
Know what I mean? It's a hustle.

196
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:32,821
‐ What's the difference?

197
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,825
‐ All niggas got
an expiration date.

198
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,413
We ain't here to build no business.
We here to beat the clock,

199
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,753
and you're a fool
if you think otherwise.

200
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,014
‐ We're all out.

201
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,518
‐ Indeed we are.

202
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,937
Where you headed?

203
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,607
‐ Home.

204
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,945
‐ Yo, I got you.

205
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,825
‐ No, I'ma walk it.

206
00:15:57,997 --> 00:15:59,083
Peace.

207
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,237
<i>The uniformed crew members
located on each deck.</i>

208
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:15,574
‐ So how the fuck y'all know

209
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,120
Sha was with him
in the first place?

210
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:20,292
I mean, he ain't
the only shooter on P's team.

211
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:27,681
You know that sneaky bastard be
everywhere with Power. Come on, cousin.

212
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:30,061
‐ Hey, yo, w‐when the last time
you seen him?

213
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:33,442
‐ I don't know.

214
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,530
It's been a minute.

215
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:36,908
‐ Yeah, well, I don't care

216
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:38,493
if y'all motherfuckers
go all the way back

217
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:41,667
to eatin' cupcakes
and fucking playing G.I. Joe

218
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,504
and shit.

219
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,217
I'ma peel that nigga's cap back.

220
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:50,227
It'd be done already if your
brother ain't pumped the brakes.

221
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,476
‐ Enjoy your trip. ‐ Thank you.

222
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,773
You rocking
that fake crown, son.

223
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,485
‐ It's just work shit.

224
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:23,960
‐ You some old chocolate deluxe‐type
sugarplum yum‐yum mama.

225
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:27,091
Shit, I'd love to rub your ass
in the moonshine.

226
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:31,099
When I look into those pretty
eyes, I can read your soul.

227
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,981
Says you're descended
from an Egyptian queen.

228
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,069
‐ All right, come on.
You're holding up my line‐‐

229
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,825
‐ Yo, I'm not leaving

230
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,204
until she give me her number.

231
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,792
Ready to handle this business?

232
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,669
This supposed to be 1,500.

233
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,879
‐ Shit was slow.

234
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,382
I mean, it should pick up
over the weekend.

235
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:10,427
‐ Come on, son. We ain't got
no time for games, nigga.

236
00:18:10,428 --> 00:18:12,139
Where the fuck the money at?

237
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,643
Where the money at, son?

238
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:15,187
- Come on, Bobby.
- What's wrong with your man?

239
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,190
‐ Hey, yo.

240
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,786
Bobby D, what it do?

241
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:24,163
‐ Shit, what up, Shotgun?

242
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:25,332
‐ Hey, yo, fam,

243
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,334
whatever y'all niggas
is doing here,

244
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:27,336
you can't be doing that.

245
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:28,463
This is a place of business.

246
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,217
‐ Yeah, our business.

247
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:31,344
‐ This ain't Stapleton.

248
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,931
‐ Yo, it ain't Park Hill
either, nigga.

249
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:34,058
‐ Relax.

250
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,562
‐ Check this out.
I live in Park Hill,

251
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,356
but I'm good everywhere.

252
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:40,154
I'm not with none of this
petty neighborhood bullshit.

253
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:42,534
So like I said, y'all got to go.

254
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:43,912
‐ Yo, who the fuck is you?

255
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,544
‐ Assistant manager.

256
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:49,046
‐ Yo, a'ight, a'ight, all right.

257
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:51,677
All right. Hey, chill out.

258
00:18:51,678 --> 00:18:53,724
Hey, Shotgun, let me holler
at you for a minute, a'ight?

259
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,478
Let me talk to you for a minute.

260
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,064
- ‐ Yeah, a'ight.
- Yeah.

261
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,028
Let us just have five minutes.

262
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,787
Laying some new beats.

263
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:06,372
Just come by the lab
and maybe you can record

264
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:07,710
some of that heat, nigga.

265
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,095
‐ Lunch break over
in two minutes, man.

266
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:21,402
‐ Hey, yo, you better have the
rest of that cheese by Sunday.

267
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,447
A'ight?

268
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,085
You gotta stop letting
niggas slide all the time.

269
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,046
Yo, what you buy?

270
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:32,174
‐ Some pussy!

271
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:34,513
Hey, yo, she gave me
a few rolls of film for free!

272
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,433
Nigga, you don't even got
a camera, bro.

273
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:44,490
<i>A man must
attain knowledge of himself</i>

274
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:47,664
<i>in order to survive here in the
wilderness of North America.</i>

275
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:50,335
Black people
are the original people

276
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:51,964
and the fathers of the universe,

277
00:19:51,965 --> 00:19:54,887
and we out here teaching
everything other than our word!

278
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,347
So.

279
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:59,020
‐ Hey, yo, I can't believe
you let the assistant manager

280
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,107
punk us like that, son.

281
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:02,359
‐ Yeah, whatever, yo.

282
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,779
‐ Man, whatever? ‐ Yeah.

283
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,032
‐ Your brother need
all his money

284
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,660
if he gonna cop that brick,
know what I mean?

285
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,706
Don't be talking to me
about my brother, yo.

286
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,670
Hey, Bobby!

287
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,549
I'ma catch y'all niggas later, man.

288
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,595
‐ What's up? ‐ Yo, you serious?

289
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:18,099
Trying to stop
and play games and shit?

290
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,978
Ain't you got <i>Monopoly</i>
at home, nigga?

291
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,064
Yo, I wanna be
the thimble piece.

292
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,358
Hey, yo, chill.

293
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,572
I told y'all niggas
I'ma catch y'all later.

294
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:27,578
A'ight, son. Yo.

295
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:32,712
Been a while since I took
your money, youngblood.

296
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:35,342
‐ You ain't taking nothing
from me today.

297
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:36,971
A'ight? ‐ Well, well.

298
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,308
Let's get it on.
Let's get it on.

299
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,937
Yeah.

300
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:44,068
‐ Yo, homeboy,
let me get a dime bag.

301
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:45,530
‐ What?

302
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:47,200
‐ Weed, man.

303
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:50,916
‐ Hey, wrong homeboy.

304
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:55,340
Yo, can you believe that shit?

305
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:58,264
‐ You sure
you ain't that homeboy?

306
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:00,561
‐ That ain't me.

307
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:04,651
‐ Who are you, then?

308
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:07,657
‐ There's stuff I gotta do,

309
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:09,661
for my family,

310
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:12,042
but I do be having
other shit on my mind.

311
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:16,258
‐ Clearly.

312
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,394
‐ I be hearing music in my head

313
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,066
all day long.

314
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,698
And I get lost in that shit.

315
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:31,706
I love it.

316
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,842
And I get pulled out
'cause of, you know,

317
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,847
business...

318
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,191
‐ Like a splash of cold water
on your face.

319
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:50,408
‐ Yeah, man.
Something like that.

320
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:56,797
‐ Well, it's nobody else's job
to chase your dreams for you.

321
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,801
Sounds to me

322
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:01,515
like you're out here,
doing somebody else's business

323
00:22:01,516 --> 00:22:04,186
and not your own.

324
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:06,233
Speaking of business.

325
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,532
Checkmate.

326
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:28,484
- What up, 'Rie?
- Hey.

327
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,489
What up, Ran‐D. M. C.?

328
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,080
Hey.

329
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,793
What happened?

330
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:38,088
‐ School.

331
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,344
‐ Yeah?

332
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:42,847
Was somebody messing with you?

333
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:45,018
You take them out like Mike?

334
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,813
‐ Nah, Shurrie did.

335
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:49,736
Clotheslined him
like Rowdy Roddy Piper.

336
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:51,823
The whole schoolyard laughed.

337
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,035
‐ Hell, yeah.

338
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:55,790
Who is, ‐‐

339
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,752
who's Mom talking to upstairs?

340
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,171
‐ Jerome.

341
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:02,010
Something about putting
more money on his commissary.

342
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:04,056
Bobby, is that you?

343
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,059
Yeah.

344
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:09,859
‐ Well, what do you
expect me to do?

345
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,405
I got my hands full here.

346
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:16,038
Baby, I need you to hurry
and put my numbers in.

347
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,875
They close in 20 minutes.

348
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,963
Here.

349
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:23,303
Play, um, Randy's‐‐
‐ Randy's birthday.

350
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:24,389
Straight.

351
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:27,437
What about your mother?

352
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:46,390
Fucking ass over here!

353
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,687
Give me the... where is my shit?
‐ No! No!

354
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,191
Where's my money?

355
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:53,488
Yo, yo, yo. Chill out.

356
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,200
‐ What the fuck you doing?
Mind your fucking business.

357
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,748
Better watch who the fuck
you talking to, nigga.

358
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:04,512
Yo, walk that fucking shit off, nigga.

359
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:11,859
It's okay.

360
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,088
No!

361
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,052
<i>No!</i>

362
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:28,224
<i>No!</i>

363
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,352
<i>No!</i>

364
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:31,982
<i>No!</i>

365
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:33,110
‐ Mother‐‐

366
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,241
Damn it!

367
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,455
<i>Why do I have to go?</i>

368
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:41,042
Don't make Mommy cry.

369
00:24:42,462 --> 00:24:43,882
<i>It's for the best.</i>

370
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:51,522
<i>No! No! No! No! No!</i>

371
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:43,332
‐ Hey, who's that DJ, Kid Capri?

372
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,419
I don't know.

373
00:25:57,904 --> 00:26:00,199
‐ Hey, what is this?

374
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,039
‐ It's an SP‐1200 drum machine

375
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,211
with a built‐in
ten‐second sampler.

376
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:08,592
This thing never makes
a timing error.

377
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,011
‐ How much?

378
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:12,141
‐ 2,000 bucks out the door.

379
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:16,984
I gotta try this shit out.

380
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,084
Yeah, fuck all that, son.

381
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,777
Yo.

382
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,740
Look who decided to show up.

383
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:03,492
‐ I need to ask you something.

384
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:05,496
‐ About?

385
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:06,916
‐ I need an advance.

386
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,294
You come up short on pickups,

387
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,215
and you asking for an advance?

388
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:17,647
A'ight, so how much?

389
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:23,199
- ‐ 2,000.
- You're fucking with me.

390
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,997
The fuck you need $2,000 for?

391
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,421
‐ It's for
this new beat machine.

392
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:32,635
Look, I'm telling you, this
shit is a fucking game‐changer.

393
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:34,931
I mean, the‐‐
the quality of demos

394
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:37,228
I can make off of this shit
is fucking...

395
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:41,026
Hey, yo.

396
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,905
My little brother

397
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:45,911
needs 2 Gs for a drum machine.

398
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:47,413
Who got 'em?

399
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:49,585
Hey, yo, fuck you need
a drum machine for, son?

400
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,213
You got the human beatboxer
right here!

401
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:52,216
Hey, yo, check it out. Hold on.

402
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:56,516
Yo, check it.

403
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:59,272
And all that costs you
is a 40 of Olde E.

404
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:26,702
- Shit.
- Here comes Jah Son.

405
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:29,750
This nigga tripping.

406
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,840
- Bobby D, what up?
- Yo, what up, Jah?

407
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:35,468
‐ Nigga, I just got me
a quarter uptown,

408
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:37,013
all feeling
like motherfucking Scarface

409
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:38,390
in this bitch, nigga.

410
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:40,938
This shit fucking... fucking weigh a ton.

411
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:43,902
Hey, yo, move your fucking car!

412
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:45,404
No, they not fucking honking me.

413
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:47,158
- They wanna play with me?
- Yo!

414
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,703
‐ They wanna fucking play
with me?

415
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:50,874
Let's show them some fucking
play rough, motherfucker.

416
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:53,380
Shit, what's good?

417
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:56,678
Nigga, what's up?

418
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,599
‐ Nigga, I know
this motherfucker.

419
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:03,107
Damn, I almost blew
your fucking head off, B.

420
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,486
Stop fucking around, nigga.
Seriously, you too, nigga?

421
00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,366
Man, you wild, Jah.

422
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:30,031
You're burning it.

423
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:35,207
Shurrie, you hear me?

424
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,129
Divine likes his skin crispy.

425
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:40,594
‐ All right, I'ma be late
for my shift.

426
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:42,097
‐ Don't forget your purse.

427
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,108
Hey, Mommy.

428
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:50,279
If you got the rent, I can drop it
off on my way to the Rib Shack.

429
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,325
‐ No, no, I already paid it,
all right?

430
00:30:52,326 --> 00:30:53,578
<i>Wasn't Cross Colours, even.</i>

431
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:54,955
The nigga Jah Son

432
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:57,794
came out the whip
like Rainbow Man,

433
00:30:57,795 --> 00:30:59,840
like one of them clowns
in the circus or some shit.

434
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:02,011
‐ Yo, like, ‐‐like, ‐‐
like Ronald McDonald.

435
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:03,221
‐ Yeah!

436
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:04,475
‐ Happy Meal.

437
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:06,979
‐ All he needed
was the red afro.

438
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,775
You know?

439
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:10,111
‐ Eat your food.

440
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:13,701
You save me a plate?

441
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:15,371
‐ ‐ On the stove.

442
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:17,041
He was bullying him.

443
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,962
He need to learn how to fight
for himself, don't he?

444
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,549
He gotta learn right now.

445
00:31:23,304 --> 00:31:25,767
Whoo, this is that shit.

446
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,187
Shit.

447
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:45,098
‐ Turn it off.

448
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,916
‐ Yo.

449
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,378
Yo, why you bugging?

450
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:04,596
‐ Go finish your homework.

451
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:06,933
‐ I did already.

452
00:32:09,814 --> 00:32:11,399
‐ Come on.

453
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,280
I'll see y'all. I gotta
get home to my brothers.

454
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,365
I'ma catch ya.

455
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,079
- ‐ All right.
- Later, D.

456
00:32:27,307 --> 00:32:30,062
‐ Kilos are coming
to Staten Island

457
00:32:30,063 --> 00:32:33,401
for the first time in whenever.

458
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:37,869
Now, you know how long I've been
stacking up my chips for this.

459
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,961
We get our hands
on a whole key and flip it.

460
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,842
Now, that's some life‐changing
shit right there.

461
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:47,514
‐ Right, so what?

462
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:49,935
So you flip that shit,
and then you give me the money.

463
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:52,231
‐ You want more money to buy
your little music machine

464
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:54,235
or whatever, then bro,
you need to put in work.

465
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:55,738
‐ I put in work.

466
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:58,160
‐ No, you‐‐
you put in part‐time.

467
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:00,205
This work we do‐‐

468
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:02,042
it's all for family.

469
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:05,592
Now, you only family part‐time?
Is that what you're saying?

470
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:08,514
Now, we out there at war
with Power and Park Hill

471
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:11,437
while you down in the basement
with Gladys Knight.

472
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:14,860
They tried to wet D.

473
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:18,158
You think they won't try
and touch you?

474
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,662
‐ I don't know.

475
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,209
I don't roll like D.

476
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:26,217
‐ Yeah, that's right. You don't.

477
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,602
See, I remember when you and Sha

478
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:34,398
were shorties,
chewing Bubble Yum together.

479
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,198
That's the only reason I've been
giving that little nigga a pass.

480
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:42,414
But if he had anything to do
with that move on D,

481
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:45,295
yeah, it ain't gonna be his bubble
that gets popped. Know what I mean?

482
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:47,802
‐ Yo, Sha ain't have nothing
to do with that shit.

483
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:50,139
All right?

484
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,854
Right, we just trying
to make music, yo.

485
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:56,610
It must be nice to have dreams?

486
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:59,240
But they ain't real.

487
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,745
This house is real.

488
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,164
That food on your plate,

489
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:05,545
the money that pays
for all of it,

490
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,298
is real.

491
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,637
‐ Your way ain't
the only way, 'Vine.

492
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,539
‐ You know the other thing
about dreams

493
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,878
is that they're there
for you to wake up from.

494
00:34:27,923 --> 00:34:29,635
You wanna make it in this world?

495
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,060
Then put in the fucking work.

496
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:36,022
Tomorrow, when I page you,

497
00:34:36,023 --> 00:34:38,069
it's on you to go get the re‐up.

498
00:34:43,496 --> 00:34:45,123
Hey, yo, going to North Carolina

499
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,838
was the worst thing that
could've ever happened to you.

500
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:04,789
<i>Travel time
is approximately 17 hours...</i>

501
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:08,839
<i>Thirty minutes...</i>

502
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:18,567
‐ Bobby?

503
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:22,616
You remember me?

504
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:26,624
I'm your Uncle Hollis.

505
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:34,264
<i>Welcome to your new home.</i>

506
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:40,693
Where we're at,

507
00:35:40,694 --> 00:35:42,864
you speak when you're spoken to.

508
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:45,703
You say "yes" and "sir."

509
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:48,918
<i>Understand?</i>

510
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:50,672
‐ Yes, sir.

511
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:53,970
‐ All right.

512
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:17,600
This is my sister Goldie.

513
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,688
She looks over my properties.

514
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:20,774
‐ Hello.

515
00:36:23,822 --> 00:36:26,535
Hello, ma'am.

516
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:28,581
‐ We're happy
to have you, Bobby.

517
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:30,794
I'ma feed y'all
after I feed the chickens.

518
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:49,204
‐ Did you brush your teeth?

519
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:51,794
‐ Yeah‐‐yes, sir.

520
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:54,675
‐ Turn that off.

521
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:04,027
Good night, Bobby.

522
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:04,773
<i>This thing never‐ver‐ver‐‐</i>

523
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:06,485
<i>never makes a timing error.</i>

524
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:54,747
Yo, we sold out.

525
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:57,044
Shit was popping last night.

526
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,102
‐ Yo, that ain't gonna fit, man.

527
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:36,623
You put it back now, I won't
report you to the manager.

528
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,003
Otherwise, he gonna ban you
from the store.

529
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,303
All right?

530
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:00,963
<i>I told them niggas,
they need to stay</i>

531
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:02,925
<i>near their fucking‐‐
their fucking beepers, man.</i>

532
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:05,096
That's what I fucking told them.

533
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:06,432
Telling you, if you don't re‐up

534
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,227
in the next 30,

535
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:09,564
these fiends'll go over
to the Hill

536
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:11,150
and cop them red tops.

537
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:13,280
‐ Yo, fucking Bobby
ain't call me back.

538
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:17,120
Hey, I'ma‐‐I'ma hit D up.

539
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:18,875
A'ight.

540
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,482
‐ Hey, yo, where Randy at?

541
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:33,070
‐ At his friend's,
like I told you already.

542
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:40,709
Come on.
My mom's gonna be home soon!

543
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,087
We don't have much time.

544
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:43,757
- My...
- Fuck.

545
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,720
Fuck.

546
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:51,397
‐ Yeah.

547
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:53,861
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

548
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:01,041
‐ What's up, baby?

549
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,043
‐ Yo, you seen where D at?

550
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,254
I paged him an hour ago

551
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,298
and he ain't hit me back yet.

552
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:09,099
Yo, head back to the spot,
a'ight?

553
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,813
‐ You bet.

554
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:14,067
‐ Hey, you sure you want this
fiend looking after the spot?

555
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:15,904
‐ Fuck you, old
Grimace‐looking motherfucker.

556
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:17,323
You know I ain't no fucking fiend.
Okay, nigga.

557
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:18,577
You can't take
a fucking joke, nigga?

558
00:41:18,578 --> 00:41:20,455
‐ Man, fuck you.
‐ Nigga, it's a fucking joke.

559
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:22,500
Fucking take it. It's not
a fucking dick, a'ight?

560
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:24,337
‐ Come on, man. You know I
ain't no fucking fiend.

561
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:26,926
‐ Hey, maybe so, but you looking
kind of fiendish to me.

562
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,682
Look at him, nigga.
That's a crackhead.

563
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:31,728
‐ Come on, man. Fuck what
he talking about, man?

564
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:35,360
Who making the drop,
Bobby or D‐Love?

565
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:39,452
‐ I'll do it my damn self.

566
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:43,083
‐ Hey, you want me to
come with you? Nah.

567
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,377
‐ Nigga, sit your ugly ass
down, bro.

568
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:45,714
Nobody need your shit no more.

569
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:47,091
Fuck you, Grimace!
‐ Stay off the crack.

570
00:41:47,092 --> 00:41:49,012
Visit your mom, nigga.
I know she fucking miss you.

571
00:41:49,013 --> 00:41:50,224
She told me that shit
last night.

572
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:53,395
<i>I spoke with Haze, and he said</i>

573
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:54,941
<i>Cressy and his team
is all set up.</i>

574
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:57,571
A'ight, Bricks is on the Rock.

575
00:41:57,572 --> 00:41:59,449
‐ Word.

576
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,788
Shit, it sound
like we all good, then.

577
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,417
‐ Yeah, but yo,

578
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:06,213
I wanna settle
that other problem first,

579
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:07,550
know what I mean?

580
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,010
I don't want
these Stapleton niggas

581
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:11,139
making a come‐up.

582
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,603
Hey, fucking Haze is cool
with Divine,

583
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:16,818
so I'm assuming he'll be
setting up business with him.

584
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:18,446
Where you stash the TEC?

585
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:23,832
‐ The chick house. She good.

586
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,670
‐ Go on and get that back.

587
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,062
I want Dennis in the ground by
the end of the week, my nigga.

588
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:37,527
A'ight? Take these
niggas' strength away.

589
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:47,631
‐ Shit.

590
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,143
Fuck.

591
00:42:55,354 --> 00:42:56,899
Fuck.

592
00:42:59,738 --> 00:43:01,157
Shit.

593
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:46,456
‐ Sheba, stay.

594
00:44:26,118 --> 00:44:27,370
‐ I thought Bobby was coming.

595
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:28,706
‐ No, instead you got me.

596
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,210
‐ Okay.

597
00:44:48,706 --> 00:44:51,501
Yo, you got this
for you little brother

598
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:53,088
but you can't hook me up
with one, too?

599
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,051
‐ No, I gotta go.

600
00:44:58,182 --> 00:44:59,768
‐ Yo, let me hit it again.

601
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,772
Your bonbons still hard.

602
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:03,066
‐ Get out of here. ‐

603
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,277
‐ Yo, Shurrie‐‐
‐ My mom gonna be home soon.

604
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:05,363
‐ Come on.

605
00:45:46,153 --> 00:45:50,285
Okay. Okay!

606
00:45:50,286 --> 00:45:51,747
All right, I'll see you later.

607
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,209
‐ Bye.

608
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:45,062
‐ For real?

609
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:48,945
‐ Nia, I'll be right back.

610
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:51,032
‐ You promise?

611
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:53,161
‐ Yeah, yeah, sure, dear.
I promise.

612
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:54,206
Okay.

613
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:20,048
If New Jersey
would've won that boat race,

614
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:22,303
then this rock
we call Staten Island

615
00:47:22,304 --> 00:47:24,098
would be a part of New Jersey,

616
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:26,687
and all the micks from Bayonne
would've moved in here,

617
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:27,982
and that's a fact.

618
00:47:30,654 --> 00:47:32,782
Hey, Cocoa Puff!

619
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,410
Get the hell out of here!

620
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:36,039
I catch you playing
with that again,

621
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,882
I'm gonna break
your little fingers!

622
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:43,804
How do you expect them
to learn that way?

623
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:45,767
‐ When are you gonna learn
to listen to your doctor,

624
00:47:45,768 --> 00:47:47,479
quit smoking?

625
00:47:50,736 --> 00:47:52,864
‐ Yeah, yeah. Hello, yeah.

626
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:54,702
Yeah, she's here. Yeah, hold on.

627
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,415
‐ Hello?

628
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:10,733
Divine, baby.

629
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:12,737
You okay?

630
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,241
‐ Yeah, Mom. I'm okay.

631
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:16,954
Yeah.

632
00:48:16,955 --> 00:48:18,667
Put Bobby on.

633
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:26,014
‐ Divine, I'm sorry, man.
I was‐‐I was just trying to‐‐

634
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:27,559
<i>There ain't no time for that.</i>

635
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,353
Yo, you and D
can apologize to me

636
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:31,441
after you get me out of here.

637
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:32,944
<i>All right, well,
your bail is 250,</i>

638
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:34,656
<i>and we still gotta get that 10%.</i>

639
00:48:34,657 --> 00:48:36,827
You know, Ma's trying
to get you a lawyer, so‐‐

640
00:48:36,828 --> 00:48:39,081
<i>No, we can't afford to have our
cream tied up in the system</i>

641
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,417
or with no lawyer.

642
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,714
Now, we need to use that money
on that cake.

643
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:44,593
You know what I'm saying?

644
00:48:44,594 --> 00:48:46,638
‐ Yeah, but we‐‐
we gotta get you out.

645
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:47,974
<i>No, we need a roof over our head</i>

646
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,519
<i>and food on our table first,</i>

647
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,899
<i>so don't talk to me
about bail or no lawyer.</i>

648
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,694
<i>You need to put that money
to work.</i>

649
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:54,821
<i>You, Bobby.</i>

650
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:56,032
<i>You need to do that,</i>

651
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,827
<i>or we ain't gonna have no house.</i>

652
00:48:57,828 --> 00:48:59,413
<i>We ain't gonna have nothing.</i>

653
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:02,378
<i>You gotta be the man now,
whether you like it or not.</i>

654
00:49:02,379 --> 00:49:03,590
<i>A'ight?</i>

655
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,056
‐ Yeah.

656
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:09,184
Yeah, I hear you.

657
00:49:10,395 --> 00:49:12,649
‐ Yo, money,
Dougie Fresh time in here.

658
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,943
Six minutes and off.

659
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:15,445
Hang it the fuck up!

660
00:49:15,446 --> 00:49:17,575
‐ Hey, yo.

661
00:49:17,576 --> 00:49:19,664
Put D on.

662
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,254
‐ Yo.

663
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:27,846
‐ Yo, fam, you good?

664
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:29,683
Them BK niggas
trying to press hard?

665
00:49:29,684 --> 00:49:31,603
<i>- It is what it is.
- Listen,</i>

666
00:49:31,604 --> 00:49:33,941
we continue with the movement.

667
00:49:33,942 --> 00:49:35,485
Fl‐zip that cake fast,

668
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,030
and then we can talk
about b‐zail.

669
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:38,324
Six minutes is up.

670
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:39,828
‐ Yeah, my brother

671
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:41,247
can have his head
up in the clouds,

672
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:43,460
so I'ma need you
to be my boots on the ground.

673
00:49:43,461 --> 00:49:44,838
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

674
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:46,843
- ‐ Word is bond.
<i>- A'ight.</i>

675
00:49:48,345 --> 00:49:50,224
‐ Six minutes is up, Staten!

676
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:54,231
‐ Yo, 'Vine.

677
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:55,526
Yo, 'Vine.

678
00:49:55,527 --> 00:49:56,528
‐ What's happening?

679
00:49:56,529 --> 00:49:58,031
‐ Yo.

680
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:59,577
'Vine. What's
happening to my baby?

681
00:50:01,246 --> 00:50:02,372
‐ 'Vine.

682
00:50:02,373 --> 00:50:03,960
‐ What's happening to my baby?

683
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,136
<i>No, please, Auntie, no!</i>

684
00:50:09,137 --> 00:50:13,144
<i>Are you gonna forget</i>

685
00:50:13,145 --> 00:50:16,777
to turn the lights off

686
00:50:16,778 --> 00:50:18,363
<i>in your room?</i>

687
00:50:18,364 --> 00:50:20,075
‐ No, ma'am!

688
00:50:20,076 --> 00:50:22,789
No, please, Auntie, no!

689
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,794
That's right.

690
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,072
Now, what's this I hear

691
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:25,873
about you keeping
the light on all night?

692
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,796
Goldie sleeps
with the window open,

693
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:32,052
and those mosquitoes
be feasting on her.

694
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:33,764
‐ There's demons in my room.

695
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:35,100
They be there in the dark.

696
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:39,067
‐ Okay, no more horror movies
for you.

697
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:46,790
‐ If God made light,
why does darkness still exist?

698
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:51,006
‐ Actually, Bobby,
light is always shining.

699
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,467
It's just that we turn ourselves

700
00:51:52,468 --> 00:51:53,846
away from it

701
00:51:53,847 --> 00:51:55,306
and end up in the shadow

702
00:51:55,307 --> 00:51:58,772
of something that blocks
the light.

703
00:51:58,773 --> 00:52:03,239
Sometimes, it's our own shadows.

704
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,118
Look around the room, Bobby.

705
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,622
Y‐you see the bookcase?

706
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,460
‐ Yes, sir.

707
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:11,674
‐ See the closet? ‐ ‐

708
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:20,566
‐ What's in the dark
is also in the light.

709
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:23,197
It's just your perception
that changes.

710
00:52:24,992 --> 00:52:26,870
See?

711
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:28,707
Everything the same.

712
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:33,382
‐ So the demon in my closet
was just my imagination?

713
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,552
Yep.

714
00:52:34,553 --> 00:52:38,351
The largest nation
is the imagination.

715
00:52:38,352 --> 00:52:41,775
It can be your greatest enemy,

716
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:45,616
but if you have control of it

717
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:48,120
and you understand
how to use it,

718
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:50,333
it becomes your greatest weapon.

719
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,420
‐ You're saying

720
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:55,468
your imagination
is like a superpower.

721
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:59,393
Well, that's one way to put it.

722
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:03,652
Now, get you some rest.

723
00:53:03,653 --> 00:53:05,114
‐ Yes, sir.

724
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:13,590
Boo!

725
00:53:16,428 --> 00:53:18,515
‐ HOLLIS: Good night, Bobby.

726
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:20,351
‐ Night, Uncle Hollis.

727
00:53:20,352 --> 00:53:21,689
Love you!

728
00:53:54,045 --> 00:53:55,631
Can't believe 'Vine
gotta do a bid

729
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,054
right before the keys are finally
coming to Staten Island.

730
00:53:59,055 --> 00:54:01,183
‐ Hey, stop saying that shit.

731
00:54:01,184 --> 00:54:03,312
He might get off.

732
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:05,109
‐ Yo, with what he had on him?

733
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:08,239
Ain't no way he walking,

734
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,620
unless he snitching,
and Vine ain't no snitch.

735
00:54:17,926 --> 00:54:20,221
Hey, yo, h‐how many years
you think he gonna get?

736
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:21,599
I don't know!

737
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,727
I look like a fucking lawyer?

738
00:54:22,728 --> 00:54:24,690
Use your imagination, nigga.

739
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,328
Hey, yo, it coulda been
me or you that got picked up.

740
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:33,915
‐ Maybe.

741
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:37,130
Maybe, or if me and you
were around,

742
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:38,926
no one would've got bagged.

743
00:55:21,804 --> 00:55:23,724
‐ Hey, yo, when y'all get this?

744
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,021
‐ Shit, yo.

745
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:28,440
That's...

746
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,946
I be having that for a minute.

747
00:55:30,947 --> 00:55:33,284
‐ From where?

748
00:55:33,285 --> 00:55:35,956
‐ My cousin Gary's man
out in Brooklyn.

749
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,333
Repo man was coming for his car,

750
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,837
so I got it for cheap.

751
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:40,507
And you ain't never
shown me this shit, son?

752
00:55:40,508 --> 00:55:42,721
This shit fire!

753
00:55:44,223 --> 00:55:45,810
‐ Yeah.

754
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:47,897
Let me see that shit, nigga.

755
00:55:47,898 --> 00:55:50,318
‐ Nah.

756
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,992
This exactly
what I been needing.

757
00:55:53,993 --> 00:55:56,455
‐ For what?

758
00:55:56,456 --> 00:56:00,422
‐ To hit back at Power
and your boy Sha.

759
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,553
‐ I thought Divine said
to deck that shit.

760
00:56:03,554 --> 00:56:06,058
Well, 'Vine ain't here
right now, is he?

761
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:08,354
We in charge,

762
00:56:08,355 --> 00:56:11,109
and the first order of business

763
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,823
is we getting them niggas back.

764
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:15,953
<i>Attempt to fan our rivalry!</i>

765
00:56:15,954 --> 00:56:17,288
<i>I don't give a damn.</i>

766
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:19,335
<i>‐ So you do want us
to kill each other.</i>

767
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,473
<i>‐ That's right.
I want you to fight</i>

768
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:27,602
<i>till one of you dies.</i>

769
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:40,711
<i>Take you on
this lyrical high real quick.</i>

770
00:56:40,712 --> 00:56:44,467
<i>1993 exoticness.</i>

771
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,179
<i>Know what I'm saying?</i>

772
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,852
<i>Let's get technical.</i>

773
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:50,605
<i>Where's your bone at?</i>

774
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:52,484
<i>Get up on that shit, a'ight?</i>

775
00:57:55,485 --> 00:57:56,989
<i>Get on the line.</i>

776
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,761
<i>It's Staten Island...</i>

777
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:10,098
Against the world.

778
00:58:12,812 --> 00:58:17,069
I told you, Bobby, you got
to step up and make decisions.

779
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,823
We in charge now.

780
00:58:18,824 --> 00:58:20,785
‐ When there's a war in the
streets, nobody makes money.

781
00:58:20,786 --> 00:58:22,706
‐ But when that war is over,
it's winner take all.

782
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,084
‐ Truth.

783
00:58:28,761 --> 00:58:31,139
When y'all gonna start
making more music together?

784
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,601
‐ Nah, I'm good.

785
00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:35,982
‐ He shot at my crib where
my moms and my brothers stay.

786
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:39,365
When I catch up with Sha...

787
00:58:41,954 --> 00:58:44,332
‐ You got Divine's bail?
‐ We don't have enough yet.

788
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,710
‐ Where you been at lately?

789
00:58:45,711 --> 00:58:47,129
<i>Hey, yo, I'm out here
putting in work.</i>

790
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,092
‐ What would Bobby think?
‐ You want to tell him?

791
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:51,221
‐ Yo, battle on the island, son.

792
00:58:51,222 --> 00:58:53,935
<i>The winner
of the battle gets $5,000?</i>

793
00:58:53,936 --> 00:58:55,230
‐ Let the battle begin.

794
00:58:57,276 --> 00:58:59,445
<i>- Here we are again...</i>
- ‐

795
00:58:59,446 --> 00:59:02,118
<i>Another mother's son
has been taken from us.</i>

796
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:04,247
‐ I'm sick of this. ‐ What?

797
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:06,459
<i>You got to tell her.
You can't just be trifling with it.</i>

798
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,755
<i>You're looking at 20 years.</i>

799
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:11,721
‐ It's not just you up in here.
It's us.

800
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:13,641
<i>I'm gonna step it up, Ma.</i>

801
00:59:13,642 --> 00:59:15,478
‐ You control your fate.

802
00:59:19,028 --> 00:59:22,199
‐ Them tapes swarming in the
hood like killer bees and shit.

803
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,244
‐ Damn, son.

804
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:31,594
Put on a good show. It doesn't
matter if there's two people today.

805
00:59:31,595 --> 00:59:34,183
Tomorrow there's gonna be 200
and then 2,000.

806
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:44,035
<i>We coming together.</i>

807
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:46,541
