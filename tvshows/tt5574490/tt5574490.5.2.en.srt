Your copies of
Smurf's will.

3
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:06,005
You should read it.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,007
What the hell is this?
Who the hell is Pamela Johnson?

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,675
I have the current address
for Pam,

6

phone number,
police records.

You did.

go to jail for 20 years.

9

10
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,884
and he starts asking questions
about you and your brothers.

11
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,219
Adrian: So what's the plan?
Indonesia?

12
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,688
Great surfing,
no extradition treaty.

13
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,023
Is that our only choice?

14
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,358
You'll be dealing
with me now.

15
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,426
Your uncles know you planning
on running things?

16
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,895
They will.
Alright.

17
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,030
How's the kid?

18
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,098
I think he's yours.

19
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,767
I'll make sure that everything's
ready for you both

20
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,501
when you come back
to the house.

21
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,771
How come you didn't tell me
you saw Angela

22
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,040
when I was looking
for her yesterday?

23
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,241
J: I know that
you care about her.

24
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,909
But this is
what she does.

25
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,911
She gets sober and then
she falls right back in.

26
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,112
Just like my mom.

27
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,647
What do you want to do
about her ashes?

28
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,915
Deran:
She bought us those burial plots

29
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,316
where she moved Julia.

30
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,451
We'll also be there.

31
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,453
Just seems kind of boring
for Smurf.

32
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,856
I don't think all this
moving around is good.

33
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,059
-Why?
-I think Andrew needs more.

34
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,994
What?
More something.

35
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,730

checking back.

Is this Pope?

She doesn't
live here anymore.

00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:12,191
I'm her parole officer,

since she's checked in.

67
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,661
I'm gonna have to report her
as non-compliant

68
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,731
and issue a warrant for her
arrest if she doesn't show up.

I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

He's been showing up?

71

Few times.

72
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,009
Does she have a key
to the house?

73
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,215
Alright, we should
change the locks.

I know you're disappointed
by the way

101
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,317
your mother chose
to structure her estate,

102
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,985
but she had the right
to distribute her assets

however she wanted.

104

She was ill.

105
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:23,922
Can we contest
based on the fact

106
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,658
that she was on a lot
of painkillers and medication?

Ms. Cody had me
draw this up four weeks ago.

00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,062
She was lucid
and very clear

on how she wanted
her estate distributed.

110
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,399
So we have no grounds
to contest?

111
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,335
