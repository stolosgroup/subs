I'm waking up places.
I don't know how I got there.

824
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:37,496
I don't remember
what happened.

825
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:39,031
Okay.

826
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:40,032
I'm confused.

827
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,834
Okay, then, let's go
to the doctor.

828
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:43,502
We'll talk to a doctor.
We'll see what they say.

829
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,571
They picked me up at
some trailer park.

830
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:48,240
And I go back to get my truck,

831
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:50,308
and they said that
I'm -- I'm wandering around,

832
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,978
knocking on doors...

833
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,046
looking for Julia.

834
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:56,582
What?

835
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:58,917
I'm blacking out!
I'm looking for ghosts!

836
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,118
I'm hearing voices!

837
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,521
I'm hearing Smurf's
voice in my head!

838
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:06,058
Everywhere I look,
I see her everywhere!

839
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:17,403
I can't stay.

840
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:18,938
Hey.

841
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:23,009
Listen to me.

842
00:42:23,011 --> 00:42:25,077
If you want to go,
you can go.

843
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,613
I get it, all right?

844
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:32,218
I mean, you know, you've had
our backs for so long.

845
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,354
Now we have yours, okay?

846
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:37,623
You just -- You just go
do what you need to do,

847
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,492
and then you come back,
all right?

848
00:42:42,096 --> 00:42:43,763
I don't think
I can come back.

849
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:47,967
Pope.

850
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:00,913
Hey, kids.

851
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:03,816
Come here.

852
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:06,652
All right.

853
00:43:09,057 --> 00:43:10,857
These...

854
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,791
are for you.

855
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:14,660
For what?

856
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:16,328
It's your cut.

857
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,065
You helped
on a job today.

858
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:21,534
When you help,
you get paid.

859
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:23,535
Right?

860
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,537
Can we go to 7-Eleven?

861
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:28,407
Sure, you can!
Go on, get.

862
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,976
Stay together!

863
00:43:34,282 --> 00:43:36,415
You shouldn't be
teaching them that.

864
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,483
Why not?

865
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:40,419
It's a family business.

866
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:42,020
It was risky.

867
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:44,924

You need to relax.

He took off.

Said he needed
