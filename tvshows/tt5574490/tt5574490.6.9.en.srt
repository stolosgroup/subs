She, uh...
She broke into the house.

497
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:30,555
What do you mean
she broke into the house?

498
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:32,357
- How'd she get into the house?
- Did she take anything?

499
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,692
I don't think
she took anything.

500
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,227
Well, we can use
all of this.

501
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,695
If she was in here
without a warrant,

502
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:39,899
we can get any possible case
thrown out on that alone.

503
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,700
Unfortunately,

504
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:44,369
that's not the only charge that
Andrew's facing right now.

505
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:45,905
Okay.
What's the other charge?

506
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:48,774
I discovered that Oceanside PD
is gonna be issuing a warrant

507
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:50,576
for Andrew's arrest
for assault.

508
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:53,312
The victim is someone
named Taylor Cline.

509
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,314
Does that sound
familiar?
Yes.

510
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:56,649
The kid
from the skate park.

511
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:58,183
She put him there,
the cop.

512
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:00,119
Wait, what's that got to do
with an old murder case?

513
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:02,121
She probably doesn't have enough
for a homicide charge,

514
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:04,990
so she convinced someone
from Oceanside to prop this up.

515
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:06,659
Now that we're aware
of her investigation,

516
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,861
she probably assumes
that Andrew may run,

517
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:11,196
so we'll need to go down
and get you processed.

518
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,398
You should be able to get bail,
but the previous

519
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,468
felony conviction
may complicate things.

520
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,803
He's just gonna walk down there
and turn himself in?

521
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,273
It'll look better for us if we
go to the station, cooperate.

522
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:22,275
How much can you raise
for bail?

523
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:24,076
Enough.

524

But she already knew.

661

You gave her all the details,
huh, Andrew?

662
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:58,117
She didn't want
to tell me,

663

an accessory to a crime.
