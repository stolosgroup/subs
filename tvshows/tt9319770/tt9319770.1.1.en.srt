Shanice, it's time to wake up.

00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,302
Are we in Paris?

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,346
Yeah. (chuckles)

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,057
I just picked up some
croissants for breakfast.

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,393
Mm. Fresh ones.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,937
And are we gonna
stroll by the Seine later

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,732
and make out on
a bridge at sunset?

10
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,567
Definitely.

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,987
Liar.

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,949

out part. Mm-hmm.

You are gonna be
in so much trouble

19
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,429
if you didn't bring
her a croissant.

LOGAN: Don't you
have somewhere to be?

21

(chuckles) Yes.

22

Yes, it's a bad look for me to
be late on my first day back.

JESSICA: You'll
get a formal briefing,

96
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,051
but you saw the news about
those people on Belle Isle?

97
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,285
Yeah, some kind of
protest. Got out of hand.

98
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,663
That's the story we're
letting the press run with,

but there is zero chatter
or online organizing.

Thousands of people
just showed up.

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,672
We've tried fingerprinting

102

on hundreds so far.

103
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,969
The ones we've identified
are all missing persons cases

from the last couple decades.

105
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,848
Okay, so, what, they're all,
like, kidnapped and returned?

106
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,100
Unlikely.

107
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,327
They're from all
over the country.

about is... (breathes deeply)

111

I know.

112

We're putting together teams

00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,962
of corrections officers
and social workers

114
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,338
to see if you can get some
information out of them.

00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,697
Quickly.

116
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,907
We've just been
battling this on all fronts,

117
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,260
especially trying to
keep it out of the press

118
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,160
until we have any
kind of handle on it.

119
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,013
Well, in my experience,
people lie when they get caught

120
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,123
doing things they
aren't supposed to.

121
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,750
We'll find the truth.

122
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,339
Can you tell me
what you remember?

123
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,841
Okay, we're gonna
figure this out.

124
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,260
We're gonna get
everything back to normal.

125
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,346
I-I swear I'm gonna do whatever I
can do. Let me take a look at this.

127
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,684

anything about all this?

00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,732
Was gonna ask you the same.

131
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,333
Well, last I knew, I
was in Mississippi,

132

and-and now they
saying we in Detroit?

133
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,654
This how people dress

134
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,031

provide you with some insight.

Uh...

152
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,944
Give me my phone back

153
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,280
and get me out of
this janky-ass hotel.

155

STEVE: Uh, sorry,

I need to speak with

I need supplies.

who organizes protests

322
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,627
against travesties
like this sham war.

323
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,268
No blood for oil! You
got us raising kids

324
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,148
before you even bought
me coffee? No blood for oil!

325
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,800
(chuckles) Yeah, sorry. No
blood for oil! No blood for oil!

326
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,219
Hey, I'm Logan, by the way.

327
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,762
You want to get coffee?

328
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,597
I'm a little busy right now.

329
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,432
And I'm not really
trying to discuss kids.

330
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,850
That's a long ways off for me.

331
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,644
That right?

332
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,479
That's right. I am
getting my law degree,

333
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,540
and I'm gonna advocate for
the people in my community

334
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,626
who have been screwed over
more times than I can count.

335
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,944
Detroit is on the
verge of a comeback,

336
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,196
and I plan to be a part
of making it happen.

337
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,448
All that's pretty
heavy for coffee.

338
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,451
I didn't say I'd go... It's
definitely first dinner talk, though.

339
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,495
You free tonight?
No blood for oil!

340
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,372
No blood for oil!

341
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,834
No blood for oil!
No blood for oil!

342
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,460
No blood for oil!

343
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,630
No blood for oil! No blood

344
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,383
for oil! No blood for oil!

345
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,598
We've interviewed 15 people
so far and gotten nowhere.

346
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,392
Well, we know
that they all cleared

347
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,768
their medical screenings.

348
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,120
They don't pose a
danger to anyone.

349
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,855
But we don't know that.

350
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,499
Are we supposed to believe
these people don't remember

351
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,400
anything about what
happened to them? Keisha,

352
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,318
they're just as
confused as we are.

353
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,029
All right? We should help them.

354
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,823
Tell the public, alert
family members.

355
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,283
Tell the public what?

356
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,044
Some people got
snatched up by a green light

357
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,036
and just showed back
up out of nowhere? No.

358
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,913
There's something we're missing.

359
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,499
Okay, and how long
until we have answers?

360
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,752
In the meantime, we are
leaving a lot of people out there

361
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,880
believing that their loved
ones are never coming home

362
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,674
when, really, we got them
locked up here in this hotel.

363
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,760
(phone vibrates) Have a seat.

364
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,765
Hey, I have to run
an errand real quick.

365
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,518
Can you take the last interview
of the day for me? Thanks.

366
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,105
(door opens)

367
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,775
(door closes) (exhales)

368
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,114
You haven't spoken a
word since you arrived, huh?

369
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,703
I will need to find
new bandages.

370
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,458
This is remarkable.

371
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,253
It's almost fully healed.
How did this happen?

372
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,606
Did you receive treatment
from their doctors?

373
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,965
No, I didn't. (chuckles softly)

374
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,801
I-I think I should... Oh, no.

375
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,470
No, I'm fine. (chuckles)

376
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,431
It mustn't have been so
bad after all. (chuckles)

377
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,933
Go on, now. You got other
patients who need you.

378
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,700
Do you know sign language?

379
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,204
(knock on door)

380
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,422
What's going on?
We have a problem.

381
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,758
Shanice Murray escaped.

382
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,136
I bet she's heading home.

383
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,306
(panting)

384
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,436
Logan?

385
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,815
Logan, it's me.
Come on. Come on.

386
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,400
Logan!

387
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,152
Logan, please come out!

388
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,697
Someone's breaking
into my house.

389
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,198
She's Black.

390
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,616
Yes, I think she's armed.

391
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,243
(vehicle approaching)

392
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,912
(tires squealing)

393
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,082
(sirens wailing)

394
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,385
(tires screeching)

395
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,391
KEISHA: You got here fast.

396
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,810
Oh, he's with
me. I got your text.

397
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,562
DILLON: Owner
just called the cops.

398
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,980
We're gonna fan
out. She's close.

399
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,691
And she's got no
place to stay. Cold night.

400
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,127
She'll find a place
that's open late.

401
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,652
Warm up.

402
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,414
Look, I think I saw a
diner down the street.

403
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,411
Hey.

404
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,871
Where do you think you're going?

405
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,956
Like he said, let's fan out.

406
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,918
(car door closes)

407
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,137
(panting)

408
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,435
WOMAN: Who is it?

409
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,936
It's-it's Shanice.

410
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,272
It's Shanice Murray.
(shotgun cocks)

411
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,649
WOMAN: Haven't known anybody
by that name in a long while.

412
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,612
Mrs. Grover, you-you
changed my diapers,

413
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,074
did my hair and fed me
every day after school.

414
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,367
Plus, I know that shotgun's
about a hundred years old,

415
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,620
and you're gonna hurt
yourself if you try to shoot me.

416
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,455
(dog barks in distance)

417
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,584
Neecey?

418
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,544
That you?

419
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,713
Come on in here out of
the cold. You're gonna

420
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,257
catch your death. (laughs)

421
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,053
(door closes) (phone vibrates)

422
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,430
Jasmin. Hey.

423
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,100
Look, any sign of Manny at
the facility you were assigned to?

424
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,561
All right, hit me up
if you find anything.

425
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,021
Thanks.

426
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,190
(sighs)

427
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,469
CLAUDETTE: They say
this is like a soda pop?

428
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,245
You just poke a hole in it?

429
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,956
Guess the government
couldn't spring for the real thing.

430
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,625
You pull the tab
on the top. Here.

431
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,003
(chuckles)

432
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,797
(carbonation fizzing)

433
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,843
(chuckles) Well, I'll be.

434
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,803
It's all bubbly like
just from the fountain.

435
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,972
Yes, ma'am.

436
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,891
Keep the line moving. Let's go.

437
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:22,536
I told them I am a
sometime pescatarian,

438
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,996
ovo vegetarian.

439
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,123
Like, what is so
complicated about that?

440
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,085
Oh, my God. Do you
even speak English?

441
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,715
Oh, my God.

442
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,385
I have called home,

443
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,971
his office, his cell
phone. All disconnected.

444
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,848
How am I gonna track them down?

445
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,850
I couldn't find
your-your phone book.

446
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,269
The city stopped putting
those out years ago.

447
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,563
Oh, my gosh. But I wrote down

448
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,816
the new address when they
moved out to Palmer Woods.

449
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,943
Palmer Woods? Mm-hmm.

450
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,445
Uh,

451
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,156
what's the address?
Can I borrow the Pontiac?

452
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,908
The car is gone.

453
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,619
And there is not
much more you can do

454
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,079
until you get some
sleep. No, I have to...

455
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,789
You're dead on your feet.

456
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,417
You're talking nonsense
and don't even know it.

457
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,628
Come on, now.
Drink your Vernors.

458
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,093
Rest up,

459
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,430
and you can find your
husband in the morning.

460
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,767
A few more hours ain't
gonna change anything

461
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,227
now that you're back.

462
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,896
I'm glad to see

463
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,357
you're not too much
like your daddy after all.

464
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,900
I'm nothing like him.

465
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,735
I didn't leave.

466
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
I...

467
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,906
I don't know what
happened. I wa...

468
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,450
(chuckles): I was
home yesterday.

469
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,702
I just want to close my eyes

470
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,372
and have everything
return to normal.

471
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,915
I mean, if I... if...

472
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,833
If I can just see Logan

473
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,545
and-and... and
hug my little baby...

474
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,757
It'll be okay.

475
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,759
I know it will.

476
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,552
It has to be.

477
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,076
(toilet flushes)

478
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,040
Well, damn. Lurk much?

479
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,961
(faucet running) Can I help you?

480
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,588
Yes. Yes. I want you to cut me.

481
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,173
Oh, my God.

482
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,968
Um, lady, look, I know
this is all a hot mess,

483
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,386
but are you okay?

484
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,488
They won't give
us anything sharp,

485
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,805
so I need to use your nails.

486
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,223
Absolutely not.

487
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,183
Do you have any idea
how much I paid for these?

488
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,601
I just want to test a theory.

489
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,815
Do it, and I won't tell
that guard you're sweet on

490
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,817
that you just made
yourself sick in here.

491
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,819
That's none of your business.

492
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,822
No, it surely isn't.

493
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,200
Fine.

494
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,706
Ew. Ew. (inhales sharply)

495
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,207
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew. (grunts)

496
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,917
Oh, my God. (exhales)

497
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,919
(faucet running)

498
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,671
Well, thank you kindly,

499
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,506
and you have a nice
day now, you hear?

500
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,717
I'm sorry, wait a
minute. That's it?

501
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,720
I mean, like, you're not
gonna bleed out, are you?

502
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,698
'Cause I am not trying to go
down for murder in a bathroom,

503
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,223
so... I...

504
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,351
(breathing shakily)

505
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,159
ANDRE: Madam. Mrs.
Williams, you mustn't...

506
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,788
But how can that be?

507
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,289
(chuckles softly)

508
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,876
Is this some medical
advance from this era?

509
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,920
Nope, because I tried it,

510
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,296
and it still stings.

511
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,799
But-but hers healed
up even faster this time.

512
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,342
I don't know how to explain it,

513
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,427
but I just started
feeling better.

514
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,639
Gradually more and
more, a-and now...

515
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,308
Now I feel great.

516
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,519
(chuckles) Well,
that makes one of us.

517
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,063
ANDRE: I think...

518
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:22,859
I think this could be
very detrimental to you

519
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,694
and perhaps to all
of us if they found out

520
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,862
about this.

521
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,699
We should not tell anyone else.

522
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,160
(clears throat)

523
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,289
(scoffs) As if.

524
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,707
You know what? I don't know

525
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,976
what you two weirdos
are talking about,

526
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,377
and I don't care.

527
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,921
(chuckles) I'm so over all this.

528
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,308
I'm not going back.

529
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,726
Do you understand?

530
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,396
You can't keep me
from them. You have

531
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,106
no legal right. Whoa, hey, hey.

532
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,524
I agree.

533
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,751
I don't like the way this thing

534
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,068
is being run, either. (scoffs)

535
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,154
But I'm not the one in charge.

536
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,530
So...

537
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,324
I'll take you to
see your family.

538
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,410
Look, I'll work it out
with the agents who are

539
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,092
watching the door to
your husband's house.

540
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,747
But you got to return to
the hotel with me afterwards.

541
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,916
Deal?

542
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,003
Why would you help me?

543
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,880
Because if I was your family,

544
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,133
I would give anything to
know that you were okay.

545
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,429
Okay.

546
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,723
This is me.

547
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,351
Weren't you wearing
that yesterday?

548
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,353
(chuckles softly) Guilty.

549
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,331
(chuckles) But you
definitely weren't wearing that.

550
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,025
Hey, Mrs. Grover's sense
of fashion is timeless.

551
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,985

Let... Okay! O-Okay, folks.

568
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,104
I know it's been a long
couple of days, and tensions

569
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,148
are high. I feel you
on that, all right?

570
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,693
Now, we know it ain't
right to keep us locked up

when we haven't
done anything wrong.

572
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,199
But we also know that
something strange is going on

573
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,326
because just a couple days ago,

574
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,245
I was kicking back
watching Jordan

575
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,247
lead the Bulls in
the NBA Finals.

576
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,833
Hector, you had just gotten
back from the Korean War.

577
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,878
And, LaDonna, you were out
at some party. Then suddenly,

578
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,172
you're here. So unfair.

579
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,676
The government's trying to help.

580
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,096
And I think maybe they can
find a way to show us that.

581
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,764
How about we open up

582
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,516
some of those rooms
for people to have

583
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,601
a real bed to stay in tonight?
JESSICA: Those floors

584
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,937
are currently closed. We
have some time before nightfall.

585
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,647
As a gesture.

586
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,065
And tomorrow,

587
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,251
we'll be getting some answers.

588
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,234
That sounds like

589
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,610
a sign of good will to me.

590
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,529

We're blessed in that.

(cheering and whooping)

597
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,924
That was well-done
of the reverend.

598
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,801
CLAUDETTE: That's
because he knows how to use

599
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,095
pretty words to make
people believe him.

600
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,597
Men like him?

601
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,307
They dangerous.

602
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,267
Why would you think that?

603
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,436
Because I'm married to one.

607
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,580
You're...

608
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,665
Mom?

609
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,836

00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,838
It's really you.

611
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,298
You're...

612
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,175
You're really...

613
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,177
You're grown

614
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,346
and... LOGAN: Mariah,
who's at the door, sweetheart?

615
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,306
Logan?

616
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,557
Oh, thank God.

617
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,808
(chuckles softly)

618
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,644
Shanice?

619
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,813
Hey, get inside.
But-but, Dad, wait.

620
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,855
No, no, please. LOGAN:
Come on. Come on, all right?

621
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,902
(door closes) I
can't believe it's her.

622
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,321
Um, look, I don't... I
don't have much time,

623
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,073
but I had to come
and-and see you.

624
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,033
What are you doing
here, Shanice?

625
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,827
I came to find you.

626
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,388
You wouldn't believe
what I have been through.

627
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,706
I mean, I-I don't
believe it, really,

628
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,208
but Mariah's a teenager,

629
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,793
so... Do you...
Do you really think

630
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,228
that you can just
walk out on your family

631
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,338
and come waltzing
back 16 years later

632
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,589
like it never happened?

633
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,549
"Walk out"?

634
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,094
That-That's not what happened.

635
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,428
I was taken

636
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,739
or-or something. I
don't actually know.

637
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,515
Wait, who's that?

638
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,351
He's... It's a long story.

639
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,728
That's what I'm
trying to tell you. The...

640
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,855
The day you say I left, for me,

641
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,691
that was two days
ago. I don't know.

642
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,025
I thought I'd have more time.

643
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,670
Logan, please, I need
you to listen to me.

644
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,112
I need help. We-we all

645
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,589
need help. They're
keeping us in this...

646
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,365
in this hotel downtown.
Wait, who? Who?

647
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,717
There was this
agent... Sir, stand back.

648
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,576
This woman is a
national security threat.

649
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,012
She could pose a danger to you
and your family. That's not true.

650
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,746
Mariah, stay back.
What is going on?

651
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,373
Oh, my God.

652
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,666
Shanice?

653
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,044
You look just
like your pictures.

654
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,756
KEISHA: Shanice, you
have to come with us now.

655
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,050
How long?

656
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,721
How long?

657
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,306
Nine years.

658
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,935
And she, she...

659
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,688
She raised my daughter?

660
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,483
(footsteps approaching)

661
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,318
(handcuffs clinking)

662
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,028
Hey. Hey, hang on. No.

663
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,506
(handcuffs click) LOGAN:
Don't put your hands on her.

664
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,632
I don't... I don't know
what you thought,

665
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,949
but I did not leave.

666
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,410
I would never have
left you. I love you.

667
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,078
You are my family, and I will do

668
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,122
everything I can
to get back to you

669
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,016
and make you understand. I don't
know what you got yourself into,

670
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,376
Shanice, but don't lie to me.

671
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,919
Don't lie to our daughter.

672
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,839
I found your note.

673
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,135
No. No, Logan.

674
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,054
That's not what you
think. I can explain, Logan!

675
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,682
(crying): Logan! I can explain!

676
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,977
That's not what
you think, Logan!

677
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,937
Logan!

678
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,403
(indistinct chatter over radio)

679
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,865
JHARREL: Do you have any idea

680
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,492
the destruction you
caused that family?

681
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,659
Why?

682
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,369
I didn't put her
in this position.

683
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,497
You did. Okay? She was never

684
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,416
supposed to make
contact. She was coming in.

685
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,794
Quietly. But instead,

686
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,295
you traumatize the kid,

687
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,255
had to witness her mom
being treated like that.

688
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,216
Someone helped her escape.

689
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,259
What, you think I
did that? I don't know.

690
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,846
But I do know when people
have something to hide.

691
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,557
And I don't trust you.
JHARREL: Yeah?

692
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,684
Well, you're a cop who
believes in the system

693
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,187
over people's humanity.

694
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,356
I don't really
trust you, either.

695
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,695
(phone vibrates)

696
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,667
Mrs. Murray, you look unwell.

697
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,794
(crying) Where have you been?

698
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,547
Are you all right?

699
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,509
Not really, Doc.

700
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,014
My husband...

701
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,225
is now married to someone else

702
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,812
who also raised my
16-year-old daughter.

703
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,815
I...

704
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,449
I was so scared
when I got pregnant.

705
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,828
I wasn't ready to be a mother.

706
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,374
(Mariah crying) I
had so much to do.

707
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,128
And when she was born,

708
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,256
it wasn't that immediate
connection they tell you

709
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,465
it's gonna be.

710
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,970
I was so worried
about my life changing,

711
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,890
about my career.

712
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,475
And she was this...

713
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,353
this strange, little creature.

714
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,940
(crying)

715
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,526
I was in pain. My
head wasn't on straight.

716
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,156
But I got help.

717
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,956
And she and I, we...

718
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,792
We grew into our love.

719
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,669
We fought

720
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,630
to get where we were, you know?

721
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,966
And I was never gonna
stop fighting for her.

722
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,845
But I missed it all.

723
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,890
Her first words.

724
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,434
Her first steps.

725
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,813
Her first everything.

726
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,441
She was this tiny, little blob

727
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:27,528
in my arms, and now
she has had a whole life.

728
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,572
And...

729
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,157
she didn't...

730
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,660
she didn't need me.

731
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,290
(sobbing)

732
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,641
CLAUDETTE: You're gonna
get to sleep in a real bed tonight.

733
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,102
I thought at least that would've
put a smile on your face.

734
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,603
No.

735
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,271
No, I'm in the future,

736
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,107
and you're, like,
one of the X-Men.

737
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,401
I'm a what now? And
I'm stuck in this dump,

738
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm totally alone, and I
just want my phone back.

739
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,157
I'll admit I think y'all have
a real surprising attachment

740
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,534
to telephones now. (chuckles)

741
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,910
Mm. And

742
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,704
I can't say what's
happening here

743
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,872
other than to take as truth

744
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,000
what I done seen
with my own two eyes.

745
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,043
But I do know one thing.

746
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,421
You're not alone.

747
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,173
You, me, the doc,

748
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,592
everyone in here, we
are all in this together.

749
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:35,013
And that's the only way we
gonna get through it. You hear me?

750
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,563
Say, you think
that piano's in tune?

that nobody knows about?

782

00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,636
Let me see. I'll examine her,

but it looked benign to me.

792
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,306
Really? Because it sounded

793
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,201
like it was bad... Just-just
hit my funny bone is all.

794
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,978
But thank you for your concern.

795

This seat taken?

796
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,710
I'm not interested.

797
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,296
And I'm definitely
not interested.

798
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,400
Now, I have to turn in a
report tomorrow morning

799
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,301
about what went
down today, and...

800
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,344
Look, is there anything
you want to tell me?

801
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,763
A reason you're so
protective of Shanice Murray?

802
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,517
I was protective because
I have seen what happens

803
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,227
when a powerful
government machine

804
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,771
treats people like
they're problems

805
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,708
instead of human beings.
That's not what's happening.

806
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,358
Okay... We don't
know what's happening.

807
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,944
All right? We know some
people appeared out of nowhere,

808
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,071
and some of them
are from the past.

809
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,240
Now, tell me, how do you think

810
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,284
our government is
gonna react to that?

811
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,246
Look, you might
be a good person.

812
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,291
All right, the people we
report to might be good people.

813
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,753
But even good people
justify very bad things

814
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,088
in the name of doing their jobs.

815
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,758
In the name of
keeping people safe.

816
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,636
The truth is, I thought...

817
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,179
(scoffs)

818
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,935
My brother Manny is missing,

819
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,688
and I thought that I had seen
a green light out the window

820
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,774
right after he left.

821
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,943
(scoffs) The first time

822
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,778
in a year

823
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,947
I had real hope.

824
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,867
There's no sign of Manny
among any of these people.

825
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,245
And I am gonna
have to face the fact

826
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,455
that I'll probably
never see him again.

827
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:38,089
Well, it's been real.

828
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,217
I'll fix it with DHS.

829
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,720
Okay? I've got...

830
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,931
connections.

831
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,060
So that is what is going on
between you and Agent Tanner,

832
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,437
huh? Connections.

833
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,065
(chuckles softly)

834
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,695
I know what it's like

835
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,571
to lose someone you
were supposed to protect.

836
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,033
Okay, my sister was killed

837
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,953
walking home from the
library five years ago.

838
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,955
Gunfire. Not meant for her.

839
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,208
A parolee who shouldn't
have had access to a weapon.

840
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,668
Keisha, I'm sorry. I didn't...

841
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,670
It's hard to let
anyone get close.

842
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,131
Anyone you could ever
let down like that again.

843
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,508
Easier to protect strangers.

844
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,598
(dialogue inaudible) Uh, hey,
can you turn that up for me?

845
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,267
NEWSMAN: We are following up

846
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,602
on explosive allegations
about the mysterious gathering

847
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,438
on Belle Isle two nights ago.

848
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,523
A whistleblower tells us
a number of the people

849
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,358
have been identified
as missing persons

850
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,027
who all appeared
at the same location

851
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,486
for reasons unknown.

852
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,530
We are told the total
number of returnees

853
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,324
is 4,400,

854
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,285
and they're being held
at undisclosed locations.

855
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,086
Where'd you
disappear to yesterday?

856
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,047
I got out. Out?

857
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,507
How? I don't know.

858
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,149
The door just opened.
(Claudette exhales)

859
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,428
So that's what got the
guards' cages all rattled.

860
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,846
And?

861
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,556
Is it true?

862
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,185
Unless someone's put
together a very elaborate hoax,

863
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,687
it's really 2021.

864
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,732
And they came after me.

865
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,026
Sent the whole cavalry
to bring me back in.

866
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,111
That's a whole lot of
effort for one Black woman.

867
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,031
Yep. So, why us?

868
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,575
Far as I can tell, we
have nothing in common.

869
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,219
Not where we're from.
Not when we're from.

870
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,330
So why now? Why this?

871
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,458
For some reason, we're special.

872
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,212
As much as I wish I didn't have
anything to do with any of this,

873
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,589
I've realized that if we
have that kind of value,

874
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,925
it means one more thing.

875
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,386
Yeah, and what's that?

876
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,429
We're not powerless.

877
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,728
I think I might just like 2021.

878
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,355
(chuckles softly)

879
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,942
KEISHA: There's
news vans outside.

880
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,111
You holding up?
Hounded by the press,

881
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,445
the White House,

882
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,280
people who think we
have their loved ones.

883
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,157
These people,

884
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,660
the ones we can find data
on, follow no clear pattern.

885
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,620
They're just standard
missing persons cases.

886
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,999
Others match records that
defy every logical explanation.

887
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,710
The Pentagon is
exploring every theory.

888
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,380
They're reading in NASA.

889
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,258
Do they think this is
something extraterrestrial?

890
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,634
I know it sounds crazy,

891
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,302
but the time period
discrepancies?

892
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,513
Some people have
reported seeing green lights?

893
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:36,267
The way none of this makes
sense or is even possible?

894
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,937
I'm glad you're here.

895
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,857
And...

896
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,694
be careful with them.

897
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,742
(sighs)

898
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,745
What are you doing out here?

899
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,167
I'm glad they finally found
you something else to wear.

900
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,295
Heard they were gonna
hit up the Salvation Army.

901
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,673
You know, my
sister and I saw her

902
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,508
at Ford Field when we were kids.

903
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,344
She wanted to be a
rapper/mogul/collaborator

904
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,596
just like Missy.

905
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,642
You don't even know
who that is, do you?

906
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,981
Come on.

907
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,983
Let's get you in a room
so you can get some sleep.

908
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,445
Tell Jharrel
that Manny's all right.

909
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,825
And that he's sorry
for everything.

909
00:41:35,305 --> 00:42:35,942
