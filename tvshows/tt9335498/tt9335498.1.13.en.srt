where are you right now?

I can still hear
that creepy sound.

I just hope he's safe.

18

Shoichi: Um, Zenitsu, is it me,

19
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,418
or are we just going
around and around in circles?

20
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,754
Zenitsu: I knew it! I was
getting the exact same feeling!

21
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,157
I knew I could rely on you
to help me out, shoichi!

All right.

23
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,496
Can you check to see
if this room is clear?

Hey, what's with that look?!

Damn it! I can't win like this.

00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,586
I need more
than just determination.

52
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,055
Calm down. Use your head

That was close.
I barely scraped by there.

Kyogai: Curses!
This is irritating.

get my hands on that boy

This is so boring!

80
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,378
Disappointing. Your writing
is absolutely insipid.

81
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,816
Every last word on these pages
is utterly trite!

82

There's no beauty,
vulnerability, or impact.

83

Why don't you forget
this fantasy of being a writer?

84
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,162
It would simply be
a waste of ink and paper.

85
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:01,966
It doesn't help that you
never even step outside anymore.

86

It's no wonder
you're such a dull individual.

87

And, if that's the case,
you might as well stick

88

with your original hobby
of playing the drum.

89
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,579
Not that you're good enough

90
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,383

with that, either.

The speed of these rotations
is making me dizzy! This is bad.

104
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,915
What a terrifying skill.

105
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,917
Not only that,

106
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,720
but now he's using
five claws instead of three!

107

Kyogai: Eh?

108
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,933
Tanjiro: I got it!

109
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,205
Now that I've dodged his strikes

110
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,941
without stepping
on those papers,

111
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,542
I can protect my wounds,

112
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,644
because I know
how to move around and breathe.

113
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:56,515
Take quick, shallow breaths.

114
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,618
Use that breathing technique

115
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,755
to reinforce the muscles
around your broken leg!

116
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,890
Also, right before
the claw attack,

117
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,493
there's a strong scent of mold.

Tanjiro: Go, Tanjiro.
Get within striking distance.

you can bear this. It'll pass!

My blood Demon art...

155
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,231

Wow, it worked.

He said it would
automatically extract blood

164

when applied like this,
but seeing it in action

00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,847
Oh! You're the one

169
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,384
who's going to deliver this
to miss Tamayo, right?

170
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,287
Here we are. Good kitty!

171
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,125
You're all set!

172
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,727
All right. Take care!

173
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,197
( Cat meows )

174
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,465
Tanjiro: Oh.

175
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,335
I was told that,
under Yushiro's spell,

176
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:05,738
it would be invisible
until it meowed,

177
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,007
and then vanish again
when it meowed a second time.

178
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,676
So it's true, then.

179
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,347
( Gasps ) Those kids.

180
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,915
I gotta find them!

181
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,424
Kyogai: My--my writing...

182
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:30,362
Man: Disappointing.

183
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,765
Your writing
is absolutely insipid.

184
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:37,970
Every last word on these pages
is utterly trite!

185
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:42,374
There's no beauty,
vulnerability, or impact.

186
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,844
¶

187
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,312
Kyogai: It wasn't worthless.

188
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,515
At the very least,

189
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,051
that child didn't believe so.

190
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,155
He respectfully avoided
trampling upon my work.

191
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,825
Tanjiro: May your soul
rest in peace.

192
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,262
( Kyogai crying )

193
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:13,872
Both my blood Demon art
and my drum playing...

194
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,711
Have been recognized.

195
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,251
Tanjiro: Kiyoshi! Teruko!

196
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,321
Are you here? Answer me!

197
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,391
Teruko! Kiyoshi!

198
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,525
( Teruko screams )

199
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,194
( Kiyoshi yells )

200
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,395
( Tanjiro groans )

201
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,130
Teruko: Uh...

202
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,266
Kiyoshi: Sorry, Tanjiro.

203
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,135
Tanjiro: Why are the two of you
throwing stuff at me?

204
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,470
Kiyoshi: We're sorry

205
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,173
the drum we were using
disappeared, so we panicked.

206
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,809
Tanjiro: I see.

207
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,278
Well, you're safe. I'm glad.

208
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,047
( Teruko crying )

209
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,086
Tanjiro: You did a great job
hanging in there.

210
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,221
You, too, Kiyoshi.

211
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,424
Come on. Let's head outside.

212
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,093
Kiyoshi, hop on.

213
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,295
( Footsteps shuffling )

214
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,830
How's your leg feeling?

215
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,232
Kiyoshi: Not too bad.

216
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,967
Tanjiro: Just hang on
a little longer.

217
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,904
I'm picking up
Zenitsu and shoichi's scent.

218
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,973
They're probably outside.

219
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:22,974
Seems they're both sa--

220
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,175
( gasps )

221
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,444
I smell blood.

222
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,979
Kiyoshi: What's the matter?

223
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,049
Nothing. Let's hurry along.

224
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,017
¶

225
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,125
- ( Thump )
- Swordsman: Take this!

226
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,994
Come on! Move it!

227
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,064
Now, you spineless coward!

228
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,332
Draw your sword, and face me!

229
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,300
( Tanjiro gasps )

230
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,138
( Shoichi sobbing )

231
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,873
Zenitsu: Tanjiro...

232
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:00,479
The box, I protected it.

233
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,414
You told me...

234
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,550
This was
more important to you...

235
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,319
Than your own life.

236
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,456
That's why I did it.

237
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,200
The fact is, I've always
had really good hearing.

238
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,173
There have been times
when I knew what people said,

239
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,375
even though
I had been fast asleep.

240
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,311
That really
creeped everyone out.

241
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,383
I don't hear any more demons.

242
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:41,086
You must have
finished the job, Tanjiro.

243
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,189
I can hear you all

244
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:48,394
and also these
odd-sounding, loud footsteps.

245
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,331
Shoichi: Zenitsu! Zenitsu!

246
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,867
Please, wake up!

247
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,205
Oh. Thank goodness!

248
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,007
Are you all right?

249
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,274
( Zenitsu groans )

250
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,210
Shoichi: When the room
spun around earlier,

251
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,612
we ended up
getting thrown outside.

252
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,614
We fell
from the second-story window.

253
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,151
( Zenitsu gasps )

254
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,619
- Did we, really?
- Shoichi: Yeah

255
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,222
you made sure that I was
protected at the time, though,

256
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,558
so I didn't end up
getting hurt at all.

257
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,227
Zenitsu: I'm glad to hear that.

258
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,164
So what's
with all the tears, then?

259
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,399
Huh?

260
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,504
Now I understand!

261
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,639
I fell right onto my head,
didn't I?!

262
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,707
Shoichi: Yes.

263
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,176
Zenitsu: Am I gonna--

264
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,643
am I gonna die?!

265
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,312
Oh, no. The world
is starting to spin.

266
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,715
- Is this the end for me?!
- ( Swordsman laughing )

267
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:45,650
Zenitsu: What's going on?
I don't like that sound!

268
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,587
Kiyoshi: Watch out,
'cause, ready or not,

269
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,455
I'm comin' through!

270
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,323
( Zenitsu shrieks )

271
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,725
There it is again,

272
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,460
that terrifying boar monster!

273
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,197
( Swordsman laughs )

274
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,265
Picking up
a demonic presence here.

275
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,333
( Zenitsu gasps ) Hey, wait.

276
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,536
I know where I've heard
that voice before.

277
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,538
He's the fifth survivor.

278
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,339
During final selection,

279
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,275
he was the first
to rush up the mountain

280
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,411
and the first to come back down.

281
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,546
- What a force of nature!
- Swordsman: Hmm?

282
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,218
( Laughs )

283
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,287
I've found you, Demon!

284
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,622
( Roars )

285
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,623
Zenitsu: Stop it!

286
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,226
¶

287
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,094
swordsman: What the hell?

288
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,495
Who are you?

289
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:32,297
Get outta my way!

290
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,633
Zenitsu: My name
is Zenitsu Agatsuma!

291
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,436
I'm a Demon Slayer,
the same as you!

292
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,439
Swordsman: Oh? Are you, now?

293
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,307
Then, you should already know!

294
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,110
We gotta get rid
of that thing at all costs!

295
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,312
Now get the hell out of my way!

296
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,447
Zenitsu: I refuse!

297
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,781
This belongs to Tanjiro--

298
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,583
swordsman:
Don't you argue with me!

299
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:55,654
I'll deal with him and his box
if that's the case.

300
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,257
I won't say it again. Move!

301
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,659
( Zenitsu whimpering )

302
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:03,595
Swordsman: Do you wanna die?

303
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,597
Zenitsu: This box,

304
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,266
I won't let you touch it!

305
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,667
I don't know what's inside,

306
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,802
but I know that it's
precious to Tanjiro!

307
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:13,404
Swordsman: Are you serious?

308
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,740
Use your damn head!

309
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,276
There's a Demon in that box!

310
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,078
Don't you get that?

311
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,279
Zenitsu: Of course I do!

312
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,147
I've known that
from the very start!

313
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:27,486
I knew he was
traveling with a Demon,

314
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:32,291
because the sounds demons make
aren't anything like a human.

315
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,759
That said,

316
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,829
the sounds I hear from Tanjiro
are so kind and gentle,

317
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,765
it makes me want to cry.

318
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:45,771
I don't think I've ever heard
anything like it before.

319
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,642
All living creatures
constantly give off vibrations.

320
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,711
The world is full
of sounds ringing out...

321
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,315
Breathing, heartbeats,

322
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,083
the rhythm
of blood circulating.

323
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,586
By listening closely,
I'm able to tell

324
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:04,523
what kind of thoughts are
going through someone's head.

325
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:09,328
Even so, I've been deceived
by others many times.

326
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,664
That's because
I've always stubbornly believed

327
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,733
in whomever I wanted.

328
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:18,537
Tanjiro, despite being
a Demon Slayer,

329
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,739
is traveling with a Demon,

330
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:25,344
but I'm sure he has
a good reason for doing so.

331
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,278
Whatever that reason may be,

332
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:30,549
I'm sure I can
put my faith behind it.

333
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,551
I'll do it.

334
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,952
Swordsman: Huh?

335
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,487
Zenitsu: I'll ask him.

336
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,690
I'll ask Tanjiro
about the Demon myself.

337
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,625
Until that happens,

338
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,961
just leave it alone!

339
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,663
( Both grunting )

340
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:53,839
Swordsman:
Let go of me, damn it!

341
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,041
- ( Zenitsu yelps )
- Swordsman: You're a pest!

342
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,911
( Grunts )

343
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,446
( Growls )

344
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,415
Zenitsu: I won't
let you touch that!

345
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,387
It's important to Tanjiro.

346
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,255
Stay away from it!

347
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:16,461
You're not laying a finger on it
until he gets back!

348
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,796
Swordsman: Damn you!

349
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:18,664
( Sputters )

350
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,332
Take this!

351
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,402
- ( Blows landing )
- ( Both grunting )

352
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,671
Swordsman: Move it!

353
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,473
Zenitsu: No! I refuse!

354
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,409
¶

355
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:34,946
swordsman: Take this!

356
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,616
Come on! Move it!

357
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,219
Now, you spineless coward!

358
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,353
Draw your sword, and face me!

359
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:43,689
( Tanjiro gasps )

360
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:47,959
( Shoichi sobbing )

361
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,229
Zenitsu: Tanjiro...

362
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:55,434
The box, I protected it.

363
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,769
You told me...

364
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:00,639
This was
more important to you...

365
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,274
Than your own life.

366
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,511
That's why I did it.

367
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:10,381
Swordsman: You idiot!
After all that bluster,

368
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,584
you don't even bother
to draw your sword!

369
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:16,588
If you're a fellow Demon Slayer,
then let's see you fight!

370
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,457
( Zenitsu groaning )

371
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,861
( Tanjiro growls )

372
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,329
Swordsman: If you're
not gonna fight,

373
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,265
then get the hell out of my way!

374
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,233

Swordsman: Fine, then.

380
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:48,954
If all you're gonna do
is keep me from doing my job,

381
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,689
then you leave no choice,

382
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:53,558
but to take you out
along with that box!

383

( Zenitsu groaning )

384

Tanjiro: Stop it!

385
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,233
Swordsman: Huh?

00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,770
( Zenitsu groaning )

387
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:11,710
