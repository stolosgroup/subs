No, missed it.
Aram cut it.

Thank you, thank you.

00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,211
Does that mean we need
to cut the scene?

166
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:21,735
No, no, no.

167
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,606
Absolutely not.
We're not cutting the scene.

168
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,695
Unless we can
find another 6'6",

169
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:28,393
300-pound actor
just hanging around...

170
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,311
What about your friend?

171
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,792
My friend?

172
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:39,056
"I am honored
and grateful..."

173
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,887
Don Corleone,
I am honored and...

174
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,628
"Grateful."

175
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,238
Right, right.

176
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,675
Don Corleone,

177
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:51,678
I am honored
and grateful that...

178
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,245
"That you invited me."

179
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,117
Okay, okay.

180
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,816
Don Corleone,
I am honored and...

181
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,949
Oh, my God.
What the fuck, Lenny?

182
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,299
How many times did your
mother drop you on your head?

183
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,867
"I am honored and grateful
that you invited me

184
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,478
into your home on the day
of your daughter's wedding."

185
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,610
Well, why don't you do it?

186
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,915
'Cause they need
a fat fuck like you.

187
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,569
Hey.

188
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,266
It's okay,
we're gonna try again.

189
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,746
Unbelievable.

190
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,619
A head that big and it
can't hold a goddamn thing.

191
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,185
Can we cut down the lines?

192
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,926
Make it easier?

193
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,060
Luca Brasi is formal.

194
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,584
He wants to get the lines
just right for the Don.

195
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,107
He's nervous.

196
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,762
So on the day, we shoot him
right outside the office.

197
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,546
And he's practicing
with his cards.

198
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,374
"Honored and grateful..."

199
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,812
And we shoot it like that.

200
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,820
Oh, kitty. Oh, kitty-kitty.

201
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,952
What a pretty kitty, huh?

202
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,912
Who's a pretty cat?

203
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:57,787
What's with the cat?

204
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,876
Did you do a rewrite?

205
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,749
No, there's no cat
in the scene.

206
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,489
That sure looks like a cat.

207
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,057
Is it Brando's cat?

208
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:08,537
It's one of the stray cats
from the alley

209
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,712
behind the studio.

210
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,023
I like it.

211
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,852
Yeah, me too.

212
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,723
Of course, 'cause neither one
of you wants to be the one

213
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,856
to tell Brando
he can't have it.

214
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,075
True.

215
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,511
So what are we doing?

216
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,600
Cat or no cat?

217
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,254
I think it's inspired.

218
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:31,516
Can we try one?

219
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,822
Okay, let's lock it up.

220
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,868
Last looks, everybody.

221
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,131
Hey, we got a small problem.
Yeah?

222
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,267
Huh.

223
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,616
We'll fix it in post.

224
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,966
Sorry, sir.

225
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,359
Mr. Evans is
on the phone in your office.

226
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,665
He said it can't wait.

227
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,670
Okay, put us on a bell.

228
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,413
And action.

229
00:11:58,456 --> 00:11:59,588
Bob?

230
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,024
Where are you?

231
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,852
Where am I?
I don't fucking know.

232
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,462
I'm over one
of those square states.

233
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:05,855
Look, we've got a problem.

234
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,118
Bluhdorn
and Lapidus saw dailies

235
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,772
of Pacino's first day,
and they want to fire him.

236
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,166
What the fuck? No, no.

237
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,820
Look, we're not
changing horses now.

238
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,256
This is all Lapidus, man.

239
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,127
Barry's a fucking rat
who's always wanted my job,

240
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,433
and this is part
of his power grab.

241
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,783
Okay, listen,
I know you haven't always been

242
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,480
the biggest supporter
of Pacino, but...

243
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,047
Never mind that.

244
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,833
Pacino's our boy now,
so let's not fuck this up.

245
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,749
I told Bluhdorn
we'll talk when I land,

246
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,576
but you need
to figure something out, man.

247
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,665
All right, I'll get
back to set and deal with it.

248
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,145
But first...

249
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,494
how was Texas?

250
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,065
Bob?

251
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,373
Hot as a fucking sauna.

252
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,940
See ya.

253
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,080
Power in and of itself

254
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,908
is not an important thing
to him.

255
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:01,737
You know, he would never
talk about his own power.

256
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783
No, his power
comes from his confidence,

257
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,785
from what he
doesn't have to say.

258
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,961
And he's not a criminal.

259
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,615
He's got a deep moral center.

260
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,704
Politicians are the criminals,

261
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,402
the drug dealers
getting people hooked

262
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:15,359
on empty promises.

263
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:16,621
Mm-hmm.

264
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,710
The Don,
he serves his community

265
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:20,800
more than any
politician ever would.

266
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,714
Yes, he does.

267
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,107
And when people
come for his help,

268
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,282
he knows right from wrong

269
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:27,371
because of his
old world values.

270
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:30,548
He just wants to do right
by his people and his family.

271
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,030
Yeah, that's it.
That's exactly it.

272
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:35,466
You want to try another one?

273
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,990
All right.
Okay.

274
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,948
- Freddie.
- Okay, lock it up.

275
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,385
Going again.
Last looks, please.

276
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,737
What the fuck
is Duvall wearing?

277
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,652
Oh, Brando likes
to be in the moment.

278
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,524
He doesn't memorize his lines.

279
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,656
Apparently no one does.

280
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,050
Listen,
I just talked to Bob.

281
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:56,444
Charlie and Lapidus
want to fire Pacino.

282
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,489
What?

283
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,579
Um, one second, Freddie.

284
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,190
What are you talking about?

285
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,061
They saw the dailies
from his first scene.

286
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,497
They're not happy.

287
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,848
They don't even
know how to look at dailies.

288
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,501
What do... how can
they judge him on one scene?

289
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,677
Look, we just need
to get them excited about him.

290
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,723
What's his best scene?

291
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,507
There's a lot.

292
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:17,900
Um...

293
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,206
what about the restaurant scene

294
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,990
where he shoots
Sollozzo and McCluskey?

295
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:22,862
I mean, they gotta be able
to see what he can do there.

296
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,428
Perfect.
When do we shoot that?

297
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:26,474
End of the week.

298
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,694
We need to shoot that tomorrow.

299
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,175
Fine, yes, fine.
I can do that, yes.

300
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,829
See if we can get the location.

301
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,657
Yes.
Gordy.

302
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,615
Let me chat with you.

303
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,530
You too, Aram.

304
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,054
What do you need, boss?

305
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,578
Okay, new policy.

306
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:47,060
As of right now, only the four
of us have access to dailies.

307
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:50,106
No one else sees them
unless Francis or I approve it.

308
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,631
You got it.
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,898
Freddie.

310
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,812
Okay, roll sound.

311
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,032
And action.

312
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,947
Business is good.

313
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,644
This is for you.
20 large.

314
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,603
From the fundraiser.

315
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,171
20, huh?

316
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:15,262
How many tickets
you sell to that event?

317
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:20,963
Well, we're
still counting.

318
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,747
This is just
to show respect.

319
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,445
There's more
where that came from.

320
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,889
I appreciate that, Joe.

321
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,414
I had my concerns about this...

322
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,722
Italian League thing of yours
from the very beginning.

323
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,767
But I gotta say,

324
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,639
you're proving me wrong.

325
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,251
Yeah, well,

326
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,427
the unions at the movie
have started to produce too.

327
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,951
I'll have
your cut on Friday.

328
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,430
It was good that we
got in on this thing

329
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:54,605
from the ground up.

330
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,522
You're doing great, Joe.

331
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,481
Mm? Keep it up.

332
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,138
Okay.

333
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:17,977
♪

334
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,641
This kind of trouble,

335
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:31,903
it's just the beginning.

336
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,122
Kiss my ass.
Come on.

337
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,297
The lighting's not working.

338
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,082
We're falling way behind.

339
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,648
The lighting's perfect.

340
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,040
It's perfect!

341
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,173
But if you don't
direct the actors,

342
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,349
none of it
means a fucking thing!

343
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,915
Clear the set.

344
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,091
So precious about everything.

345
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,528
I give a shit
what it looks like!

346
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:48,790
Oh...
Okay, everybody.

347
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,270
Take five.

348
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:51,967
More fucking drama
than a soap opera.

349
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,447
They're not
on the same page.

350
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,014
Mm-hmm, not even reading
the same book.

351
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,450
Coppola's lost this crew.

352
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,843
We have to tell
Charlie about this.

353
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,454
Is that
what you think, man?

354
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:03,283
Of course I care
about what it looks like!

355
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,328
But the actors, they can't even
walk around the set!

356
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:08,027
Yes, that's right.
They can't.

357
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,984
They have to hit their marks!

358
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,595
That's the point!

359
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,510
Unless you just want me
to point a 10K at the room

360
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:14,945
and walk away.

361
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,165
You know lighting!

362
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,820
You don't know a goddamn thing
about the needs of actors.

363
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,431
They need freedom.

364
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,694
They need to be able
to walk around

365
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,608
so they can bring
the characters to life.

366
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,349
We talked about this.
How simply can I put this?

367
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:30,353
So there's light,
and there's dark.

368
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,703
If they're not in the light,
they're in the dark!

369
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,923
All right, hey, boys,
bring it down a notch.

370
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,446
Okay, let me
make it simple for you.

371
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,058
Anybody coming to see
this movie is not gonna care

372
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,798
about your lights
if they can't connect

373
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,148
with the actors!

374
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,367
You're impossible.
You are impossible.

375
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,630
Nobody can talk to you!

376
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,023
I'll light it.

377
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,459
I can light it!

378
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,766
Look at this guy!

379
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,594
Let him go.
No, let him go!

380
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,119
Gordy, come on... No, no!

381
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,903
He's being an asshole.

382
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,557
He acts like this is just
between him and the actors.

383
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,516
There's 150 fucking people
on this crew

384
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,431
busting their asses,
trying to make this work

385
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:05,823
for him!

386
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,260
He has no appreciation
for anyone,

387
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:08,565
and I'm done with it, I'm done.

388
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,089
Okay, well, listen to me,
Gordy, you leave,

389
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,091
there's a good chance those
150 people are unemployed.

390
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,223
Okay, so I'll fix this, okay?

391
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,095
But you gotta give me
a chance to do it, okay?

392
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,661
Please.

393
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,535
I'll finish the day,

394
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:24,755
but that's it
unless he apologizes.

395
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,366
Fuck.

396
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,845
Damn it.

397
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,113
Coppola thinks he's a god,

398
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,462
but the product is a mess.

399
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,073
First Pacino, now everything's
incredibly dark,

400
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,683
and Brando
is a mumbling fool.

401
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,903
The scene Coppola shot
in the Don's office

402
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,992
is unusable.

403
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,950
Star of the scene
is a goddamn cat.

404
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,822
The DP is this
close to quitting,

405
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,606
and the crew is not far behind.

406
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,132
So what's our solution?

407
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,959
We need to get rid of Coppola.

408
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,048
Right after we
get rid of Pacino.

409
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,137
Aram should take the helm.

410
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,442
He's been on set
the whole time.

411
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,923
He knows the footage.
He can fix this.

412
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,625
Fine.

413
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:12,890
Put together the worst set
of dailies you possibly can.

414
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,763
We'll show Charlie,
and if it's what you say...

415
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,593
The two of you
better be ready to take over.

unless you have the crew
on your side.

You can't do it

00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,661
But I do want a moment
before you go for the gun.

660
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:55,054
Uh-huh.
Okay?

661
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:58,057
So you look up,
you see the tank.

662
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,277
You don't know, was Clemenza
even able to plant it?

663
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:02,713
Right?
Mm-hmm.

664
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:03,802
That's the motivation.

665
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,630
Then, you go for the gun.

666
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,284
Where should I put it?

667
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:09,938
My pocket, my belt,
what do you think?

668
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:11,418
Where does it feel
natural for you?

669
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,289
Put it wherever feels right.

670
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:16,858
So I'm gonna take it,
I'm gonna...

671
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,207
In here, we're nervous.

672
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,079
Out there, we're playing
somebody trying...

673
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:20,993
not to be nervous.
Not to be nervous.

674
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,081
Not... there you go.

675
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,604
All right.
Go get dressed.

676
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:25,040
Okay, okay.
You got it.

677
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:28,217
Yep, okay, thank you,
Francis, all right.

Do me a favor.

680

When you put
the gun back there,

681
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,056
don't put it there.

682
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,928
Put it to the left.

683
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:45,495
Yeah, and like 6 inches higher.

684
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,757
That's perfect.

You picked a good day.

688
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,896
I mean, this is one of my
favorite scenes in the film.

689
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,116
So Michael's
about to sit down to dinner

690
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,335
with these two guys
who tried to kill his father.

691
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:02,338
They want peace.
Michael wants revenge.

692
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:05,341
Oh, so this is a gangster film.

693
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,995

694

They're terrible.

699
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,703
They're too dark, and what's
with the fucking cat?

700
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:22,271
I couldn't hear a goddamn
thing over all that purring.

701
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,012
They weren't ready
for you to see, Charlie.

702
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,014
They still need to be
color timed and engineered,

703
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:28,321
but Francis is
getting some amazing footage.

704
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,105
You gotta trust me,
it's gonna be great.

705
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:31,977
Yeah, well, trust
has to earned, Ruddy.

712

713
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,388

for you if you want it.

714

Oh, I knew you were
a good producer, all right.

Yeah, sure, why not?
Yeah, yeah.

Good.

00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,624
Hey, hey, whoa! Watch it!

982
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,495
Jesus.
Hey, Jack.

983
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:50,584
Bob.

984
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,413
What's going on?
Wow, out of sight.

985
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:55,720
Wow.

986
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:58,853
Looks great.
You like that?

987
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:02,770
How can I put this delicately?

988
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:04,119
You're fired,

989
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:05,904
you backstabbing son
of a bitch.

990
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:07,688
Get the hell off my set.
Okay, wait a second.

991
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:09,951
Why don't you get the fuck
out of here too, Jack?

992
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:14,477
Listen, Mr. Producer,
that's not the way this works.

993
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:15,696
You can't do that.

994
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,524
But I can.

995
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:19,526
Excuse me, Al.

996
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:21,702
Jack...

997
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,357
You're fired.

998
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,316
Now to quote something
I heard mere seconds ago,

999
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,103
"Get the fuck off my set."

1000
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:35,237
Let's go.

1001
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,720
This isn't over, Evans.

1002
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:41,461
Oh, we'll agree
to disagree on that.

1003
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:44,682
Oh, and Jack, you got
a little blood on your collar.

1004
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,553
It's right there.

1005
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:48,729
Right there, pal.

1006
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:52,559
Who wants a drink?
Ooh.

1007
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,343
I can't.
I got somewhere I gotta be.

1008
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:56,476
Aw, raincheck.

1009
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,696
Francis?Absolutely.

1010
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:01,176
Ah, Francis, I'm touched.
That felt very good.

1011
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,352
You know what, man?
That fucking head.

1012
00:45:03,396 --> 00:45:04,876
- That's something, right?
- Yeah.

1013
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:07,008
That's something.
It could be iconic.

1014
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,793
Great work today, Marlon.

1015
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:11,143
Eh, not as great
as the show back there.

1016
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:13,623
You should have
charged admission for it.

1017
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,887
You saw all that, huh?

1018
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,454
Well, listen, it's not gonna
affect production, trust me.

1019
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:21,588
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not
worried about the production.

1020
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,459
As long as Francis
is at the helm,

1021
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:26,071
the rest of it's
just white noise.

1022
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:29,552
I guess that's
the funny thing about power.

1023
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,250
What's that?

1024
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:33,556
Well, the ones
who truly have it...

1025
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,733
don't gotta talk about it.

1026
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:43,523

We got a week left in New York,
we'll just keep our heads down

1032
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:48,866
and finish the job,

1033
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,563
at least we're done
with the mob.

1034
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:53,174
You know who I am?

1035
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:54,915
I'm Joe Gallo.

1036
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,396
You can't fuck with this guy,
Al, he's crazy.

1037
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:59,137
What does Gallo want?

1038
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,355
The money we have left
for Sicily.

1039
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:02,401
I'll squeeze
that prick producer dry.

1040
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:03,402
Are we safe?

1041
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,232
Honestly,
I don't know anymore.

1042
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:07,972
Action!

1043
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:10,322
Something's up
with Evans.

1044
00:48:10,365 --> 00:48:10,888
He hasn't been in the office
in days.

1045
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:13,629
The Bob Evans I know
wouldn't let his personal life

1046
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:14,892
compromise this fucking movie!
You don't know me!

1047
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,110
You don't know me!

1048
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:16,981
I'm working on
The Godfather.

1049
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:18,199
Have you read it?
Skimmed.

1050
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:19,592
Cut 30 minutes!

1051
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,594
They're ruining my picture.

1052
00:48:21,637 --> 00:48:22,595
Evans is done.

1053
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:24,640
The guy has given his blood
for your company.

1054
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:25,859
I gave my blood for him.

1055
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,034
What the hell are we gonna do?

1056
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:31,909
You know
what is necessary

1057
00:48:32,735 --> 00:48:33,998
to get the job done.

1058
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:37,566
This is the start
of a beautiful friendship.

1059
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,567
We're gonna keep it...

1060
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:49,752
...in the family.

1061
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:51,754
Has anyone seen Pacino?

1062
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:53,365
Yeah, he's right there.

1063
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,367
Why is he not in wardrobe?

1064
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,630
I don't know, but the kid
better bring his A game today,

1065
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,153
otherwise we're fucked.

1066
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:00,938
When Anthony Ippolito
showed up on set

1067
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,549
and I heard his voice,
it was uncanny.

1068
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:06,421
It was like being
with the real Al.

1069
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,597
Why did we move
the scene up today?

1070
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:12,950
He was not
impervious to being nervous

1071
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:16,083
as he was about to
film the iconic scene

1072
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:19,913
of when Michael Corleone
shoots Sollozzo and McCluskey

1073
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,871
in Louis Restaurant.

1074
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:30,141
They wanna fire me, don't they?

1075
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:33,274
Listen to me, look at me.

1076
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:35,973
We're not gonna let
that happen to you.

1077
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:39,237
Pacino was maybe
about to get fired,

1078
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,153
and he's about to do
what now many consider

1079
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:44,982
one of the greatest
scenes captured on film.

1080
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,548
It's just incredible.

1081
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:48,028
When you come in here,

1082
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,119
I want you to be
extremely nervous.

1083
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,121
That shouldn't be a stretch.

1084
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:55,470
They're talking
about firing him,

1085
00:49:55,514 --> 00:49:57,690
the whole production's
gonna unravel,

1086
00:49:57,733 --> 00:49:59,126
talking about firing me.

1087
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,302
They didn't want
Francis Ford Coppola,

1088
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,652
and he was kind of
in director's jail.

1089
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:06,177
And they didn't want Pacino;
nobody knew who he was.

1090
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,309
That stuff, to me,
is just amazing.

1091
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:11,530
It's hard to think about them
before they were these legends.

1092
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:15,012
Out there, you're trying
very hard not to show it.

1093
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:17,014
Okay, what scene are we gonna do

1094
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:19,146
to make sure that
everyone loves Pacino?

1095
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,714
We do the scene where
Michael has to step up.

1096
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,543
This bathroom...

1097
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:26,545
this is the birthplace

1098
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:29,330
of the future
Don Michael Corleone.

1099
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,419
He has to step up as an actor,

1100
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,552
Michael has to step
up in the movie.

1101
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:35,423
So, there's so many
moments like that

1102
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:37,295
where I'm just like, "Ah,
this is just brilliant."

1103
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:39,210
When you put the gun back there,

1104
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:42,039
don't put it there,
put it to the left.

1105
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:45,129
Yeah, and like
six inches higher.

1106
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,740
That's perfect.
Do not tell him.

1107
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:50,525
Dan's so great
and he's so talented,

1108
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:53,659
and what he's doing with
Coppola is so beautiful.

1109
00:50:53,702 --> 00:50:55,878
We were both excited
about that bathroom scene.

1110
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,271
It's just so cool.

1111
00:50:59,186 --> 00:50:59,795
I mean, how many times do you
get to do something like that?

1112
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:02,059
Hey, Charlie, I didn't
know you were coming today.

1113
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:03,756
I was present for
the scene

1114
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,453
where Michael shoots McCluskey.

1115
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:08,021
If you imagine, as an actor,
you come to set

1116
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,328
and they've
essentially recreated

1117
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:14,419
exactly the cafe where
that scene happened.

1118
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:20,338
Don't worry, Charlie,
it's not real.

1119
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:23,080
And cut!

1120
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,212
It was also weirdly meta,

1121
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:30,348
because we were watching
Coppola direct Pacino,

1122
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:33,177
and then interacting
with Anthony,

1123
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,615
who plays Pacino, as Charlie.

1124
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,357
It's sort of a scene within
a scene, within a scene,

1125
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,706
but that was a great experience.

1126
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:45,450
Stop.

1127
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,672
It's beautiful.

1127
00:51:51,305 --> 00:52:51,253
