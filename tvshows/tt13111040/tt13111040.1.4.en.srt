1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:04,405
Joe Gallo's actions
led to our last war.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,108
My family is now
the Colombo family,

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,310
and I have a right to handle
these matters as I see fit.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,744
What do you got in mind
for him?

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,780
I'm gonna light his whole
fucking world on fire

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,615
and burn everything
he ever loved

7
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,016
to the fucking ground.

8
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,051
I'm a serious man,
and I'm committed

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,352
to making a serious movie,

10
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,488
one that family men
like yourself can be proud of.

11
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,556
If you want me to change the
script, I'll change the script.

12
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,392
I know who Michael is.
Who?

13
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,594
Al Pacino.

14
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,696
That shrimp never
gets the part.

15
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,098
He's a beautiful actor!

16
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,765
Hey, director,
take a visual cue.

17
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,401
Doesn't get this part.

18
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,802
These scripts,
they come into your office

19
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,070
and just sit there.

20
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,037
That's just money burning.

21
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,673
So let me help you.
We can do this together.

22
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,708
If that's what you want.

23
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,810
Hi, Bob.
Hey, gorgeous.

24
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,113
I will find me a producer

25
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,748
who knows not to shit
where he sleeps.

26
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,551
Mr. Lovano, this is Al Ruddy,
the producer of the film.

27
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,552
Nice to meet you.

28
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,553
This is perfect.

29
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,622
We can shoot
the whole wedding sequence

30
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:55,689
right on the lawn here.

31
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,757
You like it?
I like it.

32
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,227
Do you want to know
why I'm happy?

33
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,461
Yes.
Brando wrote you back.

34
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,829
He wants to do it.

35
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,597
He wants to play the Don.

36
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,632
We need hits.

37
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,167
Did you read "Love Story"?

38
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,202
What does that have to do
with anything?

39
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,337
The audience needs
to be moved, Barry.

40
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,739
That's how you make
hit pictures.

Tonight all of Hollywood
turned out

44
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,397
for the premiere
of "Love Story,"

45
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,666
starring Ali MacGraw
and Ryan O'Neal.

46
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,269
Audiences across the country
are flocking to theaters

47
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,871
to see the adaptation
of the best-selling novel.

48
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,373
Could this finally be the hit

49
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,775
that turns around
Paramount's fate?

50
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,512
It's fucking ridiculous.

51
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,214
We should have never gone
to that premiere.

52
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,284
I had to go.
No, you didn't.

53
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,386
I had to support Bob.
"Love Story" is his baby.

54
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:06,954
Well, it's his baby,
not yours.

55
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,522
You didn't want to go,
you should have stayed home.

56
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,224
Oh, but then
I would have missed everyone

57
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,460
looking over your shoulder
for someone better to talk to.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,194
You need to learn
how to read a room, Al.

59
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,297
I don't give a shit
about reading a room!

60
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,765
I wouldn't have gotten
to where I am if I did.

61
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,767
And where exactly
is that, huh?

62
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,502
Getting embarrassed
by your peers?

63
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,803
Were we invited
in the first place?

64
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,238
I don't think we were.

65
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:25,573
You don't know what it takes
to be a producer.

66
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,441
You've been one
for all of seven seconds.

67
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,209
This is the kind of shit
that you have to do.

68
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,711
Yes.
Don't fool yourself, Al.

69
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,613
You haven't been one
for much longer, all right?

70
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,815
This coming from a woman
who's never built anything

71
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,584
by herself in her life.

72
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,985
And what do you call
the Chateau?

73
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,620
A divorce settlement.

74
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,926
Let's drop it.
No, no, no, no.

75
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,960
Let's talk about this.

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,897
You always do this.
It's all "Baby, it's okay."

77
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,700
Or, "It's a joke,"
or whatever vapid remark

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,935
that gets you out
of having a real conversation.

79
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,939
So I want to have
a real conversation now.

80
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,310
We're talking now, aren't we?

81
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,713
The fact that you think so
is the fucking problem.

82
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,921
I already live
on a mountaintop.

83
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,022
Hey!

84
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,490
Last night
was out of sight, right?

85
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,725
How 'bout those reviews?

86
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,259
Reviews?

87
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,028
The critics
are raving about it.

88
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,530
Todd, my usual.

89
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,399
Please, stop it.
It's crazy. It's too loud.

90
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,667
Well, maybe
a little bit louder.

91
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,941
Bob, what a film.

92
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,509
You made
the classic tearjerker.

93
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,910
I mean, if Louis B.
was still alive,

94
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,746
he'd be jealous of you.

95
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,414
What a great party.
Sorry we had to leave early.

96
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,582
Well, to be honest,

97
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,317
I was surprised
you could make it at all.

98
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,618
With literally zero cast

99
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,354
and more budget concerns
than the Fed.

100
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,921
Bravo, Evans.
Thank you.

101
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,658
Look, producer's tip 101.

102
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,660
If your movie's
on shaky ground,

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,664
do not bring that vibe
to another man's premiere.

104
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,598
Just, mm-mm, no.

105
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,500
Thank you very much.
Got it.

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,335
I'm in town
for casting meetings.

107
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,470
Luca Brasi, Fontane,

108
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,638
a lot of actors want in
on this picture.

109
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:05,939
You don't cast Michael
and the Don,

110
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:06,940
you don't have a picture.

111
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,942
Seriously, don't give Bluhdorn

112
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,878
a reason to pull the plug
on this one.

113
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,481
Speaking of the Don,
I got good news.

114
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,349
Mm-hmm?

115
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,084
Marlon Brando is interested.

116
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,453
Brando?
Yeah.

117
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,489
Now I got your attention.
Yeah.

118
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,590
For all the wrong reasons.

119
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,057
Brando's a fucking nightmare.

120
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,393
Box office poison.

121
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,461
Just a very difficult
human being.

122
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,764
Look, do you want my advice?
Always.

123
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,332
Don't waste your time.

124
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,001
There's plenty of other
good actors out there.

125
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,436
Just move on
to someone realistic

126
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,970
and use Andrea.

127
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,539
She knows what
she's doing, man.

128
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,741
I know.

129
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,709
One more thing.

130
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,411
Don't do Peter Falk.
It hurts my head.

131
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,479
It's about Pacino.

132
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,647
Give him another shot.

133
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,682
Francis loves him.
No. No Pacino.

134
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,684
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

135
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:54,588
You trust my taste,
and stop it, all right?

136
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,390
Look, "Love Story"
is poised to be

137
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,758
one of the biggest-grossing
movies of all time,

138
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,359
and "The Godfather"
needs to follow suit.

139
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,629
Do you hear me?
Do you understand?

140
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,366
Do not fuck up my streak,
all right?

141
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,637
I don't think one movie
in a row constitutes a streak.

142
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,540
He needs to have
his head examined.

143
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,007
I should have
my head examined

144
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,108
for what we're about to do.

145
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,577
Why?

146
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,046
He didn't say
you couldn't go after Brando.

147
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,614
Just said it was
a waste of your time.

148
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,883
Let's hope Bob appreciates
that distinction.

149
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,419
I mean, Brando has canceled
this meeting four times,

150
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,154
so maybe he won't have to.

151
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,756
Hey, boys.

152
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,758
Morning.

153
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:35,896
So this is
the Marlon Brando's house.

154
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,600
I imagined it differently
in my head.

155
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,665
Mario.

156
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,604
When I, uh, got your letter,

157
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,005
I thought,
"This, you could do, Marlon."

158
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,042
So thank you for allowing me
to come into your life.

159
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,878
Well, you're Marlon Brando.

160
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,013
Sit.

161
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,015
Thank you.

162
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:35,455
So, um, thank you so much
for having us.

163
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,195
Have you, uh--

164
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,599
have you seen my movie "Burn"?

165
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,000
Uh, no.
No.

166
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,503
Not yet.
I've never heard of it.

167
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,476
They call me
"Burned Out Brando."

168
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,512
I haven't heard that.

169
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:03,050
I don't know who "they" is,
but they're morons.

170
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,487
You two,
you two are good actors.

171
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,824
Acting is a social lubricant.

172
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,695
People lie constantly
by not saying what they think

173
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,698
or by saying
what they don't think

174
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,701
or not saying what they--
they mean,

175
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:24,638
but saying what they think
you want to hear.

176
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,176
Yes, and...

177
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,913
the difference with acting
is that you're given the words.

178
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,182
Well, dialogue changes.

179
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,884
Motivation doesn't.

180
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,723
You'd like to know
my motivation

181
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:46,159
for being here
and sitting with you?

182
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,528
Yeah.
You like the part.

183
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,968
Sinatra hated that I sang
"Luck Be a Lady"

184
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,804
in "Guys and Dolls."

185
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,873
He hates "The Godfather."

186
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,576
So...

187
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,645
I thought I'd piss him off.

188
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,546
That's the real reason.

189
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,115
It's not for the money.

190
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:16,924
I see you.

191
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,060
Come on.

192
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,098
Hello.

193
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,834
Come on, Bettye.

194
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:29,737
She works for me.

195
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,608
Ah.

196
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,277
You know, ever--
ever since your letter,

197
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,113
I keep thinking about the Don.

198
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,316
It's all I see anymore.

199
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,587
I was--

200
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,589
I was thinking maybe--

201
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,592
maybe the Don
got shot in the throat,

202
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:56,129
which--which
affected his voice.

203
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:01,234
Maybe--maybe his jowls
droop like a bulldog.

204
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,804
Huh.

205
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,138
Kai.

206
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,274
Bring me the black shoe polish.

207
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:17,217
♪

208
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,222
Buona sera, buona sera.

209
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:10,103
- Thank you again.
- Bye, Kai. Bye, Marlon.

210
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,705
Bye, Marlon.

211
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,074
Holy shit!

212
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,978
Tissue paper and shoe polish,
and Brando disappears.

213
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,312
He's a genius.

214
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,749
Francis,
you're actually smiling.

215
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,183
Let me tell you something.

216
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,286
John Ford, he once said
that you make one for them,

217
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,088
and you make one for yourself.
Well, guess what.

218
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,957
I just realized the one
that I'm making for them

219
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,392
could be the best one
that I'm making for myself.

220
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,727
And I'm not talking
about some upgrade

221
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,062
to a Warner Brothers
gangster flick.

222
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,131
Now we got a shot at making
the real thing here, people.

223
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,332
Francis.
Yes.

224
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,201
You're gonna make
a great film.

225
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,770
Thank you, Bettye.

226
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,305
Pacino and Brando
in the same frame.

227
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,775
I'm working on it.
Okay? I promise.

228
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,342
We're making a movie.

229
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,344
See you later, boys.

230
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,981
- Bye.
- Take care.

231
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,949
Hopefully the guys in
the tower see what we just saw.

232
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,250
I mean, that was incredible.
Yeah.

233
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,852
My God, what an actor.

234
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,487
Do you think Pacino's
actually a possibility?

235
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,488
No.

236
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:05,325
But I'll figure something out.

237
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,894
When I started working
for you,

238
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,962
I really wasn't sure
you knew what you were doing.

239
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,330
Most of them time, I don't.

240
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,766
Well, let me tell you,

241
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,035
you're doing
something important.

242
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,736
That's why I don't mind
trading in a love life

243
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,272
for reading
"Godfather" rewrites.

244
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,174
You just fucking swing.

245
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,510
And that matters.

246
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,446
Thanks, Bettye.
Yeah.

247
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,516
You're gonna be late.

248
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,420
So we've covered Vegas
and Palm Springs.

249
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,823
Here's another one for you.

250
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,358
What's your favorite song
to do with Dino and the boys?

251
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,896
Let me ask you this, Bill.

252
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,431
You want to do a puff piece,

253
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,499
or you want to write
something real?

254
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,036
What do you have in mind,
Frank?

255
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,770
What does "The Times" think
of Joe Colombo

256
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:54,274
and the Italian-American
Civil Rights League?

257
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,945
More importantly,
how do you feel about it?

258
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,813
Well, they're supposed to be
protecting

259
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,414
the image of hardworking
Italian-Americans,

260
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,217
but this Colombo,

261
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,453
he hasn't done a goddamn thing
about this "Godfather" movie

262
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,488
even though
it denigrates Italians.

263
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,123
I'm telling you, Bill,

264
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,559
you've got 200,000
Italian-Americans

265
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,394
following one man,

266
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,797
and he doesn't give a shit
about what's good for them.

267
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,533
What do you think
he should be doing?

268
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,370
He ought to shut
the fucking picture down.

269
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,908
I think I'm tired.

270
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,910
I'm tired of having
the same conversation

271
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,511
over and over again.

272
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,480
That makes two of us.

273
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,417
And what conversation
is that, Francoise?

274
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,120
Well, he's never honest
with me.

275
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,589
And--and it's hurting me.

276
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,557
What have I lied about?

277
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,860
Al, you lied
about everything.

278
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,261
You lied about Mickey Cohen

279
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,530
and the fact that you're now
in bed with the mafia.

280
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,567
And now you're lying about
wanting to be my partner.

281
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,903
You are my partner.

282
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,439
No, I'm not.
Nobody is.

283
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,041
Francoise,

284
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,377
can you tell Al
what you mean by that?

285
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,848
You're placating me.

286
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,350
You don't treat me
like an equal.

287
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,920
Do you think I'm too delicate
or something?

288
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,521
No, I think
you're tough as nails.

289
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,057
Then treat me with respect.

290
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,028
I'm sorry.

291
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,195
I don't want you to be sorry

292
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,630
or say what you think
I want to hear.

293
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,233
I just want you to be real.
Be honest.

294
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,401
That's all
I've ever asked of you.

295
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,103
Life is complicated.

296
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,973
I understand some things
are private. No problem.

297
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,108
But some things aren't,
or at least they shouldn't be.

298
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,377
And the truth
isn't complicated.

299
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,046
It's always the truth.

300
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,514
And if someone's your partner,
you don't bend it or avoid it.

You fucking tell it.

I don't want

324

Carmine. Lenny.

325
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,671
Is there some place to go?

326
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,006
How about a seat right here?

327
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,174
And don't worry, Carmine,

328
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,109
we'll get a high chair
for you.

329
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,710
Yeah.
This is business, Joe.

330
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,146
This isn't a place to discuss--

331
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,381
What, you don't feel safe
here in Harlem?

332
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,588
From Colombo.

333
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,730
$1,000?

334
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,599
Colombo sent you
all the way up here

335
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,402
just to fucking insult me?

336
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,005
Go back
and tell your fucking boss

337
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,607
I got my own family now.

338
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,077
I don't need his charity.

339
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,214
Known you guys
for a very long time.

340
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,250
You got 30 seconds
to get the fuck out of here,

341
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,618
or I'm gonna send you
back to Colombo

342
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,220
with your heads in a box.

343
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,092
Let's go, Lenny.

344
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,481
Gianni, what the hell
are you doing here?

345
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,816
Bettye Boop!

346
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,551
Is that the way you greet
an old friend?

347
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,785
Come here.
Give me a hug.

348
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,555
How the hell did you
even get on the lot?

349
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,056
You know I know people.

350
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,057
I thought I'd surprise you.

351
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,193
Brought you something.

352
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,365
Wow. A whole scone.

353
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,600
Yeah, I got it on the road
from this little cafe

354
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,769
that'll change your life,
right outside of Vegas.

355
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,205
Hand to God,
the best pastries in the world.

356
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,073
Hey. Who's this?

357
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,109
You're Al Ruddy, right?
Yeah, that's me.

358
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,577
Just the man
I was looking for.

359
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:58,778
Al, this is Gianni Russo.

360
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,347
He used to date
a girlfriend of mine,

361
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,782
but he was just leaving.
But first, sir,

362
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,185
I brought you something.
Oh, what, another scone?

363
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,154
Nah, something much better.

364
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,555
Gianni, you cannot just
bring your reel.

365
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:09,856
I can't just what?

366
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,525
Al's got a movie to cast.
Ain't that right, Al?

367
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,827
I'm just helping him.
Nice of you to stop by.

368
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,130
A transistor radio
changed my life.

369
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,465
Hand to God.
Listen to this.

370
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,866
You're never gonna believe
this shit.

371
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,203
I heard Frank Sinatra on it,
and I thought to myself,

372
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,638
"He's Italian. I'm Italian--"

373
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,674
Wait, wait, wait.
You're Italian?

374
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,808
My point is,

375
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,810
is if he can do it,
why not me?

376
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,279
Who could argue
with that logic?

377
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,613
You gotta watch
the whole thing.

378
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:34,747
It's incredible.

379
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,549
I did Michael, Sonny,
and the Don.

380
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,418
Ha! Wow, that is
a hell of a hat trick.

381
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,353
Hopefully
not all at the same time.

382
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,322
I just figured those are
the ones I'd be believable in.

383
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,557
Well, if you need any help with
any research, I'm your guy.

384
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,826
"The Godfather"
ain't got nothing on my life.

385
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,561
Hand to God.

386
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,230
At the very least,

387
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,599
Gianni just marked three roles
off our casting slate.

388
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,201
That's a relief.

389
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,203
Evans wants to have
a state of the union tomorrow

390
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,504
before we head back
to New York.

391
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,406
Hi. We put a bunch
of Dons on tape.

392
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,140
Anthony Quinn. Danny Thomas.
We'll show him then.

393
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,742
What about Fontane?

394
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,178
Francis likes Al Martino
for it.

395
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,179
I have no idea who that is,

396
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:07,480
but if Francis likes him,
I'm good.

397
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:08,748
Have you spoken to Francis
about casting

398
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,283
his sister Talia for Connie?

399
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,484
She's strong.
She wants to do the role.

400
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,453
He's got enough drama
with the Corleone family.

401
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:14,921
He may not want
to involve his own.

402
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,390
And dare I bring up Michael?

403
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,292
Has Evans approved Pacino
for the role?

404
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,860
Francis has a better chance
of seeing God

405
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,329
than getting Pacino that part.

406
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,764
He's tested four times.
Caan is a strong choice.

407
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,899
Francis will never go for it.

408
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,901
Bluhdorn saw Pacino
off-Broadway,

409
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,437
and he likes him,
if that helps.

410
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,938
Not while Evans is
still running this place.

411
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,606
He's angling
for Redford or Nicholson.

412
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,941
How the fuck you know
what Bluhdorn likes?

413
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,710
'Cause I did my homework.
Oh, teacher's pet.

414
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,312
What about
Falk for Moe Green?

415
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,780
Can we get him
out of his NBC deal?

416
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,282
No longer interested.

417
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,217
He said, and I quote,
"I had to hire a detective

418
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,185
to find the part,
and I still couldn't."

419
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,921
Can one fucking thing
go right with this picture?

420
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,690
I mean,
is that too much to ask?

421
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,426
I got a script
the size of an encyclopedia,

422
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,328
a budget that's less than
Bluhdorn spends

423
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,929
on cigars in a month, no cast.

424
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,298
We got Duvall in for Hagen.

425
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,467
He a great actor.
Changes nothing.

426
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,635
What about Brando?
We don't have Brando.

427
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,305
What we have
is a silent 8-millimeter film

428
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,240
to try and get him approved,
which, let's be honest,

429
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,575
that could blow up
in our faces.

430
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,377
I got a director in love
with the shortest unknown actor

431
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,778
on the fucking planet,

432
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,714
and Biaggi's making waves.

433
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,450
Am I forgetting anything?

434
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,719
No.
I'm pretty sure that covers it.

435
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,694
He's having a day.

436
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,730
Evidently, yeah.

437
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,600
I think that Gianni guy
would be good for Carlo.

438
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,269
Are you serious, Ruddy?
The guy is a schmuck.

439
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,305
Typecasting at its best.

440
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,006
Show it to Francis.

441
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,411
Who?
Don't ask.

442
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,384
I'll tell you what,
Ol' Blue Eyes better start

443
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,852
using that microphone
for singing,

444
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:53,986
or I'm gonna strangle him
with it.

445
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,488
What's it say?

446
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,624
Motherfucker's questioning
my loyalty to my people.

447
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,792
You want me to do something
about it?

448
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,495
I think it's a little more
complicated than that.

449
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,963
How'd it go?

450
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,265
Not good.

451
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,601
He was out of order, Joe.

452
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,036
He wasn't happy.

453
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,838
He said it was an insult.

454
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,307
Because it was.

455
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,576
And now we watch.

456
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,445
Gallo's gonna do
something crazy.

457
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,847
Then I'm gonna go back
to the Commission

458
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,982
and get the okay
to take him out.

459
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,984
What do you want to do
about Sinatra?

460
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,820
You know, if I let
a wannabe tough guy singer

461
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,022
and a corrupt congressman
beat me at this,

462
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,324
I might as well move to Boca.

463
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,394
I gotta double down
on this movie.

464
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,372
♪

465
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,974
I love this tune.

466
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,343
Yes, mama.

467
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,787
Hey, baby.
Hello.

468
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,655
You smell good.
Mm.

469
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,062
It could be important.

470
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,465
I got it, I got it.

471
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,902
Yello.

472
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,437
Jack!

473
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,038
Jackie, baby,
what's going on, man?

474
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,607
How you doing?

475
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,976
I'm good.
I'm good, I'm good.

476
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,645
Huh?

477
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,346
Yeah, yeah, I'll tell her.
Yeah.

478
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,948
Hey, did you see those
box office numbers, baby?

479
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,117
Evans.
Yeah, right?

480
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:33,553
It's Nicholson.
It's Jack.

481
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,022
Hey, look, that's not
the reason I called earlier.

482
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,390
No.

483
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,493
"The Godfather,"
the role of Michael.

484
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,828
Listen, star,
you can play anything.

485
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,730
Irish, Italian,
what's the difference?

486
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,932
You make it your own, baby.
You're the "Easy Rider."

487
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,500
No one can put a tag on you.

488
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,536
And when I say, "Easy Rider,"
it's not a tag,

489
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:50,737
it's a compliment.

490
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:51,971
You son of a bitch.

491
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,974
I know.

492
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,844
Yeah, run
the agreement and get it done!

493
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,012
Get the car ready.

494
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,481
Hello.

495
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:02,649
Mr. Director.

496
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,851
Charlie,
can I get a minute?

497
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,519
No.

498
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,865
I have something
you need to see.

499
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,400
What, the Coppola family
goes to Coney Island?

500
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,569
I promise you it's important.

501
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,136
Yeah, well make
an appointment, Francis.

502
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,506
Charlie,
what I have to show you,

503
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,407
it's the difference
between a good movie

504
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,510
and a cinematic classic.

505
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,778
You gotta see it.

506
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,963
Hey.
Did you slip it in?

507
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,699
Thanks.

508
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,468
Hi, Bob.

509
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,570
We've got Oscar winners
lined up for you to see.

510
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,806
We've got Steiger,
Anthony Quinn, Ernest Borgnine.

511
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:00,873
I don't know
why the hell we're doing this

512
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:02,141
without Francis.
I need his opinion.

513
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,143
Where is he?
He's in New York.

514
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,712
What the fuck
is he doing in New York?

515
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:08,180
Anyone?

516
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,882
Yes?

517
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,017
Got it, got it.

518
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,218
It's Charlie.

519
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,920
He wants us to watch something.

520
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,055
Huh?

521
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,525
Hi, Charlie.
We're starting now.

522
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,627
Mm.

523
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:27,934
Who is that?

524
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,936
Is that Rod Steiger?

525
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,171
That's not Steiger.

526
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,173
Look at those eyes.

527
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,642
Is that Brando?

528
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,745
It's fucking magic.
I love it. I love it!

529
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,146
It's the first time
I got a clue

530
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,648
of what Francis wants to do.

531
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,783
I'm sorry, but what does

532
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:48,020
a silent, three-minute
home movie prove?

533
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,823
It proves...

534
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,693
that he's still
the greatest actor of our time.

535
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,562
Brando will bring
something no one expects.

536
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,096
'Cause he's a nutcase!

537
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,698
The budget will skyrocket.

538
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,700
No, guys, he'll play ball.

539
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,135
He invited us to his home.
He let us put him on film.

540
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,171
Okay? He wants to do this.

541
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,573
I mean, look at the screen.

542
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,541
You can't take
your eyes off him.

543
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:12,645
Charlie...

544
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:15,715
you're watching
something very special.

545
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,293
- Evans, he works for scale.
- All right.

546
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:28,595
BLUHDORN
And puts up a bond.

547
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,529
Make it a million dollars.

548
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,565
That way, he doesn't pull
any of his games.

549
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,300
Sure.

550
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,907
Marlon Brando.

551
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,910
He's great, right?

552
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,178
Yeah, he's great.

553
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,048
If we lock him in,
it's a go picture?

554
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,050
Mm-hmm.

555
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,185
It worked out for you
this time, kid.

556
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:58,658
♪

557
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:01,828
Don't ever try
and go around me again.

558
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,832
Not gonna happen.
Thanks, Bob.

559
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,115
What are you reading?

560
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:32,291
They finally approved
Brando today.

561
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,594
It's a big deal.

562
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,130
So you're heading back
to New York.

563
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:42,869
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow.

564
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,972
Things are just really starting
to move fast now.

565
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,309
Francoise, I don't know
what you want from me.

566
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,778
Yes, you do.

567
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:54,681
It's not just the same
as what you want from me.

568
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:01,721
"The Godfather" is a threat
to our very existence.

569
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,990
It's an insult
to our businesses,

570
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,291
to our culture.

571
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,326
This picture is an assault

572
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,796
on Italian-Americans
everywhere.

573
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,931
And as a public servant,
I have to address

574
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,833
the concerns
of my constituents

575
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,670
and hold everyone behind
"The Godfather" accountable.

576
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,071
Thank you.

577
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,741
Fuck. Fuck.

578
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,010
And that is only
the beginning.

579
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,746
There's a Biaggi piece
in the "Chicago Sun-Times."

580
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,381
"The Tribune" quotes
some Italian baker

581
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,851
that "The Godfather"
is blasphemous

582
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,285
and he's gonna boycott
"Love Story."

583
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,653
Fuck.

584
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,824
And Sinatra
is on record as well.

585
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:40,993
If you ever do decide
to sell Paramount,

586
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,996
no buyer is gonna
want to touch us.

587
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,899
This is turning
into a fucking fiasco.

588
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,938
Charlie.

589
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,073
Ruddy needs to be supervised.
All right?

590
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,942
He's in way over his head
with this kind of stuff.

591
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:59,278
And one small,
little misstep from him

592
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,380
is gonna be a disaster.

593
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,214
It's our fault.

594
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,317
We gave him
too much responsibility.

595
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,286
One low-budget biker film

596
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,321
and a sitcom
that he walked away from--

597
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,790
that's his résumé.

598
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,894
But I don't care
about how he got Marlon Brando

599
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,463
in his little home movie,
all right?

600
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,466
We need to do something
to save this movie.

601
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,302
And we need to do it now.

602
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,071
Talk to legal.

603
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,173
Let me know
what our options are.

604
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,475
Okay.

605
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,079
I gotta tell you, Marlon,

606
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,083
Jimmy Cagney told me
he thinks that you are

607
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,218
the transformative actor
of your art form.

608
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,354
Well...

609
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,958
after the war, people
were looking for rebellion.

610
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,461
I happened to be at the right
place at the right time

611
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,263
with the right state of mind.

612
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,199
Well, you're at the right
time with "The Godfather."

613
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,400
We want you for it.

614
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,836
We just need to talk
about your approach,

615
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,206
not just creative,
but as part of the team.

616
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,110
We need to know that
you're gonna play nice, Marlon.

617
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:07,279
Play nice?

618
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:08,881
Mm.

619
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:13,152
What is this?
A sandbox?

620
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:17,056
Who are you?

621
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,326
What?

622
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,495
We're just talking
things through here.

623
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,997
I don't talk things through.

624
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,966
That's what I have
an agent for.

625
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,200
I know that.

626
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,036
But this is in the spirit
of how we're making the movie.

627
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,371
We got no problem
with your artistry

628
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,040
or your chemistry with Francis.

629
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,042
We just need to know
that you'll accept

630
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,177
that we're working
on a limited budget, man.

631
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,046
That's all.

632
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,115
Cagney said that?

633
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,450
Mm.

634
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,819
That means so much to me.

635
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,929
I have a--I have a suggestion
for Michael, if I may.

636
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,497
Well,
I'd love to hear it, Marlon.

637
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,132
Who are you thinking?

638
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,300
Well, he's a--

639
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,335
he's a great theater actor.

640
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:08,975
He won an award
for "Tiger in the Bowtie."

641
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:12,244
This kid, you can't take
your eyes off of him.

642
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,880
Al Pacino.

643
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,951
Yeah, I never heard of him.

644
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,256
Oh, that's gonna go
straight down the hall

645
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,257
and to the left.

646
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,493
How was your flight?
Long and bumpy.

647
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:30,296
And?
Everything at home?

648
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,998
Don't ask.
Roger that.

649
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,901
Hey, anything on Brando?

650
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,335
Home run on the offices,
Ruddy.

651
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,037
That's all Bettye.
Aww.

652
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,438
Your office is right here.

653
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,141
I've got Evans.
In my office.

654
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,582
Hi, Bob. I've got Al
and Francis with me.

655
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,118
Did you find me
a Michael yet?

656
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:53,519
Hey, Bob.
I didn't think so.

657
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,454
Francis, stop pimping Pacino.

658
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,455
Brando couldn't even get
the name

659
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,124
of Pacino's play right.

660
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,591
So, Brando,
you nail him down?

661
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,626
Nail him down?

662
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,628
He's like
nailing jelly to a tree.

663
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,196
Look, we need a deal at scale.

664
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,531
We need him bonded
for a million.

665
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:06,966
And we need his signature.

666
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,567
This is your shot, Ruddy.

667
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,369
You nail him down.

668
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,274
Bettye, get Irv Goldstein.
Yes.

669
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,044
Why does he have such
a hard-on against Pacino?

670
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,546
Francis, look, please.

671
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,115
Al Ruddy for Irv Goldstein.

672
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,152
I have Goldstein.

673
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,954
You know how
to play hardball?

674
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,089
I invented the game.

675
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,892
- Irv.
- You're one lucky SOB.

676
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,928
Mr. Brando
never wants to work,

677
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,930
but I convinced him
for 100 grand a week,

678
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,165
five-week guarantee,

679
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,433
with his usual perks
to do your movie.

680
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,568
Way to go.

681
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,403
Irv, it's a $4 million picture.

682
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,972
Everybody works for scale.

683
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,539
Then Marlon
isn't in the picture.

684
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,575
- That's right.
- Who else you gonna get?

685
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,244
There's always
somebody else.
No, there's nobody else.

686
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,680
- Irv, Andrea Eastman here.
- Oh, Jesus.

687
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,482
Do you know who passed
on "Casablanca"

688
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,616
before Bogart took the role?

689
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:58,985
Yeah, Ronald Reagan,

690
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:00,186
I know that one.

691
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,988
Tell Coppola
Reagan's available.

692
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,055
Reagan's, um--

693
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,191
The deal
is scale plus five points

694
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,059
once box office
hits $50 million.

695
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,527
Pass.

696
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,196
Here comes Anthony Quinn.

697
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,930
No!

698
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:13,932
What are you--
what are you doing?

699
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,035
Bottle of Dom Pérignon
he calls back in five,

700
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:19,305
four, three, two, one.

701
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:27,980
Fuck.

702
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:32,684
It's Goldstein.

703
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,520
Yes, I will connect you.

704
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,527
- This is a no quote deal.
- That's right.

705
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,130
- You go over, you pay.
- That's right.

706
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,032
Welcome
to the world of Marlon Brando.

707
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:51,403
What--how did you know
that he would call back?

708
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,140
Because he needs us
more than we need him.

709
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,375
Al Ruddy,

710
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,011
you're under arrest.

711
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,380
Sonny.
What's up, buddy?

712
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,182
You don't start till next week,
you know that, right?

713
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:04,983
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, okay.

714
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,452
Uh, everybody,
this is Sonny Grosso.

715
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,721
He's ex-NYPD and overall fixer
for guys like us.

716
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,657
He's from "French Connection."

717
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:12,724
That was me.

718
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,060
Billy Friedkin
is a good friend of mine.

719
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,328
Billy is the best.

720
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:19,098
You got a second to talk?
Yeah.

721
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,999
- How you been?
- I'm good. You?

722
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,201
Yeah, good.

723
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,569
Finally getting going
on this thing.

724
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,004
Yeah, good, good.

725
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:29,741
What do I need this for?

726
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,210
Look, I know you think

727
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,511
you know what you're doing,
all right?

728
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,346
But you don't, okay?

729
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:37,583
Getting into bed
with Joe Colombo?

730
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,218
That's a bad idea.

731
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,719
And from what I understand,
it's already done.

732
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,422
You gotta protect yourself.

733
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,524
Colombo's been nothing
but a friend to me.

734
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,658
I'm covered.

735
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,260
Honestly.

736
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:51,730
You, uh--

737
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,267
you ever hear
of Crazy Joe Gallo?

738
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,235
Maniac.

739
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:57,703
Former Profaci capo.

740
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,671
Murdered the boss,
Albert Anastasia.

741
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,573
He recently got out of jail.

742
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:02,808
What's that got to do
with me?

743
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,510
If Gallo comes gunning
for Colombo

744
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,677
like I think he will,

745
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,180
he either, I don't know,
tries to take over your movie,

746
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,149
or worse, you get caught
with a stray bullet.

747
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:13,119
Well, let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

748
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,354
But I appreciate the warning.

749
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,323
And this.

750
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,491
If you get
into a bad situation,

751
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,460
that'll buy you some time.

752
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,762
Maybe.

753
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,831
Thanks.
I'll see you.

754
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,474
Hey.

755
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,743
What a nice surprise.

756
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,578
I didn't know
you were coming today.

757
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,351
What's wrong?

758
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:49,221
I'm not staying.

759
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,724
I'm--I'm going to Paris.

760
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,161
Paris?

761
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,728
I just need to get away.

762
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,098
Clear my head.

763
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,268
But I wanted to say goodbye.

764
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:09,141
When you get back, we can--

765
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,610
we'll talk.

766
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,312
Really talk,
the way that you wanted us to.

767
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,814
I'm not coming back, Al.

768
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,683
Not to this.

769
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,822
I want to be with you.

770
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,224
All of you

771
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,826
or none of you.

772
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:38,170
♪

773
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,328
There is a simple way
to save your relationship,

774
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:04,396
if you want to.

775
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,831
Tell me.

776
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,934
Get on a plane
and get on your knees.

777
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,773
I understand
why you won't, though.

778
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,175
Thank you.

779
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,778
I got divorced a few years ago.

780
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,280
Did you know that?

781
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,215
You mentioned it.
Yeah.

782
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,783
Childhood sweethearts.

783
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,818
He grew up
down the block from me.

784
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,287
Not a single memory I have

785
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:31,457
where we weren't planning
our future together.

786
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,825
And he had this phenomenal ass.

787
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,562
Whoo!

788
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,564
Well, what happened?

789
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,466
Life, I guess.

790
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,601
I don't know, we got older,

791
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,904
realized we didn't want
the same things anymore.

792
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,639
I wanted to have a career.

793
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,708
He wanted me to bake pies.

794
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:53,412
I hate fucking pies.

795
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:57,416
I'm sorry, Bettye.
I'm not.

796
00:36:57,516 --> 00:37:00,719
I am not gonna change
for anyone.

797
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,455
What I want or who I am.

798
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:14,366
Was it easy to walk away?

799
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,834
No.

800
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:23,241
Sometimes I think
about how hard this is.

801
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:26,278
All the time,
every single turn.

802
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,750
It's like the universe
has made my balls

803
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,852
its own personal punching bag.

804
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,857
And yet,

805
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,626
I still can't seem
to walk away.

806
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,398
Then go after the girl.

807
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,702

Look at his face.

Look at--
look at the worry on his face.

He does look
fucking worried.

You're one of us now, kid.

We need each other, all right?

Yeah, of course.

Problem for you too.

I may have
a solution to that.

He doesn't want
to be humiliated, right?

840
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,608
Yeah.
That Fontaine character's

841
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:03,875
in almost a third of the book.

842

Tell him, thanks to you,

843
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,578
I was able to cut
that character down

844
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,780
to two scenes in the movie.

845
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,382
You can do that?

I mean, it's a lot of work
re-typing those scripts,

but, Joe, for you,
we can do anything.

We're so grateful
to have your support, truly.

This guy!

850

As his own tribe would say,

- A mensch.

852
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,594
I'll make sure to tell
Frank personally.

853

Please do.
All right, bye. Bye. Bye.

- Thanks, Joe.
- Bye.

Damn it!

856
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:28,800
We lost the Staten Island
compound.

857
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,135
That was Lovano.

858
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,670
What do you mean
we lost it?
We lost it.

859
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,739
Lovano, the owner,
he backed out.

860
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,575
I need that house.
The whole thing came alive...

861
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,376
Al? Al.
When I saw the house--

862
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,612
The world's looking for you,
including Bluhdorn.

863
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,014
He wants to you by end of day.

864
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,516
Okay.
Francis, I'll deal with it.

865
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,918
Just--just give me a minute,
and I'll work on it.

866
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,788
Okay.
All right?

867
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,157
Hey.

868
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:54,526
What's that about?

869
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,394
Colombo pinned me.

870
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,065
That meant something
very different

871
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,534
when I was in high school.

872
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,037
"The Godfather"
is important,

873
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,906
but it's becoming a problem.

874
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:08,840
What's the problem?

875
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,077
We just got Brando.
We're greenlit.

876
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:13,645
The problem is the bad press

877
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,113
that the picture is getting.

878
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,082
I mean, Sinatra, Biaggi,

879
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:19,050
it's coming at us
from all sides.

880
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,954
Ruddy, we want to
give you some help.

881
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,956
What kind of help?

882
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:27,959
Al...

883
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,828
We should be partners.

884
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,596
No.

885
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:32,498
Jack is gonna produce
with you.

886
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,533
He knows how
the press operates.

887
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:35,867
He can take
that burden off you.

888
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,003
And he's gonna be on set
with you anyway.

889
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,739
Just to have your back, help
with the extra heavy weight.

890
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:41,607
I got it.

891
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,909
What's Evans think about this?

892
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,811
Ask him.
He's listening.

893
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,146
I said let's hear
what you have to say.

894
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:51,149
We're all ears.

895
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,852
Well, I'm assuming,
for the three of you

896
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,153
to get this whole party
together,

897
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,688
you already talked to legal.

898
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,624
So?
So my contract states

899
00:40:58,724 --> 00:40:59,791
I'm the sole producer
on this project.

900
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,893
Al, it's not unusual
for the producer

901
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,495
to get a little help.
It's unusual for me.

902
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,696
That's why
I negotiated it that way.

903
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,733
This guy got suckered
into a pissing contest

904
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,701
with Sinatra, Biaggi,
and the Italian League.

905
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,603
Sinatra's not gonna be
a problem. I took care of it.

906
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,773
Charlie, I'm the sole producer
on this project.

907
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,775
If Jack wants to come along
and join the party, fine.

908
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,077
I'll even get him
a fancy chair on set.

909
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,846
But I'm doing this on my own.

910
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,648
I'm not putting my neck
on the line every day

911
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:24,583
to make you a great movie
so that Jack or anybody else

912
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,852
can second-guess me.

913
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,854
I make the calls.

914
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:33,224
Evans?

915
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,993
I'm with Ruddy.

916
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:40,131
Fine.

917
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,067
But a word
to the wise, Ruddy.

918
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,574
When you fail alone,
there's no one else to blame.

919
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,709
That's the only way
I want it.

920
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,086
All right.

921
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:04,289
I just want to thank all of you
for coming tonight.

922
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,124
Now that we are
finally greenlit,

923
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:07,726
we can really get
the ball rolling.

924
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,761
Closed our deals
with Dean Tavoularis

925
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,730
for production design,

926
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,299
and Gordy Willis is gonna
head up cinematography.

927
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,168
It's really an incredible team.

928
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,638
But I will defer
to the artists.

929
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:23,041
Captain, my captain,
Francis, toast.

930
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,310
Yes. Whoo!

931
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,812
Mario, you do the honors.

932
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,314
No, Francis.
Come on, this is your show.

933
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,849
I mean,
I could say a few words,

934
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,753
but it would take me at least
a month to write it, so...

935
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:38,256
Take it away.
Take it away, boss.

936
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,659
Okay.

937
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,862
Well, I'm very honored
and humbled

938
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:46,097
to be surrounded
by such talented people.

939
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,100
I hope I deserve you.

940
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,602
Um...

941
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,774
We're making a movie.

942
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,743
And you're only allotted,

943
00:42:57,843 --> 00:42:59,577
you know, a certain amount
of time during the day

944
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:01,613
to get everything done.

945
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,915
And you want everything
just perfect.

946
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,052
Every shot.

947
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:10,055
But sometimes it's great,

948
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:13,224
and it's out of focus.

949
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:17,629
Sometimes
a dolly wheel squeaks.

950
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,597
Sometimes it's magic,

951
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:22,167
and the actor
goes up on their line.

952
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,771
So you do it again,

953
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:27,072
you check the gate,
you move on.

954
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,173
Cheers.

955
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,782
To "The Godfather."

956
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,917
To "The Godfather."
To "The Godfather."

957
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:40,652
All right.
Okay, enjoy yourselves.

958
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:43,354
Wh--where you going?
We didn't even order yet.

959
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,857
I know. I gotta run.
I'm late.

960
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,226
I gotta go to Martin Scorsese's
parents' house,

961
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,829
tape their conversations
over dinner.

962
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,699
For the accents.
For the actors.

963
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,767
I'll see you all later.

964
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,673
Hey, Francis.
What's going on?

965
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,208
Everything okay?

966
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,243
That was kind of
a weird toast.

967
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,079
Look, Van Gogh
paints sunflowers, okay?

968
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,715
He needed a particular

is not gonna quite work,

won't happen.

1130
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,614
But, hey,

1131
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:33,651
I want to call Bob, and
I'll tell him that Caan is in.

1132
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,755
Good.

1133
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:40,491
Al, thanks.

1134
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,493
We're good.

1135
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:50,201
Scotch, neat.

1136
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,371
Sorry I'm late, gang.
You didn't tell him, did you?

1137
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:55,373
No, scout's honor.
Tell me what?

1138
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:56,907
Um, Francis
wanted to be here,

1139
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,676
but he's deep into prep.

1140
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:02,313
It's official.

1141
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,181
You're Michael Corleone.

1142
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:06,284
You got the part, kid.

1143
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,819
Evans approved you.
You're opposite Marlon Brando.

1144
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,795
What?

1145
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,331
What's going on?

1146
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:23,968
I was told Paramount
would never approve me.

1147
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:25,936
They called me a shrimp,
these guys, right?

1148
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,640
No. No.

1149
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,576
Al...

1150
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,711
I'm doing "The Gang That
Couldn't Shoot Straight"

1151
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,313
for MGM.

1152
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:37,682
That's a comedy.

1153
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:40,485
Al, you're a serious actor.

1154
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:44,322
Michael Corleone
is the part of a lifetime.

1155
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,625
I signed a contract.

1156
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,365
I am truly sorry.

1157
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:57,602
You know how badly I want
to do this with you, Francis...

1158
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,606
Good luck to you.

1159
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,453
We'll figure something out
for Michael.

1160
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,855
And Evans will get over it.

1161
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,690
You didn't hear him
on the phone.

1162
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,392
He sounded pretty pissed.

1163
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:25,530
Why'd you do it?

1164
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:29,300
Because Francis
needed Pacino.

1165
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,702
And I can't lose Francis.

1166
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,704
If I lose Francis,
I lose the movie.

1167
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:38,309
And at this point,
that's all I have left.

1168
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,577
At least no one can say
you don't have

1169
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:41,779
a whopping pair
of balls on you.

1170
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:47,385
No, but they can say
I don't have brains.

1171
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,354
I mean,
Evans took a chance on me

1172
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,422
when no one else would.

1173
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:53,858
And now that trust is gone.

1174
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,927
My relationship's done.

1175
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,429
For what?

1176
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:04,469
You're looking at this
the wrong way.

1177
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:07,805
The question you should be
asking yourself...

1178
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:10,641
is, why are we here,

1179
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,611
in show business?

1180
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:15,913
We're here
because this is the life

1181
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,315
that we've chosen, right?

1182
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:22,319
You, me, Bettye,
Francis, and Evans,

1183
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,621
we all ran away from home

1184
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,856
so that we could join
the circus,

1185
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,758
and everything that we say
to make it seem like

1186
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,960
we care about the life
that we could've had--

1187
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,399
wife, kids, house, dog--
it's bullshit.

1188
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:36,401
'Cause what's really
making you miserable

1189
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:37,768
isn't the fact that
you don't have a membership

1190
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,103
at the country club

1191
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:41,038
or the head of a 12-point buck
on your mantlepiece.

1192
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:43,107
None of that matters.

1193
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,975
What you really want in life,

1194
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,413
in fact, all you want in life,

1195
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:51,416
is just for a man
named Al Pacino

1196
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:54,852
to pretend he's a man
named Michael Corleone.

1197
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:59,857
And you're right
to be miserable over this.

1198
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,593
It is that important.

1199
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,463
'Cause I feel the same way.

1200
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,898
And we can only be around
other people

1201
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,901
who understand that.

1202
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:13,604

We'll have to talk about that.
We'll take it.

1230
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:21,091
We're done.
Get the fuck out of my office.

1231
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:22,927
How did it go with Evans?

1232
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:25,229
I need your help.
Boy, did you come
to the wrong place.

1233
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:26,330
So not well?

1234
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,098
Making movies has become
too unpredictable.

1235
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:29,033
We've got a problem,

1236
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:30,868
he signed a contract
for another movie.

1237
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,604
Can't I just have
one good moment?

1238
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:34,705
FBI!

1239
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:36,774
I got plenty of friends
who wouldn't mind

1240
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:37,842
taking a shot at you.

1241
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,577
If you let us put a wire
on you, we can protect you.

1242
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:41,545
Al, this is really scary.

1243
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:43,580
You did the right thing
by coming here.

1244
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,182
We are still
making the movie

1245
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:46,617
that we all set out to make.

1246
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:48,085
What's right here
is what's important.

1247
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,121
- Family.
- Salute!

1248
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,871
I have something
you need to see.

1249
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:07,838
What?

1250
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:09,139
The Coppola family
goes to Coney Island?

1251
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,641
I promise you it's important.

1252
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:12,176
Yeah, well make an
appointment, Francis.

1253
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,044
Charlie,
what I have to show you,

1254
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:16,113
it's the difference
between a good movie

1255
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,948
and a cinematic classic.

1256
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,717
You gotta see it.

1257
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,186
Look at those eyes.

1258
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:24,121
Is that Brando?

1259
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,256
It's fucking magic.
I love it.

1260
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,324
I love it!

1261
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:28,959
How do you play Marlon Brando?

1262
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:31,161
He was the greatest
actor of his generation.

1263
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,642
From the moment
that Justin Chambers

1264
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,112
went and sat down
as Marlon Brando,

1265
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,313
he just rocked it out.

1266
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:52,082
Thank you for allowing me
to come into your life.

1267
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:54,885
You're Marlon Brando.

1268
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,922
The biggest challenge
I think for Justin,

1269
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:01,859
was not to do an
imitation of Brando,

1270
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,794
and he doesn't.

1271
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:05,162
He's Brando.

1272
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,230
He's amazing.

1273
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,100
They call me burned-out Brando.

1274
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,770
I haven't heard that.

1275
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:16,006
I don't know who "they" is,
but they're morons.

1276
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:19,977
He was quite open about wanting
to honor the two legends

1277
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:22,947
that he was taking on,
this legendary performance,

1278
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:26,216
and the legendary actor
that was responsible for it.

1279
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,919
You'd like to know
my motivation for...

1280
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,755
for being here and
sitting with you?

1281
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:35,025
Because he knew
that I was
an actor as well as a director,

1282
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,928
I think he trusted
my appreciation

1283
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:41,698
of how intimidating what
he was taking on was.

1284
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,071
I see you.

1285
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:48,939
I'm sort of hiding

1286
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,207
and he clocks me

1287
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,777
and says, "I see you.
Come in and sit down."

1288
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:54,044
Come on.

1289
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:59,083
It was uncanny, how much
he looked like Brando.

1290
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:02,086
And then the way he held a room

1291
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,721
with the pauses and with
the volume of his voice

1292
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:07,257
and the power that he
managed to portray.

1293
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:10,394
Ever since your letter,
I keep thinking about the Don.

1294
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:12,997
It's-- It's all I see anymore.

1295
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:15,866
In Justin's case,
it really was like

1296
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,868
a double transformation
he had to make,

1297
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:21,305
because he had to take
on becoming Brando,

1298
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:25,843
and then as Brando, transform
himself into Vito Corleone.

1299
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,278
Maybe the Don got
shot in the throat,

1300
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,882
which uh, which
affected his voice.

1301
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,853
Both of those things he does,
I think, quite masterfully.

1302
01:02:38,022 --> 01:02:41,425
I'm very happy with how
the scene in which he transforms

1303
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,193
into the Don turned out.

1304
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,529
And we did it very
impressionistically.

1305
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:48,298
We just showed glimpses,

1306
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:51,201
so that this transformation
was something

1307
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:54,271
that we almost felt
before we saw it.

1308
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:56,473
Bonasera, Bonasera...

1309
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,042
There's something
very empowering

1310
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,944
about an actor to
be doing something

1311
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:02,346
and then see the characters
that you're working with

1312
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,948
impressed by that.

1313
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,051
It sort of reflects your own
power back to you in a way.

1314
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,854
That was a pretty
spectacular thing
to be a part of.

1315
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:12,923
I knew that the effect
was gonna be magical

1316
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,091
on the other cast members.

1317
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,094
They were all in awe of
what Justin was doing.

1318
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,063
And cut!
Beautiful.

1319
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,397
I thought he was extraordinary.

1320
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:24,168
Tissue paper and shoe polish
and Brando disappears.

1321
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,003
He's a genius.

1322
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:28,405
So does Justin Chambers
pretend to be Brando?

1323
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:29,439
Yeah, we all do.

1324
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:30,875
They're actors,
yes, they pretend.

1325
01:03:31,876 --> 01:03:33,878
But his performance really
has all the subtleties

1326
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,913
of a man who has
a deep inner life

1327
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,814
and a deep inner monologue

1328
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,884
that's constantly,
constantly running.

1329
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:40,885
That was incredible.
Yeah.

1330
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:42,252
My God, what an actor.

1331
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:45,990
It's like...
...magic every day.

1332
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,893
Now we got a shot at making
the real thing here, folks.

1332
01:03:49,305 --> 01:04:49,576
