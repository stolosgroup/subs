Yeah.

00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,970
Yeah, sure.

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,370
We could do that, but, erm...

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,770
Tell you what,
why don't you come to mine?

Yeah, I'll text you

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,690
OK. Yeah, I love you too.

30
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,810
I am so sorry.
Ah, it's not a problem.

31
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,930
Woke up stupid early again, then
fell asleep in my kitchen chair.

32
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,250
You tried valerian?

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,370
No, I can't do sleeping pills.
They zonk me out for the next day.

34
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,130
No, no, no - these are herbal.

35
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,330
No, you're absolutely normal
by 11 the next day, easy.

36
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,850
Right. Although they do stink
like rotting fish.

37
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,410
Well, they sound marvellous!

38
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,370
So, what do you think it is, then...
that's waking you up?

39
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,970
No idea.

40
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,130
Hey, Jake!

41
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,130
Morning, boss.
What we got?

42
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,170
They're laying new
drainage channels down here,

43
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,730
been doing it the last three months,

44
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,410
and then last night,
one of the workmen,

45
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,490
who happens to have trained
as a doctor in Basra, dug up this...

46
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,770
which he suspected was a section
of a human hip bone.

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,090
Dr Balcombe came out early doors,
confirmed it was human,

48
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,570
which is when they called for us.

49
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,170
SHE SIGHS
Oké, let's have a look.

50
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,450
I'm sure you think I'm being daft.

51
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,130
There's absolutely nothing
to be embarrassed about, Harry.

52
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,130
Nothing at all.

53
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,490
As you might imagine,

54
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,570
death is a pretty constant part
of my daily life,

55
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,450
and if I've learned anything
in the last 35 years,

56
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,130
it's that grief takes
every form imaginable.

57
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,170
Hm. For some,
it passes quite quickly.

58
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,850
For others, it can last many years.

59
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,810
Neither is right or wrong,
they're both just... how it is.

60
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,730
You were with Wendy for 63 years.

61
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,890
She was a part of you.

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,010
So, to still miss her
after just two...

63
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,010
Well, it's the... blink of an eye.

64
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,130
So, please, never be embarrassed

65
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,330
about wanting to talk about her
with me.

66
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,690
In fact,
I want you to talk about her.

67
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,010
I miss her, too.

68
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,890
Is the position significant?

69
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,530
What, that it's archaeological,
you mean? Yeah.

70
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,410
Not really, no.

71
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,370
Most cultures buried their dead

72
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,130
in a variety of positions -
Romans, Saxons, early medieval...

73
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,730
It could be any of those.

74
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,210
But your instinct is
that it is archaeological?

75
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,410
Well, I have no evidence of that,
it's just...

76
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,370
on balance, for obvious reasons,
I think it's more likely than not.

77
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,930
Why?

78
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,210
Well, because of where it is.

79
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,410
Who buries a body in the
central reservation of the M1?

80
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,770
Someone who doesn't want it found?

81
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,170
I guess, I just...
So how much is remaining?

82
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,530
About 60%, I think.

83
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,170
I'll know more when I get her back.

84
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,890
Right, so you think it's female?
I think, from the pelvis shape.

85
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,650
Again, I can confirm that
when I get everything out.

86
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,210
No clothing fragments?

87
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,290
Not found any yet, no.

88
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,330
It would appear we just have bones.

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,930
Do you have records for what it was
before? What the land was used for?

92
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,930
Yeah. Yeah, no, I can hold.

was built on Watling Street?

97
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,626
Old Roman road, did you know that?
I didn't.

98
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,290
I didn't know that.

99
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,290
I didn't know that.
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

103
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,130
No, no, just...

104
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,010
'you weren't home last night.'

105
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,650
I-I'm at Jen's.

106
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,770
'I told you.'
Did you?

107
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,810
I told you yesterday at breakfast
I was staying at hers.

108
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,090
Sorry, my mistake.

109
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,730
'Anyway, it's... it's no problem.'

110
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,890
I'll see you tonight?

111
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,930
Yeah, I'll see you later. Yeah.
'OK, great.'

112
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,690
Or, you know, stay out,
it's not a problem.

113
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,530
Oh... Thanks!

114
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,610
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

115
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,930
I gotta go. Lots of love, bye!

116
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,410
Actually would be quite smart,
don't you think?

117
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,730
What would?

118
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,410
If you killed someone, burying
them in a central reservation.

119
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,410
Smart? Yeah, if you were
a construction worker,

120
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,770
lanes were already closed
for repairs...

121
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,170
Even if you weren't
a construction worker, just...

122
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,170
hiring a van,
getting a hi-vis jacket,

123
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,850
three in the morning,
put up some bollards...

124
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,930
Then start digging a grave
in the middle of a motorway?

125
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,250
I mean, it'd take balls, give you
that, but... who's gonna stop you?

126
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,250
Who's gonna think, "Oh, I bet
he's not a construction worker.

127
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,130
"I bet he's... burying a body."

128
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,810
You know, the fishy smell's
really not that bad -

129
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,810
I think you should try them.
Yeah, all right!

130
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,770
SHE CHUCKLES

131
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,890
Oh, hi!
Hi there, how are you?

132
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,010
DOG BARKS

133
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,490
Oh, we're up, are we, young man?

134
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,210
Oh, super dog! Super, super dog!

135
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,490
You've decided to get up, have you?

136
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,090
Here's breakfast.

137
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,930
Today's the day big day, super dog,

138
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,410
when everything changes.

139
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,050
Yes, my Frankie,

140
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,770
today's the big day!

141
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,250
So it is female, and from the teeth,
I can tell you she's young -

142
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,090
early 20s, oldest. OK.

143
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,130
Most importantly,
you were right, DCI Stuart -

144
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,170
these remains
are not archaeological.

145
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,610
Do you see that? The bone suffered
a compound fracture at some point

146
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,210
and was fixed with a surgical plate.

147
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,290
So, plates have been used commonly
for about a hundred years,

148
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,570
but if it's titanium -

149
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,730
given the lack of corrosion,
my guess is that it is - then...

150
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,090
this is no more than 50,
60 years old, tops.

151
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,610
HE SIGHS

152
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,970
Find the need, sell the want.

153
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,610
Sell the want.

154
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,130
I'm not sure if I'm going to
sign anything today, Mr Carr.

155
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,530
And I completely understand that,
Mr Salthouse.

156
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,890
And tell me, is it the amount
that's worrying you?

157
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,690
Well...

158
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,930
Is it too much?

159
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,530
Well, possibly, but also...

160
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,690
So, what do you think
you could afford?

161
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,490
Well, as I say, it's not just the...

162
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,610
8,000? If you feel ten's too much,
how about eight?

163
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,530
You see, eight is still...

164
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,690
Seven, then?

165
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,090
I suppose...

166
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,970
I suppose I might be prepared
to invest... three.

167
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,770
Three.

168
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,450
Perhaps. Perhaps three.

169
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,290
Three's not enough.
I'm sorry?

170
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,930
Three's fine,

171
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,970
and I can do you the same terms
for three, so we're all set.

172
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,130
Right, well...

173
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,930
I'll get my cheque book, then.

174
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,370
It's here somewhere...

175
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,650
Just sign and date it, Mr Salthouse.

176
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,370
I've got a stamp.

177
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,290
So, first up, yes, it's titanium.

178
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,410
So, 60 years old, oldest?

179
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,010
Give or take.
And then, there's this...

180
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,490
which I'm guessing is some sort of
manufacturer's mark?

181
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,690
You ever seen that before?

182
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,330
Nope, and I've seen hundreds
of these.

183
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,410
But plates do usually have
a manufacturer's mark on them?

184
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,730
No, usually,
they have serial numbers indented.

185
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,970
For all of them? Yes.

186
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,130
So...?

187
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,170
So, I'm guessing this is foreign.

188
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,930
So she could've come from anywhere.

189
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,130
Do EU ones have serial numbers?
I think so.

190
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,810
At least from when the country
joined, but you'd have to check.

191
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,490
She could be British, gone abroad
and had the plate fitted there.

192
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,770
That's also a possibility. OK.

193
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,450
Can't you determine...
race or ethnicity from a skull?

194
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,050
To a degree.
It's not an exact science.

195
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,970
I mean, there are certainly
general characteristics

196
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,130
of Asian skulls versus African
versus European, etcetera,

197
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,850
but they suggest a likelihood
of origin, no more than that.

198
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,090
OK, can you do that for us?

199
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,290
Mm. And age-wise,
you said early 20s...

200
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,626
Would you be able to narrow it down
any more than that?

201
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,370
We'll be doing an
ossification test -

202
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,730
cartilage turns to bone
at a very specific age.

203
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,770
That should narrow it down
considerably.

204
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,810
Who might be best-placed to
recognise who the manufacturer is?

205
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,050
I'd start with the orthopaedics
departments of large city hospitals.

206
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,810
Given the amount of foreign-born
NHS employees we have, there's...

207
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,650
got to be a good chance you'll
come across a surgeon who's inserted

208
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,970
a plate with that mark on it.
Mm-hm.

209
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,010
Well, that's it for this week.

210
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,530
Join us same time next week
for the first of the semis.

211
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,010
It's goodbye from our teams...
ALL: Goodbye!

212
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,970
..and it's goodbye from me. Goodbye.

213
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,690
FUNKY THEME MUSIC PLAYS

214
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,970
CHEERING

215
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,290
LAUGHTER

216
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,170
And would you mind signing a copy
of your book, please, Mr Hollis?

217
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,370
No, of course not. So, erm,
is that to "Karen" or "Kaz", or...?

218
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,810
Actually, if you could just put it,
er, "To Nan."

219
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,290
"Nan"?! Oh, dear, oh, dear!

220
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,330
At least it used to be, "To Mum."
Am I that ancient now?

221
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,850
I'm gonna have to steal you away,
I'm afraid, James.

222
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,890
OK, sorry, guys, she's the boss,
but, listen...

223
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,290
erm, I hope you all enjoyed
yourselves today, and seriously,

224
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,650
well done, all of you.

225
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,570
You're a sight smarter than I was
when I was your age.

226
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,330
OK, cheers, guys. Safe journey. Bye!

227
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,570
Ta-ta!

228
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,490
Oh, of course, yeah!
They're so lovely...

229
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,650
So, couple of messages
from the production office.

230
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,650
Your friend Pete rang,
something about a dinner?

231
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,730
OK, thank you.

232
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,186
And then your wife has rung twice,
needs you to call her. Amy?

233
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,570
Yeah. Right, thanks, Kelly.

234
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,730
Recording again in 20 minutes.
All right.

235
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,410
Start with the hospitals...

236
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,130
OK. I might stick a photo
of that mark on Twitter as well.

237
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,370
Yeah, good, cos if we can identify
the origin of the plate,

238
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,650
possibly narrow down a time window,
that's gonna be key.

239
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,530
You want to look at
missing persons yet? Er...

240
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,850
SHE SIGHS

241
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,930
Well, until we know
what country it was made in

242
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,850
and the likely ethnicity of the
victim, no, I can't see the point.

243
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,770
Hiya.

244
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,970
Where've you been?
I've left half a dozen messages.

245
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,490
In recording. What's up?

246
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,410
It's Eliot...

247
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,530
'I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, '

248
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,410
but apparently his flatmate hasn't
seen him for a couple of days.

249
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,130
Who rang you?

250
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,650
Melissa.

251
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,090
Oh, so she rings you before
she rings me now, does she?

252
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,250
Only because you'd end up
screaming at each other.

253
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,890
I'm still his dad, Amy.
She should ring me.

254
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,610
Has she spoken to him, the flatmate?

255
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,010
Ed. Yes, briefly.

256
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,850
She said she's going to finish work
early and get there about four.

257
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,610
What work? She's been writing
the same shit novel for ten years!

258
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,210
Erm... can you call her?
I'm about to start again.

259
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,250
'Tell her I'll meet her there.'
Sure.

260
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,090
And, Jamie, it'll be fine.

261
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,570
'He'll be fine.' Yeah.

262
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,610
'Call me when you've seen Mel,
yeah?'

263
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,850
Sure.

264
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,810
Hey, Chris. Hiya.

265
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,250
Nice to see you. How are you?

266
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,810
Oh, I'm good. I'm good, thanks.

267
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,170
How are you?
Ah, you know, not too shabby.

268
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,890
Glad you dropped in, actually -
sold two more pieces at the weekend.

269
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,570
Oh! Oh, OK!

270
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,010
Got a bit of space for
a couple more, if you have any?

271
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,490
Yeah, I'm working on something...

272
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,170
maybe beginning of next week?

273
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,450
Perfect.

274
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,490
Rob, I-I need some of my money.

275
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,810
Er, yes, not a problem.
Erm, how much?

276
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,370
4,000, please.

277
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,370
OK, fine.

278
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,090
Sorry, you mean now?

279
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,410
Yeah. Right!

280
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,810
Well, I have to go to the bank,
obviously. Can you wait ten minutes?

281
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,610
Uh-huh, yeah.

282
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,850
So...

283
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,610
..that's quite a lot of money,
Chris,

284
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,170
and I'm very happy to get it
for you, of course,

285
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,250
but you're absolutely sure
you need all of this?

286
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,890
I am, yeah.

287
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,810
Have you got somewhere safe
to keep it?

288
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,050
Yeah.

289
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,090
Erm, well...

290
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,650
do you wanna wait outside,
or maybe you could hold the fort...?

291
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,490
No, no, I'll wait out there.

292
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,930
No problem.

293
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,650
You're over-thinking it, love.

294
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,450
So you read it as him hiding,

295
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,930
I read it as he was just busy,
you know,

296
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,570
preparing his dad's lunch,
changing his bed sheets or whatever.

297
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,546
So why didn't he come out
when I said goodbye?

298
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,890
He probably just didn't hear you.

299
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,170
Mm.

300
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,850
Tim, sweetheart...

301
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,450
..I promise you,

302
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,170
no-one in this town believes a word
of these allegations.

303
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,890
They know you,
and they know Alison Pinion.

304
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,810
They certainly know Alison has
a grudge against this practice.

305
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,930
As your rep says, the case won't
even get to the next stage.

306
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,570
So, please,
just try and forget about it, hm?

307
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,210
Let's just have a lovely evening
tonight with your girls.

308
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,370
Come on.

309
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,690
DRAMATIC MUSIC
SWELLS OVER SPEECH

310
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,410
INAUDIBLE

311
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,970
Ah, these are Greek letters...
erm, intertwined.

312
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,170
You see that...

313
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,490
You see there,
that is an A and the X is a C.

314
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,770
Stands for "Angelis and Christos".

315
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,170
They're a Cypriot firm,
based in Nicosia. Right.

316
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,570
They do all sorts of surgical stuff.

317
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,530
Do you know if they're
still in operation?

318
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,970
Er, I think so. I think
they only started in the '80s.

319
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,810
And certainly, they were still
in operation when I worked there...

320
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,730
couple of years ago?

321
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,010
DCI Stuart, it's Leanne Balcombe.

322
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,330
So, I just spoke to Dr Balcombe...

323
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,730
and her tests suggest
that the skull is European,

324
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,210
which narrows things down a bit.

325
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,810
So we now know that the plate
is made by a Greek company,

326
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,690
Angelis and Christos,
based in Cyprus.

327
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,770
Now, they didn't start
operating until 1984,

328
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,250
so that's as old
as the plate can be.

329
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,290
But I've sent them some photos
and the MD's gonna come back to me,

330
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,386
see if he can help us
narrow the dates down a bit.

331
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,210
But, er, in the meantime,

332
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,250
we can now also tell you...

333
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,610
..Dr Balcombe did various tests
on the major bones and teeth.

334
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,690
And she was able to determine,

335
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,650
with, actually,
a pretty good deal of certainty,

336
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,850
that these remains are actually
those of a young female...

337
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,090
..between the ages of 13 and 15.

338
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,290
So, this is not an adult,
it's not even a young adult.

339
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,370
This is the body of a child.

340
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,970
So, as of now,
we have a window of 34 years,

341
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,170
and as soon as we hear back
from A&C,

342
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,490
we start searching for all
missing children of that age.

343
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,530
We're gonna start with the UK,
but if we have to,

344
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,330
we'll liaise with Interpol
and roll this out across Europe,

345
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,570
because not many children
of that age go missing

346
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,530
without leaving people behind.

347
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,690
And...

348
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,410
..somewhere,
there surely must be parents...

349
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,970
who have lived in a world
of almost unimaginable pain...

350
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,450
..for many, many years.

351
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,330
Let's give them their child back.

352
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,040
Don't apologise - your English
is better than my Greek.

353
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,240
'Anyway, what we can tell you
is that in 2004,

354
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,880
'when we joined the EU,
in line with EU regulations,

355
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,000
'we started using serial numbers
on all our plates,

356
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,600
'so it has to predate that.'

357
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,680
Well, that is already
extremely useful.

358
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,320
'And the logo, we didn't start
using that until '95.'

359
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,680
'95?

360
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,080
Right, so... that has to have been
made in this nine-year period?

361
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,800
'Oh, absolutely.'

362
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,320
Right. Thank you.

363
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,240
'So, what time
do you think you'll be back?'

364
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,520
Not late, six-ish.

365
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,120
Thought I might take the boys
to the beach if it stays dry.

366
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,840
Yeah, they'd love that.

367
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,080
'No problem.'

368
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,840
Oh, and by the way, the boiler's
turned itself off again.

369
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,880
Right, remember,
just press the reset button, then...

370
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,120
Yeah, I know.

371
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,960
I did it eight times
before it fired up.

372
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,720
'It's broken, Pete.'

373
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,480
I'll look at it later. Back at six.

374
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,120
Yeah, OK.

375
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
Mum!

376
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Oh, OK!

377
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,160
When a man goes into a shop, Pete,
to ask for a quarter-inch drill bit,

378
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,280
he doesn't really want
a quarter-inch drill bit, does he?

379
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,760
Doesn't he?

380
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,040
What he actually wants...

381
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,720
is a quarter-inch hole.

382
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,360
I'm sorry, Mark, I've got absolutely
no idea what you're talking about.

383
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,200
You've asked me for new leads,
but what you actually want

384
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,320
is to be making more money, right?

385
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,560
Of course.
Which I can't give you.

386
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
I couldn't give you
a quarter-inch hole...

387
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,080
..and I can't make you
a better salesman.

388
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
So she was found in the UK,

389
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,000
and I think it's fair to assume
she's more likely to be British.

390
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah.

391
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
And if she is British...

392
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,040
..why might she have had
an operation in Cyprus?

393
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,200
Cos she was on holiday?
With her family.

394
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,560
And according to the insurance rep
I just spoke to,

395
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,680
most families on holiday in Cyprus,
they go to Paphos.

396
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,280
So we make contact
with this hospital,

397
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,120
see what records
they have from then.

398
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,680
Meanwhile, get the team
to start an outstanding review

399
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,920
of UK miss pers of, say,
12 to 16-year-old girls

400
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,000
between '95 and 2004.

401
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah, I'll get them onto it. Mm.

402
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,760
Hey, Pete, I got your message.

403
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,240
Sorry I'm being rubbish,
but work's mad now.

404
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,240
So, yeah, let's put in a date
for a meet-up.

405
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,640
Why don't I call Tim
and you do Chris?

406
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,000
I miss you, big man.
Lots of love.

407
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,960
How's he been the last few weeks?

408
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,400
How's his... mood been,
would you say?

409
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,160
I dunno, he's just seemed...

410
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,560
really stressed.

411
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,320
Stressed? Yeah.
Stressed by what?

412
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,600
Dunno.

413
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,520
Stressed by watching back-to-back
Family Guy all day long? James...

414
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,600
Stressed by having to choose exactly
how he'll fuck my life up this week?

415
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,520
What d'you think?
I'm just trying to help, mate.

416
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,040
To be honest, it's not my problem.

417
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,280
For what it's worth,

418
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,840
having a father like you...

419
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
would stress the fuck out of anyone.

420
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,360
Does it ever get tiring,
being so angry all the time?

421
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,440
Does it get tiring
being such a smug tit?

422
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,160
Sorry.

423
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,360
HE SIGHS

424
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,520
You'd think 20 years of this,

425
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,560
of wondering every time
he goes off on one

426
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,960
if this is the time
he'll wind up in a canal,

427
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,080
would inure you to the fear,
but it just seems to make it worse.

428
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
For us both.

429
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,840
I'll do the pubs,
you do the dealers.

430
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
SIGHS

431
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,440
OFFICE CHATTER

432
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,800
Hello, um, do you speak English?

433
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,360
Brilliant, brilliant.

434
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,920
Yeah, wonder if you can
help me with something...

435
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,440
MAN: Eight.
GROUP: Eight.

436
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,760

438
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Sunday...

439
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,480
Can I use the phone in the office?
I can never get signal in here.

440
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,120
Yeah, yeah, no problem. Thanks.

441
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,200
But he's, he's OK now?

442
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,800
Yeah. I got him back to sleep
at about five,

443
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,360
and then he slept in till midday.

444
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,800
Oh, and... was it about his dad?

445
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,840
'No, he rarely dreams about
his dad.'

446
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,240
He was too little to remember,
really. No, it's...

447
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,640
pretty much always the gas.

448
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,920
'I'm so sorry.'

449
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,160
Listen, it's much better
than it used to be.

450
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,200
'This was the first time in months.'

451
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,160
Would you like me to come round?
I could do some painting with him?

452
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,000
I think he'd love that.

453
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,360
How about... tomorrow, after school?

454
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,360
Yeah, well, OK. Four-ish?

455
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,840
'Perfect.'

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,800
Oh, OK. Er, well, you...

457
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,640
'..send him my love.'

458
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,680
I will.
'And I'll, I'll see you tomorrow.'

459
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Bye.

460

GULLS CALL

461
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,560
PETE: Come on,
see if you can tackle me!

462
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,520
You're just running away,
miles away...

463
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,160
Here we go!

464
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400
Oh, looking dangerous now.

465
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,760
It's looking dangerous.

466
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,080
Can we save...? Oh!

467
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
Ohh!

468
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,080
Here we go.

469
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,080
Go and get that!

470
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,280
And have you started pronouncing
your words stupidly yet?

471
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
'Only when I eat...
AMERICAN PRONUNCIATION: ...oreg-ano.'

472
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,320
AMERICAN ACCENT: On your ris-o-tto?

473
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,960
'New York's actually pretty like
London. It's just... cooler.'

474
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,760
Yeah, well, don't get too attached,
cos you're not moving there.

475
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,360
'Oh, am I not?'

476
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,680
Sorry, needed here, I'm afraid.

477
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,240
'Right, you see, I didn't realise
I had no say in this decision.'

478
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,600
THEY LAUGH

479
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
'How's Grandad?'

480
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,320
Yeah, all good.

481
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,520
'He there?'

482
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,960
Er... no, no,

483
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,120
because he's out with Jenny tonight.

484
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,280
'Wo-o-ow! Wow!
That's quite a thing, isn't it?

485
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,640
'How long have they been goin' out?'

486
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,120
Er, well, dunno. A while.

487

FEMALE VOICE: 'Adam! Adam!'

488
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,520

489
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,240
'Just gimme a sec.

490
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,520
'Mum, look, I gotta go.'

491
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you go.

492
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,120
'I'll call you next week, yeah?
I love you.'

493
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,240
And do some bloody work, cos
that is why you're there, remem...?

PHONE RINGS

495
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,800
Hiya. 'Er, boss...'

496
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,240
Yeah, yeah, sorry to disturb you.
LAUGHTER IN BACKGROUND

497
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,680
'No, no problem.'

498
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,720
The Paphos hospital just emailed me.

499
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,080
'They lost all of their
pre-2008 records in a fire

500
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,240
'a couple of years ago.'

501
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,520
Shit.

502
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,440
'Yeah, irritating.'

503
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,200
Obviously, I'll try the other
hospitals in the morning, but...

504
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,160
'for now,
we're back to a nine-year window.'

505
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,040
OK, well,
thanks for letting me know.

'Sounds like it's going well...'

508
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,440
You're doing great.

509
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,760
'Sunny?'

510
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,200
Yes, boss - sorry.

511
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,240
Er, it is, very. I'll let you go.

512
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,920
'Have a great evening.'
And you. Night.

513
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,440

MICROWAVE DINGS

515
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,400
I know you feel she can be tricky,
but... can't you just reach out?

516
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,720
She's your mum.

517
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,120
And there were very good reasons
you got divorced, Dad.

518
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,496
Can we not turn this into another
Mum slag fest, please?

519
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,880
I completely agree.

520
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,840
She's a lovely lady who did
extremely well to put up with me

521
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,200
for as long as she did.

522
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,640
Maybe we can do a trip up there
for her birthday?

523
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,480
Not a chance. I'm driving 300 miles
to the middle of nowhere to...

524
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,040
OK, fine, forget about it.
Let's talk about something else.

525
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,440
Let's talk about why we're here...
Here's to you both.

526
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,080
Happy anniversary!

527
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,616
And a huge well done to you, Carol,

528
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,720
for tolerating the old bastard
for ten years. To Dad and Carol.

529
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,600
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.

530
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,200
Excuse me...

531
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,600
Just wanted to say, Dr Finch,
for what it's worth,

532
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,880
nobody I know believes a word of it.

533
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,160
This is corked.
Is it?

534
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Right, sorry about that,
let me just...

535
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,120
No, no. You don't need to smell it.

536
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,120
I smelt it. It's corked.

537
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,360
I'll bring you another bottle.

538
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,480
Anything?

539
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,120
No.

540
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,200
Looked everywhere, no sign.

541
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,640
HE SIGHS

542
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,280
So, we very much hoped the Cyprus
hospitals could've given us a name

543
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,000
that we would find here,
but they haven't.

544
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,600
Which means now
we have two options -

545
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,720
checking each file
against dental records,

546
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,760
which will be very, very slow...

547
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,080
or we make contact with each of
the families of these missing girls

548
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,960
and ask them if their daughter
ever broke her arm on holiday.

549
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,680
Now, if we find one who did,
and it was in Cyprus,

550
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,520
chances are we've found her.

551
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,200
In the end, I think this is
the least worst option.

552
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,680
But it's gonna be hard.

553
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,520
The best most of these families
will have hoped for, for many years,

554
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,880
will simply have been
finding a body to bury.

555
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,320
And for all but one of them -
that's if we're lucky -

556
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,800
we're gonna offer them
that little glimmer of hope,

557
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
only to snatch it away
seconds later.

558
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,600
So we tread gently, please.

559
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,680
We tread very gently.

560
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:23,357
I'm so sorry to trouble you -
my name is DC Fran Lingley,

561
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:26,275
I'm calling from Bishop Street
Police Station in London.

562
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,580
...And I'm part of a team
investigating the discovery

563
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,420
of human remains in Hendon,
North London.

564
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,540
And I wanted, if I may, to ask you
a question in connection with the

565
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,340
disappearance of your daughter,
Annabelle.

566
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,420
Yeah, I'm very sorry to hear that,
Mr Mason.

567
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,580
So, who might still be alive
that I could talk to,

568
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,780
who would know if your sister
ever broke her wrist?

569
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,500
I completely understand,

570
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,580
and I really wish I could've
given you some answers.

571
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,340
Is there someone who can be there
with you, Jackie?

572
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,180
And I can tell you we can eliminate
Michaela from our list.

573
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,100
OK, thank you. Take care. Goodbye.

574
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,340
They're my oldest friends, Maria.

575
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,620
It's one night.

576
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,740
We stay in a Travelodge,
we eat in a pub!

577
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,860
And I can't afford to buy the kids
new shoes.

578
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,100
Josh, Will, downstairs now, please!

579
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,100
CHILDREN GIGGLE UPSTAIRS

580
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,540
But, fine.
Things will get easier, I promise.

581
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,020
I've got some really good business
coming in in the next few weeks.

582
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,276
What? When have you not had
some really good business

583
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,020
about to come through, Pete?

584
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,300
I think the day I met you,

585
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
you were about to buy the club
we were drinking in.

586
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,420
Yeah, then the world
went to hell in a handcart.

587
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,420
I mean, I'll take the
blame for a lot of things,

588
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,900
but not the global financial crash!

589
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,860
We're gonna be late.

590
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,660
Look...

591
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,660
buy the kids whatever shoes
they need.

592
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,060
There'll be money in the
joint account tomorrow.

593
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,620
At the end of the day, Tim,
it's your word against hers.

594
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,660
And given what we know about her...

595
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,940
He saying he's at Smudge's,
apparently.

596
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,580
Right, so...

597
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,420
I don't know Smudge.
Where does he live?

598
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,580
Panford House, number 22.

599
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,660
I hope he's OK, Mr Hollis.

600
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,380
Thank you.

601
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,140
You look after yourself, Steven.

602
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,060
No, I'm sorry, if Jasmine never
sustained an injury like that,

603
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,860
then it really can't be her,
I'm afraid.

604
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,420
No, you cry away, Robin,
and I'm so sorry

605
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,140
we can't give you any more
positive news.

606
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
And you're her sister, did you say?
'Yeah.'

607
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,180
And how sure are you, Jessica,
that she broke her wrist?

608
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,500
'100%. I remember the cast,
what I wrote on it.'

609
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,380
OK, do you remember how she did it?

610
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,460
She slipped by the swimming pool.

611
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,860
By the swimming pool? So this was
a swimming pool at home, or...?

612
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,860
We were on holiday.

613
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,580
What year would this have been?

614
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,500
Erm... mid-'90s, maybe?

615
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,420
Do you remember where
you were on holiday?

616
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,140
'We were only little, so I'd have to
check with my mum, but, erm...'

617
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,740
I think it was Cyprus?

618
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,661
OK, Jessica, I think we're gonna
have to come and see you,

619
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,300
but in the meantime,
is your mother...?

620
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,940
She lives five minutes away.

621
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,540
Could you ask her about Cyprus for
me, and also ask if she remembers

622
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,700
if Hayley had a surgical plate
fitted following a fracture?

623
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,180
'No problem.' Can you do that now
and get back to us?

624
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,060
Yeah, sure.

625
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,820
'Do you really think it's her?'

626
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,580
Jessica, I...

627
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,980
Obviously, I can't say for sure,
but...

628
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,740
..I think it's certainly
very possible, yes.

629
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,900
I'll call you straight back.

630
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,020
Anyone remember
the Hayley Reid case?

631
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,540
She was on her way to a party,
wasn't she?

632
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,380
Mm. From a shift at a pub.

633
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,980
New Year's Eve.

634
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,620
Millennium, 1999.

635
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,980
Awful. She just... disappeared.

636
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,500
What was the name of the guy
they thought did it?

637
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,060
Mullins, was it? Mullery.

638
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,580
Adrian Mullery was the boyfriend.

639
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,020
We were exactly the same age.

640
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,220
Yeah, I remember my mum
wouldn't let me get a Saturday job

641
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,860
when that happened.

642
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,900
Yeah, I remember her.

643
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,340
Brown stripes,

644
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,260
and there are the trees.

645
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,780
I think you have a gifted child.

646
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,700
He has a real talent.

647
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,260
Well, you bring it out in him,
so thank you.

648
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,340
It gives him such pleasure.

649
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,420
Jamila, I wan...
I wanted to ask you something.

650
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,660
I wanted to ask you...

651
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,100
do you think that
you would ever consider...

652
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,100
..marrying me?

653
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,100
I'm sorry?

654
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,980
I know, yeah, this has probably
come as a bit of a shock...

655
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,100
And I know I'm not what people
would consider "a catch",

656
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,820
but I'm earning good money now
with my paintings,

657
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,140
and I've saved up enough

658
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,700
to put down a deposit on a flat
to rent for us all.

659
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
I just...
In the last couple of years,

660
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:21,580
we've got to know each other
really well, and, erm, months ago...

661
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,660
..I realised that
I was in love with you.

662
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,940
Just... watching you do
ordinary things.

663
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,900
And, yes,
I should've said something sooner,

664
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,260
I should've mentioned it,
but I was so scared.

665
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,580
I was so scared that you wouldn't...

666
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,020
you know.

667
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,300
And I just wanna make things better
for you, Jamila.

668
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,100
For you and for Asif.

669
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,220
And for me, for me, obviously,
for me, because the idea of me

670
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,580
being with you both
and us being a family...

671
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,660
..that'd make me happy.

672
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,380
Wow!

673
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,740
I'm a bit... shocked.

674
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,500
I mean in a good way, but...

675
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,220
You don't have to say anything.

676
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,220
You know, h-have a think about it
and then we can talk soon.

677
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,820
Maybe tomorrow, at the centre...?

678
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Yes, right. And, erm...

679
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,660
..thank you.

680
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,180
I nearly forgot...

681
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,940
I bought you this.

682
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,380
See you tomorrow.

683
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,780
So the complaint against you,
Dr Finch,

684
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,780
is that on the 27th of April 2017,

685
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,180
while on a house call to
Maureen Anne Avery, since deceased,

686
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,740
and seemingly unaware that
her daughter, the complainant,

687
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,540
Alison Pinion, was in the house,

688
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,340
you verbally abused
and threatened Mrs Avery.

689
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,180
Specifically, that you called her
a "tiresome old bitch",

690
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,980
and that you then told her you'd

691
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,340
"half a mind to stick her
full of morphine,

692
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,660
"and give us all a fucking break".

693
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:39,260
DOORBELL RINGS

694
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,020
CHATTER FROM RADIO
IN BACKGROUND

695
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,220
Mum?!

696
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,780
Mum?

697
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,460
FOOTSTEPS THUD ON STAIRS

698
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,180
Mum?

699
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,740
Wake up, Mum.

700
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,380
Jess...

701
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,940
Jessie, what is it?

702
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,540
When Hayley broke her arm that time
when we were on holiday,

703
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,060
did she have a plate fitted?

704
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,380
What?

705
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,780
I think we were in Cyprus.
Did she have a plate fitted?

706
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,380
Why?

707
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,700
Did she?

708
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,500
Yes.

709
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,020
It was a compound fracture.

710
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,700
She had it done
at the local hospital.

711
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,940
Why?

712
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,780
You're gonna have to get up, Mum.

713
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,620
The police are gonna be
coming down from London.

714
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,420
They think they've found her.

715
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,020
They think they've found Hayley.

716
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,900
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

717
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,420
Eliot?

718
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,900
Hey, Els, how you doing?

719
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,220
Hi, Dad.

720
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,420
GULLS CALL

721
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:06,420
Eliot!

722
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,540
My client's mother, Mrs Avery,

723
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,420
was diagnosed with dementia
over seven years ago.

724
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,300
As you can imagine...

725
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,740
Oh, shit!

726
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,140
BREATHES HEAVILY

727
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,140
JESSICA:
Yes, she had a plate fitted,

728
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,660
and it was in Cyprus.

729
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,780
It's her.

730
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,340
SHE SOBS

731
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,500
WAILS

732
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,820
