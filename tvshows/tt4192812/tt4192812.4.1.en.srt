Yeah, all good.

What time you in?
One.

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,329
You want me to drive you?
Hm, no, thanks.

33
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,528
I need to be on my own
for half an hour.

34
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:03,689
Prepare myself. Calm myself.

35
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:10,890
Adam! The estate agent's
coming at ten. I want you up!

36
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:14,969
21 years old...

37
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:20,729
OK, well, I might as well
head back down now,

38

beat the afternoon traffic.

39
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,648
You're going back down? Yeah.
I've got the interview tomorrow.

40
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:28,170
Oh, yeah, of course. Sorry, sorry.

41
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:30,928
I mean, I could try to reschedule...

42
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:33,249
No, no, no, it's not a problem,
I was just...

43
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,570
Right, I'm coming up
with a bucket of water!

44
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:59,368
So I asked her to clean one little
chimney, one tiny little chimney,

45
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,569
suddenly, social services are involved.

46
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,768
I mean, it's not like
she was a little kid or anything,

47
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,569
this was when she was 12,
for crying out loud.

48
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,528
This is a joke, isn't it?
I get it. Very funny.

49
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,890
Hello, boss.
Hey, Murray, tell me.

50
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:13,609
The owner found the body first thing,

51
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,208
round the side of that heap there.

52
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,688
We've marked and filmed the spot
where it was found.

53
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,089
Now, security is very good.

54
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,969
Lot of valuable metal on site,
so the owner doesn't think

55
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,568
it could've been dumped illicitly.

56
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:24,729
Out of hours, I mean.

57
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,808
So...?

58
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:28,688
Best guess is, part of a regular drop,

59
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,289
maybe inside something?

60
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,769
And what are their records like?

61
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,289
Fully compliant.

62
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,928
I've asked for the last 48 hours
to get started.

63
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:37,328
Good.

64
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,730
Let's have a look.

65
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,849
Morning.

66
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,610
Oh, hey, Sunny, how you doing?

67
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,170
Yeah, fine, thanks, Leanne.

68
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,409
So what do we think, age-wise, 20, 30?

69
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,089
It's hard to tell for sure
without teeth,

70
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,128
but, from the general condition
of the body, yeah,

71
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,128
a relatively young adult male.

72
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,489
Can you tell if the wounds
were pre or post-mortem?

73
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,448
I think post, no obvious
vital reaction around the wounds

74
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,849
to the naked eye, but I need
to take a closer look in the lab.

75
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,248
Also, this sort of mutilation
is usually done post-mortem,

76
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,008
to facilitate disposal and obscure ID.

77
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,568
Exactly.
Any obvious cause of death?

78
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:39,688
No, not that I can see.

79
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:42,049
I need to get him back to the lab
and open him up.

80
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,409
All I can see externally that's odd
is this.

81
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,089
Looks kind of wrinkled.
Yeah.

82
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,409
And when I first saw it,
I wasn't sure what it was,

83
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,248
but it sort of looked familiar.

84
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:55,730
And after I took a temperature,
I realised exactly what it was.

85
00:05:56,809 --> 00:06:00,808
This was my thermometer. It snapped
in two after I tried to insert it.

86
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:03,769
I was more careful with my spare
and got a reading.

87
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,289
The inside of the body is minus 15.

88
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,209
Frozen?
Solid.

89
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,650
And those marks...

90
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,888
You know when you put
a piece of meat in the freezer

91
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,128
without wrapping it properly

92
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:17,530
and it develops
a kind of weird wrinkle pattern?

93
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,730
I think that's what we have here.

94
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,289
What a day, what a day.

95
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,809
Oh, that is definitely your colour.

96
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:01,488
Hey... that's for you.

97
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,369
Thank you, Chacha Ram.

98
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:22,489
Oh.

99
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:25,409
You're late.

100
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,969
Oh, don't give me grief, mate,
I've got a monster hangover.

101
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,329
Hm.

102
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,569
Ah, Ramjeet, my gorgeous boy.
How are you?

103
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,368
Very well, Mama, happy birthday.
How are you today?

104
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:48,969
Oh, not so bad. Yesterday,
not so good, but today, so-so...

105
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,409
Well, if I'd had as many 70ths as
you, I'd be pretty happy, you know.

106
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,568
All right, chuckles?

107
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,248
So, who thinks they deserve a present?

108
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,290
Oh, you shouldn't have...
Aw.

109
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,530
1.8.

110
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:27,169
And are we sure about carpet?

111
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,568
It's warmer.

112
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,328
Makes it feel more welcoming.
More like you're at home.

113
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:34,808
Although maybe people don't wanna
feel like they're at home?

114
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,169
Maybe they wanna feel like
they're in a medical setting.

115
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,889
Well, we can't afford real wood.
And veneer looks pony, so...

116
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,249
Well, I'm just saying,
for the consulting rooms.

117
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,088
Give it a bloody rest, Geoff,
please... It's just a suggestion.

118
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,608
I mean, I don't even wanna be here.

119
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,808
This is not even my idea, so...

120
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:50,369
It's hard enough as it is

121
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,568
without you spending money
we do not have.

122
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,410
Carpet it is.

123
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,170
Amy?

124
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,968
Yeah. Yeah. Hang on.

125
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:08,529
Can you zip over to my brother's
office tomorrow after work? Why?

126
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,448
Just mortgage stuff.
Last few forms. Is there a problem?

127
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,729
Well, apparently, you've been
laundering money for the Ruskies...

128
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,009
Six OK?
Fine.

129
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,890
Yep, that's cool.
We'll be there at six.

130
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:23,729
Yeah, and can you bring
that statement of earnings...

131
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:42,370
So, why the hell
would you screw a freezer door shut?

132
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,968
Right. Well, that looks very much
like blood to me.

133
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:08,088
And if it's his,
we might just have a shout

134
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,650
in finding out who he is
and maybe where he comes from.

135
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,704
They just won't budge, I'm so sorry.

136
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:22,904
As I say, they're very happy with
the first six months as sick leave,

137
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,904
and they're happy to go
half pay for another six,

138
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:28,864
but, er... they just won't allow
a medical retirement.

139
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:35,144
Which obviously still leaves you
three months shy

140
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:37,544
of your full 30 years.

141
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,825
And I'm as angry as you are.

142
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,144
Because I know five years ago,

143
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,945
they just would have waved this
through without a second thought.

144
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,304
Maybe, in five years, they will.

145
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:51,305
But... now?

146
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:54,545
You know what it's like, Cass.

147
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,785
They're still counting
every single penny.

148
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,623
And what was that figure again?
What does it equate to, exactly?

149
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:06,623
Erm... It's, er...

150
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,904
£124,467.

151
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:14,104
That I'd lose. Despite me not being
able to come back three months ago.

152
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:19,304
Which they say - they, not me -

153
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,505
is not the case.

154
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:23,145
And what the fuck do they know?

155
00:11:24,624 --> 00:11:26,185
Sir.

156
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,304
They're bean counters.

157
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:34,024
Never done a single day on the job
in their lives.

158
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,343
Meaning they have not one
single scintilla of an idea

159
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:39,664
what 30 years of -
sorry, 29 years and nine months -

160
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,064
of doing this job does to a person.

161
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:45,224
29 years and nine months
of having to mop up the...

162
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,144
..blood and the tears and the...

163
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,704
rage and the despair, on a daily basis.

164
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,784
This judgement
does not recognise that, Sir.

165
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:03,825
This judgment does not
cut me any slack.

166
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:07,825
And, again, I'm, er...
I'm so sorry, Cass.

167
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,785
Yeah, well. Me too.

168
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:18,103
We'll need to go back to them.

169
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,305
What do you want me to say?
I dunno, I need to think.

170
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:22,103
Hey, Eugenia.
Hello, Elizabeth.

171
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,265
I'm going to head straight up.
Yeah.

172
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,425
Hello, Mum.

173
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:40,584
Don't!

174
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:52,904
Sorry.

175
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,944
Mahler's fifth, fourth movement.

176
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:58,305
You can't really cut that short.
Right.

177
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:05,383
You never really
caught that particular bug, did you?

178
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:07,583
What bug's that?
Music.

179
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:10,383
I love music.
Proper music, I mean.

180
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,545
Nothing but classical is proper, is it?

181
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:16,583
I know your father always
found that rather disappointing.

182
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:20,785
He would've loved
to have shared his passion with you.

183
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:25,905
Oh, well, we found lots else to share.

184
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:29,024
Not really.

185
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,904
So, what have you planned today, then?

186
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,784
Oh, today, I'm going roller skating,

187
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:40,184
and tonight I thought I might
head into town and try a club

188
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,825
Oh, we're in that sort of mood, are we?

189
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:48,824
Today, I will be mainly lying in
bed, Elizabeth, wishing I was dead,

190
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:51,264
because everyone I ever loved,

191
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,144
liked, or enjoyed spending time
with, already is.

192
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,545
Right.

193
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,424
Well, thanks for that.

194
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:03,905
Well, if you will ask
such asinine questions.

195
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:09,265
OK. Er, enjoy your lunch,
I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:15,984
Elizabeth...

197
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,305
This soup is cold.

198
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,984
I'll ask Eugenia to heat it up.

199
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,424
OK, I'm gonna get straight onto that
now, boss.

200
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,824
OK, no worries,
I'll head back with Murray.

201
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:44,544
So, this model was only
manufactured between 1998 and 2008,

202
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:46,065
discontinued 12 years ago.

203
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:48,584
Is that useful?

204
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,424
What, in terms of working out
how long he's been dead, you mean?

205
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:55,024
Well, coulda just stuck it
in this one last week.

206
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,383
Just pulled this out of
the back pocket of his tracksuit.

207
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,583
Oh, man, a Marathon!
What's a Marathon?

208
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,784
Snickers,
that's what they used to call them.

209
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,424
They used to call Snickers "Marathon"?

210
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,743
Didn't they do a reboot of Marathon
last year, or...?

211
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:08,144
Did they?
This looks like paper, though,

212
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:10,623
wouldn't the reboot
have been plastic? Yeah, maybe.

213
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:13,904
When did they change it, originally,
I mean? God knows, ten years ago?

214
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:14,983
20?

215
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,905
What did we do before Google,
how was life even worth living?

216
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,983
Yeah, there are three ways you make
money from a charity event, Jill.

217
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,503
There's before, on,
and after the night.

218
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:29,264
By far the most important of those
is after,

219
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,024
that's where the real money's made.

220
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:35,264
So, it would be great to get
some more lots for the auction,

221
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:37,863
but we've got less than a week to go
and I think our priority now

222
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,825
has to be
to get those last two tables sold.

223
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:43,264
And the richer the better, please.

224
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,424
Yeah.

225
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:48,103
OK, well, look...
Yeah, lovely to talk to you, too,

226
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:50,304
and thank you so much
for all your hard work so far.

227
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:53,944
Yeah, and I will see you Wednesday.

228
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:55,545
Yeah. OK. Bye-bye.

229
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:28,583
Dean!

230
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,265
You've got to see this.

231
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:41,143

00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:49,024
I thought we were
practising spelling our names today.

235
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,143
Oh, my gosh!

236
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:53,183
♪ Heads, shoulders
Knees and toes... ♪

237
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,985
Go on.
You sing, Dad!

238
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,024
I can't stand here and sing, Jack,

239
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:01,224
I've got very important meetings
to go to,

240
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,784
I am a very important man.

241
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:05,224
Mum?
I don't know. Erm...

242
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,745
I think we'd all like
to hear you sing and dance.

243
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:13,264
If this ends up on Facebook,
you're dead to me.

244
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:15,025
Come on.

245
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:18,943
Ready?

246
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:22,183

247
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,824

251
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,384
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.

252
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,943
What are you gonna do?
What can I do?

253
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:41,663
There's always projects, Cass,
jump on one of those.

254
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,423
Or take a job in admin or... I'm not
taking a job in fucking admin.

255
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:49,024
OK. Well, come back in with us,
then.

256
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,943
And lose it again?

257
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,863
It was one man.

258
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:54,864
You think?

259
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:58,264
It was everything, Sunny.

260
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:00,704
It was Finch,
it was 30 years of doing this shit,

261
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:04,103
it was the Walker case, what I did...

262
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,103
What we did.
Everything.

263
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,384
And being away from it,
the questions fade.

264
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,184
Well, they don't go away,
but they fade.

265
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:19,383
I... I don't know what to say,
Cass.

266
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:21,664
Nope. Me neither.

267
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,024
How's John?
Yeah, good, thanks.

268
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:32,704
And the boys? Er, Adie's
driving me nuts but, yeah,

269
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,903
all good in the broad scheme of things.

270
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:37,824
How's your dad?

271
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,304
I told you it was rapid onset?

272
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,824
Mm.

273
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,264
Um, so, lots of memory issues,
obviously,

274
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,864
but lots of anger, too, and depression.

275
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:50,264
How aware do you think he is of it all?

276
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:51,704
Oh, often very.

277
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:54,663
Which is where
the mood swings come from.

278
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,505
It's completely terrifying for him.

279
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:59,344
Oh, shit.

280
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:02,705
Cass, I'm really sorry.

281
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:06,505
I'd better head.

282
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:10,944
Ran into Jake earlier,
he told me about the case.

283
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:15,384
Fiver if you know
when Marathons changed to Snickers.

284
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:18,024
2000.

285
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:21,224
Way out, 1990.
Oh, wow. Where did my life go?

286
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:25,464
Yeah, the victim, erm, had
a Marathon wrapper in his pocket

287
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,024
we're checking it for DNA.

288
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,464
And Jake said you think
he'd been kept in a freezer?

289
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,143
Pretty sure now.

290
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:35,304
The lab's confirmed traces of blood
in a freezer found near the body.

291
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:38,024
What, and you're thinking
he'd been in there since the '90s?

292
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,504
Dunno.

293
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,623
Weird. Why would someone
keep a body for 30 years?

294
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:46,704
Do you know yet how it got to the dump?

295
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,464
Murray's going through their records

296
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:51,264
and we're checking mispers
two years either side of 1990.

297
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:55,465
The victim had a Millwall tat
on his arm, which will help. Hm.

298
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:58,104
I gotta go.

299
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,265
It was lovely to see you.

300
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:05,663
Sorry I'm grumpy.

301
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,184
Well, luckily, I'm very nice,
so I forgive you.

302
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:14,304
When you find the right vehicle,
check to see what else they dumped.

303
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:17,784
Cos there might be a second freezer,
that has the rest of him in it.

304
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,785
Still got it.

305
00:21:29,944 --> 00:21:32,304
Ah, of course.

306
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:34,583
The windowsill.

307
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,944
What is it with you and the windowsill?

308
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:41,184
Reminds me where I came from, innit,
bruv.

309
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:46,623
Reminds me of a day,
40 years ago, sitting here,

310
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,343
looking down, feeling half petrified
and half "fuck, yeah."

311
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:53,704
First time ever we showed 'em
we weren't the smiley, waggly-headed

312
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:56,943
It Ain't Half Hot, Mum twats
they wanted us to be.

313
00:21:56,944 --> 00:22:00,344
Hm, it's good to be reminded of that
every once in a while...

314
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,265
..cos we both know it ain't over.

315
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:13,544
Nowhere near.

316
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,904
No, no, that's really helpful,
thanks. Thank you.

317
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,943
So, the serial number on the freezer?

318
00:22:18,944 --> 00:22:21,903
It links
to a purchase made in August 2001,

319
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:23,705
from a branch of Curry's in Croydon.

320
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:26,583
Please tell me you have a name?

321
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:29,383
I have a name. Mr Robert Fogerty.

322
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,183
Brilliant. Address?

323
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,103
Address no longer existing,

324
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,825
it was a block of flats
demolished seven years ago.

325
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:38,623
Sorry, did you just say Fogerty?

326
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,824
Yeah.

327
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,064
I was on the phone to the firm
that dumped the freezer.

328
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:44,064
They're a household clearance firm,

329
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:46,304
and they're actually
contracted by Haringey Council,

330
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:49,423
but the house they cleared,
the house the freezer came from,

331
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,744
was owned by a Mr Robert Fogerty.

332
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,304
Get in.
"Was"?

333
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,305
He died two months ago.

334
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:22,088
Hi, Claire.
Oh, hi, Dean.

335
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:24,288
Er, these need signing,
it's the Morrison contracts.

336
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,048
OK. And then these are the VAT
exemptions for the Belgian deal.

337
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,049
And then a man called Felix called?

338
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,249
Felix?
Yeah.

339
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,449
No message, just asked
if you could call him asap.

340
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,528
He said you'd know what it
was about. Right, OK.

341
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,489
Erm, can you take that to the post
for me?

342
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,289
Sure.
Thanks.

343
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,890
Hey.
Hello.

344
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,328
You're not meant to be here.

345
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,490
Yeah, I changed the interview
to next week.

346
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,808
Oh, my love.

347
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,529
That is very sweet of you, thank you.

348
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,529
I'm so pleased to see you.

349
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,009
What a great day I've had.

350
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,089
They didn't...
Yeah, they did.

351
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:44,170
Cos of three lousy months?

352
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,088
Listen, I need to be at my dad's
in half an hour

353
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,449
so I'm gonna have a quick shower,

354
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,609
and then I'll tell you about it
on the way.

355
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:04,608
So, he lived here alone?
Yeah.

356
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:07,689
He'd been dead about six weeks,
so you can imagine the state of him.

357
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,889
House was disgusting, as well,
rubbish everywhere.

358
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,608
And do you know what he died of?
Heart attack, they think.

359
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,209
He weren't old.
Late 40s, apparently,

360
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,808
but the neighbours said
he drank from morning to night.

361
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,130
So, this is where it was.

362
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:23,768
It was still plugged in,
electricity still on,

363
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,568
it had this odd bracket on it,
so you couldn't open it.

364
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:29,489
OK. You didn't think it was...
unusually heavy?

365
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,129
I didn't really give it any thought,
to be honest.

366
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,608
The money was rubbish,
it always is for the Council.

367
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,048
It was a get in and get out job.

368
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:38,249
Plus, we knew it
was going to the dump anyway, so...

369
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,689
And there was definitely
no other freezer in the house? No.

370
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,848
Hm.

371
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,608
And what about everything else, his...

372
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,409
the furniture, personal possessions?

373
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,729
That's at our warehouse,
waiting to get sorted. OK.

374
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,929
And no relatives took anything
before you came in?

375
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,048
There were no relatives.
No will, apparently, no nothing.

376
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,129
OK.

377
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,449
So, DC Collier here
will need to go through

378
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,808
everything that you removed
from the house.

379
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,969
Why?

380
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,409
Because the body that we found
in this freezer, sir, was not whole

381
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,689
and you might be storing
the rest of him.

382
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,890
Eh?

383
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,250
Bottom line, I know, unequivocally,
I don't wanna go back.

384
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,008
I've already given the job
everything I have.

385
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,209
So, the only other option
is giving up the money.

386
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,489
And for what it's worth, I think we
could absolutely manage without it.

387
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,649
And if it was just you and me,
yeah, I think we could.

388
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,368
But I've no idea what my dad
might need in the next year or two.

389
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:33,609
So I think...

390
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,970
I actually have no choice.

391
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,529
It's...

392
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,048
DI Sunny Khan.

393
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,088
Oh, hi, Leanne.

394
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,250
How are you doing?
Yeah, all good. Good.

395
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,250
I've got 31 blokes here
who chose to get a Millwall tattoo.

396
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:06,450
31.

397
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,169
I will never cease to be amazed
by the vagaries of human nature.

398
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,689
So, no obvious cause of death.
'Not with what I have.'

399
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,729
Nothing from toxicology either,

400
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,808
which would suggest
if there is anything to find,

401
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,608
it's gonna be with the head.

402
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,329
So, we need the rest of him.
'Please.'

403
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:28,130
I'll call you.
'OK. Bye.'

404
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:45,489
Well, I think they're perfectly
within their rights. Really?

405
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,088
Listen, they want and need
people to stay for 30 years,

406
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:51,288
so if they start making exceptions
for someone

407
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:53,489
who's just had enough...
"Just had enough"?

408
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,689
..tomorrow, some bloke comes along
and says,

409
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,449
"Oh, well, in that case,
can I finish six months earlier?"

410
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,088
I haven't "just had enough,"
I've been off sick.

411
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:04,528
Yeah, well, that's another bloody con.

412
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,568
Another what?
Cass...

413
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:10,129
I mean, you lot, you take a day off
if you break a... a thing...

414
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,608
What's that at the end of my...
A fingernail...

415
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:15,729
A fucking fingernail!
And who pays for it, eh? Us.

416
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,848
Bloody muggins taxpayers.

417
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:22,088
Your sick pay, your pensions.

418
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:26,328
Jesus Christ, I'd have died
to have had a pension like you get.

419
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,729
Which I have been paying into
for 30 years.

420
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,690
29 years and nine months,
I think you'll find.

421
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:43,730
We should be heading,
early start tomorrow.

422
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,848
Cassie.

423
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,768
Sorry about that, it's not him, it's...

424
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:16,169
I know, it's fine, and I'm sure
you have it much worse than me.

425
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,008
No, he seems OK with me.

426
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:21,169
And, listen, obviously,
tonight wasn't the right time,

427
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,328
but when you get a moment,

428
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,288
I know he wants to talk to you
about his will.

429
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:29,368
His will? He keeps mentioning it,
it's making him stressed,

430
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:32,210
so how about I call you
and we get a date in the diary?

431
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:34,929
Sure, whatever.

432
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,769
Night, Jenny.
Bye.

433
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:51,608
And then each month is basically
a montage of the photos

434
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:54,729
taken of us that month
in the last 11 years.

435
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,969
Molls, that is so lovely, thank you.
She's gonna love that.

436
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,249
Did you hear that, matey?
What?

437
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,489
Have you sorted something out
for Mother's Day? Mother's Day?

438
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,568
Oh, my God, Sam, I have reminded
you a thousand times.

439
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:10,130
OK, come on, guys, we're late.

440
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:23,489
Well, if you're sure?
Cos there are any number of projects

441
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,328
I could assign you to. Your skills
would be invaluable and...

442
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,489
No, if I have to be here,
I might as well do what I do.

443
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,368
And I'm up to speed on the Fogerty case

444
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,608
so I'll start straight away on that
if that's OK.

445
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,649
Sure. And I'll get occ health

446
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,489
to devise a structured return
timetable, ease you in. Whatever.

447
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,730
It's only three months, Cass.

448
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,169
It's a good thing to remind them of,
even if it does feel forced. Sorry?

449
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,608
Sunday. Mother's Day.

450
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:58,609
Oh. Yeah.

451
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,808
The messed up families
I see on a daily basis...

452
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,450
And not having known my own parents.

453
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,450
It's good to remind them
just how lucky they are.

454
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:36,369
Have a good day.

455
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:51,809
Morning, Pearl.
Morning, Fiona.

456
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:02,449
Elizabeth? Do you have five minutes?

457
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,689
I'm actually in a bit of a rush,
Eugenia, but...

458
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,890
Yeah, sure, what's up?

459
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,250
I'm thinking of leaving.

460
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,690
Gosh.

461
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,288
Right, er...

462
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:20,690
I'm sorry to hear that.
Do you mind if I ask why?

463
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,369
The work is... hard.

464
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:30,649
Your mother can be difficult,
I am sure you know this. Yes.

465
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,889
But it's a good job.

466
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,368
It's satisfying and worthwhile, I hope,

467
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:37,690
and I'm lucky, I know this.

468
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,689
But I'm struggling with the money.

469
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,368
I've been working here for three years,

470
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:47,808
and my pay has only gone up
by £1 an hour in that time.

471
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:50,368
Which is actually more than inflation

472
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,568
and more than the going rate
for the job.

473
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:54,848
I'm sure.

474
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:58,130
All I can say is...
I struggle.

475
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:03,889
I'm not greedy, but...
rent goes up, heating bills go up,

476
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,569
and I am working as many hours
as I can possibly work, but...

477
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,608
..life is very hard for me
and my daughter,

478
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:14,329
very hard.

479
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:19,970
And I don't want to lose you.

480
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,649
Maybe we can speak
at the end of the week?

481
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,929
Please, I would appreciate that
very much.

482
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,489
OK, no problem.

483
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,890
And thank you for listening.

484
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:49,048
The problem is, Kai...
the repeated lying.

485
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,649
It benefits no-one.

486
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,850
And certainly not you.

487
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,209
Because if we lie
to the people closest to us,

488
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,210
it destroys trust, of course.

489
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:04,849
But, also, it stops people knowing us.

490
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:07,849
Or being able to understand us.

491
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,449
And if you can't understand someone...

492
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,570
..how can we ever begin to help them
when they're struggling?

493
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,968
Morning.
Morning.

494
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,969
Hi, boss.
Morning.

495
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,089
Hiya.

496
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,250
Morning.
Morning.

497
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,529
So, what did you say to them?

498
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,408
What you told me to,
that you didn't want a fuss.

499
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:26,968
Yeah, more of a fuss than that.

500
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:29,610
That was like I went out
to get a cup of bleedin' tea.

501
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:33,289
You OK?

502
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:36,969
Yeah.

503
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,010
Just gonna keep my head down, Sunny.

504
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:46,969
Do the job, not get too involved.

505
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,050
It'll be fine.
It will.

506
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,689
So, Fogerty, where are we?

507
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:04,888
OK, erm, so we got one little
tickle on the intel system,

508
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:08,049
a PNC record for a drink drive
conviction from 1990.

509
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,209
1990? Marathon year, OK,
interesting.

510
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,768
Exactly. Erm, it says there are
further details on the microfiche,

511
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,569
so I've made an application
to get them.

512
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,129
Good. Jake's on his way
to the house clearance company,

513
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,408
to go through everything
they took and didn't dump.

514
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:23,928
Yep.

515
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:28,489
And, most importantly, we're pretty
sure we've identified the victim.

516
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,899
Mr Fogerty, I presume.

517
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:15,619
And that's its heart, there.

518
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,458
God, you never get blase

519
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:20,659
about seeing their hearts
for the first time, do you?

520
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,179
What number's this, then?

521
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,699
It's my third, her first.

522
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,579
Oh, congratulations.
Thank you.

523
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,139
My first day on this unit.
Well, we'll stick together.

524
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,179
And they said on your site
you could tell us the sex?

525
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,619
We can, but not this early, I'm afraid.

526
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,179
Uh-oh!

527
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,818
Look at him, he's literally
gonna explode with impatience.

528
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:44,019
Well, at least he's in
the right place. God...

529
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,859
Just remind me of your age again, Mum?

530
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,059
46.
Why do you need to know her age?

531
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,378
No, no, all good. Tell you what,
just wait ten seconds

532
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,939
and I'm gonna have a quick word
with my colleague.

533
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,060
You... Why d'you need to...

534
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,100
Can't get the staff these days.

535
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:20,219
We think his name was Matthew Kieran
Walsh, otherwise known as Matt.

536
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,779
He was 24 years old
when he disappeared,

537
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,419
he was an apprentice electrician.

538
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:29,259
This was one of several photos
given to the original investigation

539
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,938
by his girlfriend at the time,
a Karen Chambers.

540
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:36,179
If you compare the tattoo
to the one from the autopsy,

541
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,378
you can see this distinct snake design.

542
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:39,858
It's pretty unique,

543
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,699
I've been on Millwall tattoo websites

544
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,378
and I've not seen anything else
like it.

545
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,818
When did he go missing?

546
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:47,938
He was last seen on 30th March 1990,

547
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:50,458
near Copsefield Park, West Hendon,

548
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:52,659
which is about a mile
from where he lived, actually.

549
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,818
Any good leads at the time?

550
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:55,538
I'm trying to locate
the original files,

551
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,139
all that's from the misper database.

552
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,458
OK.
And do we have any next of kin?

553
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:04,580
We're trying to find up-to-date
contact details right now.

554
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,859
I'll come straight down.

555
00:39:35,379 --> 00:39:39,699
Well, it's not too late.
I mean, she's gonna hate it anyway.

556
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,659
She'll be OK as long as we sit her
next to your friends,

557
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,620
it's just mine
she'll be unbearably snobby to.

558
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,660
All I'm saying... All I'm saying...

559
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,699
..is this is meant to be
the happiest day of our life.

560
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,418
It will be.

561
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:02,620
And I just don't want that
evil old cow to spoil anything.

562
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,979
I have to invite her, babe,
she's my mum.

563
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,099
She won't spoil anything.

564
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,220
I promise, I won't let her.

565
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,379
You're a mystery to me sometimes,
Elizabeth Baildon.

566
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:26,338
I would've put her out to pasture
years ago.

567
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,300
Come on. Present list.

568
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,938
Hey.
Hey.

569
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,379
This just came through,
which is interesting...

570
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:48,299
The front page of the Fogerty
drink drive stop.

571
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,059
Oh, yeah.
So, first of all,

572
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,579
the time, date,
and where he was stopped.

573
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:58,699
11:37 at night, March 30th 1990,
on Colebridge Road,

574
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,219
which turns out
to be less than a mile away

575
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,818
from the location of the last known
sighting of Matthew Walsh,

576
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:09,059
which was walking down
Townmead Road, near Copsefield Park,

577
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,219
at 10:55.

578
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,779
So, less than a mile away
on exactly the same night.

579
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,938
OK. So, this is good, no?

580
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,259
Yeah, I think so,

581
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,458
cos here you've got Walsh,
spotted alive and well

582
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,579
just before 11,

583
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,099
and then you've got the guy
in whose house we find Walsh's body,

584
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,579
stopped in his car, just
down the road, 40 minutes later.

585
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,059
With, we might reasonably presume,
Walsh's body now in the car?

586
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,338
I think if you were a gambling man,
that's a strong possibility.

587
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,378
Now, that's all fine. That all fits.

588
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:37,498
What's curious is when
you read the traffic officer's notes

589
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:40,338
on the arrest.
What was the cop's name?

590
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:42,619
Alan Hamilton, so if you look
at his notes there,

591
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,180
you'll see that
when Fogerty was pulled over...

592
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,939
Oh, wow.

593
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
There were four other people
in the car with him.

594
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:59,219
Hi, is that Felix?
'Yup.'

595
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,378
Hi, Felix, it's Dean. Dean Barton.

596
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:04,338
'Dean Barton, hey, mate, long time.
Thanks for getting back to me.'

597
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:06,538
Yeah, no problem, sorry it, er,
took a while,

598
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,259
I couldn't find your number anywhere.

599
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,538
'No worries.'
So, what's up?

600
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:14,179
'Right, well, listen, Dean,
bottom line, I need a favour.'

601
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,059
Oh, yeah? What sort of favour?

602
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,579
'I've been let down
by a massive shipment.

603
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,139
'With its passage, I mean,
from Calais to here.

604
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,099
'And I was wondering
if you could possibly help me out.'

605
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,299
Yeah, I don't do that any more,
Felix. You know that.

606
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,538
It's 11 years now.

607
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:31,978
I don't have the contacts any more.

608
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:34,779
I'm just an ordinary businessman
these days.

609
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,819
So I'm not the guy.
Erm, you need someone else.

610
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:49,100
I mean, how much
are we even talking about?

611
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,299
Well, weirdly, I actually remember
this incident remarkably well.

612
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,779
Oh, OK.

613
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,179
Good. Why?

614
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,659
Well, cos it was so strange.

615
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,699
Nothing like this
had ever happened to me before

616
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,858
or, indeed, ever happened again.

617
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:20,898
Wow.

618
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,338
Go on.

619
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:25,579
So, as it says here,
the car was speeding,

620
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,219
that's why we pulled it over

621
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,818
and when the driver got out, Fogerty,

622
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:33,259
I could smell alcohol on his breath.

623
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,018
He didn't seem drunk,
but we did a test and he failed it,

624
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:41,220
so, obviously, I had to nick him,
which was when he started to cry.

625
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:45,059
And he was a big lad, tall.

626
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,300
But he was crying like a child,
like he was utterly broken-hearted.

627
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:52,779
It was upsetting, you know?

628
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,378
Because, well,
he seemed like a nice enough kid.

629
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:58,378
I mean, he'd been silly,
but as I said to him,

630
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:01,619
he'd get a couple of points
on his licence and a year ban,

631
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,020
but it wasn't the end of the world.

632
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:06,220
Which is when he told me.

633
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:10,219
He was driving back
from a party in Hendon.

634
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,619
A celebration party.

635
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,419
A celebration party for what?

636
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,180
Passing out.

637
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,179
No...

638
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,818
He was a probationer
who'd just qualified,

639
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:27,660
and he was crying because he knew...

640
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,060
Well, he knew
he'd just fucked his entire career.

641
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,539
And the others, in the car.

642
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,260
Had they been at the same party?

643
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,818
Yeah.

644
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,300
That's why it's stayed in my head
all these years.

645
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,819
Because all five of them...

646
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,339
..were newly qualified coppers.

646
00:45:00,305 --> 00:46:00,461
