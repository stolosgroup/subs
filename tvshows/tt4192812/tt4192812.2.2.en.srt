1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,070
So, how old could it be?

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,990
10, 20 years? Maybe longer.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,070
Male, do you think?

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,590
That looks like a bloke's watch.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,270
- Daddies!
- Hello, my darling.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,880
You're gonna be fine. And in ten
weeks, she'll be ours for good.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,350
I saw you yesterday, in the supermarket...

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,670
How much?

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,240
£5,000.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,510
- Are you nervous?
- No, terrified.

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,910
Who wouldn't want to turn
a school like that around?

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,910
You will never find a candidate
who understands the sorts of kids

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,910
you have at Highbrook better than me.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,590
I've gotta go but I'll see
you on the ward. Bye, love.

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,190
- Who was that?
- Zoe, the girl with non-Hodgkins.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,790
She's got your personal number?

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,630
When I was examining the body,
I noticed something a bit odd.

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,910
It's the remains of a pager.

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,310
We'd need to source a working
version of this model,

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,990
de-solder the data chip from
this and see what we get.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,430
Here he is.

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,520
David Ewan Walker.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,680
63% of all murder victims are
killed by their partners.

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,360
You'll be thinking that, won't you?

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,074

So, yesterday we believe we
identified the body in the case,

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,280
as David Ewan Walker,

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,640
reported missing on the 10th of May, 1990.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,120
The postmortem confirmed
that David Walker died

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,720
as a result of probably a
single stab wound to the chest.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,760
So, we're looking for his
killer, pure and simple.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
For whoever robbed a five-year-old child

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,520
of the opportunity to
ever see his dad again.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,880
A boy who... well, no,
he's a 31-year-old man now,

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,080
who has apparently spent the last 26 years

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,200
praying that his father
would still turn up...

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,350
- Hey, Mum.
- .. alive.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,320
What?

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,070
So, the data chip from the
pager we found on his body

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,430
is still being analysed.

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,590
But so far we've pulled information off it

49
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,360
going back about erm...
12 weeks before he died.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,070
Now, I'm not sure how much you
children know about pagers.

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,990
But this one was alphanumeric,

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,350
which meant as well as
leaving your phone number,

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,510
you could send it short
messages, like a text.

54
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,470
Now, obviously the more we can decipher,

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,670
er... the more of an insight we can gain

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,270
into his movements in the
last few weeks of his life.

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,440
So, Fran, can you talk to
BT and see if they can help

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,190
fill in the gaps of any
of these phone numbers.

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,520
And a bottle of erm... champagne...

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,070
- Whoo!
- Prosecco. Budget cuts.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,600
.. to whoever can decode this message.

62
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,070
Myself and DI Khan

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,800
will learn everything we can about
David Walker from his widow.

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,520
And, Murray, and erm... Jake,

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,230
can you to dig out the original files.

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,390
Let's see what that
investigation turned up.

67
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,510
OK, thank you, everyone.

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,780
I was erm... I was thinking last night.

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,830
Why would you leave anything on a body

70
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,840
that could possibly identify the
victim and then, possibly, you.

71
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,590
Because you rushed
things, you didn't check?

72
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,680
And why would you do that? Why
would you effectively panic?

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
Cos you were in shock.
Never killed anyone before.

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
It's worth bearing in mind.

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,040
- Hey, boys. - Hi. - Hi.

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
.. horsepower. That's not...

77
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,880
- Hiya. - Hi, love.
Oh, this came for you.

78
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,740
By bike.

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,110
I got a second interview.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh... get in!

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,200
- Well done.
- Oh, man, get a room.

82
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,420
Oh.

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,790
I've got those charts.

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,350
- Can you let me know when
Dr Samuels is in. - Yeah.

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,670
- Ooh, Marion.
- Hey.

86
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,310
- Have you got a minute?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,470
She said that she was finding
it hard to speak to her parents

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,590
and that she loved our
chats and that she...

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,790
She just asked if I'd mind

90
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,870
if she could phone my mobile occasionally.

91
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,510
Right. And when was this?

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,550
Oh, gosh, about a month ago.

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
- And how many times has she
called you on your mobile? - Twice.

94
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,310
Er... yesterday and then...

95
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,870
about day or so after she
first asked me, I think.

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,040
- It's not like a regular thing, really.
- No. No, no, not at all.

97
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,630
And I would've put a stop to it

98
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,510
if I thought it was getting out of hand.

99
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,950
I mean, it's obviously great

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,510
that you've developed such
a strong rapport with her

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,350
and I know how much you've helped her.

102
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,150
I just think we need to reset
the boundaries a bit now

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,440
- and just say no more personal calls.
- OK, yeah, sure.

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,710
I'll speak to her parents
and reassure them,

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,670
they just felt a little bit undermined.

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,110
OK, no problem. And I'm sorry if...

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,360
OK. Thanks, Marion. Cheers.

108
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Sorry, who... who told them?
Zoe's parents, I mean?

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
Zoe, I presume. Who else?

110
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,150
All my life, I've thought
he walked out on us.

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,480
I know. But I always said we
didn't know that for sure.

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,630
It was the best-case scenario, Mum.

113
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,080
Worst-case? He topped himself.

114
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,200
His five-year-old kid wasn't
enough to stay alive for.

115
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,120
I mean, can you imagine what 26
years of thinking that does to you?

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,520
No, I can't.

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,200
And then to find out it was this?

118
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,590
That he did nothing wrong.

119
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,920
That he did still love us.

120
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,600
I feel... cheated. I
feel... I feel robbed.

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,520
I know. Me, too.

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm so sorry, mate, for you both.

123
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Who would've wanted to
have done that to him?

124
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,950
Who would have wanted to have hurt my dad?

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Don't nudge my arm.

126
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,320
All right, you finish it
off. Give me one second.

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
What is it, Col? What's the matter?

128
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,720
Nothing.

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,790
These are meant to be the
happiest weeks of our lives.

130
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,110
I'm fine.

131
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,500
Everything's absolutely fine.

132
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,900
We went out for about
five years, on and off.

133
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,140
Er... finally got married
in '81, had Jason in '85.

134
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,860
Hm. And it was a happy marriage?

135
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,060
Yeah. Well, it was as happy as any.

136
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,810
How do you mean?

137
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,700
Well, no marriage is perfect, is it?

138
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,740
No. No, I guess not.

139
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,940
No, I mean, we... we loved
each other but er...

140
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,820
David had his issues, periods
of fairly serious depression.

141
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,640
And... and that put a strain on things.

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,090
And this depression was
caused by one thing, or...

143
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,930
Well, no, I think that's the
point of depression, isn't it?

144
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,130
There isn't anything
obvious to be sad about.

145
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,970
- Sure. - I mean, certainly,
I never really worked it out.

146
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,140
In the end, I think it was... I
think it was just how he was made.

147
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,660
And... and you said all this
to the original investigation?

148
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,140
Yeah, I think I did, I mean...
God, it was a long time ago now.

149
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,680
Indeed.

150
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:14,220
We found the remains of a
pager on your husband's body?

151
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,170
Yeah. Yeah, he had a pager.

152
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,740
Do any of these numbers or
messages ring any bells for you.

153
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,340
Right, well, if that's...
if that's "call me",

154
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,450
that's the sort of message I often sent.

155
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,980
- I probably even sent something
like that when he went missing. - Hm.

156
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,770
Nothing else rings any bells on that list?

157
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,980
Mm... no. No, sorry.

158
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,810
Can I just ask, did you both work?

159
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,170
He did. I stayed at home
after Jason was born.

160
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,890
- What was his job?
- He worked in the leisure industry.

161
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,450
- Clubs and nightclubs.
- And was that successful?

162
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,330
Yeah, I mean David worked incredibly hard.

163
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,330
He was one of those guys who was
always on the right charity board.

164
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,570
Did loads of voluntary stuff,
raised funds for the local Tories...

165
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,730
What I'm saying is, he was well-connected.

166
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,420
He went missing on the 8th but you
didn't report it till the 10th?

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,980
- No.
- Why was that?

168
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,610
He sometimes went away
on work-related stuff

169
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,300
and would neglect to tell
me, but never two nights.

170
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,450
When he didn't come
home that second evening,

171
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,890
I rang the police first thing.

172
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,650
- I assume you tried to call him.
- Many times, at work.

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,740
And those calls were logged
by the original investigation.

174
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,970
And they said what?

175
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,610
His office said he hadn't come in that day

176
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,060
and that no-one had seen him
since early evening of the 8th.

177
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,500
- And where was that?
- At a pub in Cannon Street.

178
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,610
- Erm... with anyone, or...?
- Two Tory party members.

179
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,580
He left at 7:00, saying he was
off to meet a potential donor.

180
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,500
And erm... well, that was
the last time he was seen.

181
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,170
In the weeks and months
afterwards, what did you think?

182
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,130
Well, for a long time, I...

183
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,410
I thought he'd finally
had a full on breakdown

184
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,780
and just disappeared to some backwater.

185
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,060
He was that troubled?

186
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,370
In the absence of any better explanation,

187
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,760
it was the best answer I had.

188
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,100
And as the months and
then years went by...

189
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,300
.. I just assumed he'd gone off
and killed himself somewhere.

190
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,850
I presume the business came to you?

191
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,100
It did, yeah, eventually.

192
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,340
And er... for all his ambition
and endless years of 14-hour days,

193
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,370
it wasn't actually worth much.

194
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,220
All I know is Jason and I ended
up with less than £30,000.

195
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,540
So I joined the police force
six months after he disappeared,

196
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,530
mainly cos I was so impressed
with the officers on his case,

197
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,890
but also, because I needed the money.

198
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,100
Hm.

199
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,940
OK, thank you.

200
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,410
Fasting gives us criteria,
it gives us guidance

201
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,060
on what is right and what is wrong.

202
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,290
- Sister... - As long as
people keep taking it down,

203
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,090
I will keep sticking it back up, Omar.

204
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,730
I've had so many complaints, Sara.

205
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,180
And so have I, from other women
made to pray in that room.

206
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,620
It's tiny, it smells.

207
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,050
We have limited space...

208
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,610
Fine, we swap, then.

209
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,490
We have your room, you have ours, simple.

210
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,010
Bye, Omar.

211
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,930
Evening, all.

212
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,890
Hello, love. Good day?

213
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,410
Yeah, not bad. You?

214
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,250
I just put down the phone on Adam.

215
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,500
He might come down next weekend
to celebrate my birthday.

216
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,850
Oh, that'd be nice.

217
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,330
Did he tell you about his
girlfriend? What she did?

218
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,050
Yeah. He seemed to think
it was a selling point.

219
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,690
What do you mean, "selling point"?

220
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,130
- The term "threes up"
was used... - Oh...

221
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,170
At which point, I reminded him
I've got an irregular heartbeat.

222
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,690
Youth of today.

223
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,410
Lucky bastards.

224
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,970
Oh, I meant to ask you,

225
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,100
- what were you doing in Winchester
last Wednesday? - Winchester?

226
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,210
I found a train ticket
in your jeans pocket,

227
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,010
I was about to put them in the machine.

228
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,810
Well, it must have been something

229
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,960
I must have picked up
accidentally in the pub.

230
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,410
Huh.

231
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,620
Last Wednesday? I was playing
pitch-and-putt with Bob and Gem

232
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,100
in Acton.

233
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,210
Right. Yeah, no worries.

234
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,620
Of course I didn't tell them. How
would I even know their number?

235
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,900
She rang me from her landline, you
could have looked on my mobile.

236
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,180
- Well, why would I do that?
- I don't know, Tony, you tell me.

237
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,970
I'm... I'm worried about you.

238
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,970
I'm worried you're getting sick again.

239
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,690
I'm not getting sick again, Tony.

240
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,130
Just cos I don't see the world

241
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,450
exactly how you see it, how Elise sees it.

242
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,890
What's Elise got to do with it?

243
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,970
Oh, every time I disagree with
either of you, I'm going nuts again.

244
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,730
And I saw you, by the way,
exchanging looks about me at mum's.

245
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,810
I didn't exchange any looks with her.

246
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,690
You have no idea what it's
like being part of that family.

247
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,250
I didn't ring Zoe's parents, sweetheart.

248
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,060
I promise, I would never
do something like that.

249
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,180
Marion. Marion, don't...

250
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,050
So, yesterday we spoke to Tessa Nixon

251
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,860
or erm... DI Tessa Nixon I should say.

252
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,410
And we both felt that she
was holding stuff back,

253
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,700
but no evidence as yet that she had
anything to do with his murder.

254
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780
Murray, what did the original
investigation conclude?

255
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,180
Exactly that. There was no evidence
connecting her to any foul play.

256
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,890
- How comprehensive were the files?
- Pretty good.

257
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,850
Though we both thought their
angle was definitely more misper

258
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,050
than foul play, so...
There are holes, though.

259
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,220
- Things dealt with not quite
rigorously enough. - Such as?

260
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,050
This travelcard was found
in an office desk of his

261
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,730
- in the days after his
disappearance. - OK.

262
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,980
Look at the dates -- 7th of May, 1990.

263
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,530
The day before he disappeared.

264
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,490
Erm... are we... are we sure
that this is his handwriting?

265
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,010
The experts back in the day
thought it probably was.

266
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,490
And this was followed up?

267
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,850
Yeah, it was. 26 Raglan Way, Highgate.

268
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,730
Two sisters lived in
there, both in their 70s,

269
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,450
who had no idea why their
address was on this ticket.

270
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,450
Got a number for the address, called it,

271
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,570
- but they both died
several years ago. - Oh.

272
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,900
But I'm just wondering,
is that definitely a six?

273
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Or could it be a zero?

274
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,090
I told you we shouldn't sack him.

275
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,620
So, have... have you made
contact with number 20?

276
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,690
Yeah, local authority records
have a Mrs J Dunphy living there

277
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,050
who's an 80-year-old widow.

278
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,780
Very... good... work. We
need to follow up on that.

279
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,850
Anything else?

280
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,260
These are photocopies of the last
three months of his desk diary,

281
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,210
and this is a list of all the
original points of action

282
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,410
that came out of it.

283
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,050
I went through, highlighted any gaps.

284
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,810
And this one seems to have
slipped through the cracks.

285
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,260
There's the time, 7:30,
on the 9th of March,

286
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,100
and then next to it, a name -- Colin.

287
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,620
Then, 5 days later, the
14th, a phone number,

288
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,100
which BT have said at the time
was registered to a C Osbourne.

289
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,170
- C for Colin.
- And this wasn't followed up?

290
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,930
Officers called on the address
attached several times.

291
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,860
It was a flat near Tower Bridge
-- Flat Seven, Ferriers' Wharf.

292
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,650
No-one was ever in and then
it was never followed up.

293
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,810
But seeing as it was only a few
weeks before he was murdered,

294
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,850
we think it's worth chasing down, right?

295
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,940
Yeah, definitely. Thanks, Jake.

296
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,780
- Fran.
- Yeah.

297
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,690
So, BT have been very helpful,

298
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,490
lots of numbers come up more than once.

299
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,290
So, most of these are his work numbers.

300
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,210
His clubs, his accountant, his office.

301
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,900
But this one here is his best mate,
James Gregory, a restaurant owner.

302
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,090
He's still on the same number, erm...

303
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,450
I spoke to him, he seemed
really keen to talk to us.

304
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,370
That's interesting.

305
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,420
OK and erm... finally,

306
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,260
anyone claiming a bottle of
the very finest £5 Prosecco?

307
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,820
Yes. I think it's an address.

308
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,300
Er... Flat C, Shawbrook Mansions...

309
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,780
And the KX?

310
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,900
King's Cross.

311
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,410
Oh, very well done.

312
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,980
Fran, very good.

313
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,540
OK, now we will follow up on all
of that. Thank you, everyone.

314
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,610
Flat Seven, Ferriers' Wharf, Tower Bridge.

315
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,540
Yes, August '88 to May 1990,

316
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,580
it was let to a Colin Eliot Osborne.

317
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,100
- OK, any forwarding address?
- No.

318
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,660
Right. No references
or previous addresses?

319
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,540
- Sorry, after seven years, we
just keep the contracts. - Right.

320
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,020
Wow, £24,000 per annum,

321
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,290
that's... well, that's two grand a month.

322
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,450
That was serious money
back then, wasn't it?

323
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,660
- It was the '80s. It's when
serious money was invented. - Yeah.

324
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,940
Fran, I'm in King's Cross,
outside your Shawbrook Mansions.

325
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,060
I can see it was residential,
it's now an advertising agency.

326
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,330
Er... maybe check Land
Registry records for 1990,

327
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,690
see who owned the building.

328
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,060
- Check utility bills, gas, electric,
water... - Yeah. - Yeah, OK.

329
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,860
- Hey.
- So, a zero or a six?

330
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,850
Dunno yet, there's no-one in.

331
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,210
I've dropped a note through
the door to call us.

332
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,330
So, I've just spoken to the original owner

333
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,890
of the King's Cross property.

334
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,090
- He'd be happy to speak
to us in an hour. - Huh.

335
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,010
Fran found a gas bill with the
tenant's name -- an S Larvey.

336
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,570
Also, just spoke to Jake.

337
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,740
He thinks he might have tracked
down your Tower Bridge tenant.

338
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,930
A Colin Eliot Osborne who's the right age,

339
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,210
living in Brighton, working as a lawyer.

340
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,530
Great.

341
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,610
- I'm gonna give you the money.
- All right.

342
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,650
But it's a one-off payment.

343
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,290
If you come after me again,

344
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,050
I will go to the police
and social services myself

345
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,240
and I'll take my chances.

346
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,730
I need to know you understand that.

347
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,260
Absolutely. You know, I'm not
some lowlife blackmailer, Colin.

348
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,140
This is a one-off for both our benefit.

349
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,540
Meet me in the cafe we were in
before at 9:30 on Wednesday.

350
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,580
Ms Alazi.

351
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,300
I'm sorry, no, I have no
recollection of her at all.

352
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,660
I mean, obviously she was a
tenant cos she paid the gas bill.

353
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,300
But I owned eight houses,

354
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,170
each of which had up
to five flats, you know,

355
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,570
which I rented out from the late '60s

356
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,570
to when I sold up in
er... what was it? 2007?

357
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,050
Yeah, I must have had
thousands of tenants.

358
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,490
Right, I see.

359
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,820
Took over the supply in late '89.

360
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,100
Well, er... as I'm sure
you're both well-aware,

361
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,420
King's Cross has changed a
fair bit in the past few years.

362
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,100
- Yes. - But in '89, the house
she lived in at that time

363
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,420
I rented out almost
exclusively to prostitutes.

364
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,340
Yeah, lovely girls most of 'em.

365
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,900
Yeah, very reliable. Always paid on time.

366
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,020
So I'd be very surprised if
your Ms Alazi wasn't a tart.

367
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,440
Any form relating to S
Alazi, King's Cross area,

368
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,440
from... let's say '88 to '92.

369
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,750
Cheers, Jake.

370
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Guv.

371
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,430
I'm trying to think of other
reasons why a man would have

372
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,470
a prostitute's address sent to
his pager, but I am struggling.

373
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,510
Which would be exactly the same
conversation a wife would have

374
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,510
with her husband if she found out.

375
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,900
Indeed.

376
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
We can use this one.

377
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,630
I'm sorry, we're very aware
of how hard this must be

378
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
for you to hear.

379
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,480
And he messaged her, or...?

380
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,140
We think she sent him her address.

381
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,940
Which we have good reason to
believe she used for business.

382
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,790
No, I had no knowledge of him

383
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,840
using prostitutes,
obviously, I was his wife.

384
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,870
And, no, we didn't row about it,

385
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,390
the row didn't get out of hand

386
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
and I didn't accidentally
fucking kill him.

387
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,430
Sure.

388
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,320
But, knowing him as you did and
not withstanding his issues...

389
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,960
.. is it something now you could
contemplate he could have done?

390
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,640
Could he have been that sort of man?

391
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,400
How long have you been a
detective, DCI Stuart?

392
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,120
22 years.

393
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,480
19.

394
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,440
Would anything a man is
capable of surprise you?

395
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,000
OK.

396
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,590
Thanks for your time, Tessa.

397
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,110
Thank you.

398
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,180
- Thank you.
- Bye.

399
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,390
- Tess.
- Ma'am.

400
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,710
Have you got five?

401
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,920
Er... yeah, sure.

402
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,510
"Restricted duties"?

403
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,510
Look, I understand this must be hard to...

404
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,030
I was cleared of any involvement in my
husband's disappearance 26 years ago.

405
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,950
Of course, and that's not what this is.

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,750
- DCI Stuart is just doing
a general sweep... - Tess.

407
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,070
No-one can be expected
to do their job properly

408
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,510
with this hanging over them.

409
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,510
Except nothing is hanging over me, ma'am.

410
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,760
Not to mention the upset of
learning what happened to David.

411
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,030
So, I wanna set up some
counselling for you.

412
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm gonna refer you to
Occupational Health.

413
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,360
Are you telling me I have to go on
restricted duties or asking me to?

414
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,350
I'm saying be sensible,
take a back seat for a bit

415
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,000
and I'm sure it'll all have
blown over in a few weeks.

416
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,720
Do you think I might have done it, then?

417
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,110
Tess, that is insulting
and I can't even...

418
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,630
No, I'm fine, ma'am. If you
want me out of my office,

419
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,180
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to formally suspend me.

420
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,990
I don't care what time anyone
else is staying till, Aisha,

421
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,550
I want you back at 11:00.

422
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,680
Listen. Lis... Listen.
Listen. OK, here's the deal.

423
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,550
You can either go and be back
by 11:00, or not go at all.

424
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,400
It's your choice.

425
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,750
Aisha?

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,190
Ai...

427
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,380
Oh!

428
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,350
Hardball. Respect.

429
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,880
I've been having the same conversation
every week for the last six months.

430
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,700
It's like negotiating with a goldfish.

431
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Mr Osborne?

432
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,870
Er... excuse me. Hello.

433
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,840
DCI Stuart. DI Khan. Bishop Street Police.

434
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,550
Is there somewhere we could
go for a quick chat, please?

435
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,230
I was just about to go in to court.

436
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,790
If it's about a case, you
should contact my chambers

437
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,470
- and they'll...
- No, it's not about a case of yours.

438
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,070
We're investigating an
historical case in London

439
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,120
and we hoped you might be able
to help us with our enquiries.

440
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,350
All right, take room
three down the corridor.

441
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,630
I was just about to got to the loo, so...

442
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,150
Thank you.

443
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,360
- Hey.
- Hi.

444
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,460
Sorry, no... no idea.

445
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,950
And the name doesn't ring any bells?

446
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,280
Erm... no. No, sorry.

447
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
OK, not a problem.

448
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,920
The only reason we ask is
that we found a phone number

449
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that was registered to a
flat that you were renting

450
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,040
in a desk diary belonging to David Walker.

451
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,280
Wh... which flat?

452
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,240
Er... Ferriers' Wharf, Tower Bridge.

453
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,750
- Oh, OK.
- You did rent that flat?

454
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,080
Er... yes. Late '80s, I think.

455
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
'88 to '90.

456
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,160
Erm... I mean, I had a lot of
mates staying with me at that flat,

457
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,230
I suppose any one of them could
have given this guy the number.

458
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,150
It was slightly party central.

459
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,750
It was a pretty cool flat.

460
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,190
Well, I was working in the
city at the time, so...

461
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,630
As a lawyer?

462
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,550
No, a banker, I'm afraid.

463
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,680
Oh, right, Erm... which bank?

464
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,360
Klein Egerton?

465
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Banker to criminal lawyer, that's...

466
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,590
.. that's quite a change, isn't it?

467
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,960
Is it?

468
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,910
What prompted that?

469
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,430
If you'd worked in the city in the '80s,

470
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,990
you wouldn't have to ask me this.

471
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,780
Pretty soulless.

472
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,830
Well, good for you.

473
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,960
I looked at your chambers website,
you do a lot of really good work.

474
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,240
- I hope so. - Lots of pro bono. - Yeah.

475
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,990
You obviously have a desire to...

476
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,870
.. give something back.

477
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,110
Well, if you can, I think you should.

478
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,900
Hm.

479
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,080
Yeah.

480
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,500
Well, thanks for your time...

481
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,840
.. Mr Osborne, we appreciate it.

482
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,150
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

483
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,400
Oh, actually, no, one... one more thing.

484
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,670
When did you say you left banking?

485
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm not sure I did.

486
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,880
Erm... early 1990.

487
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,760
Right, so... February or March or...

488
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,040
Erm... yes, around about
then. I'm sorry, I can't...

489
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,110
- I can't quite remember exactly.
- No problem. Thanks again.

490
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,760
- You're welcome, thank you.
- Bye.

491
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,500
Cheers.

492
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,590
- Subtle.
- Aren't I?

493
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,840
You might as well have just said,
"Guilty conscience, Mr Osborne?"

494
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,630
Got him sweating though, didn't it?

495
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,780
And I'd put money on him
knowing David Walker.

496
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,190
I need an adjournment.

497
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,510
You're on in two minutes.

498
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,350
And I've just been puking up in the bog.

499
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,950
So, unless the judge wants
his courtroom redecorated,

500
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,100
- I suggest you persuade
him to allow it. - OK.

501
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,450
For some women it only lasts a few months,

502
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,050
whereas for others, it can take...

503
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,330
All I want to know is, am I still fertile?

504
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,420
Well, given your age and the fact
that you haven't had a period

505
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,660
for 18 months, it's pretty unlikely.

506
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,730
I mean, I could still get you
referred to a fertility...

507
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,930
No. No, it's not a problem, really.

508
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,650
It's not a problem at all. Thank you.

509
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,900
He said he hoped she'd die of AIDS.

510
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,940
I just...

511
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,420
I mean, I just thought your temper
issues were so in the past now.

512
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,600
- And they are.
- Right, so you risk your job?

513
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,940
You force us into engaging with
some incredibly unstable couple?

514
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,380
You jeopardise everything because
some twat takes a shot at us?

515
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,330
It's all right. It's OK.

517
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,780
- God, I've completely messed up haven't I?
- No, you haven't.

518
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,380
We'll deal with it, OK?
We'll... we'll work it out.

519
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,130
OK, so I think we've got two options.

520
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,450
- We tell Janet...
- No.

521
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Colin, you know the rules. If
any of our circumstances change,

522
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,570
we have a duty to tell
her and make sure...

523
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,570
And how do you think that's going to play?

524
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,930
How happy are they gonna be to leave

525
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,810
an already very vulnerable young girl

526
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,960
with somebody who loses
their temper like that?

527
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,810
Which is, I'm sure, exactly
what you're thinking right now.

528
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,660
Of course I'm not.

529
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
If we tell Janet, we could lose Flo.

530
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:11,420
OK, well, then the second option
is... we give them the money.

531
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,100
I think it's our only choice, love.

532
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,490
I just hope it's enough.

533
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Jase?

534
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,700
Go home, mate. Take a few days
off, you shouldn't be here.

535
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,320
I'm really sorry for you.

536
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,450
- Jase... - Sorry, Cath,
I'm in a bit of a rush.

537
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,620
Oh, OK. No problem.

538
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,770
- Night, then.
- Night.

539
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,130
Are you OK?

540
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,730
Is there any way you could
swap weekends with Melanie

541
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,530
so Becca could go there this weekend?

542
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Er... yeah.

543
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,860
Yeah, fine.

544
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
What?

545
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,090
It's just...

546
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,440
Becca's mum's is very noisy
with her stepbrothers.

547
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,210
She has her exams next week, so...

548
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,340
- Oh, right.
- She's really hoping to be able to

549
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,220
revise here in a bit of peace and quiet.

550
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Fine.

551
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,060
I just...

552
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,850
I do need some space, love.

553
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,300
I'm... I'm finding this all pretty hard.

554
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Yeah, of course.

555
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,480
Well...

556
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,050
- .. I'll speak to her.
- OK.

557
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,570
Thank you.

558
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,420
Anything erm... Anything I can help with?

559
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,240
You wanna...

560
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,370
.. talk to me? Tell me anything?

561
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,370
- Tell you what?
- No, fine, it's just...

562
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,490
Any time you need to...

563
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,060
.. offload, I'm here.

564
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,880
Well, thank you.

565
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,060
Are you all right?

566
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Yeah, fine.

567
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,560
Night, then.

568
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,900
So we have four arrests for Sara Alazi,

569
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,460
all in '89 or '90, and
all within a 5-minute walk

570
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,170
of the King's Cross flat.

571
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,700
Erm... on two of those occasions, she
was arrested with the same woman,

572
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,580
a Samira Khan who is still a sex worker.

573
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,970
Impressive.

574
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,780
Er... last arrest was 18 months ago,

575
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,490
for running a brothel just
off the Pentonville Road.

576
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,050
Council tax records have
her down as owning it,

577
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,220
although it is now listed as a spa.

578
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,460
Well, I don't suppose "brothel"
is an option on the form.

579
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,180
Ooh, one more thing. David
Walker was a Tory party fundraiser

580
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,530
for most of the '80s.

581
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,100
Can you ring his wife and see if she
has any photos of him from that time?

582
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,020
Photos of functions they
went to, press clippings.

583
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,540
And if you get no joy
there, ring the party HQ

584
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,570
and see if they have a photo
archive that we can look at.

585
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,820
- Got it.
- Thanks, Jake.

586
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,240
- Got the address.
- Shall we go?

587
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,130
Can I help you?

588
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,500
Hi, I'm DCI Cassie Stewart.
We're looking for Samira Khan.

589
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,850
Yeah, we were very good friends.

590
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,890
And over what period
of time would you say?

591
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,810
When we were working together.

592
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,580
Not long, eight, nine months
maybe, but we stayed friends after.

593
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,500
Right, and so when did she stop?

594
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,450
- Sex work?
- Yes.

595
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,380
Erm... early 1990?

596
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,250
She cleaned herself up
and moved out of London,

597
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,090
but we just stayed in
touch. Phone, letters...

598
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,380
And we'd meet up every few months
in town for a coffee and a natter.

599
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,730
And when was the last time you saw her?

600
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,940
'93, '94, maybe?

601
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,700
But we wrote to each other
until about erm... 1995.

602
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,450
And where was she then?

603
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,410
She was living in Salisbury.

604
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,060
She'd er... done a degree,
I think, and got married.

605
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,660
Yeah, she was always a
smart girl, not like me.

606
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,060
Did you keep any of the letters, Samira?

607
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Sorry, no.

608
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,100
That's no problem. I know
it's a long time ago, but...

609
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,610
do you happen to remember
her married name?

610
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,900
Yeah, I do, cos we joked
about it in the letters.

611
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,300
Mahmoud -- the same as
my mum's maiden name.

612
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,120
I said, "I always knew we'd be family."

613
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,340
Thank you so much, Samira.
You've been incredibly helpful.

614
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,140
No problem. And if you do find her,
send her all my love, will you?

615
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm glad she got out. She
was always better than this.

616
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,500
Sex, death and revenge.

617
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,120
Here are three of our main topics.

618
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,290
Are you all right, miss?

619
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,200
Let's look at erm...

620
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,740
.. act three, please, scene four.

621
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,460
"Thanks to Your Majesty..."

622
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,240
Mrs Mahmoud, can we borrow
you for a second, please?

623
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,620
No, sorry. I don't
recognise him I'm afraid.

624
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,460
OK. No problem.

625
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,700
Any idea how your flat address
might have ended up in his pager?

626
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,140
Can I remember why I might have
given some random bloke my address

627
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,140
one night in the '90s?... No, sorry.

628
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,600
Well...

629
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,050
.. do you think there's a chance

630
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,380
that you gave it when he was your client?

631
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,260
What do you mean, "client"?

632
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,000
A punter of yours...

633
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,260
.. when you worked as a prostitute.

634
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,880
Please say you don't
need to tell anyone this.

635
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,580
Here, or my family.

636
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,700
Please.

637
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,300
(Please.)

638
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,580
It was a lifetime ago, I was a
completely different person.

639
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,940
- Sara, if you co-operate with us...
- I will, completely.

640
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,050
I wanna help you.

641
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,770
Then there's absolutely no reason

642
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,940
why anyone but us needs
to know about anything.

643
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,860
I don't know him, I swear.

644
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,260
But, yeah, of course he
could have been a client.

645
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,300
You had a lot of clients, I presume?

646
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,080
I did what I did for less than a year.

647
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,080
I was in a very dark place at the time.

648
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,540
But a year is still a very
long time in that world.

649
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,930
When did he go missing?

650
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,540
May 1990. The 8th, we think.

651
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,980
I was abroad.

652
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,650
I went travelling in Europe early 1990

653
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,530
and was away for most of the year.

654
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,980
You can check passport records.

655
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,570
I was 1,000 miles away.

656
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,100
So, what do you think?

657
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,970
Completely credible.

658
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,360
I agree.

659
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,850
But let's assume she's lying.

660
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,620
Absolutely. I'll check the passport.

661
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,170
After all this fucking...

662
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,810
I've spent 26 years being messed up

663
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,250
by something that never
actually happened, Becs.

664
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,410
I mean, can you imagine
what that feels like?

665
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,330
- No...
- It feels shit, let me tell you.

666
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,100
I can feel this fucking rage inside
cos of the years I've wasted...

667
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,970
I never needed to become the
useless loser that I am now.

668
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,890
And I just... I feel like I
wanna take it out on someone...

669
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,570
- I wanna punch and smash
and hurt someone... - Becca?

670
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,130
- .. except there is no-one
to blame... - Dad? - Jase?

671
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,450
- Jason.
- Hi, Paul. Hi, Mum.

672
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,370
Hiya, sweetheart. Why didn't you
tell us you were coming round?

673
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,770
It wasn't planned, just
needed someone to talk to.

674
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,420
All right. It's OK. Hey, come on.

675
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,930
- You OK? - Mm-hm. - It's all right.

676
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,320
It's fine, it's fine. Come on.

677
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,700
I think we will want to interview
you properly, Mr Gregory,

678
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,010
but that's really helpful for now.

679
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,740
Thanks. Thank you very much. Bye.

680
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,180
Guv, I've just spoken to the friend again,

681
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,570
James Gregory, the restaurant owner.

682
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,730
- OK. - So, the conversation
was pretty brief,

683
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,850
he was on the way to work.

684
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,370
But he was telling me
about David's problems,

685
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,690
his depression, his drinking.

686
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,610
Tessa never told us about that.

687
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,540
Ah, he thought it had a lot to do
with what happened to him as a kid.

688
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,650
Which was?

689
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:37,020
He said he'd been abused by a
teacher at his primary school.

690
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,090
And in the last few months of his life,

691
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,570
he'd talked a lot about
going to the police

692
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,970
and finally reporting
what had happened to him.

693
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,500
But also, he talked about
confronting his abuser.

694
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,290
And then one day, he just disappears.

695
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,460
And then one day, someone
sticks a knife in his chest.

695
00:44:58,305 --> 00:45:58,520
