Say again? Why can't
Chigwell pick it up, or Edmonton?

14
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,276
I'm not sure, really. Andrews just
rang me and told me it was ours.

15
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,359
Hold on one second, please.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Will you two please be quiet?
I'm on a work call!

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah, sorry - Listen. Listen,
I know it's late.

18
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,240
For me it was either this or
Time Team Revisited, so...

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
You coming past me?

20
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,759
Mum, it was my birthday.

21
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
So, what time did it finish?
God... four, maybe five.

22
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,839
Your neighbours must love you.

23
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,840
They were the last to leave.
And was Alice there?

24
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Alice and I split. Oh! Right, another
one I never met.

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm not sure you would've liked her
anyway, so...

26
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
It doesn't matter what I think of
her, Jase.

27
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,360
I just want you to be happy. Yeah.

28
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,720
You want another one? Erm...

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Well, go on, then. A quick one. Then
I should shift. Paul's cooking.

30
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah, me too. The flat's totalled.

31
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
I mean... my sister did it.

32
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,399
When she split up with Michael.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,400
No. It's not really my thing.

34
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,817
Well, one in four marriages last
year started online.

35
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:18,389
Yeah, I'm sure.
I just don't really fancyending up

36
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,115
standing in front of some bloke I've been
on three dates with in my bra and knickers.

37
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,404
That bit never bothers me.

38
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,217
What? You in your bra and knickers?

39
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,679
Evening. Evening, sir. Which way?

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Just go over the bridge...
Thank you.

41
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,439
Because... What? Because you want to
watch EastEnders,

42
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,440
or because wanna go out, or...?

43
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Because you're feeling sick?
I'm always feeling sick, fucktard.

44
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,320
On account of the cancer.
Do you have cancer?

45
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Just... Really, what's the point?

46
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,495
Oh, yeah, I know.

47
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,532
You do everything you're meant to do
and you fight with every fibre in your body

48
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:24,145
and it turns out cancer
doesn't give a shit.

49
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,137
So, by all means, have a cry...

50
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:28,557
and just tell me that you're scared.

51
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:31,167
And if you like you can give up in
here as well, cos that's

52
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:33,933
not really gonna make a difference, but...

53
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,531
Please, please don't stop taking the
chemo, cos in the end, that is all we've got.

54
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Never ever become a therapist.

55
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Now please, piss off
before I top myself.

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,510
And according to the local council,
the river was last dredged in 1994.

57
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,831
Right. Obviously that doesn't necessarily
mean this went in the water after then.

58
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,580
The last dredge could've just missed it.

59
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,535
Sorry, to me, this looks way too
preserved to have been in here

60
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,199
for any serious length of time.
- Ordinarily I'd agree,

61
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,552
but there are potentially a couple
of unusual factors here.

62
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,705
Firstly, the body was in a sealed case - meaning
very little got in for quite some time, I imagine.

63
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,935
And then secondly, if the conditions are right,
sometimes a body that's been left in water

64
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,879
undergoes a chemical change called
saponification.

65
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,940
Which, effectively, seals and
preserves the body.

66
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,119
So, how old could it be?

67
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,784
Hard to say, but easily... five, ten,
20 years? Maybe longer.

68
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,247
Wow! Male, do you think? Cos that
looks like a bloke's watch.

69
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,079
Let me get everything back to my lab.

70
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,581
We'll get the remains out,
clean them up and see where we are.

71
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,999
Yeah. Call me when you're ready.

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,260
Thanks, Fran.

73
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Popular picnic spot apparently.

74
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,960
All the people who sat here...

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,515
Families, lovers, old ladies eating their egg
and cress and just a few yards away...

76
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I hate egg and cress.

77
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,359
Do you? Mm.

78
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,360
I don't mind it. No? What's your
sandwich of choice, then?

79
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Wouldn't be a sandwich. A crusty,
white roll, grated cheese and onion.

80
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
White bread gives you cancer.
Yeah, that's what they say today.

81
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Next week... the key to everlasting
life.

82
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,679
Hi, jason. Oh, hi, Cath.

83
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,375
Sorry about your party. I had to work late,
and by the time we got back your lights wereout.

84
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,837
Yeah, oh, well. Everyone was
knackered, so it wasn't a late one.

85
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Another time maybe?
- Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.

86
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Do you wanna fix a date now or...?

87
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,758
Well... let me have a look at my diary and I'll
- Sure.

88
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,880
No problem. Night, Cath.

89
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Hiya. In here.

90
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,239
Hey, love. How'd it go?

91
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,319
Fine.

92
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
What? Oh, just...

93
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Well, they're all lovely and
everything but...

94
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,599
They're all little, old ladies, aren't they?
- And you're an old man. Old man.

95
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,279
Yes. Well, thanks for that.

96
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,280
I'm gonna head up. Dad...

97
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,439
Sorry, no, I didn't mean - No, no,
it's all right.

98
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
I'm just feeling a bit bushed.

99
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,599
I'll see you in the morning.

100
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Love you.

101
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
How about I get an extra flight to
Spain?

102
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Becca wouldn't mind. He's always
great company.

103
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Paul... that is so kind of you.

104
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Oh! Come on. Hey!

105
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
He'll be OK.

106
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Mm? He's a cracking lad.

107
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Someone will see that one day.
They will. Mm.

108
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,759
Hm?

109
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Oh!

110
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,160
On three. One, two, three.

111
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,279
Yeah, as I suspected it is a
Blanchard.

112
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,879
You can just see that mark on this
rim.

113
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,519
Oh, I've never heard of it.

114
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,799
They went out of business in the
early '905.

115
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,800
The seals kept going, which wasn't
brilliant on a diving watch.

116
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Don't they have serial numbers
inside? Not this model, annoyingly.

117
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,760
So, not helpful then, in terms of
dating the body.

118
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,839
Maybe we should be concentrating on
the suitcase.

119
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,152
Well, this is a watch, although not a premium one,
it still cost the best part of a grand.

120
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:18,177
So if it goes wrong, you get it
fixed. Any watchmaker fixing a watch,

121
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
will leave a little mark
on the inside plate.

122
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Now, if I can get this off we might
find the date, firstly.

123
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,559
But more importantly, we might find a
name.

124
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,474
So if this watch was fixed at some point... you
think we could probably identify the watchmaker?

125
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,519
If we can identify them...

126
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,520
They might be able to tell us whose
watch it was.

127
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:45,563
♪♪

128
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,587
In mitigation, Your Honour, I would ask you
consider the side of jordan that he hides,

129
00:11:58,422 --> 00:12:02,680
very successfully, from any figure of
authority he comes into contact with.

130
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
And that is the side
of this young man

131
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,108
who spent all the profits accrued
from selling the drugs he was arrested for

132
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,420
on a week at a holiday camp for his
younger brother Liam.

133
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,260
If I may...

134
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,024
The younger brother, who, like jordan,
was taken into care before he turned six.

135
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,005
The fact is, Your Honour, what jordan needs...
In fact, what he desperately wants

136
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,979
is help with his addiction.

137
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Because jordan is, at heart,
a kind and decent young man.

138
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,980
And Iwould ask that we help him show
the world what he is truly capable of.

139
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,139
Laters, bruv. I sincerely hope not.

140
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,499
Say hi to Liam for me. Will do.

141
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
See ya, Col!

142
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,139
Oh!

143
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,671
Excuse me!

144
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,099
Are you serious? The most important
day of our lives.

145
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Nearly gave me a bloody heart attack.

146
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Oh, what you worried about? We've
got at least 15 seconds.

147
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,299
Oh, just hold me up for a minute.

148
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,979
Daddies! Hey!

149
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,059
Oh, hi!

150
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,659
Oh, my darling girl. Shall we go
home?

151
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Yeah. You all right? You ready?
Yeah. Yeah? Good.

152
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I'll take that. You all set? Oh,
she's been so excited. Bye, janet.

153
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,099
Bye, Flo! Bye!

154
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Bye, Flo!

155
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,459
Pizza! Pizza? Oh, yes.

156
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,460
And carrot sticks? No.
And some fruit.

157
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Smith? I'm afraid so. But we do have
an initial.

158
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,339
W Smith?

159
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,739
12/06/89. Yep.

160
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,339
And 04/02/90.

161
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,293
In the absence of a serial number
this is your best bet of identifying the owner.

162
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,780
'So, I've started in
january, 1990.‘ Yeah, good.

163
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,899
'And for now I've taken it up to
1995.‘

164
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Fair enough. 'And that brings up
only 1.5 million missing persons.‘

165
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,099
Oh, please. Now, as we're pretty sure
it's male...

166
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,059
that narrows it down to about
750,000.

167
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,942
Still missing after five years -
that narrows it down to 1% of that figure.

168
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,059
Yeah, that's still 7,500.

169
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,019
Yeah, sorry.

170
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,499
Yeah, hold fire on that for now.

171
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,353
Thanks, jake. 'Cool.‘

172
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,228
I think that's it there.

173
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,708
Obviously there are quite a number of Smiths.
Though the initial does narrow it down quite a bit.

174
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,241
I should also say there are many thousands of
watch repairers who don't belong to our guild,

175
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,300
and we don't keep records of.
-  Right.

176
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,916
But listen... Give me half an hour.
I'll see what I can do.

177
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:00,979
Thank you so much.

178
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:03,402
Oh, will you excuse me?

179
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,232
Dr East, how we doing?

180
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
'Come, you spirits, that tend on
mortal thoughts.

181
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,225
Unsex me here and fill me from the
crown to the toe top, full of direst cruelty.'

182
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
'Unsex me here.' So why is she
talking about sex in this scene?

183
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,940
Why, we might suppose that she has
more important things on her mind?

184
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,660
What's more important than sex?

185
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,459
Why is she saying this?

186
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,460
janice. Cos she isn't talking about
sex in that way.

187
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,739
She means, like, gender.

188
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,579
Very good. But women murder.

189
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,499
They do. Like Myra Hindley.

190
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,179
Charlize Theron.

191
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,899
No, no, it's a good point Karim's
making.

192
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,900
But like Aileen Wuornos, who I think
you're referring to,

193
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,892
like almost all female killers,

194
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:05,221
when women do kill, they generally kill
for a man or because of a man.

195
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,432
What Shakespeare is saying here is
that it's not really in their nature to murder.

196
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,240
Two sides, please, for Monday.

197
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:16,287
Is Lady Macbeth more evil than her
husband?

198
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,379
Did I say you could touch me?

199
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,419
So there's some lamb burgers in the
freezer, and they can have them with

200
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:24,975
spaghetti hoops and broccoli?

201
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,739
Oh, I think we're covering all the
food groups there.

202
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,939
And I should be back by nine-ish.
- CooL

203
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,772
You nervous?
- No. Terrified.

204
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,130
Ah, you'll be fine. How many do you
reckon they're seeing?

205
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,715
Dunno. Loads, though.

206
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,872
I thought you said it was in
special measures?

207
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:40,632
Exactly. Who wouldn't want to turn a school
like that around?

208
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,078
All right.
Teachers are weird.

209
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,353
Says the man who adds up for a living.
- Yeah, all right.

210
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:47,877
Piss off. Love you.
- Yeah, love youtoo. Bye.

211
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,259
0h!

212
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Oh, why not? Well, because I thought
we agreed fresh fruit for brekkie,

213
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,899
and cos Daddy Colin said no.
0h! Right.

214
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,900
I knew it would end up being somehow
my fault. Please, Daddy!

215
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,299
Please, Daddy!

216
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,300
All right, one packet. Yes!

217
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Look! Nope. Yeah, let's not push it,
eh, Flo?

218
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Come on, yoghurt.

219
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,260
I hope you all die of fucking AIDS.
The kid, too.

220
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,220
So, it is a male? Height -
approximately 5'9 "-5'10".

221
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,557
And from the extent of the saponification
I'd say he was probably a little overweight.

222
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,643
Age wise... I'd estimate somewhere
between 30 and 50.

223
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:50,684
OK.

224
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,660
Cause of death.

225
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,419
It was in his chest cavity.

226
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,139
I'm guessing... a kitchen knife?

227
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,733
The handle's maybe rotted away or
perhaps even snapped off at the time of entry.

228
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,659
Right.

229
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,652
So, there are blade marks on the
fourth and fifth left side ribs here.

230
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,499
And here.

231
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
All of which is consistent with a
fatal stab wound to the chest.

232
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,099
To the heart?
- Mm-hm.

233
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:26,327
Based on striations and...

234
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:29,355
...the width of the blade, it would certainly
have penetrated the heart

235
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,717
and the victim would have bled out fairly quickly.

236
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:32,684
OK.

237
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,019
So, we found nothing else in the
suitcase.

238
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,520
But when I was examining the body I...

239
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,395
...noticed something a bit odd about
the area directly below the wound

240
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,779
as he was laying. I had a bit of a
dig around...

241
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,579
...and eventually...

242
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,580
I pulled out this.

243
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,414
What is it?

244
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:53,875
Well, the waxy material is what I told you
about, the hydrolysed body fat.

245
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,902
Yeah.

246
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,257
But it's what it's collected around
that's interesting.

247
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,059
Jesus!

248
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,060
It says 'Andersson', who were a
telecoms company.

249
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,179
I'm guessing it was in
his shirt pocket.

250
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,180
And I think it was
the remains of a pager.

251
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:15,149
♪♪

252
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,532
Here we go.

253
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,642
You all right?

254
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:29,962
Yeah, yeah.
- Just a bit nervous, I think.

255
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,255
We're gonna be fine.
- Are we?

256
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
100%. And in ten weeks' time she'll
be ours for good.

257
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:36,329
Trust me.

258
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:40,282
They're not gonna revoke the adoption
because we gave her Honey Squares.

259
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,431
Right. Seatbelt on, please. OK. I'll
open those for you in one second.

260
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Done. OK. That's it. Done. OK.

261
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Obviously, for your sake, I would've
hoped there'd been less.

262
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Trust me... I thought it'd be worse.

263
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,999
Email the ones that I've marked,

264
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,919
and attach of a photo of the watch.

265
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,879
And Oliver's photo of
the engraved signature.

266
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,880
I'm gonna visit some of the Central
London ones in person.

267
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Got you.

268
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
No, that's not me. You sure?
Absolutely positive. OK.

269
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,640
So the email I sent you. Do you
recognise that signature?

270
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,080
No? OK, no problem. Probably be back
in touch.

271
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,479
Thanks for your time. Bye.

272
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Not to worry. We have your details if
anything changes. Cheers. Bye-bye.

273
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,160
OK, thanks for your time.

274
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Hiya! In here.

275
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,159
There you go.

276
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Hello, my darlings. We're having fish
fingers again.

277
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,515
We've run out of quail's eggs and
lark's tongues.

278
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,900
Oh, nothing wrong with fish fingers.

279
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:38,370
A fish finger sandwich is one of the
finest inventions knownto man.

280
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,930
Hear-hear.

281
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I thought you said five.
That's what she told me.

282
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,279
Oh, hi, love. Hi. I thought you said five.
- No, I said four.

283
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,530
Party starts at six.

284
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:55,702
Oh, right, four. Well, it's 4:25.
- Marion, don't start.

285
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,035
Tony's just served up, we're still eating.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Tony.

286
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:00,908
Sorry, I did tell Marion four.

287
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:02,590
No, she didn't.
- It's not a problem.

288
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,687
Come on, boys, we need to get going

289
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:06,434
because I want you dressed and
showered by the time everyone arrives.

290
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:08,091
Want me to doggy bag it?

291
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:10,540
No, I'll give them a sandwich or
something when we get home.

292
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:12,055
Thank you so much.
- All right.

293
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,572
I'll see you later.
- Bye.

294
00:23:13,597 --> 00:23:15,855
And don't be late.
Bye, boys, we'll see you later.

295
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,442
Bye, Aunty Marion.
- You got everything?

296
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:18,495
Yes, thank you.

297
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,255
I go on first.

298
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
Hey, come on, then. Off we go.

299
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
jump in the back. Bye! Bye!

300
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,266
Ah!

301
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,519
How does she manage to be such an
annoying bitch?

302
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,520
I do not know.

303
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,560
What's that? What?

304
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Right, that was evil.
It's all going in.

305
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,760
No...

306
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,479
3CX, and that's it.

307
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,480
OK. So try Andersson first.
See if they can help.

308
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,640
OK, thanks, Fran.

309
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Hi. I'm looking for Nathan.

310
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,599
Yep, that's me.

311
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,239
Right. Blimey.

312
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Last time I saw you, you just weed
your pants all over my sofa.

313
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I'm Adam Stuart's mum.
Ah, hi, Mrs Stuart.

314
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,950
Yeah, he said you might pop in.

315
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:41,316
I mean, you were only nine, so... you
know, I've moved on.

316
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:44,720
He said you had a pager that you
wanted me to look at.

317
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,039
And this was released in...? 1989.

318
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,040
And did this have a... what?
I dunno, SIM or...?

319
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,889
This is a pager. SIMs are only in phones,
and only 2G, which wasn't launched till '91.

320
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,146
OK, so how was information stored on it?
It's a basic data chip built into the pager itself.

321
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,759
And these chips held how much data?

322
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,035
Very little. Maybe last 20 messages.

323
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,867
Which was just... Were they just numbers or...?
Oh, no, it's alphanumeric.

324
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,679
So it could receive messages
29 characters long.

325
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,984
OK. So given what I've told you, and
where it's been for the last...

326
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,055
I dunno, however many years...

327
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:50,305
What do you think the chances are that we
could pull any data off it?

328
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,840
What we'd need to do is source a
working version of this model.

329
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:54,375
How do we do that?
- eBay.

330
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,159
Yeah, and then we de-solder the data
chip from this,

331
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,565
solder it into the working version
and see what we get.

332
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,989
But it's possible?

333
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:06,419
It's a microchip made of silicon.
Anything's possible.

334
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Good to see you, mate. Give my best
to Emma. We'll be in touch very soon.

335
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:24,014
Mrs Mahmoud, so sorry to keep you
waiting. Would you like to come in?

336
00:26:24,077 --> 00:26:25,132
Yes.

337
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Hi. Hi.

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,479
Hooray!

All right, here we go. Wish me luck!

344
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Ooh! Come on. Oh, come on, Mum, you
can do better than that.

345
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,919
Come on!

346
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Loads of puff.

347
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Hooray! What?

348
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,400
No, you're right. It would be a big
leap for me, heading up a school.

349
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,440
But I've headed up a Sixth Form for
five years now

350
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,759
and so...

351
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,760
..I'm confident that I could
successfully make the leap.

352
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Sorry, said 'leap' twice.

353
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,360
With the right support, and Iwould
relish the opportunity.

354
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,480
So...

355
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Yeah.

356
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,399
Sorry! Hi, there.

357
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Hi. Ijust...

358
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,120
I wanted to say...

359
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,920
I wanted to say there are gonna be
better qualified candidates than me.

360
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Better managers, more eloquent
speakers, definitely.

361
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,799
But I promise you this...

362
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,167
You will never,

363
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:35,855
never find a candidate who understands the
sorts of kids you have at Highbrook

364
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,106
better than me.

365
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:43,169
A woman who left school at 16, who didn't get
a single qualification till she was 25.

366
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,959
Who knows what it feels like to be written off.

367
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,207
What it does to you inside.

368
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,577
Which is why I've never written any kid off,
no matter how challenging in my entire career.

369
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,895
And why, if I got this job,
I would fight with my dying breath

370
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,966
to make Highbrook the school that
every single kid who comes here deserves.

371
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,599
And I'd be cheaper, too.

372
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Hmm... Thanks for your time.

373
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Have a good evening.

374
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,875
Oh, I blew a few candles out. Get a
life, Elise. Come on!

375
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:27,853
Which I asked you not to do because
she said she wanted to do it herself.

376
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:29,730
I can't believe you're making a fuss
about this!

377
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:32,598
I just wanted her to be
centre of attention for once!

378
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,159
Says the woman who insisted on having
the party here.

379
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,683
We could hardly have got 50 people
into your house, could we?

380
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:39,575
She didn't even want 50 people, Elise.

381
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,695
Please, do not even try and tell me
what Mum wants.

382
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,845
You don't even begin to understand
what she wants.

383
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:47,023
And you do because
you're the golden child.

384
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:49,479
No, I am not the golden child,
Marion.

385
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,480
I just didn't piss off for the best
part of a decade.- Oh, here we go!

386
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,917
So the relationship I have with her,
I have earned.- Anyone want a top-up?

387
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:57,879
No, we're leaving.
- What?

388
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,544
I'm sure it's what we both want
anyway.

389
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,385
What the hell happened?

390
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,314
I'm so sorry, Tony.
- You always get caught in the bloody crossfire.

391
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,736
All right. Well, say sorry to joy
for me. I will.

392
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,700
See ya.

393
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,699
Marion?

394
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Marion! Marion, slow down!

395
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,120
If you defend her... If you say one
bloody word, I swear...

396
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Look, you didn't even say
goodbye to - Oh!

397
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Marion!

398
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,085
Hey, what is going on here? Having
fun at this time of night?

399
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Come on. It's bed. Come on. Let's go
on up.

400
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
I'll take her. Come on.

401
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Good night. Say night night.
Love you. Love you.

402
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,048
Right, Monkey. I'll race you.
Come on. Go, go, go!

403
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,919
What if something goes wrong?
But what if it doesn't?

404
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,920
But what if it does?
But what if it doesn't?

405
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Come on, you scooch down.

406
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,400
You're safe now, Flo. Safe with us.

407
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,239
OK? No-one's ever gonna take you
away.

408
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,240
OK? OK.

409
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Love you, sweetheart. Love you, too.
Good night, Daddy.

410
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,719
See you in the morning.

411
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Night night.

412
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,720
She's asleep. She's down? Mm-hm.
Well done.

413
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Excuse me! Excuse me, sir!

414
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,320
I think that could be
my uncle's signature.

Are you serious? Yes, I spoke to a
Patrick Smith earlier. Shh!

426
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,617
Spoke to a Patrick Smith earlier. He

OK. Sounds good.

How's it going with the pager?

430
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Yeah, we found a second-hand one
on eBay, so...

431
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,399
We'll know one way or the other
tomorrow.

432
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,400
OK. Well, progress. Yep. I'll see

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Yeah.

Girls!

435
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Evening. Oh, hi, love. How'd it go?

436
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,479
God, no idea.

437
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,279
There's at least ten people going for
it, though.

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,199
Yeah? Yeah.

439
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,479
And the actual interview was a bit
of a disaster.

440

Sorry, no offence, Mum, but jesse
might be about to kill Gale. No!

441
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
No way would jesse kill Gale.
Not a chance.

Bye, sweetheart. Bye, Daddy,
I love you. Love you, too.

Colin?

445
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,319
Hi. How you doing?

446
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks. How are you?
You don't remember my name, do you?

447
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Erm... No worries. I'm Tyler.

448
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Tyler? Well, of course. You're
Milly's dad, is that right?

449
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,359
No, no, no. I'm not a parent here.

450
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,359
Well, not technically anyway.
I'm a stepfather.

451
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,839
All right. Who to?

452
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Flo. I'm her birth mum's partner.

453
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,319
What? What the hell? It's OK.
Look, Ijust wanna talk.

454
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,124
About what? You shouldn't be making
contact with me. Colin, it's... No, no, no.

455
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,076
How the hell did you find out where...?
It doesn't matter, I can't talk.

456
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,951
Of course you can.

457
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,204
I saw you yesterday,
in the supermarket.

458
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:11,503
Have you followed us?

459
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:14,855
I can guess what he said to you, that bloke,
so I don't blame you for what you did.

460
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,278
It would've made me pretty angry, too.

461
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,839
But I guess others might not be so
sympathetic.

462
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,840
What, with you being a lawyer
and everything.

463
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,840
What do you want?
Like I said, just to talk.

464
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,240
With the greatest respect, 25 years
of this mob is enough for anyone.

465
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Well, I hope that it goes without
saying that you'll be very sorely missed.

466
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
No, in all seriousness, I've loved
every single minute of it.

467
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,839
Well, you were always a natural,
Tess.

468
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,840
I suspect it's gonna be early next
year. Probably April.

469
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,639
just let me know as soon as you
decide.

470
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,640
We'll start organising a party.
Absolutely.

471
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,520
What are we going to do without you,
Tess? Ah!

472
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,480
All right, T.

473
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,079
The wonders of eBay. Hmm.

474
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,919
So, pleased be prepared for this not
to work at all.

475
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,043
The data chip could be damaged as I remove it.
It could be damaged as I put it in the new pager.

476
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:22,037
It's OK. I get it.

477
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,080
I'll call you.
- Or I can wait.

478
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,458
I'll call you.
- OK.

479
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,080
I don't wanna be here. You know,
I have pride like you.

480
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,239
And I love Flo.
You know, we both did.

481
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,839
Do.

482
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,439
But if you knew the childhood
Sal had had...

483
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,319
Cos she was never taught how you do
it, you see - be a good mum.

484
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,320
How much do you want? She's been
clean for three months now, Col.

485
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,799
Colin. Which is the longest time
ever.

486
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:59,425
Which makes it even harder knowing
Flo's in the same city just a few miles away,

487
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,846
being brought up by someone else.

488
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,999
And she absolutely knows
it's the best for Flo.

489
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:07,016
How much?

490
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,836
£5,000.

491
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,875
just to move. Money for a van and a
deposit on a flat.

492
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,275
We've seen a place in Hastings.

493
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,179
We're not bad people, Colin. We just
want the same as you - the best for Flo.

494
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,959
I need to think.

495
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Give me your number, I'll call you.

496
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,679
Yeah, but just remember, Zoe, as hard as this is for
you, I actually sometimes think it's harder for them.

497
00:38:25,463 --> 00:38:28,935
I can't imagine anything worse than
being a parent and seeing your child in pain,

498
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,009
and not being able to do anything about it.

499
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:34,619
So maybe you just need to
cut them a little slack sometimes.

500
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:38,368
You know, cos they're under immense
pressure, too, aren't they?

501
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:40,588
Yeah.

502
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,588
OK. Listen, I've gotta go but I'll
see you on the ward on Friday, OK?

503
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,359
Bye. All right, bye, love.

504
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,039
Hiya! Who was that?

505
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,959
Oh, it was Zoe, the girl with
Non-Hodgkin's.

506
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Oh, right. She's got your personal
number?

507
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,479
How was your morning?

508
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:01,105
Yeah, great. I got the sash windows

509
00:39:01,144 --> 00:39:03,277
Great. Listen, I gotta shift cos
I'm on at two.

510
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Marion?
- Yeah?

511
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Er... do you wanna talk about last
night?

512
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,719
I'm really late, love.

513
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,720
See ya.

514
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,799
Here we go.

515
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Three months either side of
when the repairs were done.

516
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Ah, brilliant. Thank you. Good luck.

517
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,455
So, I got Patrick Smith to dig out the business
account statements for three months either side

518
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,639
of the dates the repairs were done.

519
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,944
I thought that if I could find payments that
were made on or around the repair dates

520
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
that were made by the same person...
Chances are that could be our man.

521
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,239
So I did.

522
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,240
First one's here...

523
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Was made on 21st of june, 1989 -

524
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,079
a week or so after the first repair.

525
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Credit card payment made by
Mr D Walker.

526
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,640
And the second one... made on
February the 14th, 1990 -

527
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,960
about ten days after the repair.

528
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Payment made by Mr D Walker. Genius.

529
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Then I checked Missing Persons...

530
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,680
And... here he is...

531
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,240
Mr D Walker.

532
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,120
'David Ewan Walker.

533
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,199
39 years old.

534
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Last seen on the 8th of May, 1990.

535
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,680
5'9" tall, blue eyes, brown hair.

536
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Last seen in the Cricketers Public
House, Cannon Street, London.

537
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,815
If you have any information on David's whereabouts,
please call Winston Hill Police Station

538
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,840
and help reunite David with his
wife...

539
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,360
..and five-year-old son...

540
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,520
..who desperately wants his daddy to
come home.'

541
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,319
Hello. Hello. We're looking for
Tessa Walker.

542
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,320
I'm DCI Cassie Stuart.
This is DI Sunil Khan.

543
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,759
I'm Tessa Nixon. I haven't been
Walker for eight years.

544
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Right. Can we come in, Mrs Nixon?

545
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Why? Can we?

546
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Is this...?

547
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,999
Is this David?

548
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Yes, we think so.

549
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Where did you find him? His remains
were found in a river.

550
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,440
In a river? The Lea.

551
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,479
So, when do you think he died?

552
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Probably not long after he went
missing.

553
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,240
How on earth does a body survive
26 years in a river?

554
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,640
I'm a copper myself. I've seen what
water does to a body.

555
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,880
How... how do you even start to
identify remains from that long ago?

556
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,600
His remains were found in a
suitcase.

557
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,960
I assumed... that it was suicide.
Wasn't it?

558
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,360
We've found pretty good evidence to
suggest that David was murdered.

559
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,800
0h!

560
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,440
I'm so sorry.

561
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
That was your husband, Mrs Nixon.
He's on his way now.

562
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,720
So, what are the next steps? Well,
we'll need a DNA swab from your son,

563
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,679
if that's OK to confirm
that it is David.

564
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,680
And obviously we'll be accessing the
original files into his disappearance.

565
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,080
But in light of these new
developments,

566
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,199
when would it be convenient for us
to talk further with you?

567
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,200
We could do it here.
Or at our station.

568
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,480
What about tomorrow, after lunch
maybe? Yeah. Fine.

569
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Thank you.

570
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Once again... I am so sorry
for your loss.

571
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,920
63% of all murder victims are killed
by their partners.

572
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,639
You'll be thinking that, won't you?

573
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,519
I would be.

574
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,520
We'll see you tomorrow, Tessa. Yeah.

575
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,520
Well, she looked how you'd expect,
didn't she?

576
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Shocked. Upset.

577
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,400
But... But she'd know how to fake it
better than most.

578
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,199
Oh! Nathan.

579
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,119
We have some code. It's binary.

580
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,120
Right. And that's good?
I need to do some work on it.

581
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,040
But right now, we have a date -
15th of February, 1990.

582
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,720
And we have words, with lots more to
come, I reckon.

583
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,080
Thank you, Nathan. Night.

584
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,760
And so it begins.
